1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Whoa, okay, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna get the equipment working this time.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,660
It's gonna work fine.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,580
Okay.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,420
Easy.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,780
I'm, uh...

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,140
Right!

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,560
Yeah!

8
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,580
Yeah!

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,200
Hey!

10
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,840
What's happening?

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,280
Most people are gonna think they've got the plain old non-lethal flu right up to the very end.

12
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,520
And that's the biggest break we've had so far.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,560
Who cares?

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,720
Bob.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:37,840
What?

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,100
Bob, save some for me.

17
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,080
Don't worry.

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:43,980
Pathetic.

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,480
You don't feel so cocky now, do you, Bob?

20
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,020
Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it right now.

21
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,360
You know what the tragedy is here, Bob?

22
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,200
We could have been friends.

23
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,500
But you weren't.

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,760
We wouldn't go through public channels.

25
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,240
My dog barks some.

26
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,540
Mentally, you picture my dog.

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,380
But I have not told you the title.

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,440
Dog which I have.

29
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,700
Perhaps you might even picture Toto from The Wizard of Oz.

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:52,640
But I can tell you my dog is always with me.

31
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,480
I can tell you my dog is always with me.

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,580
I can tell you how simple life is for married men.

33
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,520
I tell you my boy is that much superior than you.

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:15,560
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:15,560


36
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:15,560


37
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:15,560


38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:15,560


39
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:15,560


40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,260
You mean you said got that guy below ten years of age who can't be heard from a woman.

41
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,260


42
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,260


43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,560
So you guys find yourself a little while longer off to dinner and pint, buy a truck and a давай the police car.

44
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,160
Alright, happy party.

45
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,160


46
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,400
We'll see you again, Next Good Day.

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,140
Aw.

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,960
See ya.

80
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,020
towards that thing called life

81
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,140
certainly can change over the years, you know.

82
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,200
As a kid, little kid,

83
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,940
you have no philosophy, really,

84
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,520
except that you are God and deserve all slack.

85
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,700
You had the right idea back then.

86
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,060
But then as a teenager,

87
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,180
you start to get the idea,

88
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,100
a fairly practical idea,

89
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,360
that you aren't going to get all that slack,

90
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,680
and you start to turn hate positive.

91
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,220
Yet you still suffer from the sad delusion

92
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,580
that future generations might get the slack,

93
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,180
if only everybody else would wise up like you have.

94
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,460
And then in your twenties,

95
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,380
if you're anything like me,

96
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,940
well, you're on the job,

97
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,760
but there's a certain determined idealism on the job,

98
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,100
and,

99
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,860
and as you get better in the job,

100
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,280
it turns into almost very slightly triumphant idealism.

101
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,400
But then that quickly turns to, uh,

102
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,720
totally limited idealism

103
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,000
because of the very reality of the jobs,

104
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,220
which you increasingly learn

105
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,000
until you finally hit a dead end,

106
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,700
which is where a lot of people end up.

107
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,160
If you're lucky, through your thirties,

108
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,140
you'll, like,

109
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,520
like I did,

110
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,440
build to an orgy,

111
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,160
an orgy of utter cynicism.

112
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,540
But, you know, that's a dead end to,

113
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,660
I'm afraid,

114
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,040
I mean, I wish I didn't have to,

115
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,920
uh, tell you that.

116
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,780
But you get into your,

117
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,140
your forties,

118
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,860
and you get kind of resigned to,

119
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,820
well, you, you,

120
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,080
you end up with the philosophy that,

121
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,080
although it's pretty bad,

122
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,000
you can,

123
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,260
you can at least try to make the best of it.

124
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,700
Now, I'm in my early forties,

125
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,180
and I have to assume, because of that,

126
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,520
that there's a next stage

127
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,260
that I just don't know about,

128
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,340
and which I cannot be explained to me,

129
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,180
even by my older, uh,

130
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,280
slightly older friends,

131
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,840
like, uh, G. Gordon Gordon,

132
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,460
or, uh, Dr. Snavely Eklund.

133
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,980
Uh, I would hope

134
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,660
that it would be a more inspired,

135
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,860
uh, make the best of it sort of philosophy.

136
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,200
But how can I know that,

137
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,420
since it's not perceivable to me

138
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,460
at this present step?

139
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,240
And in that respect,

140
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,280
I must admit that I am indeed an ageist,

141
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,120
my friends.

142
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,780
Not that I think that age brings wisdom,

143
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,080
but it does bring a certain resignedness

144
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,080
that can lead either to clearer thinking,

145
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,080
more rational and scientific,

146
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,240
as it has with me,

147
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,980
or it can lead to stultified fossilization

148
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,740
of the brain pan and swift,

149
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,180
uh, degeneration into senility,

150
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,100
which I think is what usually happens

151
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,080
in most cases, uh, to most human beings.

152
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,440
But then in most cases,

153
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,620
the average human being never had much real awareness

154
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,120
to work from in the first place,

155
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,420
so it's a, a moot point.

156
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,340
Now, I'll, I'll be the first to admit

157
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,600
that I'm, uh, an elitist, yes,

158
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,540
uh, one who thinks that most people are dumber than me,

159
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,700
but the most hideous aspect

160
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,240
of that, my friends, is

161
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,360
I know I'm not very smart at all.

162
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,740
Think how dumb that makes them look.

163
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,280
And most of the time,

164
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,680
I can't even comprehend how dumb and lazy people can be,

165
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,920
and so they continue to surprise me because of that.

166
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,280
I can't imagine how dumb they could be,

167
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,940
and yet, oh, oh,

168
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,300
every day they come up with something new.

169
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,380
And again, it's, it's, uh,

170
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,360
not because I'm so smart.

171
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,220
Oh, no, no, horribly, most horribly of all,

172
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,840
it's because they're even more lazy and stupid than I.

173
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,840
And, my friend, that's saying a lot.

174
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,920
That's saying a hell of a lot.

175
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,180
A lot of bad stuff about my fellow bipeds.

176
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,480
What it says?

177
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,620
Oh, it's a shame, dear friends.

178
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,820
It's a, it's a crying, crying shame.

179
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,400
Don't you ever wonder why

180
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,800
Nothing ever seems to change

181
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,060
If it does, it's for the worse

182
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,160
Seems it's just a modern curse

183
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,460
Sometimes when I take a peek

184
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,740
Outside of my little cage

185
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,880
Everyone looks so asleep

186
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,360
Will they die before they wake?

187
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,560
And, hey, don't you know

188
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,880
We're just products of our time

189
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,040
And, hey, what do you say?

190
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,380
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

191
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Better dumb and happy than

192
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,480
Smart and without any friends

193
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,700
Better cute and better loud

194
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,940
Better join up with the crowd

195
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,220
Keep a fork and let me hide

196
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,540
There's a dust storm in the air

197
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,640
In my mind

198
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,720
Seems I can't see straight these days

199
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,480
Doesn't matter anyway

200
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,220
And, hey, don't you know

201
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,500
We're just products of our time

202
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,720
And, hey, what do you say?

203
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,020
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

204
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,860
Hey, what do you say?

205
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,040
Hey, what do you say?

206
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,820
Please don't ever

207
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,640
Oh, God, here's that question now

208
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,740
The one that makes me go insane

209
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,580
I'd gladly tear my heart out

210
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,320
If you never, never, never, never change

211
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,640
Do you want to change?

212
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,480
Do you want to change?

213
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,320
Do you want to change right now?

214
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,800
Do you want to change?

215
00:17:52,800 --> 00:18:00,200
Do you want to change right now?

216
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,420
I don't know

217
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,980
I don't know

218
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,680
I don't know

219
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,700
I don't know

220
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,480
I don't know

221
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,400
Do you want to change?

222
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:13,400


223
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:13,400


224
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:13,680
Oh, yeah

225
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,000
Hey, dear friends

226
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,180
Oink-oh-boink-oh

227
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,760
Yodeling away there in the background

228
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,440
And, you know, some people don't ever want to change

229
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,100
Bob Dobbs gets a lot of mail which we intercept

230
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:35,860
and we very recently got a mailing about how the Conservative talk show host is in danger

231
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,140
So we should send them more money

232
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,360
Dear friends, let's see, here's this letter here.

233
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,600
It says, they're meeting into the night, late into the night, to silence us.

234
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:54,940
Don't let Congress silence Rush Limbaugh, Pat Buchanan, Gordon Liddy, and other conservatives.

235
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:03,200
The so-called fairness doctrine will silence Rush Limbaugh, Pat Buchanan, Gordon Liddy, Marlon Maddox, and other conservatives.

236
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,360
They repeat that line about four times in the same two-page letter.

237
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:20,320
Yes, friends, it seems that liberals in Congress are hardly hiding the purpose of their so-called fairness doctrine bill.

238
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,860
This bill would muzzle Rush Limbaugh, Gordon Liddy, Pat Buchanan, and conservative radio talk shows across the country.

239
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:33,540
Bill Clinton and the liberals in Congress can't compete with Rush Limbaugh, Gordon Liddy, Pat Buchanan on the radio.

240
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,560
They know it. That's why the so-called fairness doctrine covers only radio.

241
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:43,780
If the liberals were really concerned about fairness, their bill would also cover...

242
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:54,480
Oh, here, let's, uh, that's a lovely boingo song, but I want to put on something else here because we want to play a rest of that boingo song.

243
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,000
He was talking over that.

244
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,240
Anyway, to continue with this letter here, as Dr. Bob plays in the background,

245
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,540
uh, if the liberals were really concerned about fairness,

246
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,420
they would also cover TV and newspapers.

247
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:19,920
But liberals dominated TV, and most major newspapers are clearly controlled by liberals.

248
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:30,340
And, uh, it says here, uh, yeah, the liberals can't stand the heat, so their plan is to force conservative talk show hosts off the air.

249
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,620
Uh, if you can send $1,000 or $500, it would be greatly appreciated.

250
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,540
Our campaign is cost-free.

251
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,520
We're wasting a lot of money.

252
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,600
We need to reach at least 5 million grassroots voters over the next couple of months.

253
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:54,320
This is the only way to stop Clinton and his liberal buddies in Congress from muzzling our conservative radio show hosts,

254
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,640
Rush Limbaugh, Pat Buchanan, Gordon, Lady Markman, and the other members.

255
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,180
Whoa!

256
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,420
And there's a lot of these conservative money-making machines out there.

257
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,540
Uh, or far right.

258
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,540
Money-making machines, uh, rather.

259
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:15,000
They call far right conservative and middle-of-the-road liberal.

260
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:24,680
Uh, anyway, all these folks are begging and getting donations from paranoids in order to fight the threat,

261
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:33,460
the terrible threat to conservative talk show hosts from that, uh, demonic liberal-controlled media.

262
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,640
And I hear about this threat.

263
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,460
All day long.

264
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,960
Morning, noon, and night on far right talk shows and, and newspapers.

265
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:55,180
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Rush Limbaugh, Gordon, Lydia, Gordon, Tony, etc., etc., plus all the local ones, you know, in your local town there, friends.

266
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:04,840
And you don't come to think of it, I haven't heard any liberal biased talk show hosts on any of the liberal biased conspiracy media.

267
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,260
Uh.

268
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,620
Uh.

269
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:17,800
Now, I understand, uh, that Jim Hightower has such a show, but like this show, uh, no station here in, uh, mighty Dallas, Texas is inclined to run such a thing.

270
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,040
You know, it might upset the fundamentalists and run the creationist science school board or something.

271
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:32,720
Hey, you might say, oh, come on, Reverend Stang, look at these bleeding-heart-drippy shows like, uh, Nightline and McNeil-Larer.

272
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,600
And I'd have, I'd have to say I'm sorry.

273
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:36,600


274
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:36,600


275
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:36,600


276
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,300
I'm afraid I've looked a mile closer than you have, my friend.

277
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:50,940
Uh, for all that PBSNPR crap is funded by the government, and the most frequent single guest on those shows is Henry Kissinger.

278
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,180
And 75% of their guests are government or government-associated spokesmen.

279
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:04,720
You know, there ain't nothing to the left of Al Gore that even exists on the national media.

280
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,180
Now, man, you know, how often?

281
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,540
How often do you hear about libertarians or greens on pink media?

282
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,820
Only on comedy shows.

283
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,780
Yeah.

284
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,160
Oh, yeah.

285
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,380
Liberal biased media.

286
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,200
Hmph.

287
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:24,860
Yeah, well, yeah, sure, if you call Westinghouse stockholders, uh, liberals.

288
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,940
If you call, uh, Reaganites liberals.

289
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,320
If you call, uh, Whitewater Silverado.

290
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,180
If you call, uh, cheating on your wife.

291
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,160
Uh, conducting secret meetings.

292
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,020
If you call, uh, wars and massive drug smuggling operations.

293
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,960
I'll tell you, dear friends, in hell, commies aren't scary enough anymore.

294
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:57,300
Now there's an anti-family, pro-abortion, eco-nut, Jew, hippie, queer, negro, Arab, liberal under every bed.

295
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:05,360
Oh, thank God the far right doesn't even know the subgeniuses exist, or they'd have had us secretly killed by now.

296
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,240
Uh, for that matter, if the so-called liberals knew about the church, they'd have us killed, too.

297
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:16,880
As well they should, seeing as how we are the only true enemies of both.

298
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:34,720
I'm telling you, friend, we're in bad trouble and we'll continue to be robbed of slack as long as, as any, uh, politicians, uh, voters, or for that matter, any politics at all, remain on this benighted planet.

299
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,680
The humans are just too stupid. Just too easily self-corrupted.

300
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:50,660
The only government of any kind should be only the dictatorship of J.R. Bob Don Salone.

301
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:57,760
For only he cannot be any more corrupt than he already is.

302
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,900
I hope this works.

303
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,020
How do we...?

304
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,340
Go.

305
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,380
I never had the keys to put them to use.

306
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:32,580
The name of the patron saint, the father, the son, do not believe in it. I command you back.

307
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,400
Go!

308
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:33,780
Go!

309
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,580
The knights will assume you.

310
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,080
United to the devil.

311
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,700
Return, your master.

312
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,820
Leave us.

313
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,180
Gaze.

314
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,160
Gaze on the fiery cross and return to the darkness of your cold tombs.

315
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,200
Away.

316
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,940
Away with you.

317
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,040
Back.

318
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,400
Back to the darkness.

319
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,460
Back to the dimension of the damned.

320
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,240
I command you back.

321
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,020
In the name of the trinity, to hell, from once you came.

322
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,420
Leave me.

323
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,560
They would know how we solved our problems.

324
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,360
They would know how we solved them.

325
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,680
And whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years.

326
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,300
Or whether it hurt them.

327
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,060
They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons.

328
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,040
Nuclear weapons.

329
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,280
Terrible destructive power.

330
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,960
Aimed at each other.

331
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,840
Capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes.

332
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,820
And destroying civilization as we knew it.

333
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,520
In the name of the trinity.

334
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:00,520


335
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:00,520


336
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:00,840
If youÕve changed, you would want us to agree to it, until that alas this below and

337
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:00,840


338
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,020
Stick up there, and be more careful about what you say.

339
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,020


340
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,020


341
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,020


342
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,020


343
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,020


344
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,020


345
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,000
If you kill me you have to mush out half of my life here.

346
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,000

365
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:04,540
inadvertent uh slow pokes and unbusiness like slack heads that we actually are

369
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,700
Explanations for whatever happened to the mighty Stark Fist on, uh, Side 2 of Eve's show.

370
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,960
Because we like you, new friends.

371
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,320
And we want you to hear it all, you know, every tiny bit of it.

372
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,260
I like my stupid life just the way it is.

373
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,020
And I wouldn't even change it for a thousand flying pigs.

374
00:29:54,020 --> 00:30:06,440
And I like you just the way you are.

375
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,920
I like your face just the way it is.

376
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,860
And I wouldn't even trade it for a heart.

377
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,640
I'm bored of screaming kids.

378
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:38,060
And I like you just the way you are.

379
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,040
I like you.

380
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,200
I know you may not like me back.

381
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,640
I would.

382
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:59,820
I'd dazzle you with brilliance if I only had the neck.

383
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:12,220
Because I like you just the way you are.

384
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,500
I like you.

385
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,560
I like you.

386
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,560


387
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,560


388
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,560


389
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,560


390
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,560


391
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,560


392
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,560


393
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,560


394
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:33,560


395
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,880
Yes, we're back here, friends.

396
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:42,080
And with some more explanations, perhaps, that you so desperately need to know.

397
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:51,580
You know, some geniuses can come to know the Church in many different ways.

398
00:31:51,580 --> 00:32:01,120
Some have only seen our video arise and think that the church books that that video shows are all fictitious props.

399
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:09,640
Some have only read the book of the subgenius and the other books but don't know about the radio shows.

400
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:18,680
Some can't read at all and are just utter skinflints and so just tune in to this show.

401
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:28,640
All of course are exhorted to join up and become ordained and subscribe to the Stark Fist church newsletter.

402
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:37,600
And every one of those is wondering just why they haven't seen a new one in two years.

403
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,780
Well it's two problems friends.

404
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,820
Time and money.

405
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,440
Time because it took a year.

406
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,760
Longer than we thought to finish our new huge 210 page bible.

407
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:01,480
Revelation X the Bob Apocryphon for Simon and Schuster out in October.

408
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,260
The greatest story ever told.

409
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:13,880
However just the runoff from that effort provides us with literally enough material to fill 20 Stark Fist magazines.

410
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,600
So where are those magazines?

411
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,900
Well friends and here's the problem.

412
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:29,080
We don't have a thin thin dime to print anything with.

413
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:36,560
There's only about 4,000 subgenii in the whole world who subscribe to that thing.

414
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:44,560
Only 4,000 who will ride the escape vessels of the sex goddesses come X day 1998.

415
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,080
And uh.

416
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,660
Yeah well let me put it this way.

417
00:33:48,660 --> 00:34:00,000
Friends that last Stark Fist was a 130 page deluxe book size monster that put us $7,000 in debt.

418
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:06,100
The plan was you know people would see all the new sacred goods.

419
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:13,640
The Bob t-shirts and boxer shorts and sacred coffee mugs and the videos and hour of slack tapes.

420
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,580
And actually order some of that.

421
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,340
And that would.

422
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,300
Pay for the next Stark Fist.

423
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:29,440
Well I'm afraid we were just a tad optimistic on that score friend.

424
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,440
And plus the fact that we've never had the capital to advertise.

425
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:45,460
It's a humiliating situation for what's supposed to be a juggernaut of raw capitalism.

426
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,640
Unleashed by the very gods.

427
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,960
And the very god of sales himself.

428
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:56,680
But I guess Bob's busy with other things.

429
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,340
With his mysterious ways friends.

430
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,560
And we're stuck with trying to fill his shoes.

431
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,420
And we fall short my friend.

432
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,360
We fall short because we're not Bob.

433
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,020
We're great subgeniuses yes.

434
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:18,500
But the church has no smarty pants business mind.

435
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:18,640
We're not Bob.

436
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:18,640


437
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:18,640


438
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,640
We're in a business case.

439
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,120
We have to surrender.

440
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,320
This Poet ess theme's not amused by any chance either.

441
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,160
It will.

442
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,480
But over time we'll figure out.

443
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,180
emmm...

444
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,620
Yeah.

445
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,720
I'm pushing you out, Bob.

446
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,460
And besides, we're not talking about human beings here.

447
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,620
It's never been proven their intelligence is in any way...

448
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,220
Oh, come on, Bob.

449
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:20,000
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.

450
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,920
Joseph, Joseph, your amazing Technicolor cards are in the barn.

451
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,480
I will take care of the Technicolor cards.

452
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,200
You passed out with a lyrical nightmare, G.

453
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,780
The cigarette pipe.

454
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,100
I keep.

455
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,220
I keep the bitches' cards.

456
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,500
That is the black light, funky pono.

457
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,340
You get busted up.

458
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,060
Bad.

459
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:44,440
Ha ha.

460
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,360
Ha ha.

461
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:45,800
Ba.

462
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,560
Ba.

463
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:55,440
My brother, your mother makes the best Kentucky fry chicken I ever done tasted.

464
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,620
Yo.

465
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,540
But it is not my little brother.

466
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,440
Hey, homie.

467
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,420
You messing my old lady?

468
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,440
What?

469
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,660
You have got to be running cold upside the head.

470
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,200
Hey, homo.

471
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,300
It's fine candy.

472
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,000
You fool.

473
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,660
Child.

474
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,260
Not like homos sapiens say.

475
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,280
Oh.

476
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,140
Mr. Gobbolina.

477
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,280
Mr. Bobgobbolina.

478
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Mr. Gobbolina.

479
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Mr. Bobgobbolina.

480
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,400
My own young town.

481
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,260
Mr. Gobbolina.

482
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,120
Mr. Bobgobbolina.

483
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,880
Slambunking and highfiving.

484
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,860
Better watch out.

485
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,520
That is correct, my fellow gnomos.

486
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,180
Shoot you.

487
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,020
Shoot you.

488
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,200
Shoot you.

489
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,080
You in the head.

490
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,500
Shoot you.

491
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,620
Shoot you in the head and make you dead.

492
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,020
Shoot you in the head and make you dead.

493
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,500
Shoot you in the head and don' make you dead.

494
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:53,580


495
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,700
That is correct, my fellow gnomos.

496
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,340
I will not be happy.

497
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,180
You be very sad.

498
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,680
That is correct, my fellow gnomos.

499
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,140


500
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,780
Peace out from Halfway Gangsterz Crew.

501
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,100
Shaker shut up and blow your instead of Louie right up there.

502
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,100
Weird videos science is which do you mean.

503
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,000
Well, that's where we've been as baroms again.

504
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,140
What do you think?

505
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,140


506
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,180
Now, look.

507
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,180


508
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,180


509
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,180


510
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,180


511
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,380
I feel that someone worships me

512
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,280
I am the abyss

513
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,260
I die harder than Bruce Willis

514
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,960
Step to me, Bob, and you are going to get shot

515
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,760
And why is that?

516
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,440
You think I'll get shot?

517
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,100
Where? Where? Where?

518
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,180
In the lab! In the lab!

519
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:35,940
In the lab!

520
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,400
Mr. Popolina

521
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,920
Mr. Popolina

522
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,880
You'll be very sad

523
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,960
So sad

524
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,440
When I kick your ass

525
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,480
You don't want to feel bad

526
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,720
You don't want to feel bad

527
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,800
You don't want to feel bad

528
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,840
You don't want to feel bad

529
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,880
Come

530
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,160
Come

531
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,260
Come

532
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,160
Come

533
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,720
Come

534
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,280
Come

535
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,600
We don't want to feel bad

536
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,480
Oh

537
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,800
Feel bad

538
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,220
Not enough money

539
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,020
For more subgenius

540
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,120
Must look in new book

541
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,640
And read from

542
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,100
Subgenius Affirmation

543
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,060
Yes

544
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,200
Dear friends

545
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,600
We can fill

546
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,680
What?

547
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,460
The lab

548
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,240
Yeah

549
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,180
Yes

550
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:56,080
We'll just relax and lean back and recite to ourselves the subgenius affirmation by

551
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:04,360
J.N.R. Hypercleves as it appears in the forthcoming subgenius Bible, Revelation X.

552
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:16,400
In the course of exploiting my abnormality potential, I will let no one stifle my inner

553
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:23,340
spoiled child. If my deep sensitivity must be expressed in a way that causes injury to others

554
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:32,800
with, for instance, chainsaws and blowtorches, the delicate genius of my artistic soul must be

555
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,340
protected at all costs.

556
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:44,960
So that I might achieve my greatest masterpieces, even if the price be the maiming of a few inconsequentials,

557
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:55,580
I demand others to aid the healing process of my delicate psyche and help build my self-esteem

558
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,260
and nurture my free expression.

559
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:03,780
A 40-hour work week would be too stressful for one.

560
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,340
So I will let no one stifle my inner spoiled child.

561
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:12,920
If my deep sensitivity must be expressed in a way that causes injury to others with, for instance,

562
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,280
chainsaws and blowtorches, the delicate genius of my artistic soul must be protected at all costs.

563
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:14,280


564
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:14,280


565
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:22,620
If my productivity lies in producing apathy, lethargy, and billowing clouds of marijuana smoke,

566
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,580
then I must follow my slack.

567
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:34,060
If everything I want is not handed to me on a silver platter, I'm in danger of hurting myself.

568
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,080
If I'm not able to do anything, I'm in danger of being a victim of my own self or others.

569
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:47,060
If to exploit, injure, or rob others would help me grow, under no circumstances should they deny me my needs,

570
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,000
as this too could damage my yeti self.

571
00:41:51,960 --> 00:42:01,180
When crude, insensitive people try to inhibit my free expression, it only fills me with a greater sense of self-loathing,

572
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:07,240
justifying any further actions I might take.

573
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,460
Countless long nights while I stare at the wall, I ask myself over again,

574
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:26,380
How did I end up in this little hell? How did it ever begin?

575
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:33,920
How did I ever begin?

576
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:45,420
Oh, oh, oh, oh, helpless, helpless to turn back the clock that ticks on with its cruel shining face.

577
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,300
It laughs while it watches my every disgrace.

578
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:55,600
I was born a sap all the nurses laughed when they saw me the first time.

579
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:01,300
They giggled and said, this poor little monster be better off dead.

580
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:10,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, helpless, helplessly trapped in a body,

581
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:17,860
I'm sure should have never been mine, I'll let that my real one's doing just fine.

582
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,780
And I don't belong here, I don't belong here, I should be quite rich,

583
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,580
with a big shiny car.

584
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,140
A house and twelve rooms, I deserve to go far.

585
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:38,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, helpless, helplessly falling in love,

586
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,020
but does love really last through the night?

587
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:50,480
To love and to honor, to kick and to bite, and I don't belong here, I don't belong here.

588
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,820
And it's all a mistake.

589
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,100
I was destined for greatness.

590
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,360
A leader.

591
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,380
A prophet.

592
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,520
But I'm just too blind to notice.

593
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,680
Where did this whole silly story begin?

594
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,180
It seems that my mind is gone.

595
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,460
Blank.

596
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,960
I think that I've messed up a chapter or two.

597
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,640
Perhaps it is best if I break.

598
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:41,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, helpless. Helplessly lost like that poor chap who came for an innocent dance. He left with his brain smeared all over his pants.

599
00:44:41,140 --> 00:45:07,160
Because he didn't belong here. He didn't belong here. He never should have left that warm cage in a zoo. His face was so ugly. What else could I do? Can you really blame me? I had to smash it. He left me no choice. He was just like the others. I just had to kill him like my poor dear old mother.

600
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:36,500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, helpless. Helplessly lost by a legion of 40 ex-cons. That's what it feels like when you walk all over me. Don't belong here, I don't belong here. Your eyes burn right through me. They fill me with fear. I could have been home watching football and drinking beer.

601
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, helpless. Helplessly lost like that poor chap who came for an innocent dance. He left with his brain smeared all over his pants. He never should have left that warm cage in a zoo. He never should have left that warm cage in a zoo. He never should have left that warm cage in a zoo.

602
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,680
Helpless. So helpless.

603
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:41,040
Helpless fans being miserly wretches unwilling to part with even a thin, thin, thin dime for their own short-duration personal saver J.R. Bob Dobbs. And mail order fraud laws being what they are. Why, why I, as a sacred scribe of the subgenius foundation, have found myself actually having to start looking for a job.

604
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:41,540
Why, why I, as a sacred scribe of the subgenius foundation, have found myself actually having to start looking for a job.

605
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:51,940
Yep, looking for a job, friends, just in order to print this damn newsletter devoted to the hate of jobs and the love of Dobbs.

606
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,240
Who dealt this mess, man? Who dealt it?

607
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:04,580
But do you see why a laid-back subgenius minister is able to hate?

608
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,700
To hate the conspiracy with such a pure and refined hate?

609
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,120
To hate the conspiracy with such a pure and refined hate?

610
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,860
A veritable Jane-Orient hate. A hate squared.

611
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,960
But that's how serious it is.

612
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,640
I know it would be laughable were it not so sad.

613
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:29,820
The very idea of Reverend Ivan Stang, almost the next guy under Dobbs himself in this church, actually working.

614
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,600
But it's not as ridiculous as you might think.

615
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,500
It's happening to other subgenius ministers even as I speak.

616
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,820
It happened to no less a bucksotic.

617
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,220
It's a far more ridiculous thing to do than to be a beacon of slack than the Reverend Susie the Floozy,

618
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:51,120
former skin-shedding stripper for Bob and uber-dominatrix of the Slack Matrix.

619
00:47:51,320 --> 00:48:00,220
And, like me, she used her subgenius soapbox on the public airwaves of the mighty WREK in Atlanta, Georgia,

620
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:09,400
to complain, bitch and gripe bitterly about the hideous unfairness of any subgenius ever having to do anything.

621
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,120
It doesn't work.

622
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:11,120


623
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,640
It doesn't work.

624
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,840
Ooh, boy, that was from the Leonard Nimoy album.

625
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:24,260
Is it, uh, the one where he is Spock on the cover before he got into intense Spock denial?

626
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,160
Let's see if I can get something going here.

627
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,920
I'm real miscued.

628
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:36,860
Oh, I've had a busy, busy weekend and no sleep and God, work.

629
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,660
Huh.

630
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:39,160
Huh.

631
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:40,420
Huh.

632
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:40,880


633
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,960
when you're spying on the spymasters.

634
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,560
They told me I'd have to take a drug test for this job,

635
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,900
so I stayed up the night before and phoned up really hard.

636
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,140
I felt confident I could identify anything they'd give me.

637
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,300
I could handle anything they'd slip me.

638
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,220
I'd even ace those essay questions.

639
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,120
Oh, but when the first day of the end of my slack life

640
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,540
came screeching up, they didn't even give me the test.

641
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,280
On my first day infiltrating the rabbit worns of corporate existence,

642
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,140
they showed me around my part of the habit trail.

643
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,700
The highlight of the orientation tour was the break room

644
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,760
where the supervisors did this Carol Merrill number

645
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,480
showing me this bank of four coffee makers.

646
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:37,020
Oh, it was just an arsenal of caffeine.

647
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,240
She grinned as she said,

648
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,100
Oh, you can have as much coffee?

649
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,480
We always have coffee here.

650
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,980
Lots and lots and lots of coffee.

651
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,320
Oh, I guess their definition of drugs is a little different from mine

652
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,640
because everyone in the place is wired.

653
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,600
Oh, yeah, I try to get the shake so bad

654
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,860
I have a challenge hitting the right keys

655
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,680
on the user-hostile computer I diddle all day.

656
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,500
But it's okay, it's their drug,

657
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,240
so I'll do it if it'll alter my consciousness enough

658
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,300
to dissociate myself from what I'm doing there.

659
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,120
guitar solo

660
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,720
Nikolai brewed some coffee

661
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,860
Boiled it in a pan

662
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,140
Drank it right on down

663
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,700
Ridiculously strong

664
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,900
Eyes bulging out

665
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,100
Oh, yeah, I try to get the shake so bad

666
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:41,100


667
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:41,100


668
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,360
From his skull

669
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,660
Wired to the max

670
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:50,140
He drank it all

671
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,440
Coffee

672
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,020
O.D.

673
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:55,500
Coffee

674
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,440
O.D.

675
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,800
Nikolai was flying high

676
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,380
Taking a coffee break

677
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,280
Cowboy style in a pen

678
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,120
Ridiculously strong

679
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,580
He filled his cup

680
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,940
And drank it down

681
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,160
All he could do

682
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,780
Was stare at the table

683
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,000
Coffee

684
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,640
O.D.

685
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,100
Coffee

686
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,940
O.D.

687
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,540
Coffee

688
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,320
O.D.

689
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:35,800
Coffee

690
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,660
O.D.

691
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,760
Coffee

692
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:40,760


693
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,780
Coffee

694
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,440
Coffee

695
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,420
If you love me

696
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:51,720
��를

697
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,040
Cooke

698
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,800
Cooke

699
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,900
My taste

700
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,420
Cooke

701
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,580
My taste

702
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,320
I love coffee

703
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,000
Cooke

704
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,520
I was bulging out

705
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,980
From his skull

706
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,380
Wired to the max

707
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:30,880
He drank it all

708
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,160
Coffee

709
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,800
O.D.

710
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,200
Coffee

711
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,200
O.D.

712
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,860
Coffee

713
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,500
O.D.

714
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:42,820
Coffee

715
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,840
O.D.

716
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,960
Well, that, that was the iguanas

717
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,320
from the Godsmell comp doing Coffee O.D.

718
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,240
and before I send this one on to staying in Dallas

719
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,640
I'm gonna have to do a lot of post-op work, but

720
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:27,520
Oooh, I'm sure all of you people who have to suffer

721
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,520
in the workplace understand what's happening

722
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,420
It's killing my brain cells

723
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,200
Ahh

724
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:35,580
Ohah.

725
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,180
Ahh. früher victory everlasting

726
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:38,180


727
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,780
Oh, I'm having a battle of conscience here about this job.

728
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:47,320
My friend, sweet little Janie, wants to get a job in this hell pit I'm in.

729
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,320
Should I stop her?

730
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:55,720
I feel like the girl in that stupid PSA where a friend is playing stone chicken with a freight train.

731
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,920
But it's her decision.

732
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,240
Oh, right.

733
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,760
Well, screw that predestination crap.

734
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,940
We can make our own luck by the grace of Bob.

735
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,880
At least my job is totally meaningless.

736
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:16,120
I'm involved in the manufacture of endless reams of paper.

737
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:23,140
This company doesn't make anything but mounds of paper and sends the paper somewhere else.

738
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,460
It's like peristaltic contractions of information.

739
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:29,120
Oh.

740
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,800
At least they recycle a lot of the paper.

741
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:36,460
The pointlessness of it all has some allure for me.

742
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,160
It's a bizarre concept.

743
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:38,720
It's a coincidence.

744
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:44,680
This self-same place chewed up and spat out the soul of our very own beloved Reverend Mike Rophone.

745
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,140
My tag team running mate.

746
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,440
The tipper to my Hillary, so to speak.

747
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:54,980
Oh, I'm not so whacked out as to think it won't suck and suck fast.

748
00:54:55,340 --> 00:55:00,840
Because he's let me in on what this particular clutch of pink boys is capable of.

749
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,680
Oh, it's a festering stew pot of swamp contagion.

750
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,860
Besides working me to the bone.

751
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,020
I already feel that scratchy aura in the bit of my throat.

752
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:18,080
That queasy seismic flux in my body that means my immune system has been reamed.

753
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:18,460
Huh.

754
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,400
For a living, they call it?

755
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:20,640
Ha!

756
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,300
Oh, I'd like to say I'm sweating like a whore in church.

757
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,400
But oh, what a whore I am now.

758
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,920
I'm a real prostitute.

759
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:34,240
A genuine, low-born, common gutter slut whore dog now.

760
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,720
But what the hell?

761
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,060
If I've been playing my cards.

762
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,400
Right so far, you don't respect me.

763
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,660
So what's to lose by limboing under the limits of seeming intelligence and getting a job?

764
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,240
So heads up, corporate America.

765
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,840
The Reverend Susie the floozy is infiltrating your very bowels.

766
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,060
I'll teach him the true meaning of slacking off.

767
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:57,960
Ha!

768
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,400
Besides, anything that makes me a little schizophrenic can't be all bad.

769
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,280
I always wanted to be a top secret agent.

770
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,380
Codename Mozart.

771
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,160
Mozart.

772
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,160
You know, make it through Checkpoint Charlie by the skin of my teeth.

773
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:21,080
I like this life just the way it is.

774
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,800
And the castle is all around me.

775
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,160
I've been melting down for years.

776
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:35,240
And it kills my brain to think of all the time I wasted here.

777
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,340
All the efforts.

778
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,880
Sweat and broken hearts.

779
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,580
The screaming and the tears.

780
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,080
The dream.

781
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:52,000
The dream.

782
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,820
Dream.

783
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,060
Dream.

784
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:01,680
Dream.

785
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,260
Dream.

786
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:03,260


787
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,540
Dream.

788
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:20,420
Yes, dear friends, you're dreaming if you think you can escape the hell.

789
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:24,880
The hell of work for any subgenius.

790
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:33,960
Of course, on the other hand, you know, if you've got it, you can't really follow Bob's directives and repent.

791
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:39,160
Repent? Quit your job at Slack Off unless you have a job to quit from.

792
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:49,260
The great Nenslow recently performed that very ritual, and I'd like to read from his update,

793
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:54,680
New Report Newsletter Number 3, about that.

794
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,940
As Nenslow said,

795
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,180
We can't even afford to, since we quit,

796
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:03,940
our job at Slack Off.

797
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,260
Our evil conspiracy torture job two months ago,

798
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,120
and the thousand bucks we thought would provide some slack

799
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:17,060
got slurped up by, of all things, a goblang student loan

800
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,820
we thought had mysteriously vanished five years ago.

801
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,180
And why, you may ask?

802
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,960
Well, I'll tell you why.

803
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:28,720
Because good citizen Nenslow decided he'd spite

804
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:33,440
the juvenile moron anarchists, or drunks on welfare,

805
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:40,080
next door, and do his dash-blinking civic duty and register to vote.

806
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,380
Well, ha, ha, ha.

807
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,240
Boy, does that, quote,

808
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:53,620
unmask the alienation behind society's lies, unquote.

809
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:59,300
We guess we should have smashed the state when we had a chance, huh?

810
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,340
Except we've never been able to conquer the urge to go.

811
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,280
The fall when we run into someone so naive

812
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,420
they have to demonstrate that their behavior is justifiable

813
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:14,060
by using some sort of political ideology.

814
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:20,940
Politics is the stupidest thing there is.

815
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,540
It was invented by boring nitwits

816
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:27,360
to make each other think they have some sort of control

817
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,600
over their lives and circumstances.

818
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,660
An utterly idiotic idea

819
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:36,160
that only a total boob could ever swallow.

820
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:42,080
And anarchism is absolutely the dopiest, trippiest, lamest

821
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,340
type of politics in defense of which state

822
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:49,280
we need only remind you that it was invented by the French.

823
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:56,320
No anarchist will ever get the grudging respect of Nenslow

824
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,540
without first acknowledging us king.

825
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,640
So just shut up.

826
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:02,780
Shut up.

827
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,160
All of you.

828
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:07,780
And send that last damn dollar

829
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:11,200
or this is the last show you'll ever see.

830
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,660
Most of this is coming out of our own pocket anyway

831
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:17,860
and if it had come down to a choice between doing this show

832
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,080
and reading this Nenslow rant

833
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:24,160
and nabbing those two dozen Charlton romance comics

834
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,200
and a couple of issues of Space War and Mars Patrol

835
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,140
you can bet there would have been not the slightest hesitation on our part

836
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:33,620
but leave you us.

837
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,280
We've got our priorities.

838
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:40,840
And your priority dear friend is

839
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,520
to just write for free information.

840
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,300
Oh yes, because that's what you need is

841
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,600
information.

842
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,880
And it has to be free, don't it?

843
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,820
Well you can get you some.

844
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,240
Get you some off of Bob.

845
01:00:59,420 --> 01:00:59,920
Why not?

846
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:01,960
You got that?

847
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,120
You got that?

848
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:02,620
You got that pencil ready?

849
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,580
I'm going to give that address.

850
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,780
Just drop us a self-addressed stamped envelope

851
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:11,460
and send that to Bob

852
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:19,680
at Post Office Box 140306.

853
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:26,900
That's Box 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

854
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,200
That's it.

855
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:29,600
It's

856
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,060
seven

857
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:32,380
two

858
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:33,340
one

859
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,000
four

860
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,620
go ahead.

861
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,020
Three voices from the dead

862
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:41,580
come from underneath my bed

863
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:42,800
and I

864
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:53,120
don't even care

865
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:59,060
I like my stupid life

866
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,900
just the way it is

867
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:02,100
I like my stupid life just the way it is

868
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,620
and the chaos that surrounds me

869
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:08,720
like a flock of screaming pigs

870
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:13,060
and it hurts my brain to think of all

871
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:15,660
the stupid things I've said

872
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:19,340
and if I could change the future

873
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,440
I would change the past instead

874
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:27,820
and I'm dreaming again

875
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,100
and I'm dreaming again

876
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,720
so that I have a friend

877
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,800
and more

878
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,420
plus

879
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,680
there is an undercurrent

880
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,300
I don't care

881
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:43,320
there is an impixel

882
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:43,620
I just need to stop

883
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:43,820
this

884
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:45,500
for i wanna w genuine

885
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:56,560
