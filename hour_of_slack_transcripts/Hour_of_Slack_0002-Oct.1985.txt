Bob?
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind
every time you say, see, hear, or think.
What about slash?
That's your key phrase.
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.
Hour of Slack.
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius,
with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs,
living out of the church,






Avatar of Slack,
and Saint of Sales,
on Planet Earth.
I will put you tried everything.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Learn to think big.
Develop the tricks of length extension.
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.
Stand direct for your own abnormality.
Bob is a way of life to millions.
Yet half of them don't even know.
He's the one true living Slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.
He is the one real shortcut to Slack.
Now see another dimension on your TV.
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.
Become physically attractive overnight.
Attain success.
Status.
Luck.
Prosperity.
By blowing them off.
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.
To explore new ways of going over the edge.
And coming right back.
And to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormal behavior.

To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.
That will fool normals and get you sex.
Be.

and doesn't have insurance against slander since we can't do live call-ins
we're we're just going to take the show public face-to-face live on the road
where we are live and we're using a microwave transmitter it costs over a
thousand dollars just to use tonight in the back of the mobile studio and it's
uh so we're bringing the show to you that's right we are bring where if we
may be drive you look out your window and if you see a a the Bob mobile
driving by well you can wave to us don't turn your radio up to you like this

I quit my own band and then I found out
that I betrayed myself
I'm not going to be a hero anymore
I'm not going to be a hero anymore
Bob
A six million year cycle will end in 1998
Bob sees the world entering a new aeon which in a few years will bring more wondrous and miraculous change and more ancient sanity and destruction than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it
Bob brings a new destiny for mankind

Bob brings a new destiny for America
A time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power to those in the know while billions of deserving conspiracy dupes thrive in hell on earth
Uncontrolled thinking controlled by Bob will usher in a spiritual rebrief from a cascade of astounding mysteries
Supernatural riches and a restoration of the world's history

A new life that will transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them
That's right you're lucky to live in the end time
Here's more money Bob
Wise up they're out to get you
The different are being silenced by a global conspiracy
Weird men arise and find out who they are and how to smash them
You probably already knew that the US government is a sham
Something popped up there for you to blame
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?
That they are actually shambling?
Unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable things?
Yes, Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet
Defy the sinister star forces which may be in the way of the world's future
And mock us all
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years
God has been misquoted all this time
His actual words may disturb you
But Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind
There's no problem with Bob
Bob is a sex god
Bob's a sex god
Unbelievable, unspeakable, unbearable
Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind
Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind
Do it, do it, do it
Keep it going
You're a moron
...town that uh...
But ah yes
It feels so good to be out here
You know I couldn't...
That uh...
The stuffy radio studio
Well that's good enough for those other DJs I suppose
But uh...
This is a living ministry dear friends
This is a live
A live uh... outreach
We're gonna reach out
There's a 7-Eleven
We could reach out to there and get a couple of packs of Marlboros
Really get into some false slack
That's right
Put them in the back of the...
Well let's see where's the show script
There is a script
We always have...
This is probably the most scripted show on K&ON
That's right
See if you can... if you can read it
Oh yes
Okay
Well tonight we're on K&ON 90.9 FM, Dallas, California

We're gonna be doing a show called K&ON
It's a show that's far worth
In stereo
Thank you K&ON
If you like what we play
Give us a call at...
What is the number here?
Well we don't have a phone in the car
8-2-3
That's okay
They can still call us
They can still call us
Is it 7-4-9-0?
I don't know
8-2-3
Yeah I think it is
It's 8-2-3-7-4-9-0
That's right Francis
And you can call us
As soon as we put a record on
I want you to give us a call
Cause we're gonna be going
And we'll talk to you very carefully
And if...
Not if you're...
If you're cool
But if you're not
But if you're really stupid enough
To be on the show with us
We will let you be on the show with us
Well...
We have that worked out
We have that option
We have that blood covenant my friend
With Wotan
The North Scot...
Look at this
Now look at this already
999-BJX
Uh huh
That's like Texas license plate
No less
In front of us
See now
We'll interpret that numerology for you
999 is the number of Bob
B...
They...
Yeah they've got it
999 on their license plate
And they...
And they wonder why
They've been battered and hit
Every time they leave their car in a parking lot
Friends...
They don't...
Or why...
Or why do these flying saucers
Seem to harass them all the time
Yeah...
Probably
That's probably what happened
I mean you know that...
I mean it's just aliens
Looking for a good time
I mean if you'd been locked up in a spaceship
For however many billions of years
It takes to get here
I mean you'd want a little too
You...
Yeah
You'd be out joy riding
And...
And uh...
Buzzing a few primitive earth vehicles
If you saw an offer like that
You wouldn't turn it down
Yeah
999 is the number of Bob
B...

It's just Bob friends
And that's why
It's not that Bob is the antichrist upside down
Uh...
Bob is the...
Uh...
If anything he's the anti-antichrist
Which doesn't mean he's the messiah
Nay Bob denies that he is the messiah
And he doesn't want you thinkin' that
Cause he knows you're gonna think it anyway
You're gonna wonder
Says he...
He...
You'll think it's too good to be true though
And friends uh...
This is KNON
Live on the road

That is my favorite song for sure.
Oh, we're out of that Belfast battle zone.
Slave driver drove his tank into his reserved parking spot
and stepped out looking like Margaret Thatcher.
The war was on.
Oh, the keys on the typewriter
had shut off.
Sharp points that kept sticking into our fingers.
The dictating equipment started asking us questions.
And our beepers sent electric shocks
just through our body like a cattle prod.
Out in the warehouse, the trucks kept banging into the docks,
not even thinking about stopping.
Oh, our frail bodies were strapped to the chairs.
And our chairs were chained to the desks.
Our pleas for justice were ignored.
And the end seemed near.
But we busted our Margaret Thatcher slave driver's
little bitty balls.
We've charged out of their brick fortress.
The streets are ours.
Oh, my God.
We've charged out of their brick fortress.

Because it's Friday.
Friday.
Friday.
Friday.

Friday.
It was like being a hell's angel
when I sang this song for the first time.
I go along to my home
when I had an old little girl.
And I'm home.
And I go to my old neighbor's to see her.
And me and my old pal, Electron, were there.
And that was when we didn't wear any underwear.
We thought it was cool to be hanging free in the breeze.
And me and Electron would go riding with the houseguests.
And we went to the academy to study philosophy and medicine and psychology as well as art and
poetry and the tradition of human mind vision.
But we were like hell's angels on the weekend.
Honoring a fire.
And there was this oneirteen
looking out the window.
And I got out at 10 o'clock.
And I'm saying to him,
Don't you think you needed a Vieio in school.
You really should get him out that moment.
嘛
He gave me this number because it was ropes.
Yeah.

Blister in the Sun
By a band called Violent Femmes
I was introduced to that song by
A little tiny, tiny gal
That likes to attack Texas OU weekenders
With a baseball bat
I'm Pastor Buck Naked, by the way
We're on the street, we're on the road as we speak
We're driving around, doing our show tonight
On four wheels
That's right, folks, and what you just heard
Starting at the beginning was
Oh yeah, by They Might Be Giants
It's Friday by I Have No Idea Who
And Hell's Angels on the Weekend
By the incredible Swinging Love Corpses
Okay, now we are going to do a little thing

I kid you not, Buddy West was in
one of these little folk stops
talking to Ray Wiley Hubbard, and Ray Wiley Hubbard says,
so, when are you and the
Jaybirds getting back together? Wow.
You guys are famous.
I know it. Yeah.
Okay. And now,
Doctors for Bob,
yes, we are going to be playing live
recordings from the last Twilight
Room revival,
dear friends, because
this is coming next
Saturday, less than a week
from the time you're
wading through right
now, is the subgenius
Scary Ball and Masquerade
D Vival at the Twilight Room.
That's right, October 26th, the weekend
before Halloween, Saturday night.
The
scariest, most hideous
monsters and bands
with more live blood and guts
on stage than you've ever seen.
This is a return to the grand
wind.
No. You see,
it's an ancient French tradition
of bloody gore shows
that we're doing
some homage to, and we'll be playing
tapes, live revival tapes
from the last Twilight Room revival where
D Vival.
That's right.
Where more drunk cowboys
and Doctors for Bob, that's right
folks, the Doctors for Bob,
the only
authorized launchers of the
bleeding head of the World
Cup golfer whose name we can't say on this show
because of the insurance problem.
It's called Mad Arabs and it's by
Doctors for Dinosaurs World Band.
That's right.
Now what, what?
That is a top 40 hit buck that Doctors for Dinosaurs
had after, just right after you quit that band.
I cleaned up on that record, pal.
Like all that subgenius stuff.
That's what I get for listening to K&N.
They send you this junk for free,
and I get paid for putting it on the air.
I've been listening to K&N and I totally missed the fact that I was listening to K&N.
I was on a champ selling AM hit.
That's right.
That's right.
Doctors for Dinosaurs, Mad Arabs.
You may just not recognize the title because it's an instrumental.
And we'll have to listen to it.
Yes, we'll be getting into all this evil,
evil, demonic tapes, you know,
because that's what they say about us.
They say Church of the Subgenius.
Well, it's a demonic.
Well, since we haven't seen it yet,
we're supposed to act like we have seen it.
How did you like Chastity Belt's show, Twilight?
No, we haven't seen it yet.
Well, I know.
Well, let's act like we have.
Okay.
I thought it was unbelievably disgusting.
I don't think that people should be allowed to do that kind of thing on stage.
How did she remove that much clothing and still get on?
I thought this was a political country.
It was a political show, see, and it was a statement.
This Twilight Room revival, devival, I'm sorry, Bob, I'm sorry, Bob, I'm sorry, Bob, I'm sorry,
but I haven't been studying the TV.


I've been working too hard for the conspiracy and drifting away from the true jargon of the
church.
Well, praise Bob.
That was my point.
Praise money.
Yeah, praise money and praise FROP, friends.
They, you know, I don't believe everybody has to eat FROP while they're driving at the
same time, but this is a free country and FROP, have a FROP Zip-U-Lops is still legal.
Well, I think we ought to be careful.

Yes.
All right, next up.
Here's a song we have on track, a anthem for you, the interviewing members for Mile
City with JAKE WILLIAMS' MALMOTOください Mar歌 제발 아닌데 AOT.

Let's do the one with the joke.
Don't you want some được 여러분 할머니
자�acco chemlogo nominated of course, the recording of the ball like I was told,
Not as long as you have two hours of sound.
Actually I do a good job reading them.
But I didn't make it up.
You can still-


Hold on to the microphones, would you, Rock?
Let's see.
All right, folks, and we're going to roll that tape.
So here it comes.
As soon as we can figure out how to...
Shock the living gee out of me.
Well, we're going to do a song here
about a young man who received electroshock
and who was cured.
We call it Shock the Living Gee Out of Me.
Shock the Living Gee Out of Me
Created an Arnold Palmer head this realistic
Where it's only the dots that prove behavior patterns
He just said she was...
She said she was 18
How was I to know she was only three?
But I'm not mad
I only seek happiness
And that's not nearly as bad
That's not nearly as bad
That's not half as bad as that time they
Shock the living gee out of me
That's not nearly as bad as that time they
Shocked the living shower of fragrant water
That's not nearly as bad as that time they
Shocked the living shower ofiamo
They got me and survived
Shouted hurt the living song
Assệt een,, heung, goodness
For beating the!
At a time so strange
Pee once was on the town
The fucking bill!
Pee was on the town!
with the sticky part.
Oh, that was fun.
That time they converted my entire body
to a wall of membrane
attached to a human brain
whose only purpose was to feel pain
and then apply the flame.
But all that felt good
compared to that time they
shot the living gay out of me.
Shot the living gay out of me.
Shot the living gay.
That time they cut off all my arms and legs
and then shot me in the neck
with a Dutron howitzer.
Oh, yeah, that felt good.
That was quite pleasurable
compared to that time they hooked up that device.
Oh, it wasn't an AC device.
It ran on the AC current.
But it ran on the DC current.
But they brought that orderly in
and they had those nurses attached to it.
That was really a panacea.
It was fun.
Oh, I'm glad.
Oh, that was a rock and roll party.
I thought all that was fun
compared to that time they
shot the living gay out of me.
All I want is happiness.
I'm not crazy.
But it's the normals.
They're trying to kill me with normalcy rays.
I had to kill that school bus full of orphans.
All I think is happiness
is myself.
Can I help with it?
Is happiness for me
is killing an entire busload
full of school children?
No, that's crazy.
Go ahead.
Lock me up.
Then they put me in the padded...
They put me in that room
where they don't give you any good pills.
They kept me confined for three weeks.
But that wasn't nearly as bad
as that time they
shot the living gay out of me.
They had me all tied up.
They brought the nurses in.
They had me chained down with rope.
They had me tied down with chains.
They had a needle that took
27 orderlies to bring in.
They had a needle that was as big
as the Empire State Building.
In order to sedate me,
they had to lower me on top of the needle
with a helicopter.
But I feel like the frontal lobotomy
was helping to build
progressive,
growthful member of society.
But my mind is still okay.
You know, I've got a piece of paper
that says my mind is still okay.
But that wasn't nearly as bad
as that time they
shot the living gay out of me.
Ah!

Okay!
Okay.
That was a shock
to living gay out of me
by Doctors for Bob.
Doctors for Bob,
more drunk cowboys,
and just a ranting bunch of
devangelists will be down
at the Twilight Room October 26th.
And you can see us all there
just this coming Saturday.
So why not?
I want y'all to make sure
to listen to Pajama Party.
And...
And...
I want to thank Shaggy for lending me that song, Blister in the Sun, that we just played.
Great song.
She's here now.
When are you on, Shaggy?
What time does your show start?
Midnight.
Midnight to what, three?
Four.
To four.
Okay, you can listen to Pajama Party here, midnight to four.
These are the announcements.
Now, you have your pen, right?
Okay, also, November 23rd, see my band, More Drunk Cowboys and Lost Highway,
the K&ON benefit, Sons of Herman Hall.
Sons of Herman Hall.
And that's November 23rd.
And this Saturday night's the other thing.
Anything else to announce?
Okay.
Also, Doug, let's now give them the itinerary for our West Coast tour.
And this is for Crazy George and anybody else.
By the way, you're listening to K&ON 90.9, Dallas-Fort Worth-Lancaster.
Doug, let's give them the itinerary of the West Coast tour.
My name is Reverend Stang, Pastor Naked.
It's November 9th in San Francisco.
November 15th in San Francisco.
And 16th in Los Angeles.
That's right, the Subgenius Rolling Medicine Show.
And Hell Tap Revival will be in California.
Then in Seattle, I think the 16th.
No, 17th.
That's all you need to know.
Let's hear Ernest.
Subgenius Medicine Show.
Subgenius Medicine Show.
My sweetheart has gone and I'm so lonely
She said that she and I were through
So I started out drinking for pastime
Driving nails in my coffin over you
I'm just driving nails in my coffin
Every time I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just driving nails in my coffin
Lordy driving those nails over you
All coming red
Oh, let's hear it for you, Jimmy
Every since the day that we parted
I've been so sad and so blue
I'm always thinking of you, love
And I just can't quit drinking that old booze
I'm just driving nails in my coffin
Every time I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just driving nails in my coffin
Lordy driving those nails over you
Hey, that new church air is just great!
It's fun!
Well, son, if you'll just keep breathing an equal portion of church air
With all of the bad air, too
You'll get like me
Your head will begin to expand
The inside will eventually become larger than the outside
I don't know quite how to explain this
But I've put my trust in Bob
Thanks to Bob
The inside of my head is much larger than the outside ever was
But doesn't that make it hard to get through doorways?
Sometimes I do get lost inside my head
And I've had trouble finding my way out
Especially early in the morning
But thanks to Bob, I've been able to get through the doorways


And I'm happy to be able to work at his shop
I'm happy to be able to be a much more productive employee on the job
And I've had a great time at parties with this new big head
That came with my glandscaping
Will the same thing happen to me when I get to be a man, too?
Yes, son, you'll go through the operations, too
The doctors will open your third nostril with their musical instruments
And you'll be able to whiff-read the stains


And you'll be able to whiff-read the stains

You'll be able to sell them anything, son
Just like me
Gee, I can't wait till that Bob-time train comes around the bend
Oh, look out, son
Here it comes now
It's frightening, isn't it?
It's unbelievably big
It's frightening, isn't it?

It's frightening, isn't it?

It's terrifying
It's a matter of

Hey, that new church air is just great.
The new screen excitement you've been waiting for.
Rated PG.
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.
Your doorbell rings and there's a chaplain standing quietly.
He tells you,
We're splashing liberation right around the world and we'll die to do it.
This is Ted Stack, KNON News, from the Twilight Room.
I'm now going to interview Reverend Ivan Stang.
Ivan Stang, is it true that the subgenius medicine show will be coming to the Twilight Room?
That's right, folks.
October 26th.
This coming Saturday.
This is coming Saturday, right?
This is going to be the scariest revival, the devival, whatever you call them nowadays in this disgusting world.
Is it true that the head of a murdered man will be on display?
That's exactly right.
These people were.
They worship this head.
They.
Ah.
Okay.
Everybody knows you.
They actually worship this head and they're, they're, they launch this thing ritualistically every equinox.
And they're, this is all Hallows Eve or just about.
That's shocking, man.
Yeah.
Is that a transformer on the ground?
And these people are having a party.
I mean, this isn't, it's not only a church ritualistic thing, it's also a sort of a sinful party.
You mean an event for marbles?
Is that for?
I mean, there's a.
There will be fleecing normals.
There will be fleecing normals and dancing their asses off at the Twilight Room on October 26th.
The admission is, what is the admission?
We forgot to bring our.
I always have to do this.
Well, I just want to say tonight that me and my fellow doctors for Bob are members in good standing of a church, but not just any church.
Well, the church to which we belong just happens to be beyond a shadow of a doubt.
The world's only bogus, true religion.
Right.
Of course.
Of course.






I am referring to the Church of the Subgenius.
Now, the Church of the Subgenius, as founded by J.R. Bob Dobbs, Saint of Sales, Master of Slack in 1953, is a pan-religion of the future,
uniting superior mutants, social renegades, twisted geniuses, and sci-fi sinners in a worldwide rampage of immoral and prophetic yucks and grins.
Yucks and grins.
Which will hopefully, inevitably, lead us directly to a commodity all too lacking in today's modern, jet-age-a-go-go society, and that commodity, friends, is slack.
Now, slack is what the conspiracy wants to rob us of.
Slack is what the conspiracy wants to take away from us.
Now, back in the 50s, Bob Dobbs himself noticed a decided lack of slack.
A lack in our culture.
He noticed an awful prevalence of normalcy.
He noticed that the normals formed a vast conspiracy against the different.
An insidious conspiracy dedicated to squelching our natural rogue instincts.
Dedicated to wiping out our fun factors.
Dedicated, in short, to the total and utter alleviation of the original slack.
With which we are all born.
Now, Bob wanted to fight this conspiracy in what better way, I ask ye, than by the foundation of a major new world religion.
Hence the Church of the Subgenius.
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Say a few words for a radio show.
Pastor Buck naked is alright.
And God save Nancy Reagan.
Okay, this is live here at the radio show.




We're in the toilet room with Tony Granados.
We're sitting...
We're walking around interviewing these drunken, brawling barbarians here at the Twilight Room.
Mysterious Bob and Dallas.
Home of the Subgenius revival this Saturday night.
That's right, this Saturday night, the Subgenius revival.
The Masquerade Ball medicine show.
Come one, come all, folks.
You'll be here, 2111 Commerce Street.
Admission...
Five dollars!
We will fleece the pigs!
Not a problem.
Bring it to the friendly people.
People touching people.
People running against people.
People developing the nuclear first strike capability to incinerate people.
Sound like a flash in the pan?
It's gotta be.
You don't settle for less.
You don't have to.
You're you.
And you've got needs.
Bigger and more earth-shaking than your grandfather could have dreamed.
How do we keep bringing them to you, year after year, bigger and better?
By using the technology of tomorrow on the consumers of today.
The now people.
People on the go.
Going from smart shopper to new low value in the time it takes to dial our number.
Call now, won't you?
For more of what you've come to expect from us.
Style.
Mood.
A certain dependable kind of image.
An image of the way you like people to be.
Passive.
Pretty.
White.
As white as the complexion of our finest women, grown right here by our special process.
As white as the hair of God.
White as it was in life.
As white as the blank sheet on which we write your mind.
Who are we?
We're the happy people.
Happy to live in a world of images.
Images of war.
Family.
Crime.
Fun images that help rinse away all the pain.
Unsightly self images so you can get away from the privacy of your own home.
After all, aren't you what everything's here for?
You're what we're here for.
That's why we made everything.
And that's why everything made you.
And that's why you made us.
Who are we?
We're the money people.
The people who take your money.
No more money hassling.
But what about little Dicky, you say?
What's little Dicky gonna do when you're working late and Wilma's minding the fort and Sis is in and out?
Put away those straps and buckles.
Dicky's safe with us.
He's even learning to speak now.
He's getting back again.
Our way.
Best of all, he's safe with the people who know what it is you want from a world.
Simplicity.
Reliability.
A world you can go to without worrying about whether your money is safe.
You know, when we first got into this business, we didn't know much more than you.
Like you.
We thought there was a world out there.
A world of value.
A world that needed meaning.
Beauty.
Love.
A world that needed a better product.
Uh-uh.
There's just you.
And you want it.
You want to know something.
You want to know just exactly what it is you're supposed to do.
You don't really care why, just so long as it's the right thing.
It's natural.
Everyone wants to do the right thing.
But sometimes it's hard to know just what the right thing is.
Let's say you're black.
And you've just lost both your arms and legs defending U.S. interests in El Salvador.
You come home and get thrown in jail for life for beating up four white cops.
You want to know just exactly what is it I'm supposed to feel.
We can't give you all the answers.
But we can help you flesh out your fantasy that there are some.
At our labs, we use only the finest homemade ingredients.
Love.
Children.
God.
And the purest blend of money your needs can buy, grown right here by our special process.
A process in use since our first mom and pop operation.
Who are we?
We're the normal people.
Time is really wasted.
There's no guarantee.
Smiles in the making.
We gotta fight the powers that be.
Got so many voices.
Say it on the scene.
Giving up all around.
Me.
Bases for the pain.
I try to play my music.
This ain't my music.
It's too loud.
I try talking about it.
I got to be run around.
And when I roll with the punches.
I got knocked on the ground.
By all this bullshit going down.
Hey.
Time is really wasted.
There's no guarantee.
Smiles in the making.
We gotta fight the powers that be.
Sleep.

Parking at the end of the line.
You're in contact.
All passengers, please sit at park.
I really didn't believe in Bob.
And then one time I was going out to my favorite club.
Yeah.
And I got a flat.
And then the next minute, I didn't have the flat.
Go ahead.
Praise Bob.
Bob.
Charlie, you're on the air with us now on our radio show.
This is Charlie Gilder of the Twilight Room.
Say a little bit about Twilight Room or anything else to the kids.
Well, we're mentioned in Playboy magazines.
This proves that we're a true den of debauchery.
What's more than that, we were talking about entertainment tonight.
Yes, this is a famous place.
Y'all come down here and be rough with us.
The Colossus Notice.
The Colossus Notice Club.
Listen to that.
We have true rock and roll corruption and lyrics that cannot be printed.
That's right.
This is any kind of false corruption.
This is the real thing, kids.
Fortunately, it's real rock and roll and the lyrics can't be uncured either.
But that's beside the point.
It'll still corrupt your soul and the devil will begin to control your brain.
That's 21-11.
It's a commerce street, folks.
It's a commerce school.
Get your butts down here.
Dr. Rubio saves me.
Saves me.
Bob saves those who save themselves.
Well, Bob made it so cold.
Pull out your wallet.
I'll give you my wallet if you just make it summer in here.
Just pull it out and...
Oh, well, I'll turn off the...
Look.
Look.
There.
All right.
And it's warmer.
Here's my checking account.
How much do you want?
It was, uh, just...
Hey.
What?
You're gonna have to put that in the wall over our eyes.
Constantly.
Bob is saying if we must be lied to and cheated for reasons, let us do it to ourselves for
our own reasons.
Let us realize where the real deceit lies.
Let us have a choice in how we're being screwed.
Some ways are fun.
For many of us, there is no physical escape from their clutches or any hope of it until
the excess come and the followers of us are gone.

like a soothing dew in what fortune lies.
After all, it should be every person's choice
to curse God and die if that was what they wish.
We all have the right to spit in the eye of the collective gods,
did we not create them?
Where indeed would Yahweh own be
without the human race that torments and pesters?
I'll put it to you,
the old chiseler would be pretty damn bored with it all
if there was nothing more entertaining
than sherpins and seraphims
and numby-pumby flaming angels
sitting around up there on damp clouds
and arson and profiting all 24 hours of bloody day
and you can fight or not.
The world is from Minnesota.
Cool.
You heard it here first.
Alright, the show has picked up two passengers.
We got guests on the show tonight.
Yeah!
Cool.
Alright.
Yeah, if we could just keep this show running.
Hey, can we get...
Can we get the show out?
This is the hour of slack.
Will the show fit through that?
No, the show can't go there.
You have to back the show up this alley
and take the show down that road there.
Oh, okay.
I'll show you the way out.
Oh, look out!
Don't hit that other show!
Oh!
Jeez, that was KZW.
I hate their truck!
I hate the KZ truck!
They're all trying to run us off the road!
I hate them!
I hate them!
And the KERA car is always following us!
Every time we go out...
No, no, you're doing a half!
They were following us last night!
Oh, heck.
No, this way.
You can only go this way.
It's a one-way airway.
The FM.
FM's this way.
Then you follow that way to stay on FM.
Otherwise, we'll end up at the AM side of the town.
We'll end up on the other side of the band.
I don't want you to be...
The last time, I had a hard time getting out of AM.
So I want to stay in FM.
Yeah.
Okay, now wait.
A powerful gospel.
And then stay on this road and hit the light.
Take a left.
Or no, no, wait a minute.
Which one is this?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'd rather you did that.
Just take a left.
On this one.
Just go down.
Go down Main.
No, no, I'd rather you go this way.
This is Commerce.
Take the show.
Go down Main.
Okay.
That way you can do it when you're totally hypnotized
and you'll never get lost.
Go down Commerce?
No, this way.
Which is this way?
Go down Main.
All right.
Okay, now listen.
These friends, you're lucky to have KNO in in this city
and you won't have it much longer.
If you don't spend your money on this station,
listen to what you get on the rest of the year.
Look at that.
A board.
A board.
We're not even table football.
Look at that.
Listen to that.
Static.
And that.
Nothing.
Wait a minute.
That's on AM.
This is the worst.
This is the worst.
Give them FM now.
All right.
Now we're going to turn to KNO in.
Here you go.
Listen to that.
All right.
That's KNO in.
Okay.
Man.
And you would let this go by.
You would let this blow by.
No, take a right.
Take a right.
Keep the show.
No.
Oh, no.
The show's off the road.
Oh, hell.
Guys.
Guys.
No, no.
Let's just go fast.
Faster and faster.
They'll never catch us.
All right.
We'll see.
Keep the show on here.
We'll go to Central.
If we can get the show.
Put the show on Central.
That's what I'm doing.
Oh, okay.
You went up to over there.
Okay.
This is Central.
We're putting the show on Central Expressway now.
All right.
It's dangerous, folks.
But we're ready to do it.
The same here.
It's all over Dallas.
You can cast KNO in anywhere.
In Dallas or Plano or Arlington or Russia.
They can't get KNO in in Russia, friend.
And you know why?
Because the people in Russia.
Don't.
Don't send us money.
That's right.
No, straight, straight, straight.
No, no.
I'm going this way.
I know what I'm doing.
What am I telling you how to drive downtown for?
He's only lived here like.
I've been running this show for a week now.
I've been here for nine years.
I just thought you were lost.
No, no.
I know where we're taking the show.
I don't know why.
Only Bob knows why.
I knew the alley.
So I thought he forgot the highways too.
I knew the way around the alley.
Yes.
There's the back alleys of the airwaves of Dallas,
Texas.
You're going to find all kinds of weird things.
The back alleys of Gotham City.
Gotham City.
This is a crime.
We're in.
Here we are.
We're in Boston City.
We're in Georgia.
We're moving.
We're moving to Concord.
We're moving to Concord.
It's not 14 ..."
It's prescient.
It's life too short to be pathological.

Okay, kids, the car is packed.
Now go and get your father and we'll look at some more new houses.
Let you hold Mary dear to your heart.
Well, the show is coming in for a landing here at the Bulldada Time Control Laboratories.
And we'll have to sign off now.
It's Sunday.
I'm sorry that we have so little time on the air.
And I want you to send some contributions in to us at the station here.
KON90.9.
But don't just send money.
Send your whole wallet.
Ah, yes, friend.
And that way we'll save your soul.
You send us your wallet, we'll save your soul.
The Subgenius Radio Ministry is the hour of slack.
That's right.
Folks, I would recommend reading.
It's free.
Scripture 16, 14, 17, 18.
And you can write for information on how to order these precious tapes.
And we need blankets and contraceptives for those boys and girls in the home for slackless children.
Your contributions keep those we hate starving to death.
I command you to spill your gift seed pledge of 100 pounds of dollar bills on my lap.
As this will buy modeling clay and transform the toys for those poor children.
Dogs will bless you for planting this seed of faith.
Ah, yes, friend.
And now, the announcer will give you our mailing address.
That's the Church of the Subgenius.

Over and over again.
I was drinking Budweiser.

Good kick by a mule.
I was with Cousin Junior.

I was drunk.
I was lonely.
I was plastered.
I was drunk.
I was drinking Budweiser.
And Bob was on TV.
Drinking Budweiser.
Watching Bob on TV.
Swallowing red men.
