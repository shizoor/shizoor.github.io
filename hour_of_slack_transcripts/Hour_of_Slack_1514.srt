1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
Brother and sister here

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,100
For

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,700
Our slack

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,860
Yeah

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,840
Alright

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,820
One God, one aim, one destiny

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,400
For all, one race

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,580
The human race

9
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,880
That nasty human race

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,800
Man, they do some nasty

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,540
Things man

12
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,520
Yeah, unfortunately

13
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,840
Unfortunately

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,820
See ya

15
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,620
WCSB Cleveland

16
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,840
You know

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,960
You know

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,520
You know I'm so thankful

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,580
Tonight that I don't have

20
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,660
A lot of money, I don't have a lot

21
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,560
Of friends, but I have

22
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,260
A whole lot of diagrams

23
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,340
Of how to position

24
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,220
Bob or Steve

25
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,620
Somebody's

26
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,900
Got a conspiracy

27
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,800
Going on

28
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,900
And you will say

29
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,140
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

30
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,120
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,200
We don't have a lot of money

32
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,020
We don't have a lot of people

33
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,100
And we got a lot of power

34
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,560
Of the wicked Bob

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,740
And the spiritual darkness

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,960
We ask Bob

37
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,280
To come

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,540
And to reveal the conspiracy

39
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,620
In the skies above you

40
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,080
And open up

41
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,380
Every deceitful work

42
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,400
Of conspiracy

43
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,340
You know, the things

44
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,800
That it's done, the symbols

45
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,480
And the emblems of Bob

46
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,520
Now, a lot of people loved the hour of slug.

47
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,660
Actually, they're in bodies with two legs.

48
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,140
They have two eyes.

49
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,340
They have two ears.

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,460
And their mouth is filled with Bob's spirit, see?

51
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,920
There's no prob with Bob.

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't know who he's with or what the deal is.

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:04,000
But I know that if I stay close to Bob, I'll be safe in those Gleaguers in Arkansas.

54
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,400
I know those creatures can't get a hold of me if I just hang around the foundation and do what they say.

55
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,380
And, you know, clean up after them a little bit.

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,080
I don't mind doing that kind of work if it's for a good cause.

57
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,420
I know that Bob.

58
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,980
I know that Bob.

59
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:23,980


60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,540
I know that Bob is a good cause.

61
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,280
Bob took me inside his heart.

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,280
And I accepted him into my life.

63
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:43,640
And I'm here to testify, friends, what that man has done for me, if you can really call him a man.

64
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,560
Many people say he's almost like a god.

65
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,700
I don't think so.

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,300
Of course, I don't know, Bob.

67
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,780
But I do.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,560
I do know Bob in certain ways.

69
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,100
And I think you understand what I'm talking about.

70
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,780
Yes, Bob, he filled me with the sort of the spirit I never knew I had.

71
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,380
And I knew it wasn't coming from him.

72
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,440
It was coming from inside me.

73
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,280
Bob was giving it to me.

74
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,920
He was laying hands on me from afar.

75
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,040
He might have been up in that great big jet plane.

76
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,980
Or he might have been down on the ground.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
Skid Row giving some bum a haircut.

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,340
But all I know is it was Bob.

79
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,860
It was Bob.

80
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,340
Bob.

81
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,360
Yeah, he's smiling.

82
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,680
You never see Bob frown.

83
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,520
You know that behind that amazing smile, there lies a mind like a steel trap.

84
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,400
I'm sure he makes mistakes.

85
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,740
Like what he did with those young women that time.

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,880
So I think the newspapers exaggerated that.

87
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,840
I know that Bob will do all of us fine in the long run.

88
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,840
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob in our lives.

89
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,800
In our lives.

90
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,320
In 1981.

91
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,520
And in 1984.

92
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,500
Hi, little brother.

93
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
And in 1991.

94
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,980
And in 1995.

95
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,580
When they bring the conspiracy to its heels.

96
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,580
And in that wondrous year that we know is going to come all too soon upon us.

97
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,740
And we'll leave our earthly things behind.

98
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:53,260
And we'll go and join the exes from God only knows what strange planet they come from.

99
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,700
If they really even come from a planet at all.

100
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,340
And not some energy star beaming away in the darkness.

101
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,440
Lighting our lives with the technology.

102
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,040
And the spirituality.

103
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,320
And the mentality of planet X.

104
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,900
Planet X coming down to take care of us subgeniuses.

105
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,640
And see that there's a place for us in the world.

106
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,000
And give us our rightful seat at the right hand of Bob.

107
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,300
Or the left hand of Bob.

108
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,520
Depending on whether we're rewardians or mediocrities.

109
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,340
But I don't want to get lost in the dogma.

110
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,400
I want to tell you something that blesses my heart.

111
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,340
And it's Bob.

112
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,680
Bob.

113
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,080
Bob.

114
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,860
Yeah, I can hear him.

115
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,160
I can hear him talking off there in the distance.

116
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,420
Saying, come to me, Tommy.

117
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,400
Come to me and lay down your material things.

118
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,640
Because you know they are going to mean much to you.

119
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,220
After that.

120
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,240
That divine year.

121
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,740
And after I lay my hand on you.

122
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,620
And lead you up the steps of that magnificent craft.

123
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,680
And we'll board it and go to the stars.

124
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,880
That's right, Tommy.

125
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,580
We'll go to the stars.

126
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,480
You and me.

127
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,880
That's what Bob said.

128
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,140
Bob said that.

129
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,200
And I said, I'm going to take you to the stars.

130
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,200


131
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,560
I got to say.

132
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,340
I'm having a better time here than I think I've ever had at any devotional.

133
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,340
Woo!

134
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:33,860
Woo!

135
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,520
Yeah.

136
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,480
Thanks so much to everybody who's brought us out here.

137
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,840
This is great.

138
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
For people who wanted to bring us out.

139
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,080
We love playing for Stang.

140
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,900
Everybody here is laid back.

141
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,580
Yeah.

142
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:46,800
Yeah.

143
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,020
I didn't say anything.

144
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,560
Oh, no.

145
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,720
This is a much cooler crowd.

146
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,200
This is a much cooler crowd.

147
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,200


148
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,200


149
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,200


150
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,200


151
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,200


152
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,200


153
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,640
You've been with it a long time.

154
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,580
I tell you.

155
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,060
Come on.

156
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,300
Come on.

157
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,440
Come on.

158
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,780
Come on.

159
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,800
Come on.

160
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,820
When poor those dogs' heads rain down on me.

161
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,080
I'm waiting for those dogs' heads rain down on me.

162
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,220
Waiting for those dogs' heads rain down on me.

163
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,540
From within that glowing cloud.

164
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,260
Radiation slack out.

165
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,580
Ball everywhere.

166
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,740
Radiation slack out.

167
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,140
Mass for a year.

168
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,820
Radiation slack out.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,400
It's already here.

170
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,660
In this beautiful music world.

171
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,820
From the

172
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,520
감 community–

173
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,080
Oh my.

174
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,880
This is absolutely brilliant right here.

175
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:18,960
But just,

176
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,720
as we have titled it,

177
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,180
10 İdol待 Odessa hearings,

178
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,520
Big low and all tech clouds

179
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,260
Radiation slack outs

180
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,540
All everywhere

181
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,420
Radiation slack outs

182
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,040
Last for a year

183
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,760
Radiation slack outs

184
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,260
Already here

185
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,420
In the beautiful music world

186
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,620
Get ready, false one

187
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,240
Coming after you

188
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,800
Get ready, false one

189
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,440

00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,580
He has lost his job

385
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:22,060
And now

386
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,800
the end is near

387
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,100
we sit and face

388
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,260
the final curtain

389
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,300
Bob Dobbs

390
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
will kick their rears

391
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,260
their pink bright butts

392
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,580
will soon be hurting

393
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,620
we lived

394
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,700
a life that's full

395
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,840
we didn't go

396
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,120
the pink boy job way

397
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,160
but more

398
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,400
much more than this

399
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,880
we did it

400
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,580
Bob's way

401
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,740
regrets

402
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,440
we had a few

403
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,500
but then again

404
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,760
too few to mention

405
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,760
will cleave

406
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,940
their world

407
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,920
into

408
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,640
and blast off to

409
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,680
the

410
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,280
X dimension

411
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,540
Bob's pipe

412
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,660
is stiff and hard

413
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,640
and it will smite

414
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,400
them here on

415
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,340
X day

416
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,680
he'll

417
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
Pong for us

418
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,740
he'll do it

419
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,880
They're little world

420
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,500
He'll do it

421
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,240
Bob's way

422
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,540
Yes there were

423
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,140
times

424
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,700
You often knew

425
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,880
The pink boys

426
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,280
beat us

427
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,100
black and blue

428
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,080
But through it all

429
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,280
We didn't stop

430
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,860
The pink boy job

431
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,300
We didn't stop

432
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:20,300


433
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:20,620
We didn't stop

434
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,200
We took the pills and smoked the frog

435
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,100
We faced the calm and we moved on

436
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,260
And did it Bob's way

437
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,080
Oh, sure, at times we cry

438
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,860
But they'll be the ones we'll be abusing

439
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,980
Until the last pink boy has died

440
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,500
I'm sure we'll find it quite amusing

441
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,120
To think we'll do all that

442
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,160
From Bangor, Maine

443
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,060
Down to the North

444
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,060


445
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,900
Down to Zimbabwe

446
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,280
Oh, no

447
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,520
Oh, no, not us

448
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:28,560
We'll do it Bob's way

449
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,940
For what is a sub?

450
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,840
What has he got?

451
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,100
If not some slap

452
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,340
Then he has not

453
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,260
To say the thing

454
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,480
He truly feels

455
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,260
And not the words

456
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,500
Of those who kneel

457
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,860
The record shows

458
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,740
We dealt the blows

459
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:09,880
And did it Bob's way

460
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,280
Thank you, brothers and sisters

461
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,180
For coming to the end of the world

462
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,620
And beyond

463
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:31,560
George, let us begin

464
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,620
From the inspiring

465
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:35,620


466
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,040
Follows the recent

467
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,880
or kill me.

468
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,080
This is N-C-N.

469
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,800
Nationalcynical.com

470
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,160
Ah, yes dear friends.

471
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,680
And, uh, we have tried

472
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,660
unsuccessfully to get

473
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,740
lonesome cowboy Dave

474
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,900
on the air.

475
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,620
All the buttons are pushed,

476
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,700
everything is up,

477
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,980
and we cannot hear

478
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,000
the lonesome cowboy.

479
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,900
Some terrible thing

480
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
has happened.

481
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,360
I can't understand,

482
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,600
and I shan't try

483
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,240
any longer.

484
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,940
Because obviously

485
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,480
the conspiracy that they

486
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,300
were talking about

487
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,980
is after us.

488
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,540
In fact, I can hear him

489
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,800
creeping and sneaking

490
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,100
and coming, coming.

491
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:45,800
Was that them?

492
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,340
Outside the station window?

493
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,840
Was that them outside the door?

494
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,480
Was that?

495
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,520
Well, it wasn't

496
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,060
lonesome cowboy Dave,

497
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,340
our special guest.

498
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,140
Who knows, maybe it'll work

499
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,320
if we try again later.

500
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:03,980
All right.

501
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,920
That last song

502
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,300
was the great Reverend

503
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,880
Phineas Narco singing Bob's

504
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:12,880


505
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:12,880


506
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:12,880


507
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,180
Way.

508
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,200
You can get a lot more

509
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,400
of his work, which is not

510
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,420
all subgeniously, but all good,

511
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,220
at nationalcynical.com.

512
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,720
Now let's go back in time

513
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,060
to the beginning of the show,

514
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,640
which almost always starts

515
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,800
with titles by Fernanda Nande,

516
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,520
Lee Murr.

517
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,840
And then there was a kind

518
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,600
of a touching, slightly off-key

519
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,080
song, which we call Bob Cleave.

520
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,480
That was me at age...

521
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,860
I don't know.

522
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:42,860


523
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:42,860


524
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:42,860


525
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,020
27 or 28.

526
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,520
Hellswammy Satellite Weavers

527
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,920
was playing violin on that,

528
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,320
and I believe Sterno was on guitar,

529
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,820
and it was recorded in a warehouse.

530
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,680
I remember that.

531
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,520
Radiate Some Slack,

532
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,980
the bluegrass song,

533
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,560
was by the Mutant Mountain Boys,

534
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,560
recorded live at X Day

535
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,780
two years ago, I think.

536
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,380
The British fellow singing

537
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,980
Too Much Is Always Better

538
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,660
But Not Enough, that was Max Slack.

539
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,880
The Crazy.

540
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,440
The Crazy.

541
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,160
That was the...

542
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,480
G-O-P song,

543
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,120
with very bizarre instrumentality.

544
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,540
Accent on the mentality.

545
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,240
Was by the Psycho Skeletons.

546
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,180
There was a little mashup by Lee Murr.

547
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,200
Oh, and the song Too Pink,

548
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,460
a rather elaborate song

549
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,400
with a lot of mixing,

550
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,900
that was Monkey Hive.

551
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,620
Reverend Fister Gag Hole,

552
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,160
the late Reverend Fister Gag Hole,

553
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:47,740
and the current Reverend Frodus Suds Peshaw.

554
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,120
The techno music was by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

555
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,920
And luckily, I have something important to read tonight.

556
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,960
It is, in fact, a prayer for urinating by.

557
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,140
And it's actually the two guys involved with this little dialogue

558
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:17,360
are a couple of gentlemen who have been lucky enough to survive kidney stones.

559
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:25,360
And since this novel, Confusion, by Neal Stephenson, takes place around 1693,

560
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,240
they were really lucky to survive kidney stones

561
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,000
because that often killed people in those days

562
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,940
and it makes people today feel like they're dying.

563
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,240
Oh, what did Dave say?

564
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,980
Well, he'll try again in five minutes and see if we can get through.

565
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,700
Okay. Well, if I see that light blink, then we can try.

566
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,360
But if I don't, I can't.

567
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,680
Anyway, here it is.

568
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,060
These two old Englishmen, and I'm not going to try to do their accents,

569
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:06,280
are outdoors getting ready to urinate.

570
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,820
And suddenly the older one goes,

571
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,980
Right. Now, on your knees, Mr. Waterhouse.

572
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,300
I beg your pardon.

573
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,740
Never fear. I will be joining you in moments.

574
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,060
My knees, being older, work slower.

575
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,820
Okay. Now, let us pray.

576
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,860
You always say a prayer after you urinate?

577
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,580
Only after a really first-rate one.

578
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,320
Or when communing with a fellow sufferer, as now.

579
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,740
Lord of the universe, you're a humble servant.

580
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,500
As you may have thought, we ask that old Samuel Pepys and Daniel Waterhouse pray

581
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:46,840
that you shall bless and keep the soul of the late bishop of Chester John Wilkins,

582
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,800
who, wanting no further purification in the kidney of the world,

583
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,700
went to your keeping 20 years since.

584
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,960
And we give praise and thanks to you for having given us the rational faculties

585
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,600
by which the procedure of lithotomy was invented, enabling us,

586
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,620
who are further from perfection,

587
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:11,800
to endure longer in this world, urinating freely as the occasion warrants.

588
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,520
Let our urine streams gleaming and scintillating in the sun's radiance

589
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,580
as they pursue their parabolic trajectories earthward

590
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,600
be as an outward and visible sign of your grace,

591
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,480
even as the knobby stones hidden in our coat pockets remind us

592
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,820
that we are all earth and that we are sinners.

593
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,400
Do you have anything to add, Mr. Waterhouse?

594
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,960
Only amen. Amen.

595
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,900
Damn me, I'm late for my next conspiracy.

596
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,700
Godspeed, Daniel.

597
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,380
And friends, as Hobbes said in Leviathan,

598
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,100
for the understanding is by the flame of the passions,

599
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,180
never enlightened but dazzled.

600
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,560
So, friends, here we sit.

601
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,520
Broken-hearted.

602
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,440
Expecting Dave, but instead we got carted.

603
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,240
That's for the monster hunters out there.

604
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,900
You know, it's interesting, my music stopped playing.

605
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,020
Oh, it's not on continuous, you see.

606
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,460
Play mode has to say can't, not sing.

607
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,580
But I can put on something else here, I think.

608
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,540
I guess, I guess we'll...

609
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,980
Just have to give up on our lonesome co-host.

610
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,000
In one more minute he shall call and we can try again

611
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,440
and see if we can gather his call and put it over the airwaves.

612
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,480
Well, one minute.

613
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,960
Also, we're doing this in a scientifical manor.

614
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,840
Or manor. Manure, I mean.

615
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,520
I'm sorry.

616
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,920
Manour, yes.

617
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,480
Reading those Englishmen in English makes me want to be all full of English.

618
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,520
You know, yeah.

619
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,140
But you know, friends, these pinks nowadays,

620
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,320
the mediocrity mentality, dull and sluggish,

621
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,760
about everything else is endlessly creative

622
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,020
when it comes to finding new ways to consume, to digest,

623
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:26,180
to transform whole continents into toxic Earthman excreta.

624
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,180
When we look at all that the Bob-danged Nagians

625
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,640
and the human income poops have built

626
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,600
and see incredible levels of...

627
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,760
what might once have passed for talent

628
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,900
instead dedicated to building an ever-growing alibi for pinkness,

629
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,960
just to keep themselves from becoming suicidally depressed,

630
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,980
they have to keep themselves in constant, unceasing denial.

631
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,720
They have to believe themselves incredibly smart and lucky

632
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,380
and see us as just the opposite.

633
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,540
What to them is natural, like working for a living,

634
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,600
is to us completely ass-sucking.

635
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,780
It's hard for us to imagine being so rigidly locked into such fossilized,

636
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,180
monotonous behavior patterns,

637
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,500
and it's natural that we speculate.

638
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,840
Oh, the normals can't really be that bad.

639
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,400
Nobody could be.

640
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,240
It's got to be us that's crazy.

641
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,620
But that's giving the pink way too much credit.

642
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,920
And possibly, possibly, lonesome cowboy Dave.

643
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,120
Yes, I hope you can hear me,

644
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,480
because I heard the spirits were avenging you tonight.

645
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,560
Oh, yeah, this time we can.

646
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,340
Praise Dobbs!

647
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,860
I don't know what the problem was,

648
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,180
but it'll be fixed for the next DJ down the line, I suppose.

649
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,920
Don't you think?

650
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,740
Well, in your youth, you were a master carpenter,

651
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,620
an ex-barker, and an exponent of...

652
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,980
You were good with all kinds of studio equipment.

653
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,220
I mean...

654
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,540
Oh, yeah?

655
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,940
Well, I thought you...

656
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,880
You can do stuff like that.

657
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,460
No, I can't.

658
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,740
No, actually, no, it's not my studio.

659
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,100
I'm only in here once a week.

660
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,540
You know, if one tiny atom is changed,

661
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,200
that creates a whole new universe,

662
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,560
and everybody goes crazy!

663
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,940
If one impish child were to vomit on the console,

664
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,500
that would be the end of programming for three weeks,

665
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,360
and no one would care.

666
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,620
He's not petting.

667
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:33,960
I'm, uh...

668
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,100
We're waiting for that.

669
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,000
We're waiting for that child any minute now.

670
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,180
Oh, wait, no, he did...

671
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,800
Oh, no, we're not.

672
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,900
Dave did call in.

673
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,100
Okay, everything's fine.

674
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,240
Everything's fine.

675
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,280
Recording?

676
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,800
Everything's going fine.

677
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,080
No trouble.

678
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,820
We got our Dave on.

679
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,980
Were you referring to the next compatriot

680
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,880
as a self-born child of light,

681
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,060
as he's going around in many of these alternative cults,

682
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,140
which have sprung up across, uh, North America?

683
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,000
No, no, no.

684
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,100
I don't know.

685
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,100


686
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,100


687
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,100


688
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,100


689
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,100


690
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,060
I don't care.

691
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,720
Alternative cults?

692
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,700
Those are other cults.

693
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,380
You mean those little, those little cults,

694
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,100
like, uh, um...

695
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,360
The Muslimics, the Christians, the, the, the...

696
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,940
Uh, Hindus and so forth.

697
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,500
The wall of tooth retardants.

698
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,240
Yeah, those are...

699
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,480
The sharks.

700
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,100
Those are small cults compared to the all-encompassing

701
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,940
Church of the Subgenius,

702
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,280
which no one knows they've joined yet.

703
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,260
Outside of maybe...

704
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,540
Has bigger bosoms, too.

705
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,340
Sorry.

706
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,620
Actually, about 50,000 people have joined

707
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,080
the Church of the Subgenius, very, very roughly.

708
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,400
Well, that's like a small nation,

709
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,720
like the Grand Duchy of...

710
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,480
What's the name that Peter Sellers was in

711
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,460
when they declared war on the world, or...

712
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,540
The Mouse That Roared.

713
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,000
The Mouse That Roared.

714
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,080
Yeah, we're the mouse that, that, uh, roared

715
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,200
when its tail was stuck in the trap

716
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,040
and the cat heard it and came.

717
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,180
But, uh...

718
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,340
Well, yeah, Church of the Subgenius,

719
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,160
if you think about it, it's a lot bigger than

720
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,480
say, Heaven's Gate,

721
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,920
and has more functioning testicles.

722
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,060
Well, that's what I was thinking.

723
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,180
I know of at least one.

724
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,040
Yeah.

725
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,800
And, uh, there was, uh...

726
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,140
What was that other cool cult?

727
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,220
Oh, the People's Temple.

728
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,120
Now, they had like 900 people,

729
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,260
but they all died.

730
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,080
No, that was the Tito Temple.

731
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,780
The Tito Temple didn't stand for anything

732
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,860
that they stand for.

733
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,280
And besides, you're dealing with a bunch of

734
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,140
renegade youth who are like impassioned,

735
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,780
impassioned with us.

736
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,940
You know, their minds are twisted,

737
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,600
really, really twisted really bad

738
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,040
because they're overmediated.

739
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,140
And they lust for things like this.

740
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,540
And you play, you, you pot,

741
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,540
well, you, um, you opened a new can of tuna fish.

742
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,560
Well, passion, passion, uh, dazzles

743
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,680
enlightenment and understanding.

744
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,980
You see, that's the...

745
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,540
And also, they can't read, uh...

746
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,740
Well, not only can they not read cursive,

747
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,060
now they can't read anything that's got

748
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,520
uppercase letters in it.

749
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,620
Have you noticed that?

750
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,200
It's, it's a violent dichotomy.

751
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,040
I mean, uh, they try to...

752
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,720
I've seen these kids write, try to write

753
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,740
cursive and stuff, and they use, like,

754
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,760
their hands like if you were, uh, you know,

755
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,100
an ice pick on tearing down an ice block

756
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,020
or something like that.

757
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,940
It's like, no, no, no, and then you have

758
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,260
to smack their hand with a ruler.

759
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,080
And then the next thing you know,

760
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,160
your bosom is cold like a cancer fish.

761
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,760
The queen-aged werewolf.

762
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,020
You're just making all this stuff up.

763
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,880
Kids don't even know what cursive is.

764
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,560
They're not taught that.

765
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,420
They don't know what it is.

766
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,380
They look at it and they...

767
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,900
I mean, what they go, and I quote,

768
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,080
what language is this?

769
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,660
The document they're examining is called

770
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,080
the Declaration of Independence.

771
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,280
What I would like to know is,

772
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,940
how are those young people supposed to sign

773
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,700
contracts when they grow up?

774
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,260
They don't do it at all.

775
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,420
That's what lawyers are for.

776
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:01,920
With passwords.

777
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,820
Huh?

778
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,320
Well, yeah.

779
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,600
Well, no, that's what passwords are for.

780
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,260
They'll sign documents with a,

781
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,660
an encrypted form they've been given

782
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,700
and stuff, and that will, it's the same way,

783
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,680
it's the basis for when you sign online.

784
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,940
Oh, that's the way, they'll have babies

785
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,880
in the future, encrypted little packets

786
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,120
of sperm delivered through email

787
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,200
through the...

788
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,180
mmm, egg sac.

789
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,660
Or nanotubes, or nanotubes,

790
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,580
which are more popular in Europe right now.

791
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,220
And then you have to unstuff the baby,

792
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,160
or unzip the baby.

793
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,220
The baby is not so much born as unzipped,

794
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,080
decant, decompressed after transmission

795
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,640
of the codes.

796
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,240
Yeah, it's like Schrodinger's baby.

797
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,560
You know, you never can tell until you open up

798
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,140
the baby's crib and start to...

799
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,480
to wonder what...

800
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,060
Is it a boy or a girl?

801
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,740
Is it a human or a subgenius?

802
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,100
Yeah, my concern exactly is they're kind of

803
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,540
a hard species to define.

804
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,520
And you just don't expect just an ordinary bald head

805
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,520
and a little tweeny ween or a little tweeny

806
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,080
to determine anything.

807
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,520
And some of them don't have any kind of business

808
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,960
like heads with one of those huge machines

809
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,720
you were talking about inserting in the back

810
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,820
of your skull. I forgot.

811
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,900
Well, the children...

812
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,100
Bob predicted, and well, it's not a prediction

813
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,840
when it comes from Bob, it's gonna happen.

814
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,260
The children of the future, if the subgenius church

815
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,900
does not triumph, if the conspiracy wins,

816
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,440
the children of the future will be born...

817
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,860
They'll have giant heads and long...

818
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,040
six long fingers, but they will have no genitals.

819
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,180
Whereas if the church of the subgenius wins,

820
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,800
one million years from now, the kids of the future

821
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,620
will be nothing but...

822
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:53,760
Christ Bob.

823
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,760
Thank you, Reverend Ivan Strang,

824
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,720
for that enlightening comment.

825
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,380
The human body, let's recap, the human body

826
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,660
becomes nothing more than a giant genital organ.

827
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,260
That's under Bob.

828
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,420
It may cause Bob to sleep uncomfortably at times,

829
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,560
being under him, and he's like the princess and the pea.

830
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,180
Here we are back to peas again.

831
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Hi, Reverend Peas, by the way.

832
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:23,740
It's Peas.

833
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,700
Peas all the way down.

834
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,420
I hope, yeah, we were, it was, have it,

835
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,820
we did a urination prayer earlier today,

836
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,460
if you missed it, because you were on the phone.

837
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,260
Oh, man, I hate, and then I have to go right afterwards,

838
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,320
which I was kind of hoping for.

839
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,640
All he was saying is give peas a chance.

840
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,980
Right, but not to call in.

841
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,460
No, we don't want him to call in.

842
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,240
That's the last thing we want peas to do is call in.

843
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,140
Okay.

844
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,260
I'm so mean.

845
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,580
What army of garden monkeys destroyed your communication systems?

846
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,980
Well, I was gonna ask,

847
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,720
I was gonna expect kind of like a Jetsons versus,

848
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,820
that's the new dichotomy, by the way,

849
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,340
Jetsons versus Flintstones.

850
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,400
That's new?

851
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,880
I mean, no, it's old,

852
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,640
but you hear all these media people like so glibly saying this old thing

853
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,800
that makes you want to kill them.

854
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,420
No, not, that's, I can't say that word.

855
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,340
Makes you want to throttle them with a gigantic rubber chicken.

856
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,640
Okay? Okay.

857
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,220
What, the old people? Because they don't, what? No.

858
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,200
No, no, no, no.

859
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,320
I got lost there, Dave, lost.

860
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,940
No, I think you got lost there in 1937 under the Fuhrer there for a moment.

861
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,600
I'm not talking about elderly people.

862
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,800
I'm talking about psychotic, what do they call them?

863
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:41,640
The big smokers, the people, you know, the capitalist imperialists.

864
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,820
No, what's the other word?

865
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,660
Fat cats?

866
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,360
Golfers.

867
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,540
Golfers?

868
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:46,980
Golfers.

869
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,080
The ones who can't really play golf?

870
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,780
The ones who can't really spend all their time playing golf?

871
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,280
Dave's digging himself a deeper and deeper hole.

872
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,660
I know, I feel that way.

873
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,280
Once he's started, he has to continue,

874
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,040
but those golfers are going to come after him.

875
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,680
It's already gone out over the air, Dave.

876
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:07,240
There's going to be golfers looking to launch your head, buddy.

877
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,540
I'm already in Timber's fear of anarcho-patriotic news.

878
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,040
I wouldn't worry about it, Dave.

879
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,280
I'm looking at a headline on Yahoo News on the little computer screen in front of me

880
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,560
that's just random headline.

881
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:26,940
Is Jeb Bush already the next Mitt Romney?

882
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,400
What kind of a question is that?

883
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,780
That's a loaded question, I would say.

884
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
Locked and loaded.

885
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,380
Very astute.

886
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,960
You understand rhetoric, compadre.

887
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,540
Just like saying, is Hillary Clinton already the next Bill Clinton?

888
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,260
It's beyond posing the question that doesn't exist at all.

889
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,860
It's way beyond it.

890
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,360
Right.

891
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,820
Yeah, I don't think that that's fair to either Bush or Romney.

892
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,220
But on the other hand, I don't really care.

893
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,000
And they probably deserve whatever they get.

894
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,160
In fact, everybody deserves whatever they get by definition.

895
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,540
That's what God said.

896
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,920
God said it.

897
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,720
I smoked it.

898
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,520
That settles it.

899
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,020
Wait a minute.

900
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:09,700
That's not...

901
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,440
Wait a minute.

902
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,280
That's the reggae version.

903
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,160
I can hear you.

904
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,840
Mr. Stank.

905
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,240
Is it all right to call you Mr. Stank?

906
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:19,240


907
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:19,240


908
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,580
Mr. Stank?

909
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,440
I mean, may I?

910
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,820
That's Reverend Stank.

911
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,060
Mr. Reverend Stank.

912
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:36,180
Well, the first thing I wanted to ask you is relative to curse avoiding, I think children

913
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:46,020
who do not know how to sign their names, as their nostrils in the same direction as

914
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:46,460
the...

915
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,780
What are they called then?

916
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,040
In the Big River.

917
00:45:51,440 --> 00:46:00,280
Well, there is evidence that children, especially those born in the late 1940s and early 1950s,

918
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:06,920
were exposed to toxic chemicals that make them talk the way you do, Dave.

919
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,540
You just did.

920
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,500
I think.

921
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,940
They just blow off nuclear plants every five...

922
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:18,760
Like they blow up a nuclear device in your backyard and stuff, and you don't know how

923
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:31,280
And you'd be told that if you were to go under a desk and look upward at the many radio personalities that are making millions of dollars per week, I don't know what the content is.

924
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:41,340
But just recently, I was listening to one of these people on the radio who said to you that you were an inspiration in his career.

925
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,100
And he also got the negative land guys on there and stuff.

926
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:49,160
Well, the other day, you get off this Clyde Lewis thing.

927
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:54,320
I don't care what Clyde Lewis says about you, me or indifferent.

928
00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:04,980
Well, no, it's just a big thing that he was purporting that aliens were coming to get us and take some to some of us be taken away successfully.

929
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,040
He said, where will you be on X-Day?

930
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,300
And I thought you might want to know that.

931
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,180
Huh?

932
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:14,980
Yeah.

933
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:15,240
Yeah.

934
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:15,460
Yeah.

935
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,500
But everybody does that, Dave.

936
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:18,840
They do?

937
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:19,300
Yeah.

938
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:19,740
Yeah.

939
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:29,560
If you'd listen to something else besides Clyde Lewis, you'd hear that Rush Limbaugh is asking people about, are you ready for X-Day?

940
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:38,520
And, you know, I mean, Jon Stewart talks about X-Day constantly.

941
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,480
What?

942
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,080
I was talking.

943
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,000
I didn't hear you talk.

944
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,860
No, I'm just saying.

945
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,780
Do you mean?

946
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,300
It's just a happy phrase that you borrowed?

947
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,040
No, they're all ripping off the Church of the Subgenius.

948
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,380
That's what we're here for.

949
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:53,760
Oh, OK.

950
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,540
OK, OK.

951
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,000
For rich idiots to copy our concepts and turn them into.

952
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,640
God only knows what.

953
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,360
I don't even.

954
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,340
I've lost interest.

955
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,520
I'd rather be playing Minecraft.

956
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,260
You can promise you.

957
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,040
I understand you very well now what you are saying.

958
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,960
You are sick of being.

959
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,620
The entire thing you make you want to evacuate your self.

960
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:29,520
What I want to know is what is it that you think that someone can eat or take that will make them talk like Dave?

961
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,700
I don't understand this.

962
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,880
Can you explain?

963
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,040
It was the nucleus testing in the 40s and 50s.

964
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:43,860
The spread nucleus radiation all over and affected the nucleus in ourselves and made Dave talk the way he does.

965
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,260
and it makes us listen to it the way we do.

966
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,000
Oh, thank you very much.

967
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,560
It's poisoning, basically.

968
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,040
Thank you.

969
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,860
It's a type of brain, soul, body poisoning.

970
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,280
But it makes us immune to further poisoning.

971
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,420
Strength through disfigurement, Brother Cleve called it.

972
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:09,620
And, you know, so that's why the more vile chemicals you pour into yourself on purpose,

973
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:14,460
the less the ones that you intake accidentally will hurt you.

974
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,520
So it's like vaccines, you know.

975
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,600
Sure, they cause autism, but at least you won't get a cold.

976
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,840
It's beautiful.

977
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,760
That's the beauty part.

978
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,820
That's what they used to say in sales, and Bob said it many, many times.

979
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,620
That's the beauty part.

980
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,980
But that must be what all the young people are disfiguring themselves for,

981
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,700
is for strength, then, to pierce and to tattoo.

982
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,440
It's just for strength, right?

983
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:38,980
No.

984
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:39,600
That's so...

985
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,400
So they can get laid.

986
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,040
Oh.

987
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,020
Same reason I had long hair when I was a kid.

988
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:44,860
Oh, I see.

989
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,080
You know, same reason you wore mini skirts.

990
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,440
But you didn't have to.

991
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:55,720
Us boys had to do ridiculous things, like have long hair, or shave our hair off,

992
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:00,960
or poke rings in our faces to show how whatever we are.

993
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,480
Hell, I know what it's to show.

994
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:07,860
You go to the mall and spend $500 to prove, to become so outlandish looking,

995
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,520
that it proves to everyone that...

996
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,740
You don't care what you look like.

997
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,200
That's how cool you are.

998
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,620
In my tribe, we used to have to have our ears, our earlobes bald.

999
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,500
And that is painful.

1000
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,760
Like, if you're like a nine-year-old child and stuff,

1001
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,080
hey, you want to grow up and be a man, don't you?

1002
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,260
Just give me that earlobe, buddy.

1003
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,840
Just hand it right over here.

1004
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,960
And then they put their fat little hands underneath your earlobe

1005
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,160
and take one of them long sticks.

1006
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,980
It'll be like, you know, some Indian tribe in South America

1007
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,380
that you never really heard of.

1008
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,280
But, you know, it's like baking soda.

1009
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,220
You know, people have talked about it.

1010
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,300
You don't know if it really exists.

1011
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:52,220
Hey, I read once an anthropologist's description of kissing a Yubangi

1012
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,840
or one of those types of people in Africa

1013
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,240
that enlarge their lips using discs.

1014
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,100
They, you know, ever-increasing discs.

1015
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,180
They have the giant plate lips that kind of look almost duck-like.

1016
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,020
Looks crazy to us.

1017
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,960
But in that culture, it's a mark of beauty.

1018
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:20,240
Anyway, this anthropologist was saying goodbye to her African friends in this tribe.

1019
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:25,580
And her buddy had taken, didn't have the lip discs on.

1020
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,560
So the lips were hanging down.

1021
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:34,140
And she said it felt like pressing her own lips

1022
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,220
against sort of a warm bowl of mush.

1023
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,560
Whereas now, if you had your lip discs in,

1024
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,100
they'd kind of be clackety-clack-clack.

1025
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:45,660
And would seem...

1026
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,620
If you had your lip discs in,

1027
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,080
if you had your neck rings on,

1028
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,020
if you had your Prince Albert ladder running up all the way, yeah.

1029
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,920
Pope Sternodocs, why did that man bifurcate his penis like that?

1030
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,900
Because he's a dumb idiot, that's why.

1031
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,680
That's a quote, only I cleaned it up a little bit.

1032
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,720
It was slightly altered.

1033
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:13,260
Yeah.

1034
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,140
Oh, yeah.

1035
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,120
For broadcast purposes.

1036
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,520
I can't wait to get slightly altered myself.

1037
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,140
Oh, pardon me?

1038
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:20,940
What was that again, Dave?

1039
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,740
No, I was just saying...

1040
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,120
No, no, you.

1041
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:23,560
You first.

1042
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,760
No, you.

1043
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,240
I insist.

1044
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:26,960
No, you.

1045
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,060
Indubitably.

1046
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,040
Inevitably.

1047
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:29,220
Go.

1048
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,700
Oh, no, you first.

1049
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,740
My bifurcation of the penis.

1050
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,660
It's really, really, really weird to see.

1051
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:36,960
I'm sorry.

1052
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:37,420
I'm done.

1053
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,840
Do some people...

1054
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,000
Pay extra for that.

1055
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,160
At the mall.

1056
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,480
You can probably get that done at the mall to prove you're cool.

1057
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,800
I don't even have one, and that sounds so painful just to think of.

1058
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,200
No, no, no.

1059
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,260
A thousand times no.

1060
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:57,160
There's already a bunch of bifurcation going on, but let's not go into that right now.

1061
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,200
Right.

1062
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:04,460
Because we had previously talked about self-immolation, and you, Princess Weave, were the victim who

1063
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,340
brought it up yourself.

1064
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,020
You introduced it into the conversation.

1065
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:08,940
Yeah, way to go, man.

1066
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,940
Smooth move, ex-lax.

1067
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,200
Okay, I'm bummed.

1068
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,860
I'm bummed.

1069
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,720
I didn't mean to.

1070
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,680
I didn't mean to.

1071
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,260
That's...

1072
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,560
I'm totes bummed.

1073
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,800
I'm totes bummed.

1074
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,740
You harshed my mellow.

1075
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,140
You marshed my hello.

1076
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,900
Oh, gosh, my jello.

1077
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:32,440
Huh?

1078
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,260
No, I'm sorry.

1079
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,600
I've got Hal's disease.

1080
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,280
I'm sorry.

1081
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,400
No, I...

1082
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,160
No, I'm sorry.

1083
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:38,420
I'm sorry.

1084
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:39,500
No, no, no.

1085
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,180
No, I'm sorry.

1086
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,020
I'm sorry.

1087
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,900
I'm sorry, my friend.

1088
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,740
I didn't mean to steal your thunder or any other body parts that you're hiding recently.

1089
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,360
Have you heard about...

1090
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,580
Who are these people who tried to destroy your communication system, and why?

1091
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,960
The conspiracy, because they're normal.

1092
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,140
And they...

1093
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:57,820
It's just...

1094
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,800
They don't mean to be that way.

1095
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:00,820
Malicious?

1096
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:01,500
No.

1097
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,580
They're not malicious.

1098
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,460
They just...

1099
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,340
They don't...

1100
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,180
It's the conspiracy that...

1101
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,180
They just don't know any better.

1102
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,140
That doesn't know itself.

1103
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:09,880
Right.

1104
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,280
It's a conspiracy that doesn't know it's a conspiracy.

1105
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,220
Jeez.

1106
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,360
You know, we've been there.

1107
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,080
We've done that.

1108
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,320
Yeah, right.

1109
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,080
Yeah, sure.

1110
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,540
Or maybe it's just a...

1111
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,280
It could possibly...

1112
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,700
Now, could a subgenius screw up?

1113
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,280
Oh, I don't know.

1114
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,580
If a...

1115
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:37,740
Actually, Dave, if a subgenius is true to Bob, the closer he is to Bob, the closer he is to Bob.

1116
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:52,640
The harder it is for him to do anything but screw up, and yet, that is just what gets him ahead of the pink boy, the normal, the normally worm, the human, you know, the mediocrity, the Barbies, the Kins, the...

1117
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:53,760
Hmm.

1118
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,540
You know, the red...

1119
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,120
The red tards, the...

1120
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,140
Yes.

1121
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,280
The yo-yos, the...

1122
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,840
From what I understand...

1123
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,300
If I run out of slurs...

1124
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:04,620
The blibniacs.

1125
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,940
Yeah, the blibniacs.

1126
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,720
The Bob Dang's nabians.

1127
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:08,660
Right.

1128
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,920
Well, that's such name-calling.

1129
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:18,440
You've just disproven your own entire theory by the lack of your rhetoric on the tail end of the project.

1130
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:26,580
You were supposed to say something about how those things don't really matter because you build a strong argument, and then you said,

1131
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:31,400
it's like them, and it's like this other, and you just totally threw me off there.

1132
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:38,160
Well, Dave, you know, as it says here, sometimes our less confident fellow subgeni feel vexed.

1133
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:38,380
Are you assuming that likes me, they're not some kind of imp resolutionist and false progressivesautisticon at all?

1134
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:38,380


1135
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:38,380


1136
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:38,380


1137
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:38,380


1138
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:38,380


1139
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:38,380


1140
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:43,720
Sometimes I know that people at the bottom are, like, unfaithful and, frankly, guilty because they have the fairness to wonder if maybe the Pinks aren't right.

1141
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,820
And we're just reminding you, friends, they aren't.

1142
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,140
There are simply more of them.

1143
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:54,460
It's best to look at them as an unfortunate fact of life, a force of nature like drought.

1144
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:59,400
You have to deal with it, a time- chann curios, in際 shore exercise or other school prebund 순n�로ff-,

1145
00:55:59,400 --> 00:55:59,940
Well, I'm whĩc it.

1146
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,940
What?

1147
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,240
Discordian philosophy?

1148
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,780
Discordant.

1149
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,880
Discordant, yes.

1150
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:12,780
Well, maybe.

1151
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,560
Hail Eric.

1152
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:16,140
Yeah.

1153
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,540
I won't.

1154
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,340
Exeter, the Elephant Man, yes.

1155
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,500
Elephant Man from Planet Mutata.

1156
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:38,780
No way.

1157
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,160
And you know these people, right?

1158
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,680
I mean, that's what you're trying to do.

1159
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,740
No, I just saw movies about it.

1160
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,220
I don't know these kind of people.

1161
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,680
I just watch TV like everybody else.

1162
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:54,140
That could be, because contrary to what, where would you be on Exeter?

1163
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,620
I'm like, these many people are quoting you.

1164
00:56:59,160 --> 00:56:59,920
I'll probably...

1165
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:03,400
I'll probably be in the bathroom on X-Day while they're all quoting me.

1166
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,460
But I'll be where I'm happy.

1167
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,920
I'm going to be in extra meditation.

1168
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,920
I'll be at one with the Bob inside me,

1169
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:19,700
and I'll be letting Bob and his little brown brothers out with expedience, I hope.

1170
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,520
Without a struggle, we would hope.

1171
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,180
One would hope.

1172
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,560
What a strange delusion.

1173
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,380
I mean, you are fabricating.

1174
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,000
You've lost your mind.

1175
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:36,980
If you think the most important thing in the world is to extra meditate on Bob,

1176
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,380
well, extra...

1177
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,000
It's not the most important thing in the world.

1178
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,300
It's the only thing in the world.

1179
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,160
It's all you can do once Bob gets his hooks in your head

1180
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:51,220
and your other hidden organs that you were talking about.

1181
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,120
Well, of course, because that's where they're supposed to be.

1182
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,380
You're not supposed to see them until after X-Day.

1183
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,260
You don't even really get to...

1184
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:06,000
That's another hyperbole that's been tomatoed around like a sturgeon or something.

1185
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,400
Like an old stick in the mud.

1186
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,080
Go ahead and say it.

1187
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,760
Yep, old Stang is just an old stick in the mud.

1188
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,940
I'm not kidding, though.

1189
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,680
I really would rather be playing Minecraft.

1190
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,780
I installed Minecraft thanks to Taphouse.

1191
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,840
Thanks, Taphouse.

1192
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,700
They gave me a free copy.

1193
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,420
Please, Taphouse.

1194
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:29,200
And I started up Minecraft, and I started building a new planet called Glandland.

1195
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:29,680
Glandistan.

1196
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:35,520
And so far, we're working on a replica of Pappy's house,

1197
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,980
only it's like triple size.

1198
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,880
And it has a swimming pool.

1199
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,500
We have a clifftop airy that you can stay in, Dave.

1200
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:50,180
If you end up homeless, you can stay in our Minecraft castle.

1201
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,000
And Reverend Stang built a stairway to heaven.

1202
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:53,740
Yeah, yeah.

1203
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,860
I actually built...

1204
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:58,260
That took hours, because it's really like a quarter of a mile long.

1205
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:58,800
Oh, I know.

1206
00:58:59,260 --> 00:58:59,340
It's hot.

1207
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,440
I know.

1208
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,200
Quarter of a mile high, and it's got little torches all along the way, so at night it's lit up.

1209
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,180
But it does look like it goes all the way to heaven.

1210
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,160
It goes up to the clouds anyway.

1211
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:12,600
A little bit of a tiki motif going along with the old man's house.

1212
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,180
Yeah.

1213
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,040
And some other really cool things and stuff.

1214
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:15,600
Yeah, yeah.

1215
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,600
And you're going to turn into a bed and breakfast, and you're going to retire and write a novel

1216
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,680
about having to deal with all these crazy people for 30 years.

1217
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,480
Actually, it's more a Nordic style than tiki.

1218
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,220
It's more the Nordic style of structure.

1219
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:34,120
Lots of wood and stone and angular things going on.

1220
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:37,720
Well, yeah, because that's not all you have in Minecraft is wood.

1221
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,440
But then that's all you have in real life.

1222
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,540
You know, rock and stick.

1223
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,160
Except that's not true.

1224
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,960
You see, back in the day, Chaz and Legume would say,

1225
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,760
everything's rock or stick.

1226
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:49,940
Think about it.

1227
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:54,520
Well, I did think about it, and there are other things made of beasts.

1228
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,960
There's rock, stick, and then there's bone and skin.

1229
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:05,460
Like, in front of me at this radio station, there's a couple of books in front of me.

1230
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,040
Well, they're made of stick, mostly.

1231
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:10,400
The ink is made from some form of mineral or rock.

1232
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:17,340
The mix board is almost solid rock-derived or non-living things.

1233
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,700
You know, petroleum products and stuff.

1234
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:20,860
Petrochemicals, yes.

1235
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:26,740
But then Princess Wee's jacket looks like it might be made of the skin of some beast.

1236
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,140
Indeed it is.

1237
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:28,920
Yes, it is.

1238
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:29,440
Oh, yes.

1239
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,460
Is it really a beast?

1240
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,680
You're wearing a beast?

1241
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:34,060
You're going to go to vegan hell, Princess Wee.

1242
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,180
It's fine with me.

1243
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,060
Coat is warm.

1244
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:36,960
I'm wearing it.

1245
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,900
So anyway, you know, it's rock, stick, and bone.

1246
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:46,040
Or flesh, meat, whatever.

1247
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,580
Friends, you've been listening to the Subgenius Hour of Slack

1248
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,540
from the Church of the Subgenius.

1249
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:56,620
For more information, you can write to or look at or something, subgenius.com.

1250
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,240
Or just type subgenius.

1251
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,280
Subgenius in a computer, and you'll see.

1252
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,280
And then you'll be sorry.

1253
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,480
But.

1254
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:04,980
Definitely.

1255
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:12,240
Now, this is where we fade out and end the show for other radio stations.

1256
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,200
But for the internet listeners, this is where we leave the show going

1257
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:21,520
until Dr. Sinister gets here, which lately couldn't mean any old time.

1258
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,740
He just pulled in.

1259
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:24,400
Oh, did he?

1260
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,560
Princess Wee's looking at the interocitor there.

1261
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,640
I'm monitoring the interocitor.

1262
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,060
Exeter's interocitor.

1263
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:29,400
Exeter.

1264
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,400
And so we had a bit.

1265
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,440
So internet listeners and Dave, we have an extra five minutes on the show.

1266
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:36,820
Yo!

1267
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,060
So what do we do with this valuable air time?

1268
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,140
We've wasted the last hour.

1269
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,700
Good truth.

1270
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:50,140
You mean on WCSB 89.3 in Cleveland?

1271
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:50,360
That's right.

1272
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:56,400
Here at WCSB Cleveland, we have done what we had to do.

1273
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:57,660
Yeesh.

1274
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:58,820
Although.

1275
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:59,040
Although.

1276
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:02,660
The best of our seeds, our alacrity, our little.

1277
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,380
We gave our best.

1278
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,900
We did everything we could.

1279
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,060
And now it's too late.

1280
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:10,800
Oh, man.

1281
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,740
Man, the show is just starting to get good.

1282
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,900
And then the next host walks in and ruins everything.

1283
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:17,660
God!

1284
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:22,060
I thought you were referring to like your bowel movements in the middle of the night

1285
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,420
and stuff that you couldn't control.

1286
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,160
You were talking about rabbits or something else.

1287
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:26,480
No, Dave.

1288
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,520
We have to go now.

1289
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:28,460
This.

1290
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,160
This is the end.

1291
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,700
And I'm going to do the fade out like I do.

1292
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,620
It's happening, Dave.

1293
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,520
Dave can't even talk, so they can hear you fade out.

1294
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,060
We're losing you.

1295
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,260
Okay, now I'm going to talk and fade out.

1296
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:50,580
Oh, wait, that wasn't him.

1297
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:51,980
Now he's out.

1298
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:54,460
That was something else.

1299
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,660
And now the music goes away and I go away.

1300
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:07,680
Here's kind of, look at this picture here of Zealandia.

1301
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,020
Ah, there it is, a nice map.

1302
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,480
Yeah, there's the whole Zealandia continent.

1303
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:17,360
And Campbell Plateau, still a sub-aqueous,

1304
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,840
but extending a long way to the south.

1305
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:24,020
The Chatham Rise to the east.

1306
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,920
To the north, the Challenger Plateau,

1307
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,920
named after Professor George Edward Challenger.

1308
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:34,420
And the South Sea Rays, is that what it says?

1309
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,000
The lettering is kind of small.

1310
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,100
My eyes aren't very good.

1311
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,220
It's a movie that Professor Challenger was in.

1312
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,060
Well, The Lost World.

1313
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,760
But there was more that he did than just discover a prehistoric plateau

1314
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,360
where dinosaurs still lived.

1315
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,920
He also discovered that the Earth itself was one living organism.

1316
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,060
And he...

1317
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:59,460
He did that by irritating it with a probe, an underground probe.

1318
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,440
And what else did he do?

1319
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,840
He discovered the Earth.

1320
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,880
Do you like to irritate the Earth, Dr. Howell?

1321
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,220
No, I don't.

1322
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:10,000
I'm, since I'm essentially like a microbe or a free surface.

1323
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,820
Challenger, that's just the way he was.

1324
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,940
He tickled it and created huge earthquakes and things.

1325
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,420
But, but, uh, and what else did he do?

1326
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:21,800
He's tickling it right now.

1327
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,320
With my little finger.

1328
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,360
Another story about Challenger that was written by A. Conan Doyle

1329
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,280
was the disintegration machine.

1330
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,880
Where not Challenger, but another mad scientist

1331
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,700
demonstrated his machine that would disintegrate anything.

1332
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:41,500
And, uh, he also was a nasty character.

1333
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:45,700
So Challenger got him to, tricked him into standing in front of it

1334
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,760
and, and pretext of how to operate it,

1335
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,780
he turned it on and disintegrated the guy.

1336
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:54,440
So his horrible machine would never, uh, be able to operate.

1337
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:54,440


1338
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:55,640
And, uh, bother humanity.

1339
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,700
And then he put on his hat and left.

1340
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,480
Ah, that's, uh, what about if we had Professor Challenger

1341
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,800
and Professor Quartermain together in the same story?

1342
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,180
That was done in that, uh, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

1343
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,180
Starfleet to scout ship.

1344
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,540
Please give your position.

1345
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,080
Over.

1346
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,560
I am in orbit around the third planet of star known as Sun.

1347
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:17,100
Over.

1348
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:18,720
May this be Earth.

1349
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:19,260
Over.

1350
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:21,820
Positive.

1351
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,340
It is known to have some form...

1352
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,500
of intelligent species...

1353
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,600
B.O.B.

1354
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:30,040
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1355
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,560
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1356
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:36,380
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1357
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,840
And not just this show, but subgenius.com

1358
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,440
and all the other archive sites.

1359
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:44,920
But if you truly love Bob

1360
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,460
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1361
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,380
you should go to subgenius.com front page

1362
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:53,980
or especially the radio page

1363
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:55,900
or the catalog store pages

1364
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:59,300
and help out financially as best you can.

1365
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:03,660
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty

1366
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:07,280
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1367
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,240
But some of you still have jobs.

1368
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:13,620
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1369
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:17,120
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1370
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,540
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1371
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,940
All we're saying is that...

1372
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:23,200
...

1373
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:28,360
Blowjobs could go the way of Stevejobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1374
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,960
We also take checks and money orders to

1375
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,800
Subgenius Foundation

1376
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:46,300
P.O. Box 181 417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1377
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:51,520
Thanks for anything you can do to help Let There Be Slack.
