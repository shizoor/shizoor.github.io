1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
An ideology that regards itself as non-ideological, that presents itself as the natural center, the very fulcrum of civilized modern life.

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,280
The self-genius power of the self.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,060
This may well be the most powerful and most dangerous ideology we have ever known.

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:30,480
I'm not denying the virtues, far from it. We're all beneficiaries of the cult of the elite.

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,780
But if we deny its dangers and the all-consuming power of its propaganda, then we...

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,720
I bet nobody ever said that to you.

7
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,700
Oh, by the way, Bob, thanks for the aspirin.

8
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:52,040
Hiya, friends. Bob Dogg here, sooner and soper operator of Bob Dogg Dog and Dogg Hotbox.

9
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,040
Bob Dogg's son and foot tires, and that means shoes and mean shoes.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,640
Means industry.

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,120
Yes, there's rain on the streets again, and where there's rain, there's rain-washed streets.

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,740
I ought to know I'm Bob Dogg, high chick, and it's my privilege to put shoes on your best friend just like he was my own son's car.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,780
Here's a pair that'll make the road blush.

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,560
Wide, they're wider than the car, and safety-wrapped before their box is stored forever, and that's a long, long time.

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,280
One second can make the difference, friends, but don't believe me unless you don't care how much it costs.

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,740
And I like that kind of man.

17
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,120
And if you are, you're the kind of man I like.

18
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,740
And I'm going to keep it that way, even if I have to offer you a deal that had to be turned down to be offered to you.

19
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,600
And remember this tomorrow when you're awake.

20
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,620
You don't have to come to Bob Dogg.

21
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,900
You can drive around on lemons, for all I care.

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Like they say, if you live in the water, you don't need a boat.

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,960
But if you do, give me the first chance at its feats, and you'll drive away a happy toe.

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,020
Thanks for looking at me.

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,920
I'm Bob Dogg, and I'll be back.

26
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,640
Well, sir, ma'am, thing.

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,880
This is a pretty...

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:02:02,000
word-heavy episode with new, very old, rare material from the Firesign Theater, as heard just now.

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:19,900
There's also some old-timey ESO swamp radio from the year 2001 that I guarantee is very directly Firesign-inspired, as are most of the subgenius shows.

30
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,740
And we continue.

31
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:33,920
We continue with samples from the soundtrack of Sandy K. Boone's movie, J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, as currently seen on many streaming services.

32
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,480
See dobbstown.org for all current info.

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,060
Indeed, we play that soundtrack now.

34
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,020
Everyone staying?

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,000
Uh-huh.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,640
Another gun.

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,580
We said, you've got a religion.

38
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,600
Now you've got to have the tent revivals.

39
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,940
You know, you can't just say you have a religion.

40
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,960
You have to have this gathering of the faithful.

41
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,280
It was a sad day for mankind.

42
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:06,060
It was a sad day for mankind when man stopped, started sticking with his head and walking on his feet.

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,040
So, God, I'd like it back up.

44
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,480
Oh, yes.

45
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,560
I could feel an emanation.

46
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,840
I could feel an eye just burning into my eye.

47
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,300
I could feel a man staring at me and grinning at me and stretching his eyebrows.

48
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,380
I could feel that man saying he wants a test.

49
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,140
Bob, Bob, Bob!

50
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,640
A divival is a subgenius revival.

51
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,960
It didn't sound good to say revival, you know.

53
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,880
Divival sounds a lot better.

54
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,920
It actually sounds kind of like devil.

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:43,120
They were a way for us to act as if we were rock and roll stars or preachers or something.

56
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,380
Thank you, Bob.

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,420
For closing my memory.

58
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,460
I was the one who was supposed to get up on stage.

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,240
And do stuff.

60
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,220
I actually had terrible stage fright.

61
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,880
I wasn't interested in that at all.

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,080
But a Dallas character who later ended up calling himself Reverend Buck Naked.

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,920
The subgenius thing really clicked with him.

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,280
The worst crime is serving the conspiracy.

65
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,620
And the penalty.

66
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,000
He was ready to get up on stage and preach.

67
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,300
The penalty is worse than having your gonads cut off.

68
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,060
The penalty is worse than having your head cut off.

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,760
Eventually.

70
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,380
I didn't really like the way Buck did it.

71
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,600
And the rest of them were wrong.

72
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,740
And you're the only one that's right.

73
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,720
And that's how you're supposed to feel.

74
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,180
So I started doing it.

75
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,820
Before we start the services, we should have our.

76
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,140
Just a moment of sacred noise.

77
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,120
Thanks to the subgenius thing, I discovered I wasn't alone.

78
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,240
There were weirdos all over the place.

79
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,020
sometimes you had to be together,

80
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,020


81
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,020


82
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,680
There were very normal people who just thought nutty stuff

83
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,560
about the church of the subgenius,

84
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,980
Which made them very easy toóyou know, to relate to and get along with.

85
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,640
I remember seeing all these bands and stuff and I thought,

86
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,800
these guys are loaded. These guys are drunk.

87
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,740
And I saw Doctors for Bob, perform.

88
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,540
for him and I thought these guys are clinically insane.

89
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,160
Anti-music is a concept of unfettered expression

90
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,180
musically and sonically to try to create this sound

91
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,780
that trained hands can't do.

92
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,860
You have to go totally on instinct

93
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,320
and that's what we did with Orchestra of All.

94
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,260
It was kind of this Looney Tunes fraternity

95
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,780
and you had to kind of enjoy guys to be a part of it.

96
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,160
The way that I view the Church of the Self-Genius

97
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,880
is that in a way it is the patriarchy

98
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,080
strained through a cheesecloth.

99
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,700
It was a boys' club and I was attracted to it

100
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,260
because I wanted to meet the boys.

101
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,740
It is finally taking itself by the hair

102
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,840
and turning itself inside out

103
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,520
and looking at the world with fresh eyes.

104
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,000
And that's why I think it's such a special place

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,860
for special people

106
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,240
doing something like this.

107
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,240


108
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,540
Special things happen to special people

109
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,600
and so we help each other out.

110
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,240
I think it was this way of saying

111
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,740
it's them and not you, you know.

112
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,920
Don't you worry if the world or the conspiracy

113
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,000
is getting you down.

114
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,640
You know, you come stand by me

115
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,760
because you're one of ours.

116
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,220
The conspiracy's major effort

117
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,760
is to take your slack away

118
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,100
and to sell you a false version of it

119
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,200
which they manufacture.

120
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,840
Well, I'm afraid we all discovered the conspiracy

121
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,800
probably our first day of school.

122
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,760
When the other kids made fun of you

123
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,940
for using the wrong color crayon

124
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,900
or you're not doing it right.

125
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,660
It was important that we encapsulate

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,160
everybody's best enemy

127
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,560
into something that could be

128
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,300
easily distilled into like one thing.

129
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,500
Something that people could say,

130
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,040
yeah, I understand that.

131
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,780
That's, we're all victims of that, you know.

132
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Anything that bothers you is the conspiracy.

133
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,240
It's a little bit the thing that assassinates you.

134
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,700
It's a little bit the thing that assassinates presidents

135
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,800
from book depository windows.

136
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,420
It's a little bit the suppressed saucer technology

137
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,000
that is owned by the European Union.

138
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,380
But it's also just when it's too hot on the bus.

139
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,900
In 1953, Jehovah One, the alien space god,

140
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,960
informed Bob Dobbs that there was this conspiracy

141
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,780
of normal people robbing the slack

142
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,680
of the subgeniuses for centuries,

143
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,020
but that,

144
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,940
on July 5th, 1998,

145
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,640
at precisely 7 a.m.,

146
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,000
the men from Planet X would come,

147
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,160
rupture up the dues-paying, believing subgeniuses

148
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,640
and give them the power to wreak revenge

149
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,940
on all the normals.

150
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,080
Next thing you know,

151
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,500
you've got the doctrine for an entire religion.

152
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,140
Oh, yes!

153
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,900
Bob can set free the winos!

154
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,180
He can set free the prisoners!

155
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,020
Do we have any more testimonials from the crowd?

156
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,640
Woo!

157
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,900
I found the image of Bob's head in a bedpan,

158
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,100
and ever since, you know, it's just been Bob all the way.

159
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,300
Saved by the image of Bob in a bedpan!

160
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,720
Our tendency is to just let everybody throw in,

161
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,280
so we don't really have any rules.

162
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,880
I was once a degenerate, but Bob saved me.

163
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,420
Oh, yes! Amen!

164
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,680
We encourage people to form their own schism,

165
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,280
you know, join the church and send us money,

166
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
but immediately rebel against it.

167
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,900
Well, there's always a split in the church,

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,820
and if there wasn't, we'd create some,

169
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,160
because you can't have a church without schisms.

170
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,660
And the more schisms in a cult, the better.

171
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,060
Ladies and gentlemen,

172
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,900
I think we need to inject this campground with some real hate.

173
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,340
Yes!

174
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,820
What I would like to bring to you,

175
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,940
the great Papa Joe Mahalo.

176
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,320
Woo!

177
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,300
One of the major magnets of religion

178
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,240
isn't the common love of some people.

179
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,980
It's the common hatred of something.

180
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:18,980


181
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,420
That's what brings everybody together.

182
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,980
So I just wanted to kind of offer that sort of alter ego,

183
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,420
the sort of anti-Bob, if you will,

184
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,580
in the Church of the Subgenius.

185
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,380
There are two distinct branches in the Church of the Subgenius.

186
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,840
The highbrow evangelical branch,

187
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,420
led by Ivan Stang and his philosophical followers.

188
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,480
Some of the subgeniuses were looking at me

189
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,220
as kind of the do-gooder.

190
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,540
I was a little too easy on the normal,

191
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,220
so I didn't really care.

192
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,460
I didn't really want to destroy the whole world.

193
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,000
I just wanted to loot it, get all the good comic books.

194
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,060
Well, other people really do hate the normals.

195
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,220
The evangelicals and the holocaustals

196
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,760
represent two sides of the Church.

197
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,120
Now, the evangelicals believe that all the pinks

198
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,560
need to be enslaved and can still serve a purpose

199
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,640
after the final judgment in which Earth is liberated

200
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,840
from the chains of pink and conspiracy rule.

201
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,180
Now, the holocaustals, we're kind of a more traditional,

202
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,000
fundamentalist, if you will.

203
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,720
We believe that, you know, you do need to eliminate

204
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,640
and exterminate all the normals.

205
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,760
Not everyone in the Church of the Subgenius

206
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,620
gets along with one another,

207
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,060
because it's the group for people who can't join groups.

208
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,140
I've often tried to explain to people

209
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,140
about Church of the Subgenius.

210
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,000
He's going to be very smart, talented people,

211
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,440
but somewhere along the line,

212
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,380
they've got a personality problem

213
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,260
that keeps them from joining in

214
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,940
and being sociable and popular and normal.

215
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,200
Thesey tell me a little bit about B корп Cool af.

216
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,200


217
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,740
a long time a bfounder of the land of animals.

218
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,740
Oh, I've noticed some more animals.

219
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:37,740


220
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,400
Seems like some of them you can yhtechize.

221
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,400
You gottaAss tissallifAHck of an animal in Japan.

222
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,800
It's not just the psychobabble and the endless miles and miles and miles of wasted tape.

223
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,680
It's not just the blissed out winos with stained trouser crotches and corroded zippers.

224
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:04,160
It's not just the shark-like doctors cruising the crowds of normals like Barracuda trailing the awful barges.

225
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:14,780
It's not just the morally bankrupt conspiracy trying desperately to climb on Bob's wagon in a futile attempt to denature the 200 proof word of salvation.

226
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:23,180
It's not just the Jane of device howling alone and unheeded in the contemporary wasteland while children suck on stones.

227
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:32,960
It's not just the media zombies who hunch in front of their FM receivers every night trying to decipher the shows that dare not speak their minds.

228
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,140
It's not just the media zombies who hunch in front of their FM receivers every night trying to decipher the shows that dare not speak their minds.

229
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,240
It's not just the stark fists that are never printed and never mailed.

230
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,700
It's not just the prairie squid denuded of hair and wrapped in plastic in your local supermarkets.

231
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,960
It's not just the one-way flow of cash to that Dallas post office box that promises slack but somehow never delivers.

232
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,660
It's not just that fatuous, pipe-faced, would-be savior who can't even tap dance.

233
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,140
It's not just the safe sex movement who wants you to spread your seed in a rubber suit.

234
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,140


235
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,480
It's not just the inane tape correspondences that go on and on and on and on and on.

236
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:23,720
It's not just the smug, self-righteous, born-again fundamentalists who want us all to live according to their moral code which was written by tribal savages back in the Stone Age.

237
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:31,420
It's not just the hate-filled zealots who murder a scientist to spare a guinea pig or a laboratory monkey.

238
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,140
It's not just the government that wants to make sure that the government is a good place to live.

239
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,460
It's not just the government that lies, cheats, robs and kills the very people whose rights it is supposed to secure.

240
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:47,700
It's not just the bad movies, bad television, bad books, bad fashions, bad music and bad taste.

241
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,580
It's not just a system that's so corrupt, top-heavy and tainted with greed that it's raping our very planet.

242
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,440
It's not just the overfed, bloated, paranoid demagogues with their bloody fingers on the doomsday buttons.

243
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,660
It's not just the complete absence of love, charity, kindness, faith, honor and slack.

244
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,420
It's not just the hip wimps milling all around you with smarmy smiles and sticky fingers.

245
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,680
It's not just the collapse of civilization that we have come to know and despise it.

246
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:33,500
It's not just the fact that everything we are and everything we do is dictated by a double helix of deoxyribonucleic acid.

247
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,920
No dear friends, it's more than all that.

248
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,840
But the church of the subgenius offers you alternatives.

249
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:51,360
Glanscaping, time control, acupointing, fornicationalism and a chance to ride the Dobbs wave as it sweeps across the luck plane.

250
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,660
Eschew normality, shun the conspiracy and get right with Bob.

251
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,360
He's still got that frog mixture and he's a dinkum square shooter.

252
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,660
Maybe he isn't the best.

253
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,940
But he's all you've got.

254
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,820
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon performing the extremely rare, it's not just the, number two.

255
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,840
Which I forgot even existed.

256
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,020
It was on hour of slack number 89 whereas this is number 1811.

257
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,620
Probably that was recorded in Bolivia.

258
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,940
Now we're going to go back to this rare old Firesign Theater material.

259
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:52,720
Now if you never heard of them and yet enjoy subgenius radio, you might want to look at firesigntheater.com

260
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:02,520
and let me note that the theater there is spelled the British way with R-E at the end instead of E-R.

261
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,060
Firesigntheater.com.

262
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:14,360
That is where you can find access to many new and old albums such as the one I'm playing from called Dope Humor of the Seventies.

263
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:25,320
There would probably not be any kind of subgenius radio or possibly even church outreach without the Firesign Theater.

264
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,680
World domination really only comes into its really golden age with Richard Nixon I think.

265
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,460
Well, well.

266
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,720
No, I think Jack Kennedy.

267
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,300
Now Kennedy really was the man who really made it possible.

268
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,640
He was the first man to take a real liberal's like super electronic vision.

269
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,780
He was the kind of guy that would be, he was the first president to own a Sony tape recorder.

270
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,260
You know, he really was.

271
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,640
If our advisors aren't there, somebody else's advisors will be there.

272
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,080
Right. I mean like if Harvard doesn't get in there first, Yale's going to get there.

273
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,420
I mean he's got a good real vision.

274
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,460
It's good healthy touch football competition.

275
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,600
Absolutely, right.

276
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,220
Political touch football is what it is.

277
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,560
Right.

278
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,160
But look, Richard Nixon, man, I mean Richard Nixon is much better than Lyndon Johnson ever was.

279
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,960
Oh, I agree.

280
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,400
I thought Lyndon Johnson was good, man, especially all that killing and stuff like that.

281
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,100
But Richard Nixon has outdone him.

282
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,540
Let me tell you one thing before you get into Nixon.

283
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,480
No, go right ahead.

284
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,860
Just very flashed on it yesterday, I just wanted to mention to the folks.

285
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,980
Like, President of the United States gets shot.

286
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,280
The guy who's supposed to do it only gets to say one thing, which is I didn't do it.

287
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,040
And then he gets shot on television, right?

288
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,160
And nobody says anything about it basically.

289
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,020
It just goes down.

290
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,680
And then the next president, everybody in Washington is scared to death, right?

291
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,080
Everybody's going around saying, well, that guy gets shot.

292
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,920
And then the guy's got shot on television.

293
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,980
Nobody said anything about it.

294
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,420
And they got the Supreme Court to say it's okay.

295
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,520
I better keep my mouth shut.

296
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,520
It's wonderful, man.

297
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,780
It's the closed-mouthed administration.

298
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,700
The closed-mouthed, right.

299
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,980
The silent generation, right?

300
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,360
Me scared of Nixon?

301
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,660
No.

302
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,020
You know who he sends around, you know, to lean on you?

303
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,840
Lyndon Johnson.

304
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,100
Lyndon Johnson, right.

305
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,240
I come from the big man.

306
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,120
Right.

307
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,420
He was in Newport Beach yesterday attending the.

308
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:00,660
Right.

309
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
The wedding of his niece.

310
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,940
And he has a perfect attendance record, by the way.

311
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,400
Yes, he does.

312
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,340
He goes to all family functions.

313
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,340
Well, they're redlined at once when he came in.

314
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,860
No matter where in Southern California they occur.

315
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,620
Oh, and if he's not there personally, he has two or three of his boys there.

316
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,800
Right, right, right.

317
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,680
I'm sorry, I will not be able.

318
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,920
You mean the little Eisenhower kid?

319
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,400
Yeah, the little Eisenhower kid.

320
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:19,620
Right.

321
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,500
The one with the submachine gun.

322
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:27,860
I am not going to go to that assassination roundup, but I am going to send David and

323
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,180
Bobby Eisenhower.

324
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,960
And I am going to send the National Boy Scout boys.

325
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,520
Look, oh, it's just wonderful.

326
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,320
Who's that kid?

327
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,200
David Eisenhower?

328
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:35,740
Yes.

329
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,640
He's got the same name as another president, you know.

330
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:37,900
That's right.

331
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,700
And he goes around.

332
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,780
They're related closely.

333
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,060
No, no, no.

334
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,160
Eisenhower was the chancellor of the German Republic after Hitler.

335
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,160
That's right, that's right.

336
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,200
Yeah, he took over war-torn Germany, I think they call it.

337
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,600
Post-war-torn Germany.

338
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,740
Dear Chancellor Kreisler.

339
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,540
And built it up to the major state that it is today.

340
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,500
War-torn.

341
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,040
Good job done well, too.

342
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,500
I hear.

343
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:54,920
Heil Volkswagen.

344
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:55,700
Right.

345
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,060
That's his first name, Volkswagen Eisenhower.

346
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,620
I hear the marks are doing well.

347
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,420
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,440
So are the Munches.

349
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,860
Right.

350
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,160
They got all the angles.

351
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,840
I left an opening for both of you, did you notice that?

352
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,220
Yeah, that's right.

353
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,180
We got your marks.

354
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:07,440
We each came in separate.

355
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:07,940
That's right.

356
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,760
We've got to look for our marks for all the angles.

357
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,520
That's right, but all the angles so we can lay it on the Munches, you know what I mean?

358
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,260
Down in Munchen.

359
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,380
That's where all the Munches are.

360
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,900
And that's where all the Munchen, man, that's where old Dorothy, man, gets.

361
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,180
Munchkin?

362
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,140
Sure, of course.

363
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,740
She gets caught in this tremendous political hurricane in Kansas, bleeding Kansas, gets

364
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,040
lifted up with a house of reprobation.

365
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,240
She's a representative and lands in Munich.

366
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,240
That's what the Wizard of Oz means.

367
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,220
Get out of here.

368
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,540
Of course.

369
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,080
Yeah, boy.

370
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,940
Get out of here.

371
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,520
Neon, fascist literary critics.

372
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,660
Oh, look, no, no, look, it's a, yes, it's a...

373
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,160
Why don't you go join Susan Perlmutter, whoever wrote that article?

374
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:41,700
Right.

375
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,480
A bunch of Jewish critics, that's all you guys are.

376
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:44,840
You're obscure.

377
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,660
That's right, that's right.

378
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,340
And Dr. Seuss is all about the takeover of the Japanese industrial movement.

379
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,600
I'm glad we got rid of him.

380
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,320
Boy, what a drag.

381
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,960
Mr. Intellectual, they call him.

382
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,060
That's terrible to get into that sort of thing.

383
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,040
Critic is a guy who plays the game.

384
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,800
Disillusioned a bunch of kids.

385
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,420
Yeah.

386
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,020
By the way, is that kid still tied to the tree out there?

387
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,360
No, no, no, no, no.

388
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,440
Say, Sebastian, you mean?

389
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,180
The cheetah got him.

390
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,200
The cheetah got him?

391
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:08,900
Yeah, right.

392
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,380
Oh, wonderful.

393
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,600
We, when we're doing the radio show, we tie a kid to the tree outside.

394
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,260
Yeah, right.

395
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,040
And so then, you know, that's an old African method, and then the tiger comes along and

396
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,980
then you shoot the tiger.

397
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,540
That's right.

398
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,460
Yeah, yeah.

399
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,640
And then somebody else shoots you.

400
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,220
It's a macho game, right, actually.

401
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, it's a good game.

402
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,680
It's a swell game.

403
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,020
Sure is.

404
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,160
I like it.

405
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,540
It's called the President Nixon game.

406
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,020
The President Nixon game, right.

407
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,460
So you go to a small country, tie it to a tree, right, and wait until, and wait for

408
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,840
China to come and eat it, right?

409
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,260
Right, right, right.

410
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,560
And then you eat China, right?

411
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:34,760
Right.

412
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,080
Let's go down and eat a little Chinese.

413
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,700
I don't be silly.

414
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,460
Of course I don't.

415
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,340
But that's because you're smart, and you spent all that excess money that you make on trips

416
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,480
to Amsterdam and stuff like that, don't you?

417
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,280
Yeah.

418
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,920
That's what the rest of us do.

419
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,460
You know, you have a write-off.

420
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,820
Yeah, intelligence, yeah.

421
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,420
Yeah, mind.

422
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,400
That's got a lot to do with it, doesn't it?

423
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:55,940
Yeah, sure.

424
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,100
That's what, no, that, Bob never said that.

425
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,500
Nah, Bob never said that.

426
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:01,880
That ain't doctrinal.

427
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,220
He never told me anything.

428
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,700
Bob never said you had to have a brain.

429
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,600
In fact, he said just the opposite.

430
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,660
He said to just float with it, man.

431
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,640
Just, just feel your way along.

432
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,260
Don't be linear.

433
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,000
Feel your weight, yeah.

434
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,900
Have a holographic view.

435
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,300
Feel the weight holding you down.

436
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,140
You don't want to be linear.

437
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,380
It's like you're being locked in a box, man.

438
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,220
Just let the weight go.

439
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,620
Yeah, man, it's not, it's not a road or a grid.

440
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,760
It's more like a cloud.

441
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:25,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

442
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:25,920


443
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:25,920


444
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,100
Yeah, it's like a, it's like an aroi or a canyon.

445
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,320
It's like a, no, it's like a beaver's tooth.

446
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,360
No, it's like a hamstrung muscle.

447
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,320
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

448
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,340
The neurons don't really do that much.

449
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:39,920
It's like a neuron.

450
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,440
The, the things they don't even know about this go off the neurons.

451
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,640
No, they don't know each other.

452
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,380
They do all the real fancy stuff.

453
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,460
They can't even talk to each other.

454
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,000
Sometimes they're so lonely and they're sitting right next to all the other neurons.

455
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

456
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,260
Dave, get your hands off that neuron.

457
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:55,900
Quick, Bob, quick.

458
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:55,900


459
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:55,900


460
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:55,900


461
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:55,900


462
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:55,900


463
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,740
You're playing with your neurons.

464
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,800
Look at that, look at him.

465
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,760
He's just like a chimpanzee in a cage.

466
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,260
Manipulating life.

467
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,740
Just beating his neurons again.

468
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,380
He's just home or something.

469
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,780
Whipping his neurons.

470
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,480
He's very, very light.

471
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,440
He can use a whisk.

472
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,080
Ew, it's gross.

473
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,720
A squishing chemicals out of him.

474
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,620
A whisk I've got is a Scandinavian plate has to whisk.

475
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,520
Ew, gross, there's serotonin all over everything.

476
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,780
Lepidomy, spring testing, and other morning, afternoon attitudes.

477
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:25,880
Dave, will you, will you plug your ears and quit leaking out your damn neurotic mind?

478
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:25,880


479
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:25,880


480
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:25,880


481
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:25,880


482
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,340
Pus.

483
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,680
Chemical brain cell pus.

484
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,240
It's neurotic pus, man.

485
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,380
Ah, neurotic pus.

486
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,740
Somebody called this show a bunch of neurotic pus and I think they meant moronic pus.

487
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,560
I don't think they meant it.

488
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,260
I would agree.

489
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,740
I would have tend to agree with that characterization.

490
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,200
Hello there.

491
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,240
It's time to play Truth and Consequences.

492
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,600
Roll up the carpets, push back the chairs, and join us in having a load of laughs and

493
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,520
lots of fun.

494
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,740
You look like a likely candidate for the first question.

495
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,540
Step up to the mic.

496
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,220
What's your name?

497
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,520
Good.

498
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,860
Now, here is the first question.

499
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:55,860


500
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:55,860


501
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:55,860


502
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:55,860


503
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:55,860


504
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:55,860


505
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:55,860


506
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:55,860


507
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,120
What large race of people still ride in buggies?

508
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:05,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

509
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,040
But what large race of people still ride in buggies?

510
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,140
It's babies.

511
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,240
And now for Private Joe Smith.

512
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,460
Private Smith's great yearning is to be a psychiatrist.

513
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,920
And here is his golden opportunity to prove his psychiatric value.

514
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,220
Give your all, Private Smith.

515
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,500
Private Smith, I'm informed that several officers of the American Medical Association

516
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,780
are listening in.

517
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,400
And if you do a good job tonight, you might find a scholarship to some medical college

518
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,320
waiting for you when you leave the army.

519
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,840
Now here's the problem.

520
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,600
You're a fashionable psychiatrist and you're sitting in your office with a woman patient.

521
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,620
This is your desk here and you'd better wear these glasses to make you look professional.

522
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,820
All right, go ahead.

523
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,620
And now, madam, just what seems to be the trouble?

524
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,900
Oh, Doctor!

525
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,000
I just don't know how to begin.

526
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,040
I can rumba and conga like a mad thing, but I just don't know how to begin.

527
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,060
Uh-huh.

528
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,720
Now, madam, what are you saying?

529
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,040
Well, you see, Doctor...

530
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Oh, Doctor, your beard, it's dipping in the ink well.

531
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,820
But, madam, I have no beard.

532
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,100
Now, don't you fret.

533
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,780
You're a lot worse than the people who talk about you.

534
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,360
Amen.

535
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,260
Now, madam...

536
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,440
Well, Doctor, you see, first of all, I suffer from a constant obsession that my husband

537
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,300
is untrue to me.

538
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,120
Well, perhaps he is untrue to you.

539
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,480
Oh, but you see, I'm not married.

540
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,680
And I also...

541
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,940
I have a constant obsession that I'm not being followed.

542
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,860
Well, that may not be a delusion, madam.

543
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,840
How old are you?

544
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,400
That's a secret between me, my mother, and my draft board.

545
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,380
Oh, no!

546
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,380
Oh, Doctor, I don't know what to think.

547
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,200
Sometimes I think I'm quite crazy, and then again I think I'm perfectly sane.

548
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,960
It's the uncertainty of it that's so terrible.

549
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,460
What?

550
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,900
Madam, your stories are over.

551
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,160
You're crazy.

552
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,940
Have you any other obsessions, madam?

553
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,120
Oh, yes, heaps.

554
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,180
Why, right this minute, I think I'm soaking wet.

555
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,400
Mine glimmel!

556
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,880
For heaven's sakes, don't do that.

557
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:53,880


558
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,020
Drip all over my...

559
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,340
Oh, Germans again, ma!

560
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,720
Excuse me.

561
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,560
I've just had a hard day.

562
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,480
Oh, I'm so glad.

563
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,120
And, Doctor, I have another obsession.

564
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:02,660
Yes?

565
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,640
Right now, I think there's a tiger in back of me.

566
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,740
A big tiger?

567
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,220
Huge.

568
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,680
Oh, no, he's asleep.

569
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,140
You see him moving around?

570
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,260
Oh, no, he's asleep.

571
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,960
Well, perhaps we'd better lower our voices.

572
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,860
We might wake him.

573
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,440
What am I saying?

574
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,260
Madam, say no more.

575
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,360
I understand your case thoroughly.

576
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,360
Madam, I have here a little word association test.

577
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,880
When I read a word, you say,

578
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:23,880


579
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:23,880


580
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:23,880


581
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:23,880


582
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,800
the first word that comes into your mind.

583
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,240
Are you ready?

584
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:26,780
Very well.

585
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,240
Dog.

586
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:27,760
Dog.

587
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,140
Hitler.

588
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,680
No.

589
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,640
You're right.

590
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,900
You're, you're, you're right.

591
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,040
You, you're wrong.

592
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,540
No, that isn't it.

593
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:34,980
Dog.

594
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,640
Don't repeat the word I read.

595
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:36,980
Now, look.

596
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,960
Just say the first word that comes into your head, all right?

597
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,200
Head.

598
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,980
No, no, not yet.

599
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,660
Not yet.

600
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,820
Wait till I do it now, okay?

601
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,260
No, okay.

602
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,340
Now, what is the first word that the word dog brings to your mind?

603
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:48,620
Hitler.

604
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,760
You're right.

605
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,440
You're right again.

606
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:50,620
Right.

607
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,180
I was right before.

608
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,580
That's good.

609
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,020
I was right before.

610
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,020


611
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,760
What did you say again?

612
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,200
Again.

613
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,520
I'm going crazy.

614
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,740
Doctor, doctor, I can't help you.

615
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,520
I'm going crazy.

616
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,320
I can't help you unless you help yourself.

617
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,400
You'll change sex.

618
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,240
Now, why don't you take a nice hot bath?

619
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,560
Here, take one of mine.

620
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,720
That's funny.

621
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,740
That's funny.

622
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,780
But I couldn't take your last one.

623
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,100
Heavens, it's late.

624
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,480
I can't stay another minute.

625
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,380
I hate to eat and run, so I'll just walk.

626
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,000
Cheerio.

627
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,380
Cheerio.

628
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,200
Oh, that's fading a little.

629
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,660
Wait a minute.

630
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,300
Let me, you skipped my line here.

631
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,760
You're stepping on the tiger's foot.

632
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:23,860
You're stepping on the tiger's foot.

633
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,120
You're stepping on the tiger's tail.

634
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,020
Silly boy.

635
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,700
Brr-brr.

636
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,700
If he doesn't mind, why should you?

637
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,960
Bye-bye.

638
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,620
Horsely to himself.

639
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,560
I must pull this horse together.

640
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,440
Madam, wait, wait.

641
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,000
That will be $25.

642
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,860
Oh, no, no.

643
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,360
I really couldn't take it.

644
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:39,860
But, madam.

645
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,200
Oh, well, if you insist.

646
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,760
I might as well be rich as the way I am.

647
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,700
But hurry, hurry.

648
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,280
Where did you learn to read?

649
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,520
Excuse me.

650
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,440
That's a 10, a 20.

651
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,500
You thought that was funny, huh?

652
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,280
Crazy.

653
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,420
25.

654
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,860
You wait for me until I'm done.

655
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:53,860


656
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:53,860


657
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:53,860


658
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:53,860


659
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,540
After this, we'll go out for a drink.

660
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:55,940
Hitler.

661
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,780
I'm off to you again.

662
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,420
Oh, my God.

663
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,860
Now, just do everything I told you.

664
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,560
And don't worry.

665
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,540
Bye-bye.

666
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,480
Bye, bums.

667
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,740
Oh, I'd like to go to the lake.

668
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,140
I'd like to ride a skate and walk around.

669
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,780
And people will have a number.

670
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:23,300
This character named Doug Wellman, using the handle Puzzling Evidence, he was way ahead

671
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:23,760
of us.

672
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,220
He was the one who was the best at collaging found sound.

673
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:39,180
Doug Wellman had been making these audio collage tapes with sound effects and improvised

674
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,400
humor, as it were.

675
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,640
It was like a network of people that traded cassette tapes.

676
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,800
You'd get the tape, and you'd listen to the tape, and you'd immediately start a tape

677
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,660
back to the friend.

678
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,800
And it was just such a great way to communicate.

679
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,320
Wouldn't you like revenge?

680
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:53,840
Yeah.

681
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:06,120
It was really nice.

682
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:12,260
Night-time, loners would always come here and dashingly stomach those conspirators

683
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,540
who这样, if you remember, managed to enslave all of Allegro, applyσει the

684
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:15,860
value of all long.

685
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,120
Say good night.

686
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,120


687
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,440
It turned this time out.

688
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:18,440


689
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,200
I was available.

690
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,360
Noja glasses, no wait a close-up.

691
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:23,840


692
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,400
We contacted him and invited ourselves onto his show.

693
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:38,020
And at some point it became Hour of Slack, which was a great name because the show is actually 90 minutes long.

694
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,500
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

695
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:52,080
And this gave us a body of cassette tapes that made us sound a little more developed than we really were.

696
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,420
Nobody had met each other to that point.

697
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,440
No real events or anything.

698
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,980
It was all just a male media network.

699
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:08,020
There were finally enough people who were curious about each other and becoming actual friends that we wanted to meet.

700
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,260
So we decided we were going to have a convention in Dallas.

701
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,380
Have you ever wondered about your neighbors?

702
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,020
Maybe wondered about the weird thumps and bumps or chances?

703
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,320
Or the weird dance emanating from their apartment?

704
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Well, they may be followers of Bob.

705
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,280
That's the fastest growing cult here in the Southwest.

706
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,820
Somehow or another, Channel 4 News got wind of this subgenius thing.

707
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,040
Ivan was like, you know, really resisted at first.

708
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,720
I was married to a school teacher.

709
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,200
We didn't want to get my wife in trouble or get Philo fired.

710
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,320
Plus, Philo's parents didn't know anything about this whole subgenius thing.

711
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,340
They were very religious.

712
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,060
I didn't ever want to do anything that was against the law.

713
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,280
I didn't want to embarrass them in public.

714
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,740
Even though I had this really strong need to rebel, I wanted to kind of do it privately.

715
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:07,380
The church is so omnipervasive that we couldn't possibly get into the dogma in any less than three or four hours.

716
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,720
I thought, man, you know, a secret identity is a good thing.

717
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,860
It's the church of the subgenius, and they're holding a revival.

718
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,800
My name's Sterno Dox from Little Rock, Arkansas.

719
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,460
This is my husband, the evidence representative, Doug Wellman.

720
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,280
I'm from Oakland, California.

721
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,620
I'm Pulver Greenies from the Wise Foundation in San Francisco.

722
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,560
Stephen Hart is San Francisco's.

723
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,020
People came from all over the country.

724
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,320
I'm from Houston, and I came to learn more about Bob.

725
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,360
Bob is like a super salesman.

726
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,700
He can sell you anything, and I bought it.

727
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,360
I just kept hearing the word Bob, Bob, Bob.

728
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,800
It would wake me up in the middle of the night.

729
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,880
I'd wake up doing jumping jacks. I wouldn't know why.

730
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,880
Devo was in town.

731
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,440
And Mark Mothersbaugh was there.

732
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,080
Mothersbaugh came by.

733
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,160
It was only by chance that I started receiving mail from the Subgenius Foundation.

734
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,640
And I realized who Bob was.

735
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,560
Two of the guys from Devo are at the convention.

736
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,540
I thought, this is really cool.

737
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:13,040
Everything was completely like a parallel universe to what Devo had been doing back in Akron

738
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,900
and now was trying to foist upon the world.

739
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,960
This was big-time major, grade-A proof positive,

740
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,800
that it had been going on somewhere else.

741
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,320
There's a good Bob, and there is a bad Bob.

742
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,940
There's a big, tall Bob, and there's a little, short Bob.

743
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,820
There's a kitchen Bob, and a living room Bob.

744
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,480
There's a car-driving Bob.

745
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,460
And where is Bob leading them?

746
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,260
When you first look at it, some people go,

747
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,700
Oh, I get it. This is a takeoff on weird cults and conspiracies.

748
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,600
Then they look a little bit deeper, and if they're really an attuned sort of person,

749
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,060
then they realize,

750
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:54,620
Oh, I get it. This really is a weird cult with cosmic wisdom and dogma

751
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,400
that I've been needing all my life.

752
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,900
And that's usually when they write their first check.

753
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,380
Kelly Lane, Channel 4 News, Dallas.

754
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,060
As the song says, different strokes for different folks.

755
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,680
Doug's been standing out in the sun too long, I think.

756
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,860
I lost my ass on that.

757
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,640
It was disastrous for me personally.

758
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,100
It hurt my job.

759
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,340
And I...

760
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,900
And probably my marriage.

761
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,120
He was struggling to make money.

762
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,760
And I have to admit, for me, that was probably the time in my life

763
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,580
when I had the least amount of trouble earning an income.

764
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,480
I was in the perfect position of being desperate enough

765
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,520
to do low-budget promotion for a weird cult.

766
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,820
Stark fist.

767
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,400
7,000 of them.

768
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,160
That's a lot of weird shit.

769
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,020
It certainly is.

770
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,480
I kicked in a few bucks now and then,

771
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,380
but for the most part, he was the guy that was shelling out his money.

772
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,300
You should make a film about slave labor in the 70s.

773
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,080
That's what I'm doing.

774
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,840
Yeah.

775
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:07,900
I was kidnapped in my native country of Africa from walking down the street.

776
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,980
And these white people came up and told me to get over here to America

777
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,860
and fold these damn envelopes.

778
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:21,400
It was like a carrot was being dangled in front of me personally all the time.

779
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,180
This thing could be big.

780
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,220
We were aware that we were sort of influencing other people.

781
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,140
That was exciting.

782
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,340
You didn't know who, but you could kind of tell other people,

783
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,660
like, what's that Bob thing you're doing?

784
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,760
I kind of wish I had found the Church of the Subgenius

785
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,600
when I was a teenager living in East Texas,

786
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,420
a little town where the state prison was.

787
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,840
You know, it was terrible.

788
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,520
There was nothing but Baptist churches everywhere,

789
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,040
which my family didn't go to, so we were sort of the oddballs.

790
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,060
What do you do to earn a living?

791
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,660
You mean work?

792
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,360
What the hell is the kind of work you have to do to earn a living?

793
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,740
All it does is fill the bellies of the pigs who exploit us.

794
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,840
They look at you and say, oh, you're not getting anything done.

795
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,740
You're a bum. You're a slacker. You're disengaged.

796
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,840
You know, all the put-downs that people throw at people

797
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,820
who seem to be living their own lives.

798
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,300
Who are kind of following their own passions.

799
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,540
What is this, some kind of psychic TV-type parallelism?

800
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:29,040
Well, we all know the psychic powers of the televised image,

801
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,780
but we need to capitalize on it and make it work for us

802
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,120
instead of us working for it.

803
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,240
That's a threat, you know. That's a threat to the conspiracy.

804
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,860
That's a threat to the mediocrity machine

805
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,820
that is the modern media.

806
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,340
That's a threat to the modern capitalist world.

807
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,140
Other creative people started coming into this church.

808
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,680
There was a guy who owned a record store in Amherst, Massachusetts.

809
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,960
I think he's the one that told me about the subgenius.

810
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,760
I was told at one point that I was the only person

811
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,060
who had paid his dues to the subgenius every single time they asked.

812
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,780
The effect they had on David Byrne,

813
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,020
the effect they had on the residents,

814
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,600
the effect they had on Paul Reubens,

815
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,580
even people who didn't know,

816
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,680
were building on subgenius tropes and sensibilities.

817
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,700
It was very flattering.

818
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,640
Some of these people were like our heroes,

819
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,380
and so to be recognized by your heroes,

820
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,240
it's a real ego boost, you know.

821
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,380
We actually got big heads and stuff.

822
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,820
There is a patrolman in Boston... Free the Anthropology 7.

823
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,700
...who has formed an organization called something like

824
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,000
the Patrolman's Friendship Association,

825
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:51,160
and the standard bearer and the emblem is a pig called Fuzzy.

826
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,240
And he says that Fuzzy the pig,

827
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,740
representing all the policemen and the people who like policemen,

828
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,000
is better than all the hippies.

829
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,680
Well, we work in this group manipulation program

830
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,880
and start with pigs, groups of pigs.

831
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,860
With any success, doctor?

832
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,460
No.

833
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,000
But it's just an experimental program,

834
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:22,300
so we expect some fallbacks before we can really get rolling with it.

835
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,220
And the government grants are gonna last us for years, so we don't care.

836
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,260
Is there any possible social use of the garbage?

837
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,720
No.

838
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,380
No social value there either?

839
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,860
The pigs eat it, but then they make more garbage.

840
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,280
That's right.

841
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,160
Although they're very clean little animals.

842
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,320
But the patients confronted with a gaggle of pigs,

843
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,000
find it difficult and interesting.

844
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,740
Doctor, can you tell me this?

845
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,720
Are you wearing those glasses because you think that I'm going to hit you?

846
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,700
No, Jim.

847
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,120
You have paranoid delusions.

848
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,980
Well, I can't believe that.

849
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,260
Let me see your hand.

850
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,800
What? No.

851
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,020
What?

852
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,320
Get your hand out of your pocket slowly.

853
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,620
I'm not going to hurt you.

854
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,240
Face the carpet. Just put your hands up.

855
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,440
I'm just talking about pigs, Jim.

856
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,540
Is that your pants leg? That's a third leg.

857
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,280
I'm just talking about pigs, Jim.

858
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,680
You must be a taper.

859
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,260
Jimmy.

860
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,180
All right. Okay.

861
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,860
Let's get back to pigs, gentlemen. Let's keep it civilized.

862
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,200
Well, we want to help him find his direction and growth.

863
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,640
Now, I'm at the polar extreme.

864
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,900
Who are the others?

865
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,640
We've been trying to find this out ever since the tenants of Freud

866
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,980
were thrown out of the building that he owned.

867
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:48,060
We're following a Newtonian science, represented, as you were, by the cow culture,

868
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,240
and it's long outdated.

869
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,020
Let's start our science with naturalistic observation of pigs.

870
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:02,960
Doctor, what you have said here has changed my life.

871
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,660
From now on, I think I'm going to have to make a drastic fallback

872
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,220
and turn around in a cybernetics.

873
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,220
In order to be able to just lick your shoes.

874
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,220
Thank God. Thank you, Jesus.

875
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,640
After all, I just like that.

876
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,660
I'd like to tell you right now, in front of this syndicated show,

877
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,260
and we're reaching 60 million listeners,

878
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,800
I would like to tell everybody that I love you, Doctor.

879
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,680
Jim, I think you have accomplished something important.

880
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,940
This is beautiful. This is real.

881
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,680
You've changed my life in a way in which I...

882
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:35,840
Can't you...

883
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,900
There it is, Jim.

884
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,660
Are you trying to...

885
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,840
Pigs, pigs, pigs.

886
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,140
I'm trying to come out of here.

887
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,060
...in a time when no one has anything to say.

888
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:45,880
Come on, come on, come on.

889
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,300
Boys and girls gathered here in the name of freedom,

890
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,680
I know some of you have hardly reached your 14th birthday.

891
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,800
Some of you are wearing those pearl cockled necklaces

892
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,640
given to you by your ancient grandfathers.

893
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,260
And we know the nuclear devices you will be carrying into town today

894
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,820
will cause you instant sainthood and martyrdom.

895
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,620
You will be lifted on high,

896
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,140
so there's no reason to cry, children.

897
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,220
Each one of you are a little bomb,

898
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,600
armed and ready to pop.

899
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,860
It's my baby calling, says I need you here.

900
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,540
Ah.

901
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,300
You think we can...

902
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,880
I don't.

903
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:31,980
Ah.

904
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,480
This is not gonna fit in here.

905
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,080
I feel like I could pop all night, baby.

906
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,920
I don't know if I can walk to town with this thing.

907
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,180
You're my radar love, hon.

908
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:42,820
Ugh.

909
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,820
The implantation devices make sure that each child

910
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,680
walks the straight and narrow path to his destination.

911
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,680
The objective or target as it is known at Control

912
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,500
is to make sure that each child removes itself as it removes the target,

913
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,420
so there are no witnesses and no disclaimers allowed past the curfew now.

914
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,400
So...

915
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,700
Well, I guess we'll have to wait and see.

916
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,480
I don't know.

917
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,200
What do you think, Dave, about the fact that...

918
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,620
Damn it, they're not even gonna hide anymore, are they?

919
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,000
No.

920
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,240
No, they're just right out there.

921
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,300
We're having an oil problem right now.

922
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,360
We're not making enough money to who knows what.

923
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,060
They're just not even gonna hide it anymore.

924
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:32,640
Nope.

925
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,500
They're just gonna rape everything they can in the four years they have.

926
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,680
Or only two, really,

927
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,900
because they know they're gonna lose it,

928
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,320
and they're gonna lose the Senate.

929
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,780
Oh, Jeb's son will be the next Bush emperor,

930
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,800
and then...

931
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,380
Jeb's son?

932
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,920
You mean the little Puerto Rican kid?

933
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,460
Yeah, yeah.

934
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,820
The one granddad called the little brown one?

935
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,200
His father called him the little brown one?

936
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,720
Yeah, George Bush Sr.

937
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,540
Oh, is that the little brown one?

938
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,200
The little brown one, right?

939
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,980
Well, I'm glad he's spreading his genes around

940
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,300
and kind of like one of the folks now, but...

941
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,400
That's good that you have a brown child.

942
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,020
I'm learning.

943
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,160
The more do I know now, the more I'm learning,

944
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,160


945
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,160


946
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,160


947
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,160


948
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,160


949
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,160


950
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,160


951
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,340
You know, I realized that I was serious

952
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,800
when it sunk in that I really was trying to learn Dutch

953
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,380
from that little Berlitz book.

954
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,140
You mean you're saying

955
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,560
you're actually thinking of repatriating fishies?

956
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,160
Well, you know...

957
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,320
Jor no vord.

958
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,720
...I don't want to be part of the Empire.

959
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,460
I know what you mean.

960
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,040
I don't want to be on the Death Star.

961
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,740
I know.

962
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,560
I grew up believing that America

963
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,860
was the rebel forces.

964
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,880
Lou, I was your father.

965
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,500
Of course, this is the Death Star, man.

966
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,720
Howdy, folks.

967
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:48,360
Come on down to America, Inc., where you'll be forced to pay for everything.

968
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,700
But it's not.

969
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,080
It's convenient, friends.

970
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,080
Ah, memories.

971
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,440
This is the most convenient.

972
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,060
Ah, memories.

973
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,800
They used to shoot at us.

974
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,100
Now they shoot near us.

975
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:05,640
Well, I heard about the more friendlier bullets that they're using on the kids these days.

976
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,480
Well, they don't think they were using friendly bullets in Cincinnati.

977
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,920
I heard they use the little bouncing bullets now.

978
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,000
Not in the West Bank of Gaza, they don't.

979
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,840
No, no.

980
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
They're using really lead bullets still.

981
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,780
Yes, there's still lead.

982
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,380
And even the Army.

983
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,060
What do you think about this?

984
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:30,140
The Army has switched to a bullet that is environmental friendly.

985
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,960
It's some sort of other, it's not lead.

986
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,500
It's biodegradable bullets.

987
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:34,920
Yeah.

988
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,720
Oh, my God.

989
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,900
The family still has to pay for it.

990
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,940
So that we only kill humans, not the earth.

991
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,860
They probably got a big...

992
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,660
They probably got a big conservation tax break for that.

993
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,380
Yeah.

994
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,980
The idea, of course, being, you know, this is the way...

995
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,720
Think of the research that went into that.

996
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,340
Gentlemen, the world of the future will be a clean war.

997
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,120
A war that you and your children can stand to fight.

998
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,440
An effectively deadly bullet, but yet easy on the mind.

999
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,060
You know, somebody had to not repent.

1000
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,260
Easy to mop up after.

1001
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:08,300
In order for that bullet to be developed, somebody had to not repent or quit their job or slack off.

1002
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,680
That's the age-correct way of thinking.

1003
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,340
There was a point where somebody could have repented, quit their job and slack off,

1004
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,560
and then somebody else would have had to develop that bullet.

1005
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,140
Said, no, sign the check and put it in my rectum right here.

1006
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,460
But instead of this, though, if I don't develop this bullet, somebody else is going to do it.

1007
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,380
So I might as well not repent, quit my job or slack off.

1008
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,720
I got to tell you guys something.

1009
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,360
I'll be known as the guy who developed the environmental bullet.

1010
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,680
The environmental bullet.

1011
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,280
Yeah.

1012
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,780
You know, the guy in the Doobie Brothers who's supposedly a missile defense expert?

1013
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,700
Bend over and spread them, baby.

1014
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,580
Here comes my...

1015
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:40,860
Environmentally...

1016
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:42,800
Cool...

1017
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,080
Bullet.

1018
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,160
Thank God I've been shot.

1019
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:55,220
I can almost see the future of America as my life oozes out here on the sidewalk.

1020
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,760
Thank God for the safe, clean bullet that just ended me.

1021
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,140
Ended you?

1022
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,180
Did I?

1023
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,400
Did you end?

1024
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,040
Did I end at that moment?

1025
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,840
No, you know, we have a friend who was in a band who's kind of like...

1026
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,240
Here's a song.

1027
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:09,740
It's just important.

1028
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,080
It's important today.

1029
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,360
Why aren't kids, like, marching and stuff?

1030
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,300
For what?

1031
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,880
Yeah, they're not shooting them yet.

1032
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:16,960
Stop.

1033
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,460
Once they start shooting them, they're going to go...

1034
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,080
No, no, but you're thinking of the old America.

1035
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,920
This is America Incorporated.

1036
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,320
Right.

1037
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,080
We don't actually...

1038
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,920
I mean, come on, man.

1039
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,880
Do I have to spell it out as many of my employers?

1040
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,920
There are no disagreements in corporate America.

1041
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,460
Come on now.

1042
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,560
Get with the program.

1043
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,160
Read from the same page and remember the talking points.

1044
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,940
Point number one.

1045
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,160
Things are better than they've ever been.

1046
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:44,760
And worse.

1047
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,320
All the kids know today is they want their job.

1048
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,660
Well, that's all there is.

1049
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,400
There's the job and there's...

1050
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,120
Endless drudgery.

1051
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,260
The life.

1052
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:53,540
Death.

1053
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,280
Well, sort of.

1054
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,720
And the job and...

1055
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,280
Well, the job.

1056
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,440
I'm not going to rock the boat.

1057
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,440
I want the job.

1058
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:05,560
Chaz, you told me you were not only going to rock the boat, that you were going to rocket butt that boat right into another world.

1059
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,020
Rocket butt that rocket boat.

1060
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,240
I mean, I'm just...

1061
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,260
You're getting wanted to go.

1062
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:13,880
You're wanting to really climb on there and go to a world where people actually think normal or something.

1063
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,580
I don't know.

1064
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,600
Yeah, definitely.

1065
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,960
It's becoming very important to build that rocket.

1066
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:20,480
To get off.

1067
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:20,860
To get off.

1068
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,720
To get off.

1069
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,120
I mean, very, very, very important now.

1070
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:24,960
Yep.

1071
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,600
I want to get off.

1072
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,980
I don't want to stick around here.

1073
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,160
I just did buy a house in Cleveland.

1074
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,760
I'm building my own Amsterdam.

1075
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,040
Yeah, about to keep it right there.

1076
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,040
You also built yourself.

1077
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,980
A nice canal boat in your mind.

1078
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,500
Do you know?

1079
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,880
With the little hair and green thing in the front.

1080
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,320
You know.

1081
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:52,180
I'm also learning foreign languages so that they'll let me go there.

1082
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,400
Are you learning Enochian babbling?

1083
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,200
Well, I've been living in my house for five years.

1084
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,220
And for five years, I've been installing each day.

1085
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,520
I dig out a little area in the foundation area.

1086
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,480
Trying to put in another composite rocket motor.

1087
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,160
So the house is about two-thirds.

1088
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:09,460
Two-thirds now.

1089
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,060
Completely surrounded and strapped with rocket motors.

1090
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,440
So in another year or two.

1091
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,000
But the timing is so fiendishly important, dude.

1092
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,160
So devilishly tricky to get every rocket to go off at once.

1093
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,740
What happens if half of them go off and the other half don't?

1094
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,280
Oh, you have a kind of...

1095
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,260
You've got a tilted house, dude.

1096
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:29,840
Really?

1097
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,860
The Mish Fire is just going to send that thing...

1098
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,640
Might end up in Arkansas.

1099
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,840
Well, you would hope it would end up in Arkansas.

1100
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,000
Well, I'm not in the middle of Lake Erie.

1101
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,700
It doesn't matter.

1102
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,940
As long as I reach seven miles per second in any direction,

1103
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,580
that'll be...

1104
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,560
Even down.

1105
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,880
I'll be able to get Earth orbit.

1106
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,100
Chaz, I'm afraid you don't want to go seven minutes per second in any...

1107
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,060
I mean, seven seconds...

1108
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,600
You know, that speed in all general directions,

1109
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,460
because that would be...

1110
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,000
You would be exploding up if you were, you know, not ahead of direction.

1111
00:46:59,060 --> 00:46:59,900
It can't happen here.

1112
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,300
It can't happen here.

1113
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,180
I've been checking it out for a while, baby.

1114
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,280
I'm telling you, my dear, that it can't.

1115
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,440
Happen here.

1116
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,040
Cream cheese.

1117
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,840
I've been checking it out.

1118
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:16,640
Did it.

1119
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,160
Checked it out a couple times.

1120
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,600
Yeah, it's happening here right now,

1121
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,260
and as we watch the sun go down on our democratic freedoms,

1122
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,300
the freedoms that we've taken for granted for so long...

1123
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,480
Oh, no, but we still have all those freedoms.

1124
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,440
They're even more convenient than ever, as long as you...

1125
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,400
As long as you tow the line.

1126
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,880
And left out in the back for...

1127
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,500
Three or four days until everything's nice and...

1128
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,400
As long as you want what they want, you can have anything you want.

1129
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,580
We want what they want.

1130
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,220
But I want what Bob wants.

1131
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,740
I want what we all want.

1132
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,140
I want a worldwide cataclysm.

1133
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,460
I want chocolate pudding delivered to me by aliens,

1134
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,800
and I want some female chocolate pudding delivered as frequently as possible,

1135
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,640
as the old salivary glands can move.

1136
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:05,980
Sometimes they...

1137
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,840
They don't move.

1138
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,780
Of course, that's not the first part of it.

1139
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,260
That's the end of it.

1140
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,200
The first part is much more laconic and obscure.

1141
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,120
I mean...

1142
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,540
Well, that's more artistic, you know,

1143
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,520
when you're obscure and hard to understand.

1144
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,020
That's more artful.

1145
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,560
And, you know, Dave, if we were a little more artful,

1146
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,780
we'd probably be getting paid a little better.

1147
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,240
But instead, we're...

1148
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:33,980
You just...

1149
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,840
Low-grade showbiz clowns.

1150
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,980
We might as well be the guys who do the showbiz.

1151
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,460
The guys that sweep up behind the elephants at the circus, you know?

1152
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,520
Well, we do that, too.

1153
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,960
The dwarfs with the little pooper scoopers.

1154
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,020
Well, we also do do that.

1155
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:48,580
Yeah.

1156
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,840
I mean, at least I've been going back.

1157
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,360
I don't know.

1158
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,140
Some people think they're too good to work.

1159
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,840
But, you know, as long as I'm getting a paycheck,

1160
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,660
I don't mind what tumbles out of there.

1161
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,500
I've seen worse things, and I've picked up worse things.

1162
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,440
You've stuck your arm all the way up worse places than where that came from.

1163
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,660
Yes, that is true.

1164
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,320
I don't want to go into the...

1165
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,620
Grim details.

1166
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:13,400
You tried to get your head all the way up into worse places, but I...

1167
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,460
I was almost a microcephalic baby from that incident.

1168
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,380
And I was almost returned to my native home in Canada

1169
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,400
and buried alive there for the whole incident.

1170
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,080
It was just...

1171
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,020
I don't know.

1172
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,180
In London, it struck a compromise.

1173
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,940
That's in England, you know.

1174
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,700
Dodger Stadium, it struck out.

1175
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,280
In Munich, it struck out.

1176
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:38,300
In Munich, it struck out.

1177
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,080
It struck first.

1178
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,620
Take your head down.

1179
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:49,960
Chaz is trying to bring back the fake rebellion of the 60s,

1180
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,460
which, of course, was actually co-opted from the very beginning.

1181
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,220
Okay, you start.

1182
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:01,340
The John Lennon glasses were trademarked before John Lennon was even born.

1183
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,340
Well, Jack Kerouac and Cassidy and all those guys...

1184
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,120
It was all planned out ahead of time.

1185
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,860
...were actually mind-controlled.

1186
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,080
...were actually mind-controlled for quite some time.

1187
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,120
Yeah, but what good did it do?

1188
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:11,900
Not a damn thing.

1189
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,940
It was early in the morning.

1190
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,220
The energy was so, so weak.

1191
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,400
The poor people below could hardly stand to look up.

1192
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,000
Their necks were craning, but still, it looked like it was...

1193
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:21,840
Wait.

1194
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:22,900
This is...

1195
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,300
Dave, you're stuck in the 60s, man.

1196
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,920
No, man, I'm not stuck in the...

1197
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,660
Get with it, dude.

1198
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:28,720
It's the 90s.

1199
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,220
No, wait.

1200
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,560
I need reading glasses.

1201
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,180
It's the aughties or the zeros or the...

1202
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,720
Yeah, it's the new...

1203
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,560
It's the modern age.

1204
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,620
What is that feeling?

1205
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:37,660
It's contemporary.

1206
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,320
It's new.

1207
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:38,860
It's now.

1208
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:39,500
It's water.

1209
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,100
...mustles rise up in your neck, and the back of your brain...

1210
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,700
Knock, knock.

1211
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,120
...tingles like there's a little teeny...

1212
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,500
A chameleon in the back of your neck.

1213
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:52,740
What is that feeling when your shoes drop off as you're walking down the street and they wave goodbye to you?

1214
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,140
What is that feeling?

1215
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,460
What is that feeling?

1216
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,520
We hope you've enjoyed it half as much...

1217
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,160
What's that blue stain in your undies?

1218
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,260
Have you been keeping bad company again?

1219
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,640
Have you been hanging with old...

1220
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:09,500
who hang too far.

1221
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,520
Yesterday I bought a new car.

1222
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,880
Today I bought a new horn for it.

1223
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:15,820
Herb Alpert.

1224
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,440
You know, the sick thing is

1225
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,920
Rowan and Martin's laugh-in

1226
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,140
was actually kind of

1227
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,140
the hippest thing going at the time.

1228
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,080
I can hardly afford to buy my groceries.

1229
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,620
Horrible nauseas

1230
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,500
possessed us in the morning.

1231
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,640
First a chilling feeling

1232
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,700
that Dean was not going to go on.

1233
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,900
His arms were too scrawny.

1234
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,140
His ears, well, his ears

1235
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,120
were full of gray.

1236
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,720
If the ship hits the sand.

1237
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,540
It's yellow matter.

1238
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,840
Yellow matter's coming out of his ears.

1239
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,480
All of a sudden,

1240
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:46,840
then...

1241
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,500
I put out all the lights

1242
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,500
and played Robert Goody.

1243
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,260
No, said Bill.

1244
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,880
I've been standing here

1245
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,740
for three hours

1246
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,400
with my panties upside down

1247
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,440
and no one's noticed.

1248
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,780
Dean hopped up about

1249
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:00,960
convulsively,

1250
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,480
anxiously pulling on his arms.

1251
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,280
It made me wonder

1252
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,680
if the college boy had thanked him.

1253
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,320
Or what he was trying to do

1254
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,280
with all the strange,

1255
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,940
strange radio equipment.

1256
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,800
No, actually, it's in Idaho.

1257
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,360
Would you mind saying that again?

1258
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:15,600
Idaho?

1259
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,340
That's frightfully interesting.

1260
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,240
We pronounce it Ohio.

1261
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,140
Oh, I've always wanted

1262
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:21,880
to make a cowboy.

1263
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,420
I mean, meet a cowboy.

1264
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:24,720
Really?

1265
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:25,960
Really?

1266
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,280
I yelled across the river.

1267
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,880
Well, you won't see me

1268
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,480
too for a two.

1269
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,940
Yeah, there was a mist

1270
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,740
and men are tonight

1271
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,900
and the streetlights

1272
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,120
didn't come on the freeway

1273
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:34,880
till Vine Street

1274
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,360
and me and an old friend

1275
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,060
were talking about

1276
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,740
Allegheny and pulling boats.

1277
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:39,980
There was people

1278
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,400
hanging themselves down steps,

1279
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:41,900
I guess,

1280
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,800
but mostly good things.

1281
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:44,960
Good things.

1282
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,000
And hello, JD.

1283
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:46,740
Hello, Robbie.

1284
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,980
Hello, everyone.

1285
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,020
My parents say

1286
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,820
I don't know what good

1287
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:52,720
clean fun is.

1288
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,680
And they're right.

1289
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,100
I don't know what good it is.

1290
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,580
The spasms lasted

1291
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,460
for three and a half hours.

1292
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,800
By the time we got grandmother

1293
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,920
all quiet,

1294
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:07,540
it down.

1295
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,140
She still had somehow

1296
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,440
gotten it into her brain

1297
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,940
that grandma was going to grandpa.

1298
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,140
I'm sorry, grandpa.

1299
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,200
She had the right idea.

1300
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,500
It's just a shame

1301
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,900
that polygamy never caught on

1302
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,940
among the married people

1303
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,560
of this country.

1304
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,280
Hey, I, I, I, I.

1305
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,160
I don't want polygamies.

1306
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,320
They can't help it

1307
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,220
if they're not tall.

1308
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:33,100
Hey, did you have a joke

1309
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,300
on Larfin last week

1310
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,560
about holding pig meat

1311
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,440
in your nostrils?

1312
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,500
The long arm has gone through

1313
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,800
and brought back one

1314
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,680
that we could slip

1315
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,360
under the door.

1316
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,720
Oh, I couldn't have said it

1317
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,140
better myself.

1318
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,300
Hey, how about that?

1319
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,600
Your name's in big lights

1320
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,860
up there on that marquee.

1321
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,460
So is mine.

1322
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:51,720
Yeah.

1323
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,540
This man was confused.

1324
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,400
He was pointing

1325
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,340
and asking questions

1326
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,280
and I just couldn't answer what...

1327
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,840
I had no idea

1328
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,720
what he was talking about.

1329
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,240
We really learned the three R's.

1330
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,920
Reading, writing, and rhythm.

1331
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,400
Specifics, barking,

1332
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,020
and playing with ourselves.

1333
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,900
These are the new rules.

1334
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,560
This is the new regimen

1335
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,120
for a new human race.

1336
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,580
One that will not only

1337
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,460
conquer the stars

1338
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,760
but conquer the bars.

1339
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,820
With the waiting thud

1340
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,120
of their own furry feet,

1341
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,800
they'll smash down every door

1342
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,120
and you'll be behind it,

1343
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,960
standing there, guarding,

1344
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,260
standing tall for America.

1345
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:34,420
Really?

1346
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,160
That really moves me, Dave.

1347
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,820
I'm so glad that...

1348
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,000
It's just a tear gas.

1349
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:41,340
...you can't say

1350
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,620
such a sincere...

1351
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:44,820
Oh, man.

1352
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,040
It's a tear gas

1353
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,220
in the mind control, man.

1354
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,540
I don't know what I'm saying.

1355
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,380
I'm crying.

1356
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:51,680
Oh, man.

1357
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,420
Get it together, man.

1358
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:53,940
It sounds like

1359
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,200
Mambo music.

1360
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:54,720
You're on the air.

1361
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:55,840
Come on.

1362
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,360
Come on.

1363
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,960
None of this emotional baloney.

1364
00:54:59,080 --> 00:54:59,740
Get it...

1365
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:00,580
Hey, guys.

1366
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,600
You know, I was wondering

1367
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,600
the funny thing

1368
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,460
about doing a late night show

1369
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:04,900
like this.

1370
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,420
You know, a lot of, you know,

1371
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,400
really out there callers.

1372
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,880
Last night,

1373
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,140
little Jimmy Spliff

1374
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,380
called three times

1375
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,480
and he was, you know,

1376
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,080
doing his own variety

1377
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,100
of rocket science.

1378
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,320
But here at the, you know,

1379
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,240
the Kingdom Dome,

1380
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,700
there's a lot of complaints.

1381
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,760
You know, we've had problems before,

1382
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,460
but we're gonna hang in there

1383
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,380
as long as we can.

1384
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,060
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1385
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,340
the gallows have been built,

1386
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,320
so let's keep hanging.

1387
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,240
And nobody's gonna...

1388
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:34,880
Nobody's gonna come back.

1389
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,980
Nobody's gonna talk about your shoes

1390
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,220
or say that, you know,

1391
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,720
you left the eggs in there too long

1392
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,560
or there's just, you know,

1393
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,680
some problem with you.

1394
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,420
You know, everyone's gonna

1395
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,740
just be cool with that.

1396
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,420
Hey, who were you hot for

1397
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,680
on the Laugh-In,

1398
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,220
Rowan and Martin Laugh-In show?

1399
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,800
I liked Goldie Hawn.

1400
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,100
Chaz.

1401
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,440
Yeah, I figured you'd be

1402
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,480
the Goldie Hawn,

1403
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,800
but there was Judy Karn,

1404
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,940
which is a little cute English chick.

1405
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:57,640
Nah.

1406
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,900
I liked Joanne.

1407
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,160
Joanne Worley.

1408
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:01,960
Me too, man.

1409
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,340
I was really into...

1410
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,300
I understand.

1411
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:04,880
She was kind of...

1412
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,200
Kind of large and...

1413
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,960
Kind of heavy-boned

1414
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,560
and loud and obnoxious,

1415
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:14,060
but that wide, wide, wide mouth

1416
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,960
just invoked...

1417
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,960
The Queen of Hearts look.

1418
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,340
You like that Queen of Hearts look

1419
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,360
off with their heads

1420
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,260
and referring to your structures

1421
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,180
down there?

1422
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,860
Yeah, I don't know what it is.

1423
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:25,620
I don't...

1424
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,620
I can't put the two and two together.

1425
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,300
Her laugh was just very infectious.

1426
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,800
There's no doubt about it.

1427
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,120
I wonder where she's at now

1428
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,660
and how large and old.

1429
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,840
Well, she's in the old actor's home

1430
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,500
in Pasadena, California.

1431
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,480
Sitting out in the backyard

1432
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,780
watching the Cupid pee in the pond.

1433
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,700
Yeah, she's had her last turkey sandwich

1434
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:48,840
for today, though.

1435
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,580
She's going back in sight

1436
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,580
for her meds.

1437
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,840
Does that little boy ever finish peeing?

1438
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,800
Or does he just be that forever?

1439
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,140
Hasta la semana próxima.

1440
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,700
Keep your back to the wind.

1441
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,280
Keep your hat tight.

1442
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,100
Keep your hat tight.

1443
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:04,100


1444
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:04,100


1445
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,700
Hasta la semana que viene.

1446
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:04,900
Hasta la semana que viene.

1447
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,080
Quedan tus cajones en el...

1448
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,100
¡Adiós!

1449
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,660
Purple haze all in my brain

1450
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,940
Little things just don't seem the same

1451
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:55,280
I'm acting funny, but I don't know why

1452
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,480
Excuse me while I kiss the sky

1453
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,980
Ba-dum-dum-dum, ba-dum-dum-dum

1454
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,940
Purple haze all around

1455
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,440
Don't know if I'm going up or down

1456
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,560
Am I happy, am I in misery

1457
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:19,180
Whatever it is that girl put her smell on me

1458
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,600
Ba-dum-dum-dum, ba-dum-dum-dum

1459
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:27,320
Oh, purple baby, purple baby

1460
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,420
Purple haze

1461
00:58:32,980 --> 00:59:02,960
Ba-dum-dum-dum, ba-dum-dum-dum

1462
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,360
Purple haze all around

1463
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,400
I'm acting funny, but I don't know why

1464
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,620
Excuse me while I kiss the sky

1465
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:18,180
Ba-dum-dum-dum, ba-dum-dum-dum

1466
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:18,500
Purple haze all around

1467
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:18,660
Don't know if I'm going up or down

1468
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:23,060
Ba-dum-dum-dum, ba-dum-dum-dum

1469
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,300
Purple haze all around

1470
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,860
Ba-dum-dum-dum, ba-dum-dum-dum

1471
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:41,480
Yeah, purple haze all around my eyes

1472
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,960
Can't tell you if it's day or night, baby

1473
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:50,120
You got me blowing, you're blowing my mind

1474
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,480
Is it a tomorrow or just the end of time?

1475
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,800
Ba-dum-dum-dum, ba-dum-dum-dum

1476
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:02,720
Oh, purple baby, purple baby

1477
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:02,960
Oh, purple baby, purple baby

1478
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,640
Oh, purple haze

1479
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,140
Yeah, oh, purple haze

1480
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,980
Yeah, oh, purple haze

1481
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,740
Yeah, oh, purple haze

1482
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:18,580
All right

1483
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,620
The Psychoskeletons

1484
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,780
A real oldie and before that

1485
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,640
ESO Swamp Radio with Professor Chaz

1486
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,420
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and me

1487
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,880
Ivan Stagg from May 2001

1488
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,140
And ancient Firesign Theatre

1489
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:48,100
from dope humor of the 70s

1490
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:51,020
Mostly that's their old radio shows

1491
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,520
that they did in Los Angeles

1492
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,720
or was it San Francisco?

1493
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:00,320
Anyway, and also we played excerpts

1494
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,280
stretches of soundtrack from Sandy Boone's documentary film

1495
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,160
about the Church of the Subgenius

1496
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,980
everything about what you might possibly want to know

1497
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:14,840
being at subgenius.com

1498
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:19,060
There is no O in subgenius

1499
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,640
Praise Bob

1500
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,320
That does have an O in it

1501
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,660
From PR News in Washington

1502
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:30,300
I'm described in letters sent to the House Intelligence Committee on Friday and Friday

1503
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,300
First reported in the PR Report

1504
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,500
Bob told PR

1505
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,640
The administration does not want to help end what he calls PR News, Washington

1506
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,100
Police in Germany have arrested the head of PR
