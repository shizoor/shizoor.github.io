1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,620
Thanks, Bob.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,360
You did kill him, my son, didn't you?

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,840
Yes, I killed him.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,560
Yes, I killed him.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,040
And I'll even show you how.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:12,860
No!

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,620
No!

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,880
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,040
Thanks, Bob.

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,880
Bob.

11
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,380
But we have gone beyond that now in the post-Christian age.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,680
Developing new evolutionary forms of religious expression.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,960
For nothing stands still.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,580
It's interesting, however, that in the 17th century,

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,920
Milton mentions time control.

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,940
The possibility of reversion through time and other things.

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,980
And my most recent researches seem to have shown that Dante,

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,100
in the end of the 13th or the beginning of the 14th century,

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,900
smoked marijuana in producing his Divine Comedy.

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,980
Which was called...

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,660
The Hour of Slack, number 1109.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,940
You have the number.

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,660
That's not in my memory bank.

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,540
Black is the color and none is the number.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,240
And 1998 is yet ere nigh.

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,060
It spreads its black wings still to enfold us all.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,120
For...

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,660
For...

29
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,960
For the time being, we who awaited the saucers

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,460
were once again not taken up but let down.

31
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,340
And yet is it not a lesson from Bob

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,600
that the end could come when ye least expect it.

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,460
Ye never know when the master cometh.

34
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,220
So always have a tissue handy.

35
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,200
Boy, that's an old one.

36
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,120
An aphorism.

37
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,540
And the old ones are watching at all times.

38
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,540
Yes.

39
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,500
Waiting for the clue that will tell them

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,580
when Bob will arise and the Exists return.

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,880
The Earthshaker, Cthulhu,

42
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,880
hidden in his subterranean adytum,

43
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,200
and much closer at hand in the woods,

44
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,520
the endless fertile being Shub-Niggurath,

45
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,380
the goat with a thousand young,

46
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,400
and many more old friends,

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,340
which we call upon to help us in this,

48
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,780
our hour of need,

49
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,820
when the Exists seem to have snubbed us.

50
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,480
However, let us not be so sure,

51
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,420
as to think we can interpret these celestial doings on the spot.

52
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:43,380
Prophecies never happen where you feel that they are exactly the way they were supposed to be.

53
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,920
And yet prophecy heeded is prophecy fulfilled, my friends.

54
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,220
If the conspiracy reads in Dateline for Dominance

55
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,020
that there's going to be five million subgeniuses by 1986,

56
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,460
they'll take steps to make sure there's only five subgeniuses.

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,360
That's if not counting the cryptos,

58
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,340
the hidden subgeniuses,

59
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,980
or the latent subgeniuses,

60
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,740
only waiting for the activity words of Dobbs to swing into action.

61
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,400
Sleeper agents who've never seen a Dobbs head,

62
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,580
but at that moment,

63
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,160
when the Dobbs head looms before them,

64
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,220
suddenly they remember everything that was implanted in them,

65
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,780
in the womb.

66
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,880
It's the dots that do it, friends.

67
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,460
All the Dobbs heads without dots are artistic tropes.

68
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:29,460


69
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:29,460


70
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:29,460


71
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,080
You've got to have those dots to activate the hidden subgenius sleeper cells.

72
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,020
And then what a march there will be on all the centers of the world

73
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:46,240
when blank-eyed shuffling subgeniuses overwhelm all forms of government and instrumentality.

74
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,820
We call it the Million Zombie March,

75
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,000
or shuffle as the case may be.

76
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,360
Now some people say zombies are over and pirates are over,

77
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,840
but, you know,

78
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,480
I will believe that when I see no more zombie and pirate paraphernalia and merchandise.

79
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,780
I'd rather choose to believe that the era of the zombie pirate is just beginning,

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,900
and totally eponymous to our era.

81
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,280
Which means that the zombie pirate porn will be just around the corner after that.

82
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,320
Yes.

83
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,960
Then the zombie pirate plumper porn,

84
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,360
which is what I'm waiting for.

85
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,820
Ah, well, I hope it comes soon for you, Reverend Steele.

86
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,420
Dang, I know how it might ease your cares.

87
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,280
At my age, nothing comes soon.

88
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,380
Well, you know, there are advantages to that.

89
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,000
But eventually, you know.

90
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,940
That's right. All things come to he who waits.

91
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,140
However, this is not the strategy of our kind.

92
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,120
Our kind being, let me be absolutely clear about this,

93
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,440
the reptile kind.

94
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,460
The reptilian stem, going back to the estemnosuchians,

95
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,820
our close relative the pelicosauri,

96
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:56,820


97
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,480
splashing around in the swamps of the Permian age,

98
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,720
long before the Mesozoic reigned.

99
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,440
For these beings were the inheritors of the horrible age of giant insects

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,580
that they never tell you about in school.

101
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,520
And there are two strategies.

102
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,900
The insectile strategy of waiting for one's food to come,

103
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,820
and the vertebrate strategy, or reptile strategy,

104
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,740
which is to wander and seek.

105
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,480
And we are the inheritors of that.

106
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,940
The reptile tradition, still wandering and seeking today,

107
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,460
to find we know not what,

108
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,220
but to fill the missing jigsaw puzzle in our programming.

109
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,620
And when that clicks in, we will truly know ultimate bliss

110
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,540
that now we can hardly even conceive.

111
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,540
We need only to see the C in slack.

112
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,960
We've got all the slack except for the C that precedes the K.

113
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,720
And that important curvature is held up by...

114
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,040
many unfortunate problems afflicting the world today.

115
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,180
Many suspect the crescent on general principles,

116
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,140
but we must enfold it into our subgenius amalgam,

117
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,420
or risk not succeeding in our great mission and task.

118
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,960
We can't remain divided into Sumis and Shiites.

119
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,400
Certainly not.

120
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,360
And it's not going to be handed to us on a plate,

121
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,060
like Shiite on a shingle.

122
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,760
Ah, yes, dear friends, but that time will come

123
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,640
if we but maintain our faith in Bob.

124
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,960
Yes, keep up the F.I.B.

125
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,740
And keep donating, donating, yes,

126
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,920
because that is the power, your love.

127
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,500
It's not that Bob needs the money,

128
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,640
it's that he needs your...

129
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,460
he needs to know that you trust him.

130
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,440
And how else can he know that,

131
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,600
unless you give up that which means more to you

132
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,220
than life itself, or your children?

133
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,360
So let your fleek frag fry.

134
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,000
And let Dobbs fly high.

135
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,460
We run into people who get the subgenius thing mixed up.

136
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,060
They think that the money grubbing is the joke,

137
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,720
and that the humans versus the subgeniuses

138
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,560
is the serious part.

139
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,480
No, we're much more serious about the money.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,020
Yes, we don't...

141
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,720
And we, only Dobbs can know who is a true subgenius

142
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,120
and who is a pink boy.

143
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,720
That's true, we could all be unpleasantly surprised by that.

144
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,140
But that's where the F.I.B. comes in.

145
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,700
One must have the faith in Bob.

146
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,300
A faith that can move a mountain

147
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,900
a few centimeters to the right to improve the view.

148
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,280
Friends, the judgmental will be at the judgment.

149
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,460
So judge ye not, unless ye hath paid.

150
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,620
Or slipped the judge a fiver or something equivalent.

151
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,480
Yes. You know what to tell the judge, friends.

152
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,020
We're talking about flesh and blood.

153
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,700
We're talking about human imperfection.

154
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,100
This isn't metaphorical!

155
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,080
There's a judge beyond that,

156
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,640
and he can't be bribed and can only be influenced

157
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,040
by maybe your sob story as a subgenius.

158
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,540
That's called prayer, friends.

159
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,180
Actually, you know, most subgeniuses don't pray

160
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,000
because we realize that Bob may not be the only one tuning in.

161
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,460
And when Negi hears your prayer,

162
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,080
then he knows just what to deny you.

163
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,020
Or he knows what you fear.

164
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,060
And so pretty soon on eBay or Amazon.com

165
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,680
comes a package which appears to satisfy the judge.

166
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,060
And it's not just a package that satisfies your lustful cravings,

167
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,360
but actually whisks them away from your clutching rookers,

168
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,520
just as you think you would be satisfied.

169
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,240
An endlessly receiving and receding mirror gallery of pleasures

170
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,940
that withdraw as fast as you advance.

171
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,400
False slack created by the conspiracy

172
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,360
to divert you from the true slack

173
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,120
which might be much closer at hand.

174
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,260
But many give this concept lip service.

175
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,120
Few choose to investigate,

176
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,300
to see how real it might be.

177
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,960
But oh my friends, it is real.

178
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,580
As real as the nose on your face.

179
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,540
As real as anything in this sub-lunar world of ours.

180
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,040
Yes, on the other hand,

181
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,180
seeking your slack while on the job can get you in trouble.

182
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,820
Well, the job is nowhere to find slack.

183
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,000
Depending on what your slack is.

184
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,680
Some people like their job, and that is their slack.

185
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,100
Well, depending on what your job is,

186
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,700
yes, that also is an important aspect.

187
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,140
But to slave in the coils of the conspiracy's bowels is unfortunately...

188
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,000
If only I could quit this Bob Dobbs job

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,860
and go to work for someplace like Walmart.

190
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,080
I'm afraid that, as you know,

191
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,500
the so-called hierarchy,

192
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,280
or perhaps we should say, lorarchy,

193
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,140
must give away slack to bring it to others.

194
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,460
The element of sacrifice...

195
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,180
That's right. We pee test, friends.

196
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,640
And if you don't have enough indications of slack abuse in your blood,

197
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,960
then we let you go.

198
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,880
It's hell, baby.

199
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,320
You gotta keep...

200
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,920
I have to pass that pee test

201
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,800
by filling my body with what the conspiracy would call terrible vaccines.

202
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,940
And yet, that's part of the job.

203
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,400
Somebody has to do it, I guess.

204
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,920
Dr. Howell, like myself,

205
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,080
has managed to achieve some success.

206
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,900
In the seeking of slack as an art bum, yes.

207
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,220
Some think that's a bad thing.

208
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,980
Well, in fact, it's difficult to evolve

209
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,360
to the position of being an art bum.

210
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,860
Not actually having a so-called job.

211
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,780
And it takes a lot out of you.

212
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,820
There's all that backing and filling,

213
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,100
ducking and weaving,

214
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,520
especially around tax time.

215
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,380
But worthwhile in the ultimate end of things.

216
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,980
There's almost as much lying involved

217
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,500
as being a preacher.

218
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,220
You have to figure it out.

219
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,760
It's either that you never work

220
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,040
and are always on vacation,

221
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
or that you are always at work

222
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,220
and never on vacation.

223
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,120
Praise Bob. That's the emergentile way.

224
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,740
Yes.

225
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,740
Never sleeping is the vacation.

226
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,480
It is possible. It can be done.

227
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,220
It is not some pie-in-the-sky scheme.

228
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,500
But really...

229
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,080
It's no pipe dream, friends.

230
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,620
No.

231
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,680
But Dobbs knew this,

232
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,520
and knew that such a message

233
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,660
could be smoked in his pipe

234
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,540
like a fine...

235
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,160
And when you smoke of him,

236
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,820
then he is inside you, my friend.

237
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,420
Whatever that mixture might be.

238
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,980
A rum-soaked shag, some say.

239
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,280
Or a shredded-up Dobbs head,

240
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,920
cut into little pieces

241
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,060
and crammed into a pipe.

242
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,880
Old, tattered, sun-brittled copies

243
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,380
of Queejeebo tamped down into the bowl.

244
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,080
Set sail on your hallucinations

245
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,040
by smoking Chris Lee's zine, Queejeebo,

246
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,460
available at the Queejeebo Cartel Camp.

247
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,460
Yeah, I've got to get down there and get mine.

248
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,320
I haven't seen the latest-ish,

249
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,400
but that's going to be one of the trophies

250
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,600
that I bear away from this festival.

251
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes, friends, there's a new subgenius product

252
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,540
out every five minutes,

253
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,060
and you never know how long it will take.

254
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,200
How long they'll stay in the shop

255
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,940
or in the catalog.

256
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,400
You must snatch them up,

257
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,880
just as you expect Bob to snatch you up

258
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,980
into those escaped saucers.

259
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,320
Ah, on that...

260
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,040
that promised day.

261
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,820
You must pile these up as your earthly treasures

262
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,300
and not think that they will be carried along with you

263
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,560
to subgenius heaven.

264
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,180
These are just things.

265
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,460
They are, but they are your special subgeniusly things

266
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,060
that can go into your large piles

267
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,320
of paper that seem to overwhelm you,

268
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,640
towers of books which may fall

269
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,880
or plastic dinosaurs which may fall

270
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,280
and injure you,

271
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,340
but it's worthwhile to assemble these pharaonic things

272
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,580
as though you were living in your tomb

273
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,600
where you want to be buried with all your cool stuff.

274
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,720
Because like the snapping of a thaw of ice

275
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,680
or the snapping of a harp string,

276
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,760
you will be jerked out of this plenum

277
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,240
as Apollo jerked the unfortunate star,

278
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,080
the unfortunate satyr, Marcius,

279
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,140
and skinless and skinned,

280
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,340
fresh and new-boned,

281
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,240
be ready for the Exists

282
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,840
who need not so much of your crap

283
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,820
as you might think.

284
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,780
You can take it with you,

285
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,040
but you won't care about it once you get there.

286
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,100
All worthless detritus,

287
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,480
useless ballast in the gyroscopic stability

288
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,340
of the bottom of the saucer.

289
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,240
But it's great for juvenile fantasy,

290
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
about what you're going to do on Ex Day.

291
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,200
And it reminds you of your...

292
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,000
I have dibs on the Rijksmuseum, by the way, in Amsterdam.

293
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,380
As you look about and see this stuff,

294
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,720
it does bring into mind

295
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,020
what your praxis might be.

296
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,540
And so, not as anything in value of itself,

297
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,100
but as for what it can stimulate in the old bean,

298
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,400
it has considerable value.

299
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,340
While everything else,

300
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,320
the pathetic plastic products of the conspiracy,

301
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,600
as always, only obscure these important sight rays.

302
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,080
Like when you take LSD,

303
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,420
if I might inject a personal note,

304
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,960
how everything looks unpleasant

305
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,060
except stuff like wood and stone and so forth.

306
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,220
Because you tend to bring out

307
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,060
your long withheld and suppressed suspicion

308
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,340
of different molecular chains

309
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,040
which were never intended to support

310
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,740
a human like yourself.

311
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,540
Actually, Dr. Howell,

312
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,560
that's an interesting observation

313
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,080
because I one time went to the Dallas Museum of Fine Art,

314
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,900
as the kids say, tripping my ass off.

315
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,640
And I wasn't impressed until I got back out to my car.

316
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,620
I sat in the parking lot and looked at rust stains

317
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,600
on the sides of old cars and on fences

318
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,300
and the gravel on the parking lot.

319
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,740
The uninitiated...

320
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,300
It was so much better than any of that fancy schmancy,

321
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,040
what they call artwork.

322
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,300
Yes, sir.

323
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,020
Right.

324
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,680
And the unrevealed see Jesus' face

325
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,480
in these rust stains and pizza pie crusts.

326
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,740
I'm not saying I didn't suffer

327
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,700
serious brain damage that afternoon.

328
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,160
You do suffer brain damage.

329
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,080
I wouldn't recommend that to anybody.

330
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,640
No, we don't recommend it.

331
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,500
You do suffer serious brain damage.

332
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,280
And at the same time, it is the only way to proceed.

333
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,660
So, you know, it's a trade-off.

334
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:46,780


335
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,200
Yeah, you know, you get nothing for nothing.

336
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,960
It's a bargain, really, in the way things are.

337
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,180
Speaking of a bargain,

338
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,500
you've got plenty of brain cells.

339
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:55,980
You're Sister Susie the Floozy.

340
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,760
There she is, looking lovely, light and summery.

341
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,060
Actually, she looks like she was up at 7 o'clock this morning

342
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,340
waiting for saucers.

343
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,720
She has that bitter look of the shattered dreams.

344
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,260
So, I looked up.

345
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,260


346
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,540
I and so looked you.

347
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,340
But we were not necessarily disappointed,

348
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,960
only further trained by the Exists.

349
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,400
Trained not to be an exuberant puppy

350
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,780
leaping up, slobbering and salivating

351
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,860
at the prospect of an immediate gratification.

352
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,920
No, we have to grow.

353
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,640
We have to grow in Bob like an expanding tumor

354
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,000
until we can finally achieve the true fullness

355
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,240
of the experience.

356
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,880
Nightmare future.

357
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,720
This is usually the part when people start screaming.

358
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,100
Who could see the future?

359
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,420
Face of evil.

360
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,180
This isn't just random, okay?

361
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,920
This is destiny.

362
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,800
It's not some fantasy, okay?

363
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,720
I explode.

364
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,140
It was natural selection.

365
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,960
You just don't get it.

366
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,420
Maybe I'm not the bomb.

367
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,920
I have to find a nuclear man.

368
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,820
Now I got you.

369
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,560
Put him up or I'll blow you to bits.

370
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,340
You need to behave.

371
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,680
My destiny is not to shoot you.

372
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,120
The universe cannot be that lame.

373
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,320
You're not run away from who you are

374
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,060
or someone's gonna blow.

375
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,520
Me?

376
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,600
I'm not normal.

377
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,660
I tried to pretend that I was

378
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,740
and I just hurt everyone.

379
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,140
My mom, my dad.

380
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,280
I'm not normal either

381
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,320
and neither is the subgenius church event.

382
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,480
I hope I'll be those kind of folks.

383
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,380
Maybe there won't be any otra

384
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:01,620
woman ever.

385
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,160
And half.

386
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,680
you don't get to see a真的

387
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,700
sheer psychiathe.

388
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,220
I'm an今天

389
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,720
end of the world at 7 a.m.

390
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,540
This would be the place to flip.

391
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,560
I'm not sure it has been 7 a.m. yet.

392
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,300
It's difficult.

393
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,200
Until someone switches off the holodeck, none of us are going to know what's going on around

394
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,520
here.

395
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,840
We don't know what year this is.

396
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,660
We don't even know what planet this is.

397
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,740
Yes, I know.

398
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,960
That slight dizziness you feel may be the rocking, the listing of the great saucer from

399
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,700
side to side as it shifts through cosmic sleet storms and other indignities.

400
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,560
I thought that was just a hangover.

401
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:57,360
Well, you know, it's through all the baffles and so on that they use to negate the effects

402
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,940
of physics.

403
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,780
A little bit of it slips through, like in Star Trek, and they all fall out of their

404
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:09,400
chairs, even though they're solving other complicated problems in starting the spaceship,

405
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,600
which is really hard.

406
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,760
And even harder, stopping the spaceship.

407
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,160
Anyway, fortunately, that's not my lookout.

408
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,120
I don't have to worry about complex problems in astrogation.

409
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:27,100
All I have to do is have faith that they will give me a halfway decent stateroom and that

410
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,260
it will have the proper facilities for my comfort.

411
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,380
Well, by stateroom, we're talking about an entire world of your own making.

412
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,580
Yes, just large enough for me and the Volcanic.

413
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:40,580


414
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,560
Fulfillment of some of my less well-adjusted fantasies.

415
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,120
But really, friends, why do you have to wait for the saucers for that?

416
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,160
Did Bob not exhort us to relax in the safety of our own delusions?

417
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,020
That, I think, is what we're supposed to be doing out here.

418
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,140
Build your own shit?

419
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,080
I mean, ship?

420
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,380
Ship.

421
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,880
Didn't Dr. Leary take too much and say reality is what you make of it or something stupid

422
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,980
like that?

423
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,960
Because what a lie that is.

424
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,200
It works until you stub your toe.

425
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,900
And then all of a sudden, all that fancy disattachment and it's all gone.

426
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,980
Well, you've got to have faith.

427
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,740
You stub your toe and it hurts.

428
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,720
It's interesting.

429
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:26,380
I had a chance to talk to Tim Leary the year before he died.

430
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,960
And he became interested in talking to me when he learned I was a subgenius.

431
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,880
Yes.

432
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,540
How about that?

433
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,280
Dr. Leary has sat right where you are sitting now here at Starwood.

434
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,040
And bullshitted his fool ass off.

435
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,560
And in a greater sense, he still sits among us, spreading confusion among us all.

436
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,380
That's right.

437
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,080
He was a really funny guy.

438
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,840
Whenever I met, I opened for him several times.

439
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,720
Sort of elfin character of light humor.

440
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:04,520
He would always, every time, he'd go, I'm supposed to be quitting smoking.

441
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,480
Can I bum a cigarette?

442
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,300
And I'd go, do you really want three or four?

443
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:08,780
Oh, yeah.

444
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,120
Thanks.

445
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,620
That'd be great.

446
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,260
There you go.

447
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:17,960
I think he mooched cigarettes through the last 25 years of his life during which he was trying to quit smoking.

448
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,800
As if to demonstrate that the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.

449
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:30,180
Was it him or Abby Hoffman that got busted on an airline disabling the smoke detector in the bathroom?

450
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,380
Like a kid in junior high.

451
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,700
That was Abby Hoffman, but at least he never went on the...

452
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,440
No, Leary got busted at the Austin airport for smoking.

453
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,240
A cigarette in the airport.

454
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Well, Abby Hoffman did too.

455
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,280
They both did.

456
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,780
But one was in an airplane and one was in the airport.

457
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,560
Well, what I used to do is you take the train, see?

458
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,200
Especially when you go through all this horrible hassle at the airport where they search you.

459
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,480
I'm always thinking of those old ads in the 1940s that said, next time, take the train.

460
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,340
And I do take it whenever possible.

461
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,140
It's not practical.

462
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,300
It's not practical to take it out here, although we might think of that for the future.

463
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,300
And what you do is you go into the end of the car where they have a little bathroom and you stand on the toilet.

464
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:26,480
And at the top of the compartment, there's a little fan that whisks the smoke, I mean the odor, outside the car.

465
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:34,680
And you just smoke your prop stick in there and then bounce back to your seat and enjoy the spectacle outside for hours.

466
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,500
I was just talking about illegal tobacco cigarettes.

467
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,020
Well, one man's wacky...

468
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,100
That's much more illegal.

469
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,100


470
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,100


471
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,100


472
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,260
Tobacco is another prohibited carcinogen stick.

473
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,080
It matters not.

474
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,580
The point is you've got to get around these regulations.

475
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,240
They are a test, an obstacle course.

476
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:59,340
You're not supposed to accede to them in a bovine manner of acceptance.

477
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:07,040
But figure your plan in your vertebrate destiny of being a rover and a seeker.

478
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,040
As long as there's...

479
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,340
There's an eye in the sky peering down at all of us wondering what the hell you're all doing here at this time of the year,

480
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,420
waiting for aliens to come and pick you up and it never happens.

481
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,560
But you continue to come back and you continue...

482
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,120
It's like this.

483
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,920
It's like this.

484
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,300
Stop that substance abuser now, baby.

485
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,860
I can't you see that by talk is driving him crazy.

486
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,020
Because you kick them in the face, it's such a damn disgrace

487
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,240
The way you treat them and you beat them and knock them in the face

488
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,800
Stop abusing that, stop abusing now, baby

489
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,300
Stop abusing that, stop abusing now, baby

490
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,460
Stop abusing that, stop abusing now, honey

491
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,180
His brain's coming out of his ears

492
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,840
And you think that's funny

493
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:13,380
Now you kick him in the face, it's such a damn disgrace

494
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,300
Come on, baby, come on, this way

495
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,280
Stop abusing that, stop abusing now, baby

496
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,620
Stop abusing that, stop abusing now, baby

497
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,280
Stop abusing that, stop abusing now, baby

498
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,440
Come on, girl, you get your job

499
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,060
Stop

500
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:15,800
Ain't no one in the house

501
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,500
You got us all in the house

502
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,580
Just want us to get a move on

503
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,340
And you're not going anywhere

504
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,340


505
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,340


506
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,340


507
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,000
Baby, we'll make it through

508
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,980
Hoping you'll be with us

509
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,880
Abusing that substance abuser now, mama

510
00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:00,480
Oh, can't you see that you're giving that boy head trauma

511
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,800
Cause you kicked him in the knee and then you made him bleed

512
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,580
And then you sucked up in the eye and then you made him cry

513
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:19,200
Oh, can't you see that you're giving that boy head trauma

514
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,120
Abusing that substance abuser now, mama

515
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,140
Okay, the cadence was all wrong. We've got to do it again. Wait a minute.

516
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,980
This whole business of prescription and non-prescription drugs is nothing but a racket.

517
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,040
Why can't we just buy the drugs we want

518
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,360
without having to get some chicken poop prescription filled out by a doctor

519
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,460
who's probably working on a drug that's not good for you?

520
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,200
He's got no car bombs in his spare time anyway.

521
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,560
Oh, my God!

522
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,960
All right, friends.

523
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:17,880
At least it's not entirely bright here, so you can see the video projections.

524
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,820
So instructive. Each one worth a thousand words.

525
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,080
Well, I'm looking in the opposite direction.

526
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,720
Once again, I have to give up slack to provide it to others.

527
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,440
Well, you know, it takes some fine adjustment to get this on track.

528
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,700
A1 at Lloyd's, ship shape and squared away, capital, imperial, whatever.

529
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,640
But we will manage to do it.

530
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,640
That is our task, the task that is set before us.

531
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,580
It's not like we're going to do anything with that video anyway.

532
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,760
Well, that video might do something with us.

533
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,320
You never know. Oh, friends, actually, speaking of...

534
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,040
We...

535
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,360
We should, in fact, always have the cameras running,

536
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:10,700
because last year I shot 15 rolls of tape, went through there 15 hours.

537
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,960
And a couple of weeks ago, before we came out here,

538
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,220
I decided to look at the footage and swiftly edit a 9 Next Day DVD,

539
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,600
which I sort of did, but in the...

540
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,960
Always leave everything to the last minute.

541
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,520
And then that desperate urgency will produce creative miracles.

542
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,640
Well, I was looking at the footage,

543
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,120
and I saw the footage of 7 a.m. last year,

544
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,900
and it was more like 7.20.

545
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,860
And we were...

546
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,020
Some funny cloud appeared in the sky,

547
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,740
and we were going, maybe that's a thing.

548
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,260
It looks like a cow.

549
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,300
It looked like a cow's anus, to be more precise.

550
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,140
Well, that's what we eventually decided on.

551
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,660
And I swung the camera around and filmed Suzy.

552
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,040
We'll show you this when it's darker and you can see it clearly.

553
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,300
Yeah, you need to look closely, like all pictures of this kind.

554
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,120
There was a UFO out here.

555
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,720
As you look at the video,

556
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,520
and no one is looking in that direction,

557
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,540
except I guess I was with my camera,

558
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,760
and I vaguely remember kind of seeing this light.

559
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,900
You can see it pass by behind Reverend Suzy the floozy's head

560
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,740
while she's talking and emoting.

561
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,220
Yeah, it's amazing.

562
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,140
And the funny thing is,

563
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,620
she's whining about how no saucers showed up.

564
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,580
And there in the back, zip, it crosses.

565
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,960
Yeah, it goes right by.

566
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,280
And then the camera pans over and it's gone.

567
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,980
It's like it's just vanished completely.

568
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,480
But then when it comes back, Suzy's vanished too.

569
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,800
It's like a meteor.

570
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:41,380
If you're not looking at the quadrant of the sky where it zips across,

571
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,340
you will miss it.

572
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,520
If people say, oh, the meteor, and then you look up, you've missed it.

573
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,740
You have to be looking.

574
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah, it's really, it's...

575
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,660
Yeah.

576
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,840
So you never know.

577
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,840
That's why we always keep the cameras running.

578
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,880
Of course, we never find anything interesting on what they record until you do.

579
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,140
Years and years later, that's the problem, I guess.

580
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,500
Just as many of the most interesting prehistoric fossil discoveries

581
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,180
are made from stuff that's already been collected years ago

582
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,100
and is in drawers at museums

583
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,720
where they haven't had time to get around to looking at it.

584
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,300
But there's always something to be found by rifling through your drawers

585
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,020
if you simply take the right time to do it

586
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,040
and are in the right state of mind.

587
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,240
But you have to be wearing drawers.

588
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,320
Well, or somebody does.

589
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,700
There's no point in rifling through empty drawers.

590
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,040
That's not what I or Bob recommends.

591
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,240
It's astonishing how Bob, without any real storehouse of knowledge,

592
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,260
is always so spot on.

593
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,860
But there's an interesting parallel.

594
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,160
I was speaking of Jesus a little while ago.

595
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,020
Apparently, he led a rather dull life as a carpenter

596
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,340
until about age 33 when he was immaculated

597
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,760
by John the Baptist, as you all know,

598
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,380
if you like your Bible story.

599
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,600
But Dobbs, in a more contemporary version,

600
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,140
messing around with the back of an experimental television set

601
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,820
of his own design, also at age 33,

602
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:15,780
was made to hear the important pronunciamentos

603
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:20,020
of Jehovah One, a senile space god

604
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,560
who had seen better days.

605
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,320
And this, of course, we call the Prescriptive.

606
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:25,520
Cheers.

607
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,880
On the way to X-Day

608
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,320
I had my say

609
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:25,320


610
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,500
I had my slack

611
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,300
Taken away

612
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,240
On the way

613
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,980
To X-Day

614
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,580
The conspiracy stole

615
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,900
What was most precious to me

616
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,400
But I will survive

617
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,460
I can take it this long

618
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,760
I will survive

619
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,760
But they will hear my song

620
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,600
I will survive

621
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,880
I've lived on this planet this long

622
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,860
I will survive

623
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,580
But I'll get what's mine

624
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,060
I'll survive

625
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,100
By hook or crook

626
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,940
By treason or truth

627
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,580
If I have to lie, cheat, kill and steal

628
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,400
I will regain

629
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,220
Live up to my name

630
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,420
I will take back

631
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,360
My mother-fucking-slack

632
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,060
I'll appreciate what's mine

633
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:45,740
Live on the streets

634
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:45,820
I have grown up

635
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,340
In a city not far from Hola

636
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,180
Same old country

637
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,960
Stay on my words

638
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,620
I've lost my ownom

639
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,120
Dorothy

640
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,200
Dorothy

641
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,880
Thank you.

642
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,400
Thank you.

643
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,380
Thank you.

644
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,840
But I'll get it back.

645
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,560
You can count on that.

646
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,100
I have my ways.

647
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,820
The conspiracy will pay.

648
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,160
So join me, brothers and sisters,

649
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,060
great soldiers of the subgenius army.

650
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,180
We have a target to take out.

651
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,180
And we...

652
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,840
We need you!

653
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,200
Your task, soldiers,

654
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,400
are to infiltrate the...

655
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,500
All right.

656
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,580
Get them across at their bella

657
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,500
and break over the highway.

658
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,340
Get all these women and shivers.

659
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,200
We'll give those little monkeys

660
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,560
a dose of their own surprise.

661
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,620
Here they come.

662
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,680
Get those shivers.

663
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,760
Let them have it.

664
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,640
That's it.

665
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,920
Look at them little monkeys go down.

666
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,320
Ha ha!

667
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,840
So, folks,

668
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,100
we may think that we've got off

669
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,260
easy and we're coasting through this apocalypse.

670
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,280
So there's a secret feeling of relief.

671
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,160
I know it well,

672
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,560
that we don't have to leave off our hand

673
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,040
on the reins of all our earthly steeds

674
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,100
and go off in some discorporate form,

675
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,760
like wrapped tubes of bologna

676
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,880
in a steel cylinder aboard a saucer.

677
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,260
You know, that will be fine when it happens.

678
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,900
Maybe we think that we're...

679
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,920
that we got off easy.

680
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,800
But as Reverend Stang,

681
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,420
so importantly said,

682
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,160
ye never will know when it happens.

683
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,380
It will come on us like a thief in the night,

684
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,640
swiftly and inexorably.

685
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,600
All that the July 5th meeting hour is,

686
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,280
is the starting point.

687
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,400
And like a hawk or falcon,

688
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,400
the exes could swoop down

689
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,780
and bear us off to their mansion in the sky,

690
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,640
where there are hot

691
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
and cold running impossibilities.

692
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,100
Now, if you've ever looked at the edge of medieval maps,

693
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,620
and I know I always do,

694
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,060
you may notice that there are some strange creatures

695
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,720
doodled into the margins by the antique cartographers.

696
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,680
It seems that at one time,

697
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,120
the oceans of this planet, our terraqueous globe,

698
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,840
swarmed with sea serpents of all kinds,

699
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,020
and such kinds, for example, there was a spouting,

700
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,020
serpentine form, which they call a physiter,

701
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,920
similar to, but not a whale, very like a whale.

702
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,100
Far less like a whale was the scolopendra,

703
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,980
or sea scorpion,

704
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,400
which had many fins or legs along its length.

705
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,320
But one of the most awesome of these prehistoric sea beasts

706
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,360
was Phastotoclon, the giant turtle.

707
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,960
And Professor Udemunds, in his invaluable book on sea serpents,

708
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,080
has regretted that.

709
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,080


710
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,040
He has regretfully said that he must decline

711
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,860
to accept the validity of the giant turtle.

712
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,120
It's just too preposterous.

713
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,600
Yes, well, he's, science has to be conservative.

714
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,680
And we know that as far as the great cosmic scheme,

715
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,440
it's turtles all the way down.

716
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,860
Even Stephen Hawking now says it's turtles all the way down.

717
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,680
Did you notice that?

718
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,300
But the great turtle, Phastotoclon,

719
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,700
to the medievals represented the devil,

720
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,860
who takes you in by his wiles and then drowns you.

721
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,400
Because this huge floating turtle, reported by all authorities,

722
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,860
anyone who's ever been on the sea,

723
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,020
is seen in all the waters of the world.

724
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,860
And it appears to be an island.

725
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,800
So people get off and they walk on it,

726
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,520
but then pretty soon he flips over and that's that.

727
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,800
And so let me say this.

728
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,120
Look.

729
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,400
There is Phastotoclon.

730
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,200
An island safe to land upon,

731
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,600
although tis rather bare.

732
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,980
Come, leave the sea and let us run,

733
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,720
or dance, or lie down in the sun.

734
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,800
See, gulls are sitting there.

735
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,200
Beware.

736
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,880
Gulls do not sink.

737
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,220
There they may sit or strut and prink.

738
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,720
Their part it is to tip the wink,

739
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,000
if anyone should dare upon that isle,

740
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,600
to settle,

741
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,040
or only for a while to get relief from sickness or the wet,

742
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,400
or maybe boil a kettle.

743
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,540
Ah, foolish folk who land on him,

744
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,400
and little fires proceed to trim,

745
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,920
and hope perhaps for tea.

746
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,080
It may be that his shell is thick.

747
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,940
He seems asleep, but he is quick,

748
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,700
and floats now in the sea with guile.

749
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,360
And when he hears their tapping feet,

750
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,380
or faintly feels the sudden heat,

751
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,640
with smile he dives,

752
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,060
and swiftly turning upside down,

753
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,060
he tips them off, and deep they drown,

754
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,660
and lose their silly lives to their surprise.

755
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,300
Be wise.

756
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:44,060
There are many monsters in the sea,

757
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,380
but none so perilous as he,

758
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,920
old horny fasty-tokalon,

759
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,820
whose mighty kindred all have gone,

760
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,740
the last of the great turtle-fish.

761
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,460
So, if to save your life you wish,

762
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,420
heed this advice.

763
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,100
Pay heed to sailors' ancient lore.

764
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,340
Set foot upon no uncharted shore,

765
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,320
or better still,

766
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,360
your days at peace in mirth

767
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,380
on the green earth fulfill.

768
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,520
That's such a pretty poem.

769
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,120
It reminds me of the pretty poems

770
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,300
in this fine book here,

771
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,600
Dinosaur Alphabet.

772
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,980
Oh yes, that's my book of dinosaur poems,

773
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,380
which I also illustrated.

774
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,680
You brought a copy.

775
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,700
Well, that's nice.

776
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,900
It's all red on the inside.

777
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,400
I hope it's red.

778
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,100
It is read by many.

779
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:39,680
Oh, there.

780
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,540
That's the centerfold.

781
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,380
Oh, yes, baby.

782
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,420
Come on, boys.

783
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,520
I know you like this.

784
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,100
The other pages have the poems,

785
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,640
and that one just opens out to a big picture

786
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,720
of a seismosaurus.

787
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,640
A kind, men-like...

788
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,820
A seismosaurus, as in seismic, earthquake,

789
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,360
you know, causes an earthquake as it goes by.

790
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,940
There's a torosaurus.

791
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,920
The coloring jobs are great.

792
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,860
I wish they'd come out with a coloring book version.

793
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,560
Well, they could because...

794
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,880
So that kids like me could color in your...

795
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,020
your volcanodon here.

796
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,780
Well, volcanodon, that's one of the few...

797
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,040
That's one of the first pieces of art

798
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,160
that I sold from that book.

799
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,180
I've got them all up in an art show

800
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,460
in San Francisco,

801
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,960
in Chicken John's warehouse.

802
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,540
And it'll be up for a while longer.

803
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,920
I had one in New York.

804
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,240
I sold one piece there.

805
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,380
All that fuss, and then...

806
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,700
But, you know, there you go.

807
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,040
There you go.

808
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:43,380
Still available.

809
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:43,880
What you gonna do?

810
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,040
I don't know.

811
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,700
What you gonna do?

812
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,580
You just gotta keep on keeping on.

813
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,400
Yeah, I gotta just keep that pipe lit.

814
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,720
And furthermore, friends,

815
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,480
that pipe is not easy to keep lit.

816
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,860
There are winds that blow from all corners of the cosmos

817
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,380
trying to extinguish that sad, valiant flame.

818
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,140
And the way to keep that pipe lit

819
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,920
is to suck it in,

820
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,840
to suck in all the breath of Bob.

821
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,640
And then maybe you can keep that spark glowing

822
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,900
for a little while longer,

823
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,500
possibly just long enough.

824
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,620
You need good lungs, good lung power,

825
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,500
and not to be too greedy of the smoke,

826
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,660
but to sip it like a fine wine

827
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,760
until you're saturated with the Dobbsian effulgence.

828
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:41,400
You can get that just from staring at one good picture of Bob.

829
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,360
With the dots.

830
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:42,980
Right.

831
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,300
All the others are sort of hieroglyphs,

832
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,060
not really the Dobbs head as we know it.

833
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,440
Too bad Philo isn't here at the moment

834
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,580
because he was instrumental

835
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,560
at plucking the Dobbs head out of the image maelstrom.

836
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,020
Well, we had hundreds of pictures of Bob

837
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,920
because of his modeling career,

838
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,640
but I was there that fine spring day

839
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,280
when we were looking through the yellow pages

840
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,320
of his clip art book.

841
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,340
He said,

842
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,520
there's got to be tons of pictures of Bob in here.

843
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,320
Like here, look in the people section.

844
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,460
There it was.

845
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,640
The grandfather of every Dobbs head you've ever seen,

846
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,740
which we have hidden in our vaults.

847
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,420
Now little does the conspiracy know

848
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,640
until this moment,

849
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,200
there is a virgin Dobbs head in Philo's possession

850
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,740
that has never been duplicated.

851
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,960
It's another copy of that same book of clip art,

852
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,980
but it is a Dobbs head that has been unsullied

853
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,620
by the light of a Xerox machine or a scanner.

854
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,760
Just as the documents of the founding of the United States

855
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,860
are protected from nuclear attack,

856
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:59,020
this sacred Dobbs head is kept well out of the ruck of things,

857
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:03,100
so even the most stringent attack on subgenius

858
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,920
would still preserve it for future generations.

859
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,800
We've been a 30,000 billion pigs!

860
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,160
Before we end this briefing, my soldiers,

861
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,340
I do have to warn you about the dangers of this mission.

862
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:45,020
The conspiracy will stop at nothing to bring you down.

863
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:52,820
These conspiracy terrorists are out to undermine

864
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,060
everything that is important to you.

865
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,220
They will lie, they will cheat, they will steal your slack.

866
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,140
But you're a strong group of soldiers,

867
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,720
and I know you can handle it, men.

868
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,800
Bob is counting on you, Connie's counting on you,

869
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,140
and the home of slackless children, they're counting on you too.

870
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,500
And perhaps we should talk about the curiosities of insect life

871
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,340
of the Borneo forest, eh?

872
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,260
Well, are you saying hot stuff?

873
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,600
I don't know, it could be, another time.

874
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,360
We discovered that, now, most of you were actually here

875
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,260
at 7 o'clock this morning, weren't you?

876
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:58,020
That's right, the fine, faithful, well, we gave them time to rest and recuperate.

877
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,960
We gave them rubbers too, we gave them free Dobbs head or Connie head condoms.

878
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,320
You missed out, Reverend Skull.

879
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,260
Because you slept in.

880
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,680
Now, what would have happened if...

881
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,360
Sleep in, miss out.

882
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:13,980
The rupture.

883
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,380
I think you'd be...

884
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,220
What were you dreaming of when the exes lifted you up

885
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,200
and gave you a planet based on your dream?

886
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:25,820
What if you were just dreaming of driving around lost in the Delaware farmland?

887
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,060
Scrapple.

888
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,400
Some subgeniuses are obsessive, and Reverend Skull, and also Dr. Mr. Sister,

889
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,960
have this scrapple obsession.

890
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,680
That's okay, that's your frop.

891
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,880
I think you'd be vacuumed up.

892
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,340
You'd give me the real frop and you can have the scrapple.

893
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:49,280
You'd end up in the saucer somewhere, but all in a tumbled, tangled condition.

894
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,700
Not prepared the way you ought to have been.

895
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,920
Now, who all is here?

896
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,880
We see, I see a smattering of the faithful.

897
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:05,680
And more arrive all the time because this is a lengthy session that we're having.

898
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,920
Actually, this is a short ex-day drill.

899
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:15,160
That means we're going to have to slack off the hell out of it, or however you put that.

900
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,100
Perhaps you should remind...

901
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,660
We had a whole week last time.

902
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,420
What are some of the delights coming up later today?

903
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,100
Well, let's see.

904
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:28,900
So far, the schedule has been vigorously adhered to.

905
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:34,080
For instance, on the schedule for yesterday, it said secret unannounced July 4th activities.

906
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,040
There you go.

907
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,060
Prophecy fulfilled.

908
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,700
And lo, so it was.

909
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,600
After sunset, Dr. Dark's drive-in.

910
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,960
And then it said Dr. Jam's sermonizing and last rites for Earth.

911
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,540
I presume somebody did that.

912
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,180
I went to bed.

913
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,580
Now, tonight, the drive-in will feature films with a mutant theme, I understand.

914
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,440
Oh, that's right.

915
00:50:54,660 --> 00:51:01,600
Oh, and by the way, if there's inclement weather, the drive-in gets moved to the studio up at the top of the hill.

916
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:05,900
But don't try to park your car inside the studio.

917
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,720
Park it outside.

918
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,600
Walk in to the studio and sit in a chair.

919
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:16,640
Otherwise, it can be out in the field with the clouds of mosquitoes and buzzing, stinging night flies.

920
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,680
You can have a great time.

921
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:24,820
Now, weren't you told that X Day would fail due to the terrible cataclysm of songbirds?

922
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:32,300
Yeah, I was actually told that because there were fewer songbirds that mosquitoes would descend on everyone at X Day and suck them dry.

923
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,000
But so far, this hasn't happened.

924
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,240
I think we can...

925
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,220
You know, there's always a little bit more grace than we think until there isn't.

926
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,860
And plus, that was the president of the pessimist club that told you that.

927
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,580
That's true.

928
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,800
It was the master diplomat of the Church of the Subgenius.

929
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:18,840
Wow.

930
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,660
Well, Erica, you doubt who colonized when you were the Pope.

931
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,200
His brother did too, approximately, he has, if anything.

932
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:22,200


933
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:22,940
So, go screw him.

934
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:23,460
Why's he what?

935
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:23,460


936
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:35,220
Actually, if you let that cataclysm right past him, you would come in cute, pretty, and spraying your 이거는 right there.

937
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,760
Where no one is their equal

938
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,620
Their minds are small like balloons popped with needles

939
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,840
They just drive around

940
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,440
Searching for their dream burritos

941
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,780
Mr. Pibb

942
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,120
Charlie Tuna

943
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,700
Mrs. Butterworth

944
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,780
Chef Boy R.D.

945
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,460
Mr. Goodbar

946
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,580
Twinkie the Kid

947
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,140
Dr. Pepper

948
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,540
Len Paul Newman

949
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:11,460
This is the March of the Insignificant People

950
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,860
They control your mind

951
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,380
With the tools of evil

952
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,860
Abedow's big boy

953
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,280
Reaches past the steeple

954
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,820
Resist the March of the Insignificant People

955
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,840
March of the Insignificant People

956
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,460
By the Chuck Hestons

957
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,200
March of the Insignificant People

958
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:39,460
And before that, friends, everything we heard was recorded at X Day 10

959
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,060
with guitar work by Reverend Angry Larry

960
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:46,580
and Reverend Valor Trucks of Bonobo's Convergence

961
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:50,680
and ranting by Priestess Pisces

962
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,320
and if you want to know more about all of this, see subgenius.com

963
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,900
And now, back to Dr. Howell and the plan.

964
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,900
And further down along the schedule,

965
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,180
what is it that we see?

966
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,460
Well, it says 2 o'clock, Hours of Slack. That's now.

967
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,700
Then it says 4 o'clock, Bulldada Auction.

968
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:19,140
Oh my, do we have a great pile of wonderful objects to sell?

969
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:26,580
I have a small pile, and Motomax piles are glowing red back there.

970
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,800
We've got, so, yeah, I have a box here.

971
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,120
Rocknar's late mom was into UFOs,

972
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,220
and there's a priceless collection of cheesy UFO paperbacks.

973
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:42,020
Good lord, those things are worth their weight in platinum.

974
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:42,720
Really?

975
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:43,840
Well, I...

976
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,900
Maybe I shouldn't auction them.

977
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,820
You're not going to find them at Borders or Walden Books, are you?

978
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,160
Right, these are the books written by old subgeniuses

979
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,500
who didn't even know about Bob.

980
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,120
Although John Keel does know of Bob and is saved.

981
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,160
And he was the first of the...

982
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,240
Well, he wasn't the first.

983
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,180
I guess Frank Edwards popularized it.

984
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:05,860
I guess he was the first.

985
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,940
But John Keel wrote Operation Trojan Horse.

986
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,280
Robert Anton Wilson also was a communicant of Bob.

987
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,300
Yes, he knew Bob personally.

988
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,300
Wrote several essays about that.

989
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:27,540
Maybe someday we'll get the subgeniuses from the farther reaches.

990
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,540
I don't know if we'd ever get Nenslow at X Day, but...

991
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,340
No, he will not.

992
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,760
He refuses to come.

993
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,780
If elected, he will not serve.

994
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,180
What?

995
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,240
What about the brow, though?

996
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,500
Do you think we might get him out?

997
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,720
Puzzling evidence might be here, for all we know.

998
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,240
Hmm.

999
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,020
Like, is that...

1000
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,280
Oh, no, that's Susie's ass.

1001
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,480
And Papa Joe Mama, perhaps.

1002
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:50,060
Papa Joe Mama was supposed to be here with Reverend Ima,

1003
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,020
who, the last I heard, fell through.

1004
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,000
The conspiracy...

1005
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,480
Fell through the conspiracy cracks.

1006
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,580
Yeah, that's a shame.

1007
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,040
Ima was here last year.

1008
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,380
Ah, well.

1009
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,660
The one person who can truly say,

1010
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,040
I'm a subgenius.

1011
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,340
But rather than go on about those who are not here,

1012
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,840
we can express some gladness about those who have managed to be among us.

1013
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,280
Friends, we're so glad to see you here.

1014
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,760
This teeming throng of eager subgeniuses,

1015
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:27,380
clamoring as they are to get aboard the sail shack,

1016
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,800
which is not opened yet.

1017
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,820
I'm sure Modemac will tell us when that hour rolls around,

1018
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,840
and this broad...

1019
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,940
This podcast changes into the Bulldada auction.

1020
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,180
We probably should let it turn into the Bulldada auction,

1021
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,980
so we can make some money,

1022
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,380
and also we're running out of dinosaurs and giant insects to talk about.

1023
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,080
Actually, that's not true.

1024
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:56,220
I know, Dr. Howell, that you could sit and talk about dinosaurs and giant insects literally forever.

1025
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:00,360
Well, I wouldn't want to do it forever, but...

1026
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,500
But you could, couldn't you?

1027
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,480
Well, I could, yeah.

1028
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,780
As a subgenius.

1029
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,140
Yes.

1030
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:04,460
You could.

1031
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:09,600
If given an escape vessel and everything you wanted,

1032
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,520
such as an audience of eager young learners.

1033
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,140
Yes.

1034
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,300
Well, everyone should study history.

1035
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,100
And empty heads to fill up.

1036
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,540
History is an interesting study, always.

1037
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:31,600
And there's not too much education about the fact that once our planet was ruled by giant insects.

1038
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:34,640
And this is something...

1039
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,340
This is something people should know.

1040
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:43,580
Not that they are likely to return again, unless the atmosphere changes to the way it was back in those days.

1041
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:44,860
But it might.

1042
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:45,300
Yeah.

1043
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,620
What do people mean by back to nature?

1044
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,500
Do they mean back to before the Europeans came?

1045
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,140
The natives here altered the environment.

1046
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,460
They did controlled burnings of trees.

1047
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,540
They changed the environment a lot.

1048
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,360
Does it mean before the Ice Age?

1049
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:12,620
Does back to nature mean before it was all messed up by life forms and cooling of the molten magma surface?

1050
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,720
It tends to mean...

1051
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,380
Is that what you mean by back to nature?

1052
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,280
Before the oceans formed?

1053
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:25,500
It tends to mean in the Rousseauian sense back before rules and regulations were established.

1054
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:34,200
Or back in a physical way to a sort of a comfortable rural rustic vacation land.

1055
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:34,640
Sure.

1056
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:40,020
But neither really have thought it out all the way to the end.

1057
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,660
Thoreau was a fake anyway.

1058
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:46,640
He actually had a townhouse and only went out there to the pond on the weekends.

1059
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,280
Well, he was out there.

1060
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,760
He was a dandy and he was a city boy most of the time.

1061
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,900
He was out there during the time he was supposed to be out there.

1062
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,840
One thing that isn't generally known is that he started a huge forest fire.

1063
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,200
I didn't know that.

1064
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:01,580
Yeah.

1065
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,640
Thoreau may have loved nature, but...

1066
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:09,640
