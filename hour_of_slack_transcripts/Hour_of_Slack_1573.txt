And the song before that in French was the Rudy Schwartz Project of course.
But get this.
We've been playing a lot of Rudy Schwartz Project from a new album.
But there's yet another new album that I just got.
So we've got a world premiere tonight of the first half of the album.

So lonely

Now that Hugh Beaumont's brain has complete control of the universe, I'm hoping it'll
begin addressing some of these zoning issues we've been having in my neighborhood.
Bill Clanton built that goddamn barbecue pit less than six inches from the property
line, which of course means there are several dozen horseshoe-shaped, generously-bedicked
protoplasmic slimes queued up in my backyard with their attendant cuss-mouthed,
dinable mantises and sunny walkmans strewing their feces in the zucchini bed and damaging
the posts where I tie up the red wattle hogs during feeding and mating sessions.
I've raised this issue before.
I've worked with city council, but apparently my property values aren't of much concern
to them, what with the recent outbreak of Southeast Asian butthole cholera, which has
led to endless waits in emergency rooms in Waldron-Mathow County Hospital.
Back in the 60s, people used to come in from as far as Akron or Ashtabula.
They'd take off all of their clothes and strut around naked amongst the bistros and boutiques,
sipping cocktails and lining up for Marty Engel's film retrospectives.
Then around 8 o'clock, just as the sun was setting over the rendering plant, they'd
all march into these narrow trenches that line the principal boulevards, and they'd
take turns vomiting on each other.
There was a big write-up in popular mechanics, but eventually they ran out of penicillin,
and the goat fever changed everything.
That's why Hugh Beaumont's brain would be wise to focus on issues closer to home.

Of that new Rudy Schwartz Project album.
I think I left out one song from the first half.
The names of the songs we heard, I think you'll enjoy these.
The first two instrumentals were
Fasten Thee Thy Swathings
and Space Medicine Girl.
We then heard the
uh
fairly obviously named
Miraculous Diaper Creatures
and a lovely song called
Moist Towelettes
that actually had singing
by someone besides the great Joe Newman
who is usually the vocalist on these things.
Somebody named David Morrison.
We heard Personal Eggs.
I skipped over Flux Bap
Builds Stout Irction
and we played
Hugh Beaumont's Brain
and the instrumental that followed it
Temporary Housing Has Been Arranged by
Tor Back.
So those are the first seven or eight songs on
They Saved Grandpa's Gauze.
And if you need to know more about the Rudy Schwartz Project
and you probably do
then you should uh
you should Google it.
Because I don't think I don't I don't know.
I don't know who actually sells these things.
There you go.
There you go kids.
And I hear the beast from 20,000 Fathoms in the background.
But until further notice
I'm going to tell you about
the secret history of Bob and Reagan.
Ronald Reagan.
Who was secretly a very heavy pot smoker.
Which caused his Alzheimer's.
He and J.R. Bob Dobbs had been friends since 1951
before Dobbs' Immaculation.
When they met on the set of
Bedtime for Bonzo.
For which of
Dobbs is listed as of all things
genetics consultant.
Hm.
After his Immaculation
Dobbs' rising star matched Ron's
and they shared a meteoric ascent
through the conspiracy ranks
until Dobbs dropped out of the show.
And went rogue.
Followed by the appearance
or disappearance of
lonesome cowboy Dave himself.
Cow pokers.
The real Dave?
It's about as real as it gets.
I was going to ask you a very furious question
before I began arguing with you.
Do you hear
moderate buzz?
Because if so I'm using
the regular phone which has been working
just fine.
And uh
the more I step on it
and crush it with my tiny little fingers
the more noises it makes.
Well here let's listen to the buzz
of Dave.
Let's see if there's a real buzz there cause
if so I'll call back with my machine gun.
With my uh
There is a buzz but it is quite a
subtle buzz.
I wouldn't worry about it Dave.
Okay there's more important things to worry about.
Yeah there's more important things than you getting a buzz.
Oh you think so do you?
Well there's something more important than me getting a buzz
especially at this particular moment in time.
Well it's not the be all and end all of life.
Getting a buzz isn't
isn't what everything is all about.
Or wait
now wait a minute.
What did my dad
My dad asked me what the meaning of life
or what was the purpose of life
and I instantly said to have fun.
Cause I had actually thought about that.
And Pappy said
I didn't know you were that into it.
I thought you were advanced.
I thought you were stupid.
I thought you'd say something like to help others
or some ridiculous lie.
Everybody knows
that's stupid.
Well it's not necessarily stupid
but it's not
I mean if that's how you have fun
then that's smart.
Yeah you're the flowers of
hedon.
However if you're helping everyone and
meanwhile griping bitterly to yourself
about what ingrates they are
that doesn't really help.
If your teeth and your buttocks are clenched
your mind is made up
you're not having enough fun.
I can clench my teeth a lot better
than I can clench my buttocks.
That's all I know.
Are you losing the power?
The old whiz bang power of the buttocks clenching?
Well you know
well it's hard to discuss on
live radio.
You call this live?
I think we...
But you know
butts doing crappy jobs
that's what old age is all about.
Doing crappy jobs
with crap.
Crap related jobs.
That's not what it's supposed to be about.
It's supposed to be having a
merciful jolly time.
I'm talking about butts
not the owners of the butts.
I guess the butts have to be having...
They just kind of rent it.
You know?
Well...
It's my monogram.
It's what I say. It's what I believe in.
So therefore I...
Okay you win.
Thank you.
It feels good doesn't it being a winner?
Yes it does.
You can feel the clip of my planking boot heel
all across Europe.
Because there is such a place.
I didn't believe in Europe until
I think it was like
two or three years ago.
Somebody showed me a map and I
scoffed and said if I can't go there
right now in five minutes it doesn't exist.
Right. If I ain't seen it
then I don't believe it.
Show me. I'm from Missouri.
Show me.
You and we were one of the...
We're two of the individuals who
convinced me there was Europe because you had been there
and I actually believe you
so I had to.
We brought back photos to prove.
He doesn't know those photos were
really from that fancy rich
people's shopping center down there.
Over there in Pepper Pike.
Don't tell him. Don't tell him.
You're blowing it.
There's nothing like blowing a hole in good old
Cayenne Pepper Pike. Especially if you
can't reach the original blowhole
which is somewhere north of Shibibu.
And that's what you told me before
when you had me believe in all this stuff.
Now you know a lot of people think
the blowhole is located right
where you live in Ashtabula.
Oh that could well be.
That's the blowhole of America
when the great
Moby Dick of America
rises and spouts.
The stinky gravy spouts.
Right, the snot comes out at Ashtabula
flies way up into the atmosphere
and then rains down
on Cleveland.
Call me Ismail
or call me later because I'm busy
right now.
And my furniture's talking to me.
You know what's actually a pretty funny book
at least the first part of it? Moby Dick
by Herman Melville. I've been reading
that. Have you really? Yes on my
phone because it was a
free book. I could get
one of any of about a hundred different
editions for free on my phone.
And so I started writing. I'd never read Moby Dick.
I started reading it and by golly it's pretty
funny. It is. It's quite
mirthful at least at the
beginning towards down near
the end it gets a bit grim.
Well which is it? Queequeg
or Pequod? Which is the one that has
tattoos all over his ears?
Queequeg is the harpooner from
the South Seas
and the Pequod is
the name of the ship.
Ah the Pequod from
Maine. And
Moby Dick is one of the
most famous
monster hunter
novels but it's certainly not the earliest
because the first
fiction and all the most
popular fiction has been in the
monster hunting genre.
From Beowulf in the
English language,
the legends of Siegfried
in the Germanic world,
Ulysses with all his
cyclopses and sirens and
stuff, Gilgamesh
the world's first science fiction book
about
3,000 years old. They're all
heavy on monsters and perhaps not
coincidentally sex because
the two go hand in hand.
Monsters chase girls
and boys chase monsters
and the girls fall down
and then the boys make the monster
fall down and then finally
the guy gets to kiss the girl
at the very end while they talk about what man
was not meant to know.
And then you got your
modern day monster
hunts like the hunting of Bin Laden
and Saddam Hussein and
Bob and Hitler and all those
bad guys.
It's monster hunts all the way down.
Heck,
we even had one, we hunted
Bob at Ex Day that one time
but of course he got away. And then there was the
long salubrious arguments and
contentions and the
different beliefs about Bob's motivations
just like with Moby Dick and all the
other famous novels and books
that you mentioned. How they deal
with the innermost parts of the
human spirit and there's
Bob sitting there with a
slack faced,
why am I smoking a pipe?
And we have to try and figure out what he
really means by his monster chase.
Well, he's got
the cliff notes of Moby Dick in one
hand and the classics illustrated
version in the other. And a playboy
wrapped around you know where.
His neck.
There's Connie and in so
few of the other ones there's never a female
figure which outshines
the male questor
as we might call it.
Well, not in the traditional
monster hunter
hunting legends but actually
there are lots of non-traditional ones.
Wasn't Diana
the huntress or something?
We met her the other day.
She was wearing a
Peas of Mind t-shirt.
And one titty was showing because she was
Amazon like because she was the huntress.
She was Diana or Tana.
She did offer us tea twice.
Yes.
She said tea, tea.
That explains all of that right now.
Yeah.
I understand
there's some sort of comic book
hero-esque called Wonder Woman
who has appeared
even in the movies lately
but I never really
followed those.
Her personal motivations in terms of
the spiritual quest.
Oh yeah they did.
They always explain them in terms of the female
what girls need to be girls
better than boys are
and why girls should stick together.
You know there's nothing like her
actual she was scared of
rotten tumors and
be shot with fish
and things like that that bothered the average woman.
Well but the other
girls of Monster High would
you know they'd get together and talk
about these things pretty seriously
and work out their problems.
Their
sex and
monster problems.
What would the world have been like
had in the old days
of the great Greek philosopher
schools of southern Italy and Greece
and Sicily
and stuff like that there
what would they have been like if they were all females
instead of Plato's and Socrates guys?
Well they may have been
it may have been that way at one time
but then the Plato and Socrates guys
came along and said burn those books.
We never should have let them learn how to read.
That's probably true.
Burn it down and start over.
I joked about that the other day
and it made a womanly person all angry I think.
I was just joking
I said look what happened
when we let them have the vote
and even worse we let them learn how to read.
I mean it's just so funny.
She didn't think that was funny.
I was trying to be funny
but you know
sometimes you hurt somebody's
little sensitive bone instead
of their funny bone.
Maybe we shouldn't ever talk about anything
that might hurt somebody's sensitive bone.
Maybe we should just turn off
these microphones and just shut up
because somebody out there might
just get a, I don't know
they might think of something bad
something we say might remind
somebody of something bad so we better not
say it.
Well that's why flatulence is a good thing
because it has no political flavor.
It's just merely like oatmeal without the cookies.
And it's not always loud.
It doesn't have to be loud for people to notice it.
And everyone loves it just the same.
It's mom and dad's favorite thing
and everybody gets a little giggle.
Flatulence?
Flatulence.
One of the world's oldest visual gags
they showed
well they, who's they?
Well they're a lot funnier if there's a lighter involved.
That's the subgenius art of pyroflatulation.
I tried to have a pyroflatulation
contest the next day
in combination with the chili cook off.
Only two
other people made chili
so therefore my chili won.
And I was planning to have
the pyroflatulation contest
like six or seven hours later in the day.
Who showed up? Just me.
With my yardstick and backdrop
and camera.
And lighter.
The backdrop went six feet
just in case we had a real power
explosion. We actually had a big meet
in high school
when we were seniors in high school. There were two teams.
We gave ourselves
funny names and stuff like that.
Really? A pyroflatulation meet?
We had a competition
and some people yelped
as it burned some hairy parts.
Yeah, it can backfire.
Yep. Yeah.
That can be dangerous.
You better be careful.
It's not a sport for the weak hearted, that's for sure.
Right.
Right.
Pate a diamond only weak hearted.
It's tough.
It's a tough old world out there, Jack.
Especially if you're talking to Jack Kerouac.
He's been dead for
34 years now.
And that's even after cutting his mule open
and getting inside and getting warm.
Oh no, that was Jack London.
I'm sorry, I was thinking Jack London.
Wrong Jack.
One of those guys named Jack. Jack something.
Reverend Jack Knapes.
That's my buddy.
Not Jack the Bear either.
No, Jack of Knapes.
Jack O' Knapes.
Reverend Jack O' Knapes.
The real Jack of Knapes.
The only true artist is the
Jack of Artist.
Oh, come on now, man.
You're making my socks smelly.
Geez.
This is the kind of humor
that you hear and, well, you used to
hear in the days of the working class world
and bars and football fields.
Well, yeah, now there's no
working class, there's just the lower
class and the slave driver class.
Just slaves and slave drivers.
Ain't nothing else.
Ain't nothing.
There's fewer and fewer slave drivers
and a lot more slaves.
Ah, the
buzz covering music.
It's always good to have
some music to cover the buzz
in the background.
Is the buzz unearthly and bad
now because I can call back on my
.
No, it's not too bad.
No, it's just quite subtle, Dave.
Well, as long as we have the music in the background,
as long as we keep talking, then no one hears
the buzz. James. James.

Just sign here, Mr. DeLuca.
Yes, in that red fluid I drew out of you.
I'm standing at the crossroads.
Yeah.
God help me.
Yeah, the problem is it was popular investment banker Dave that signed that contract and got rich and famous and had a little clone, all the clones, like Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Unpopular Garbage Man Dave and so forth.
And all those other names that you'll come back to are so famous.
Bad breath cowgirl Daveena.
Wincing, jumping monkey man Dave.
Right.
Yeah, there's a lot of clones out there.
But Dave, you're the only one that we let call the show.
All the other Daves, they just forget it.
They've tried to get in, you know.
They may be more popular, but they're not as funny as you are, Dave.
Nice.
Looking.
So, are you guys, I heard that we made some weird kind of psychedelic cookies the other night at the old Stang Hostel.
And somebody got pretty hostile.
Didn't you have a very colorful guest recently?
Are you psychic or something?
That's kind of weird that you should say that.
It was very peaceful.
It was actually a very peaceful little gathering.
It was.
It was a quiet and peaceful evening.
Nobody even knew what was in the cookies.
Until it was.
Until it was too late.
Yeah.
That's the way I like it.
We got those cookies from the devil, you know.
Yes.
From the graveyard at midnight.
The graveyard.
The graveyard.
Even a man who is pure at heart and eats his beans by night may become a buttock when the wolfbane blooms.
And autumn moon.
And autumn moon is bright.
May we all become buttocks when the wolfbane blooms.
I hope to never become a buttocks.
Hey, speaking of buttocks and X-Day, X-Day is coming.
The world's going to end.
But first, we'll have a big party out there at that campground in Ohio.
And there was something that was important I wanted to tell people about.
Oh, well, one important thing is.
It's a wistary.
It's a wistary.
It's a wistary at Wisteria.
And I put new artwork on subgenius.com and on all the X-Day events pages.
New artwork by none other than the great illustrator Dr. Howell.
Dr. Howell.
Actually, these aren't drawings.
They're collages and written things.
There's even a whole newspaper called the Dobstown Nanoheliograph with articles about
the pathetic attempts of the humans to fight back against the aliens.
It's actually pretty funny.
It's an ongoing struggle, though, isn't it?
It hasn't been terminated by...
But what else?
Okay.
There was the new pictures on subgenius.com that are good and fun.
Oh, and they've got pictures of little Miss Baby Bear there, too, in her space girl outfit.
But I'm confused.
You're talking about the party before X-Day?
Isn't there...
No.
There's a party after X-Day.
Well, no.
Before the world ends.
Oh, yes.
Before the world ends, we have a party.








After the world ends, there's a somewhat less snooty party called Starwood, but we'll
be having that aboard the escape vessel of Princess Wee and myself, because it's Princess
Wee's baby.
We promised those people, I mean, they paid to have a Starwood, so even if they're not
subgeniuses, we'll beam them up, show them a big party, and if they haven't wised up
at the end of that week...
We can become subgenius ministers.
Out the airlock!
And down to Earth to burn!
Now, aren't you having a special Spanish speaking day called Dia del Crrr?
Dia del Crrr.
Dia del Crrr.
That's the clean up after the end of the world.
Oh.
Some people are into that.
Oh, I see.
Well, I thought it was, you know, the Spanish way of saying X was Crrr, Crrr, Crrr, Crrr,

So it was Dia del Crrr.
Dia del Crrr.
Dia del Crrr.
Oh, I know how to do it.
It shows how little I know, for sure.
Everything's kind of speculative.
Dave, we've got to get you to X day somehow.
How are we going to do that?
Well, let's make sure my health is incoherent first.
Right.
We have to have a stretcher.
I may have sacrificed my vacation time.
And cats.
We need at least two cats, probably four cats, to carry Dave on a stretcher from northern
Ohio down to southern Ohio, or I suppose somebody could drive him.
But it ain't us, because our car's full.
Right.
We could put him on top.
And also, we have to go down there for a whole week or more, you see.
That's all coming soon.
Real soon.
When is Dia del Crrr?
It's the end of the world, July 5th, 1998.
I know it's El Julio del Cinco.
But the party happens way before July 5th.
Yeah, we'll start on like the 28th or 27th.
It ends actually.
June 28th.
Yeah, Dr. Howell's going to be here in the station.
Yay.
The Sunday before we leave.






Yes.
And he can give Dave a run for his money, lip-flappin' wise.
Yes, I speculoos that will be quite an evening.
Dr. Philo Drummond's going to be around, and our band will reform, the Doctors for Wotan.
That's the band of Philo and me and our wives.
And eventually, this time, we're going to let the whole audience up.
We're going to bring enough of what they call fart pianos that we can hand each member of

the audience an instrument and ask them up, cluster them around microphones, and when
all of the audience is up there banging and jumping up and down and stomping and whacking
coffee cans with spoons in time to the music no one else can hear, Philo and I and our
wives will sit down where the audience used to be and watch.
With our feet propped up.
Yeah, that's how Doctor music is really supposed to work.
So if you join us.
If you joined our band, Dave, you wouldn't really play for long, but if you stayed in
the audience, you'd probably end up doing a whole concert for an hour.
That's what we're hoping.
Yeah, I understand that part.
I don't understand, like, when you're saying a fart piano, these, like, keyboards are sampled.
Google it.
Google it.
You'll have one.
Oh, you don't have that kind of phone.
But modern-day phones, all you gotta do is just type in fart piano, and about a minute
later, you'll have one.
Mm-hmm.
Which will be a keyboard with various different .
Yeah.
Right.
It has rattlers, rump splitters, fizz, the fuzz, the fizz fuzz, the fuzzy wuzz.
It's got all of them.
And the, well, the frosted fernander.
You can't hear that one.
Frosted fernander?
Yeah.
That's the silent but deadly.
Well, didn't your dad give you the, it's different in every state and region of the country,
but down south, it was the types of...
...expulsions, gaseous expulsions were named by the sound they made.
And I'll do it again.
The fizz, the fuzz, the fizz fuzz, the fuzzy wuzz, the rattler, the rump splitter, and
the frosted fernander.
The brish, the pish, the piffer.
The blarter, the splatterer.
Oh, no.
The lubrifart.
The weezer.
The princess we invented.
The weezer and Mr. Sister invented the lubrifart.
Yes.
Well, they named them.
No, you know, Adam and Eve invented them.
And better words...
6,000 years ago.
Did you know that on our ranch in Texas, we've got the footprints, fossilized footprints of Adam and Eve?
Adam and erstwhile Eve?
Yeah.
I don't know if I believe that yet.
Oh, well, seeing is believing.
And when you see the Photoshopped photo, you'll know that it's real.
So it's Adam and Eve on the dinosaur, just as predicted by the evangelical movement?
Actually, you find their footprints inside the dinosaur footprints, because the dinosaurs were faster and ran away from the flood first.
And then Adam and Eve followed behind the dinosaurs.
And their feet sometimes would land in the dinosaur footprint in the mud.
It was mud then.
And the dinosaur footprints made the Great Lakes and the many great...
Those were really big dinosaurs that couldn't fit on the earth.

They were really big dinosaurs that couldn't fit on the ark.
But yeah, if you come to our ranch place, the new Mega Fist Temple Lodge in Texas, we'll show you fossilized ghost tracks.
We've got the ruins of Noah's Ark.
We've got the skeletons of the cave subgeniuses where they were tossed off the ark as it floated down the Paluxy River, which is flooding.
The Paluxy?
Yeah, the Paluxy River in Texas.
That's where...
It's famous for dinosaur tracks and Adam and Eve tracks and giant ape-man tracks.
Because you know there was giants on the earth in them days.
Yep.
It says so in the Bible 6,000 years ago.
Giants that lived 900 years.
Where there's no blue, pink giant...
Princess, we got that fart piano.
She did just what I said.
She did not have one on the way to the station.
And it's...
Here, go ahead and play it some more.
Oh, what a beautiful sound.
It's like a fart piano.


Well, that microphone definitely works.
Yes, this is someone playing classical music on fart pianos.
Oh, that's like a player fart piano.
Yes, this is a player fart piano.
It's got a little tape and roll running through your phone there.
Yes.
That's clever.
Play Johannes Bach's Fugend D minor.
Now, that's a good one.

That sounds more like an elderly person doing raspberries.
Heil, Heil, right into Führer's face.
Bring me herr, herr, ses, be esch, a masker, esch, and be Heil.
Heil, Heil, right into Führer's face.
Well, that was pretty groovy, man.
Now, it's a piano sound.
There we go.
Now, it's a piano sound.
maintenant
ContRA Sacramento
Where is Silesium?
Because I was always wondering when they did in Silesium...
Graham-style beans are better than wolf brand chili any day.
So go out and buy that wolf band
If you want to be sick that day
Ranch style
Oh, ranch style
Oh, how I am
God, thank God there's only about three minutes left of the show.
Isn't that wonderful?
Yeah.
Oh, that's another lovely sound effect.
Princess Wee has become a sampler artiste.
In five minutes, just because I said Google fart piano.
See, we got a band. We got a band now.
Let's see.
Okay.
When the band was...
Dave and Wee, it's called Mondo Retardo Band, right?
Yes.
And when it's just Wee and Me, it's called Poo Water Towel.
Right.
Poo Water Towel?
If it's us and Philo, then it's Doctors for Wotan.
But what is it if it's Dave and Wee and Me?
The band that was just here tonight.
Mondo Retardo Poo Towel.
Yeah. I like it.
How about Cool Bummer?
Cool Bummer. Okay, Cool Bummer.
That was a band named Philo.
Cool Bummer.
Cool Bummer makes a little bit more sense.
I'll go with Cool Bummer.
That's a good band name.
It's easier to say.
Well, okay.
This, in some ways, this radio program we've been forced to listen to and participate in
has something to do with something called the Church of the Subgenius.
Somehow.
Yeah.
A mystic fellowship, a secret society founded by the great J.R. Bob Dobbs.
And it's shortly after he broke up with Ronald Reagan.
Master of the Arcane Handshake.
And for more information, that's it.
For more information about the Church of the Subgenius, you would have to look at subgenius.com.
If you want to.
If you want more information, that would be one way to do it.
And there's a lot to look at there.
I'm not sure what to do.
Click on events first.
That leads to the naked pictures.
Because there's naked stuff that happens at our events.
I'm not saying that's good.
It may not be the kind of nakedity that most people seek out.
But, eh.
Well, I think it's quite thoughtful.
Worthy of sounding.
She's seeking out.
Especially in the case of Baby Bear.
Who I believe.
I don't know because I've never been a part of the Rumpty Organist.
She.
I've said that she might not be able to be there for very long.
But she is bringing the Bob effigy for us to burn.
That sweet one.
We always burn Bob.
And we would burn the real Bob if he wanted us to.
But he usually doesn't stick around for that.
So we get various qualities of dummies.
And kidnap them.
Drug them.
Put a Bob mask on them.
Tie them to a chair.
And surround them with.
Faggots of wood.
And dump some gasoline on it.
And call a pagan who knows the secret of fire.
It's usually that Jason guy.
And then.
Fire him up.
Last year people were roasting.
And this is not just something I'm saying.
It's not a fable.
People actually did roast hot dogs off of his burning feet.
Last year.
They light cigarettes off of his burning face.
They'll walk up to the face of Bob.
Scream.
Well, it's not really Bob.
Obviously.
It's just some dork we found usually on the way there.
Hitchhiking.
And he's screaming under that mask.
And people walk up and light their cigarettes off of that.
Hey, you know what?
We have to go.
We have to go now.
And I'm going to end up playing a piece of music by our friend Reverend Basil of the Psychoskeletons.
Ah, Basil Metabolism.
I love his works.
I saw a picture of him for the first time.
He sent a picture of his last email.
He has a tons.
He sent a picture of it on his creation.
See this donít hair dryer?
It was on myах import is used.
It has to be cast on your YouTube mark.
With a name like Basil you've got to have a monkish haircut.
Mm-hmm .

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
