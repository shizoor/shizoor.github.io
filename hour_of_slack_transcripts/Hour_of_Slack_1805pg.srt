1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
Listen.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,980
Alright, I'm one.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,160
Going up in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,880
The Show Genius Hour of Swag.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,880
We'll meet again at midnight.

6
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,980
We'll meet again at midnight.

7
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:29,980
We'll meet again at midnight.

8
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,380
We'll meet again at midnight.

9
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:15,420
We'll meet again at midnight.

10
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:47,040
We'll meet again at midnight.

11
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,120
We'll meet again at midnight.

12
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
I'm alive and well.

13
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm alive and well.

14
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,120
I'm still alive and well.

15
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,660
Oh, thank you, Johnny Winter.

16
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,600
And thanks to Lee Murr for the titles and other things.

17
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,980
And the Empire Jones.

18
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,680
Jazz Orchestra.

19
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,940
Symphonies and riffs in the background.

20
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,220
Here.

21
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,800
Oh, yes, dear friends.

22
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,920
I ain't dead yet.

23
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,920
Which is why I played that Johnny Winter song.

24
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,040
My x-rays came back.

25
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,520
And by golly, I've been hobbling around with old compression fractures in my neck and back.

26
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,160
Along with the arthritis.

27
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,300
So I wasn't being a namby-pamby weiner crybaby after all.

28
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,860
So.

29
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:44,660
So this show number 1805 is part rerun of number 76 and part new with the rest of the interview with Sandy Boone and Dr. Philodrummond about the subgenius movie on the Film School podcast.

30
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:54,360
But first, let's go back in time with a media barrage leading up to G. Gordon Gordon's classic, It's Not Just The.

31
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,300
I'm trying to make believe I'm you.

32
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,840
Oh.

33
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,000
Just a stranger on the outside looking in.

34
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,060
People say that life is fun.

35
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,600
But I don't know why.

36
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,200
As far as I can tell.

37
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,060
Life sucks.

38
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,780
Life sucks.

39
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,560
Life sucks.

40
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,320
Then you die.

41
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,680
Within the last 12 hours, we have received a number of.

42
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,620
Unconfirmed report from throughout the nation, that may or may not be connected with this strange phenomena.

43
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,720
Bob?

44
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,540
L words.

45
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:41,540


46
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:41,540


47
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,380
I'm so sorry.

48
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,820
Hello.

49
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,280
Why does this�

50
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,820
Help me too.

51
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,340
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,680
No rent, no access.

53
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,780
No interest.

54
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,680
Praise Bob.

55
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,460
Praise Bob.

56
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,060
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

57
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,500
We will control the vertical.

58
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,560
Don't kill them.

59
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,640
Suspect.

60
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,900
You'd better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.

61
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,520
Enjoy life like Bob.

62
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,460
Get to your heads, Satan.

63
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,320
Do not be afraid.

64
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,220
I am not here to harm you.

65
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,600
I know you want to destroy me.

66
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,860
But listen.

67
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
Please listen.

68
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,100
I only want to help you.

69
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,880
I've chosen you.

70
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,620
Well, I'm sure that's very flattering, but I must get on with my work now.

71
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,760
They don't love you, Bob.

72
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,220
They don't love you like I do.

73
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,480
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.

74
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,760
It's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture

75
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,000
that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes.

76
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,520
It's not just the terminal folds of noon.

77
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,700
It's not just the child zombies that murder their mediocrity parents

78
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,720
and then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

79
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,760
It's not just the...

80
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,440
Those starry old becks on the park benches with looks on their faces

81
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,140
like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.

82
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,980
It's not just the anesthesiologist for Negi.

83
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,440
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

84
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,960
It's not just the diner bones for Wotan.

85
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,000
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antenna, and human excrement

86
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,760
on your car.

87
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,020
It's not just the old ways were best.

88
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,520
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

89
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,940
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

90
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,160
It's not just the widescreen technicolor corporate daisy chain

91
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,220
that has defiled the entire planet.

92
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,260
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-fas,

93
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:57,760
and the size of the...

94
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:57,760


95
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,000
and the size of basketballs.

96
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,540
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

97
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,160
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland, non-entity son of a b-

98
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,300
Bob?

99
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,840
... who thinks workers are property.

100
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,600
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

101
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,240
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer.

102
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,620
It's not just some-

103
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,080
Bob?

104
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
... with a pipe, and a...

105
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:29,900
Bob?

106
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,360
... eating I-know-more-than-you-do dog grin all over his homogenized face.

107
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:41,660
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world that you certainly never made.

108
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,180
It's not just the doorway to doom.

109
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,980
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

110
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,260
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

111
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,760
No, dear friends, there is more to it all.

112
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,200
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

113
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,500
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

114
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,100
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

115
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,320
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus, you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

116
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,320
No, he's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

117
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,900
In his back pocket. Just you try it.

118
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:32,920
Bob.

119
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,680
Bob.

120
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,580
Bob.

121
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,320
Bob.

122
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:55,800
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ha, Ma, Bi, Bi-Bam, Bi-Bam, Bab, Bab, Ba, Ba,Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba-Baw, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba-Bam

123
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:55,860
Bob.

124
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:11,040
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

125
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:20,740
Well, I want to I want to ask Sandy in terms of sort of the challenges and sort of telling the story is as Reverend Drummond has just laid out.

126
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,500
It was there was so there was there's so much here and you could kind of get caught up in a lot of the detail of it.

127
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,180
But sort of what was your challenge in trying to tell this story?

128
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,480
Because you had the two principals here, obviously, the two people who really made this thing run.

129
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,740
What did you find in terms of, you know, storytelling that you you wanted to try and try and accomplish?

130
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,820
Well, actually, there's many difficulties in telling this story, because as Dr.

131
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,200
Drummond will tell you, there's all these different schisms.

132
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,180
And so, though, he and Ivan Stang are supposedly the leaders or the founders.

133
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes.

134
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,760
Everybody runs their own show.

135
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,080
So there's like there was an Arkansas group and a San Francisco group.

136
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,720
And there's a group that Dr.

137
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,320
What was his name?

138
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,760
Oh, I think it was.

139
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:17,300
Anyway, he was out of Florida and they're all doing their own spin on what this is supposed to be.

140
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:25,020
And they're all claiming that theirs is the most important part of the subgenius or, you know, the most vital part.

141
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,800
And so it's just.

142
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,160
I didn't I kind of chose to stick with the Stan Cross 패 and the담.

143
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,640
It's thisyi second kind of guy, and he's like, look, like they didn't, they didn't do enough start.

144
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,940
This is just not to be, just to be your move to how to write, dig in the middle.

145
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,960
Anybody wants to go into.

146
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,220
Ivory, like ours at плюс was when I got out of high school and did my first film,

147
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,220


148
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:53,320
And the first time that I did the first film was where I wanted to shoot for昶etta biggest,

149
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:53,740


150
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,640
So there were lots of days in high school.

151
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,740
and try to come up with,

152
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,260
to explain what the church was

153
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,000
with many definitions

154
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,660
that a lot of people have never heard of.

155
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,760
They don't know what a pink was or a normal.

156
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,160
And then as you're trying to give certain definitions,

157
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,140
the church is truly,

158
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,280
the people that are interviewing are saying,

159
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,560
well, that's their definition of the same word.

160
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,700
And so you never really,

161
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,440
I mean, they don't want to be defined.

162
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,740
So that made it difficult.

163
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,780
So I had to come up with a storyline

164
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,780
that would not only explain their history,

165
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,260
encompass as much of the church as I could,

166
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,920
but also relate to our modern world.

167
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,660
So this wouldn't just be a subgenius maybe,

168
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,580
and use it.

169
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,480
So hopefully the church would not only tell their story,

170
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,880
and we wanted to do what Doug asked,

171
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,480
which is, they're getting older,

172
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,140
they're concerned that they would turn

173
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,300
into a silentology or Mormonism

174
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,400
if the truth didn't finally come out.

175
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,460
And there were too many people at the time

176
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,860
that really wanted this to be a real cult.

177
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,340
So that was an issue.

178
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,160
And then also show how cults and cult practices

179
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,520
are used in politics today.

180
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,660
That gave it the world renowned information and connections.

181
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,180
So people wouldn't,

182
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,160
if they weren't even introduced to subgenius,

183
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,000
they could see how these guys that were really,

184
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,720
I hate to say this, Dr. Drummond,

185
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,240
but nobody from Dallas, Texas,

186
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,420
turned this thing into a worldwide cult.

187
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,500
Whether it's a joke or not, it still was a cult.

188
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,220
Right.

189
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,520
Well, Sandy, I thank you for saying that

190
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,120
because that is what the film is.

191
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,340
It is a film that if you hadn't,

192
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,900
and I had no idea that the church of the subgenius

193
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,800
existed until I saw the film.

194
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,920
And so for me, it was such an enjoyable watch.

195
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,500
And one of the things that I, again,

196
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,800
I think the Reverend Drummond would echo this.

197
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,280
And that is, this is a church,

198
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,960
and I'm using air quotes here,

199
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,140
church that promotes schisms,

200
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,240
which I just, and there's just so many things,

201
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,480
the devival instead of a revival,

202
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,400
all the things about it are intended, in my opinion,

203
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,780
are intended to like flashing red lights to say,

204
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,520
this is what you,

205
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,460
this is the part where you normally,

206
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,100
we would be talking to you about joining

207
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,640
and getting your family to join.

208
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,340
We're not here to do that.

209
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,480
In fact, we're here to make sure

210
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,780
your family doesn't join the church.

211
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,840
And I mean, there's just so many things about it

212
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,240
that are funny, satirical, and true.

213
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,020
And I think that's the subgenius

214
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,200
of what their philosophy is,

215
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,360
is while all of these things on some level

216
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,420
are a lot of fun,

217
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,160
they're also pointing out

218
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,000
some hard truths about social norms.

219
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,280
That's true.

220
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,240
And one of the things that I kept saying

221
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,640
through the entire movie,

222
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,700
not on screen was,

223
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,380
a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.

224
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,060
How am I going to get the broader audience

225
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,960
to be interested, watch this movie,

226
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,780
and actually learn something

227
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,720
once they walk away,

228
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,460
take something with them.

229
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,640
And it's the guy's humor.

230
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,060
I mean,

231
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,760
they're hilarious.

232
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,240
And a lot of these people,

233
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,100
and they're actually,

234
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,740
in fact,

235
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,380
one of the subgenius just accused me

236
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,920
of revealing that they are truly teddy bears

237
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,020
and that was not supposed to what was happening.

238
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,040
Well, you know,

239
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,480
when you walk into this hornet's nest

240
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,280
of terrible people, Sandy,

241
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,420
this is what's going to happen.

242
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,720
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

243
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,880
Oh, dear friends,

244
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,440
I've got a short sermon to do here.

245
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,880
And this is mostly,

246
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,960
this is going to be mostly for those of you

247
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,660
who have been regular listeners of the show.

248
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,120
And the rest of you probably ought to just go away,

249
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,520
go to the bathroom for about five, ten minutes,

250
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,920
then come back for more horrible tape.

251
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,380
Well, I've got a letter here, friends.

252
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,420
A letter from Sister Mandy.

253
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,000
And I'm going to read this letter.

254
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,980
It's pertinent.

255
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,000
She says,

256
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,500
I hope the show pulls in what was promised.

257
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,900
It would be a cry in shame if you had to die again.

258
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,860
But then again,

259
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,320
what was this,

260
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,000
this,

261
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,080
this excretive deleted

262
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,660
coming out of my radio last hour of Slack?

263
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,700
Actually, she's talking about two hours of Slack ago,

264
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,360
two weeks ago.

265
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,500
I can't believe you would rag on native Texans

266
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,640
because they're not as rowdy as some chowderhead Yankees.

267
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,280
Now, dear friends,

268
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,520
let me,

269
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,560
let me intercede here and say that,

270
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:54,740
uh,

271
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,980
it's not y'all's lack of rowdiness at all,

272
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,540
but the lack of airplane tickets that you would provide

273
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,680
to get other subgenius preachers down here for a show.

274
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,560
But Sister Mandy continues.

275
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,460
Now, I don't know if you are a real Texan or just a transplant.

276
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,840
I know I don't sound like I was raised in North Richland Hills and Fort Worth.

278
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,620
Uh,

279
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,160
but, uh,

280
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,560
maybe you like cold winter,

281
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,160
she says.

282
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,800
And the way they,

283
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,240
they pepperage farm and clam chowder.

284
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,440
Maybe now we women of Texas aren't good enough for old Reverend Ivan Stang anymore.

285
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,100
Is that it,

286
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,240
huh?

287
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,960
Well,

288
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,800
no comment there,

289
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,220
but,

290
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,460
uh,

291
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
Texans are Bob's chosen.

292
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,980
It's always been that way,

293
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,700
but that's why it's so disappointing that they don't act like it.

294
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,520
I certainly do.

295
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,660
Mandy continues.

296
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,440
I don't know.

297
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,380
I can't believe that the subgeniuses of Dallas don't have the,

298
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,640
uh,

299
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,320
say,

300
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,260
cojones to manage to put together a butt-kicking,

301
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,600
glass,

302
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,260
glass grinding,

303
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,000
splendiferous type,

304
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,820
D Vival.

305
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,380
And friends,

306
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:57,520
uh,

307
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:57,880
it's,

308
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,700
it's not the cojones is needed,

309
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,720
but the energy and the know how the art scam expertise,

310
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,420
uh,

311
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:05,980
she goes,

312
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,100
I'd be willing to give myself in every way possible to help.

313
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,600
Although I'm a prisoner of the conspiracy,

314
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,380
so-called educational system,

315
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:12,920
Irving.

316
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,600
Oh,

317
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,460
I think school.

318
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,080
Yeah.

319
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,920
I want to help when I can,

320
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,300
you know,

321
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
as well as I,

322
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,920
that Dallas is capable of it.

323
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,460
So cram this Boston BS and save your,

324
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,700
your evil fluids for Dallas.

325
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,860
But friends is Dallas capable.

326
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,040
For instance,

327
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,400
the most high buck disco club in Dallas.

328
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Miss straw couldn't handle the technical demands of one extra VHS tape deck,

329
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,520
which you operate in your own home.

330
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,680
She goes,

331
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:39,920
uh,

332
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,180
yeah,

333
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,280
I realized that your rant was meant to inflame,

334
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
but all it did was,

335
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,220
uh,

336
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:44,580
well,

337
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,220
I can't say this,

338
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,540
but anger people and friends.

339
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,620
I know that's true.

340
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,540
And it's because I delivered it poorly.

341
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,860
She says,

342
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,340
I know,

343
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,080
I know you can do better than that.

344
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,800
And that's true.

345
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,680
When I've had enough sleep,

346
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,380
do something.

347
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,840
I can't read the something to them.

348
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,900
If they can't take a joke,

349
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,900
do more than anger them,

350
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,660
challenge us and friends.

351
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,180
Some did take it as a challenge,

352
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,720
which is how,

353
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,700
how it was meant to be.

354
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,580
She says,

355
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:09,800
uh,

356
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,400
Dallas loves stupid.

357
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,660
Look at some of our swinging singles,

358
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,820
meat lockers,

359
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,880
have a national devival or something named for Dallas is cojones and threatened to have them kicked by San Francisco or something.

360
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,660
Make yourself the most hated man in Dallas for without hate.

361
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,520
There is no love.

362
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,040
And without love,

363
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,680
there is no Bob.

364
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,320
Bob equals hate equals love.

365
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,660
Did you say that?

366
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,300
Or was it me?

367
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,140
It was me,

368
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,560
Mandy.

369
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,560
I don't remember,

370
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,320
but do it staying.

371
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,220
I know you can.

372
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,520
Well,

373
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,280
you know,

374
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,520
when I've had enough sleep and had a little bit of slack,

375
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,140
usually,

376
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,440
Oh,

377
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,100
what does that mean?

378
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,880
The music stopped all of a sudden,

379
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,120
but it's true.

380
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,100
I couldn't agree with you more about that after Boston hour of slack.

381
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:47,980
Uh,

382
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,140
cause after I'd finally gotten to bed and slept for 13 hours,

383
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,240
I listened to that tape.

384
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,160
The show and went,

385
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,960
Oh my God,

386
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,220
I sound almost drunk.

387
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,300
And,

388
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,240
but keep in mind that,

389
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,500
uh,

390
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,200
stupidity is certainly no sin in this church.

391
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,640
Then I was just playing burned out,

392
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,140
tired,

393
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,500
tired friends.

394
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,960
And on top of that,

395
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,100
I was being facetious,

396
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,460
but I just wasn't being facetious well.

397
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,100
So it came off the wrong way.

398
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:13,800
Now,

399
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,360
uh,

400
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,060
you know,

401
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,180
when you go for four hours of sleep a night,

402
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,080
but it happens,

403
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,920
you don't get the slack.

404
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,320
But then when I got to Boston,

405
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,040
my buddies,

406
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,240
doctors for Bob and I did get slack,

407
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,080
but although it was partly slack through overwork,

408
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,980
which is an unusual form of slack,

409
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,240
but many of us emergent tiles have to get slack that way,

410
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,540
as opposed to you rewarding types of geniuses who I envy by the way.

411
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,820
But number one,

412
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,760
you got to remember that by definition,

413
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,340
a sub genius preacher has not only the right,

414
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,000
but the obligation,

415
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,720
dear friends to make severe and even tragic mistakes.

416
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,880
Now look at the rival cults,

417
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,560
uh,

418
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,400
the,

419
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,500
some of your local Christian denominations,

420
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,640
let's say that preach total goodness and perfection.

421
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,320
They live friends in a false,

422
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,780
dangerous fantasy world.

423
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,800
And when they show their humanity as Jim and Tammy Baker did,

424
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,420
Oh,

425
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,620
they're castigated by their people.

426
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,740
They're fired off their jobs and they sure look stupid.

427
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,640
They make Christianity.

428
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,880
look even stupider to the average American, which is okay with me.

429
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,460
But in their smug, self-deluding pride, friends,

430
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,240
they set goals that are not only impossible, but actually ridiculously unnecessary.

431
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,920
And when they can't attain those goals, then they just get more fanatical

432
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,960
and can't admit that they couldn't cut what they set up for themselves.

433
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,640
And their people are so strung out between constant states of false happiness or guilt.

434
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,920
I don't know.

435
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,620
We now know that Jim and Tammy, for all those years, were actually only acting happy.

436
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,200
But living that lie just compounded their misery.

437
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,640
And millions of people do this to themselves

438
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,620
because they think God is as ignorant and tolerant and insecure as they are.

439
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,940
But then that's their idea of wisdom and goodness, I guess.

440
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,360
Hiding their real feelings, living a lie, deliberately short-circuiting their instincts,

441
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,240
pretending.

442
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,280
That's what they do.

443
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,460
They're pretending, friends.

444
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,820
Now, you can accuse the subgeniuses of pretending,

445
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,060
but, you know, in a way, they pretend much, much worse than we do.

446
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,780
So when I come on the air and sound like a vindictive jerk,

447
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,060
remember that at least I'm being honest.

448
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,200
If I'm beat, worn out,

449
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,460
I don't take speed like Tammy Baker

450
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,780
to pretend that I've got superhuman energy.

451
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,720
I act like I feel.

452
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:56,100
I prove beyond a doubt that I can be just as overextended, overwrought, insensitive, and incoherent as any of you.

453
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,720
And yet, even with all these personality flaws, weaknesses, and staccato speech patterns,

454
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,040
yet I know that Bob gives me an excuse.

455
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,640
He doesn't need to forgive me because I didn't do anything evil.

456
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,240
I screwed up.

457
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,440
And Bob loves me.

458
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,780
And Bob loves me for that.

459
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,760
It's the power to fail, friends.

460
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,580
It's the power that the subgenius popes have and these rival popes can't ever have.

461
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,860
And the irony, friends, the irony.

462
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,440
It's like with the pledge drives.

463
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,140
The hour of slack listeners are 50% paid up right now, or probably more by now.

464
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,960
But yet, now those gospel folks, they pledged and pledged.

465
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,260
They pledged and pledged because they were so full of faith.

466
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,420
And only 10% at best.

467
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,860
And in some cases, 6% bothered to fulfill the commitment.

468
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,160
Because in Christianity, pretending and promising is good enough.

469
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,280
That's what faith means, friends.

470
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,740
It means you've decided to be satisfied no matter what.

471
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,600
Because you're going to pretend everything's okay.

472
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,520
Oh, it's God's will.

473
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,820
So therefore, you don't have to do anything about it.

474
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,060
Leave it to God, dear friends.

475
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,420
Grace through faith, not works.

476
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,300
Jesus said, be like children.

477
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:23,020
And you know, Tammy can't go to bed with her husband without keeping her fake eyelashes,

478
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,860
her bat wing size fake eyelashes on.

479
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,000
I read that in the paper today.

480
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,640
That's how you keep your husband.

481
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,180
Wear makeup to bed.

482
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,800
Pretending, friends.

483
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,360
Yeah, they're like children all right, but they're like seventh grade children.

484
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:42,460
Cruel, gossiping liars and bullies that roam in cliques and packs looking for weak, unsuspecting

485
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,640
minority victims.

486
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,520
Oh, they have faith all right.

487
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:51,180
Faith that any nasty thing they do didn't count if God forgave it in their head.

488
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,900
And if you're having the kind of fun they can't experience, then that must be sin.

489
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,440
Because in their eyes, friends, slack is the ultimate sin.

490
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,440
The devil hates slack too.

491
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,800
And when you look at the basic beliefs and behavior of a lot of these fundamentalist

492
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,980
Christians, they have a lot in common with the devil, friends.

493
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,440
A whole lot more in common with the devil than Jesus.

494
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:19,520
Now, subgenius is rationalized too, but our rationalization is so absurd that it allows

495
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,700
us the slack to remember that it's just a rationalization and there's still work to

496
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:24,940
do.

497
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,280
Praise Bob.

498
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,580
Oh, God.

499
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,100
Here's this Tammy Baker interview.

500
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,720
Yes, she rarely goes to bed without her makeup, swears by her false eyelashes, and wears different

501
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,400
wigs for her husband, Jim.

502
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,940
And that still wasn't good enough.

503
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,620
Was it?

504
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,200
No, Jessica Hahn, she didn't have to change wigs every night.

505
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:52,380
Jim very seldom seen me without makeup and hardly ever in my life without my eyelashes.

506
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,240
I think every woman ought to wear eyelashes.

507
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,200
Yeah, I think natural born eyelashes are kind of good too.

508
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
They keep the water out of your eyes.

509
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,180
The sweat, if you're inhuman enough to sweat, unlike Miss Tammy.

510
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,680
Oh, God.

511
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,000
Well, I've got more of that rant to go on.

512
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,920
But in the meantime, I'm going to go to bed.

513
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:10,920


514
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,120
See you in the morning, Tom.

515
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,120
Until then.

516
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,060
Oh!

517
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,200
.

518
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,440
When confederate flags flutter and fly.

519
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,580
I won't stand back, I won't stand by.

520
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,760
When the proud boys get a rallying cry.

521
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,940
I won't stand back, and I won't stand by.

522
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,920
In the face of hate, I won't stand back.

523
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:40,920


524
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,140
In the face of a lie, I won't stand back, I won't stand by.

525
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:51,360
I won't watch our freedom die, I won't stand back, I won't stand by.

526
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,760
Time is now, time is short, voting's not a spectator sport.

527
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:06,480
Ask me and I'll reply, I won't stand back and I won't stand by.

528
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:15,380
There's a sickness we can't deny, don't stand back, don't stand by.

529
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,580
You might be scared, but don't be shy, don't stand back, don't stand by.

530
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,720
Time is short, time is now, they get away with what we allow.

531
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,160
There's only do, there is no try.

532
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,460
Don't stand back, don't stand by.

533
00:28:38,600 --> 00:29:02,340
Don't stand back, don't stand by.

534
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,740
In the face of hate,

535
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,460
In the face of hate,

536
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:06,460


537
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,260
In the face of a lie, don't stand back, don't stand by.

538
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,380
Toe to toe and eye to eye, don't stand back, don't stand by.

539
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,540
Don't stand back, don't stand by.

540
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,940
And I won't stand back, I won't stand by.

541
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,200
I won't stand back, I won't stand by.

542
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,300
That was Stuart Stott's Local 2020,

543
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,920
part of a new huge stack of music recently sent to me by Reverend Velveteen Sly

544
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,460
of beloved Sister Station WORT in Madison.

545
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,880
We have a lot to listen to,

546
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,460
and listening is harder work than some might think for a partially deaf person.

547
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,020
But now, back to our Slight No. 76 from 1986

548
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:08,400
with Sister Chris on her old subgenius show on WFMU in New Jersey.

549
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,080
And let me tell you, friends,

550
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,580
it's not just the swelling coffers of the elder bankers.

551
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,600
It's not just the truncated detention spans of the conspiracy glorps

552
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,380
scrambling to get that ever-elusive status symbol.

553
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,140
It's not just the vapid shells of the chicken-like models

554
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,000
posing on camera.

555
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,040
It's not just the puppet rock idols

556
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,780
playing into the hands of the hell-spawned image consultants.

557
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,640
It's not just the cannibal zombies gorging themselves on self-interest.

558
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,000
It's not just the video pigs wallowing in visual sludge.

559
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,760
It's not just the mellow morons

560
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,560
stuck in a time zone from the good old days, man.

561
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,600
It's not just the aerobic airheads

562
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,820
working themselves into a cardiac arrest.

563
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,000
It's not just the talentless pinks

564
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,220
hooked into a groove devoid of style.

565
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:09,320
It's not just the fuzzy dice brains rampaging like the Visigoths.

566
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,820
It's not just the misguided gummy space creatures.

567
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,700
It's not just the oppression of the raging slabs of the lame leftists.

568
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,220
It's not just the frothy mouths of the reactionaries.

569
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,160
It's not just the blank food tubes slamming their craniums against the walls of their own creation.

570
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:32,000
It's not just the empty youth culture borrowing from the ABC cartoons.

571
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,000


572
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,180
It's not just the computerized format of possible personas.

573
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,340
It's that and a whole lot more.

574
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,120
Thank you, Sister Chris. We love you.

575
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,380
Join us now, shall we?

576
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,340
Yes, join us at the ankles and hips.

577
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,080
Thank you.

578
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,380
Now we're ready to hop off to our special sky ride.

579
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,060
Don't you wish you were with us?

580
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,000
Well, send in your money, and maybe some money, too.

581
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,000


582
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,980
One day, you can.

583
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,120
No, really, we're a fun crowd.

584
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,320
You'd like us to move in next door to you.

585
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,660
To you, we'd be indistinguishable from the others you might see in your town.

586
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,380
Oh, maybe we'd have a wink in our twinkling eye, or a smile or a leer on our lips,

587
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,800
but otherwise, we'd look like everyday Joe Lunchbale,

588
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,600
a good, solid, honest, cream-colored working man,

589
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,180
ready to move in next to you and send the property values soaring.

590
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,340
How about it, America?

591
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,160
Well, let's try it out, huh?

592
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,620
For a typewritten transcript of this show, you'd have to be out of...

593
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,420
What's going on? I feel so sleepy!

594
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,300
Disobedient to parents, a subgenius.

595
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,380
Steals, a subgenius.

596
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,960
Lies, a subgenius.

597
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,880
Hater of God, a subgenius.

598
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,720
Whisperer, a subgenius.

599
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,040
Whoremonger, a subgenius.

600
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,580
Envious, a subgenius.

601
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,980
Pride, a subgenius.

602
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,020
A backbiter, a subgenius.

603
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,980
A deceitful person, a subgenius.

604
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,720
A hypocrite, a subgenius.

605
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,620
Unmerciful, a subplenius.

606
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,340
A false accuser, a subpenius.

607
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,620
Well, I guess that about wraps it up. That's your typical subgenius now.

608
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,580
And, uh...

609
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,920
Monk, I don't need Dobbs. There's nothing wrong with me. I'll make it my way.

610
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,320
Oh, good.

611
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,660
I must have been insane. What can I say? I'm lost without Dobbs.

612
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,960
Without Bob, I'm guilty. Guilty.

613
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:41,420
Be not deceived. Dobbs is not mocked. For whosoever a man soeth, him also shall he reap.

614
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,420
For it is my shepherd, I shall not want.

615
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,400
That's right, dear friends. That's right.

616
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,560
Uh, thank you, Reverend Howe.

617
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,360
I guess he wasn't a doctor yet.

618
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,680
Now, I'm about to play a beloved piece by our heroes, the Firesign Theatre.

619
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,400
From the album and film, Everything You Know Is Wrong.

620
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,320
I believe that soon, that album will be having its 50th anniversary.

621
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:14,140
This year is the 50th anniversary of the previous album, Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me The Pliers.

622
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,460
That probably doesn't make you feel old, if you aren't old.

623
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,880
The Firesign Theatre.

624
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,600
The Firesign Theatre.

625
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:24,800


626
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:25,720
The Firesign Theatre.

627
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,680
The Firesign Theatre.

628
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,360
The Firesign Theatre.

629
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,080
You're old or happy.

630
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,140
I wanted the woods and the Indians to sleep with me.

631
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,660
But I was afraid of the cold and made them sleep outside.

632
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,780
So, I never felt the touch of a warm, naked Indian.

633
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,740
Or, or in a cold, naked forest.

634
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,060
Ben Franklin.

635
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,840
The only President of the United States.

636
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:04,660
who was never President of the United States. Was he an early drug user? Let's

637
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:12,020
see. He wrote of it in Poor Dick's Conspiracy in 1761 while still an

638
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,640
apprentice book baker in colonial Philadelphia.

639
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:22,200
So I betook me to the hash fire inn for a secret caucus of the hotheads, rebellious

640
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,720
libertines all lusting for life and liberty. The real George Washington brought the hemp,

641
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,700
and all of the evening cleaners. We quickly proceeded to get slag of the

642
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:38,060
medals and young Tom Everson goodly stretched by the hemp, which smoked us

643
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,420
all like Boston's scrot. What a fetid fervor of freedom.

644
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,060
I say, let's have a revolution.

645
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,560
Straight looked glarily Sam the tax collector, to which Big Ben replied,

646
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,700
Fine, Sam.

647
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,180
You're a good man.

648
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,820
Then we can invite over a bunch of immigrants and make cars.

649
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:03,240
Yes, 1761. Hemp kindled the fire of American history.

650
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,180
Never be clockwork villains.

651
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,740
History.

652
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,880
I want to remind our listeners that we're talking with the director,

653
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,980
producer, and the writer of this wonderful film, J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

654
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:33,100
And so that's important. And I'm going to ask Reverend Drummond here.

655
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,820
I have to ask you this because I'm a comedy nut. I go way back with all this stuff.

656
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,960
But were you guys influenced at all by Fireside Theater?

657
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:45,520
Oh, yeah, definitely. We were big Fireside Theater fans.

658
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,860
We, you know, one of the terms early on in the church, one of the terms that, you know, I was a big Fireside Theater fan.

659
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,820
Reverend Stang and I developed was the term called Macho Irony,

660
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,240
is that we wanted this to be as ironic as it could be.

661
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:08,080
So sometimes we would say, we would say the most blatant lies, but we try to do it with the straightest face possible.

662
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,560
Make them sound as true as they are.

663
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,180
And people would say, I can't believe you can say that with a straight face.

664
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,580
But I mean, that was part of the whole thing is that, you know, we really enjoyed the whole sense of irony.

665
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:21,840
And I think that's what we're trying to do.

666
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,280
We tried to put it into everything.

667
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:27,900
And, you know, kind of like nowadays, nobody gets a joke anymore.

668
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,060
It's sort of like we're in a post irony period.

669
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,820
We are.

670
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,660
People don't even understand it anymore.

671
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,620
You know, you get in trouble for joking around, saying the wrong things.

672
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:47,040
It's real easy these days, you know, and those were the kind of things that we kind of filled our cart with back in the old days, you know.

673
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,840
So it's, and part of that was in that time making fun of the people.

674
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,980
And I think the idea of making fun of something and showing how ridiculous it was was a good way to teach people about things.

675
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:04,740
We did over time build a pretty large community of people that even today all communicate with each other.

676
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:14,540
You know, they've got there's probably 25 different Facebook groups where people are, you know, the subgenius film society, the subgenius book club.

677
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,740
And so genius slack hole.

678
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,620
And all these different places that people gather.

679
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,800
And sort of in the name of Bob.

680
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,000
And, and they do it, they do it.

681
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,420
It's just part of their lives.

682
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:44,840
And for some people, it really did fill that void that that sense of community that maybe in the past was filled by a church or some religious organization now is like, we can get all that same stuff that they used to offer but we can get it from these guys, you know this.

683
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,880
And, and we can sort of make up our own rules.

684
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,600
Yeah.

685
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,600
And, and just be people.

686
00:38:52,340 --> 00:39:11,080
And, and so that's been kind of interesting as the community that has developed over time and that and Sandy said something about earlier it's not like we were afraid we're going to pass that pass away tomorrow or anything but there's a lot of people out there that up until, you know, I would say, maybe a year, two years ago.

687
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:18,520
They didn't know that Steve Wilcox and Philo Drummond was the same person because, you know, for 40 years.

688
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,600
I never left the church.

689
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,460
I never let my guard down.

690
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:39,440
When I was Philo, I was Philo, you know, he has a little bit different personality than Steve does, you know, and I think that a lot of subgenius is who chose their own subgenius name were ready to assume an identity that they felt inside for a long time but didn't feel comfortable wearing it in public, you know.

691
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:49,580
I do want to go back to because that we were talking about the late 70s, early 80s is when the church began to form and come up with the sort of the iconography of the church.

692
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:49,580


693
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:49,960
And I think that's really important.

694
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:49,960


695
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,060
And I think that's the, you know, the iconography and sort of the some of the broad outlines of the church.

696
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,000
But you know, this is an era and I'm going to go back and sort of betray my, my age here a little bit.

697
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:06,560
But I mentioned Fireside Theater, there was the National Lampoon Radio Dinner Hour, there were a lot of, there was a lot of humor around during that time.

698
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:19,400
That was ironic, that was sardonic, that was, that was, had turned things on its head, took, took convention, and really torqued it, really made it weird, right?

699
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:19,560
Yeah.

700
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:26,680
And I think of R. Crumb, you mentioned him earlier as some of these, there was that late 60s into the 70s, that sort of mindset.

701
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:33,360
It was about anti-authoritarianism, it was about, you know, F the man, you know, he's not going to tell me, that's all that stuff.

702
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,500
And over time, it got a little weird and a little misogynistic over time.

703
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:44,880
But, but there was a real nice period there, where it was genuinely funny, genuinely heartfelt.

704
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:49,560
And I think, for me, that's what you embody in, in, in the church.

705
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:49,560


706
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,320
And I think that's what you do in the film, and in the whole, that, you captured that sort of zeitgeist.

707
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,940
It, is that, am I being fair to you and to the church?

708
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,320
Oh yeah, I think so, and I think that's what Sandy was, she definitely picked that up in the film.

709
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,560
And I don't know that we could have done it, because we're just sort of too close to it, you know?

710
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,920
Yeah, I want to ask Sandy, we just got a couple more minutes.

711
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:18,480
Sandy, you know, it's, what's, there's a lot of fun things about it, but one of the things about J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

712
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,140
it was the finding the people who are fans, and Richard Linklater is in the film, Nick Offerman, Penn Jillette,

713
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,240
there are a number of people that are cool people in the film.

714
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,880
What was it like to go to them and hearing what they had to say about the church?

715
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:40,140
Well, there's, there's so many, but we even contacted R. Crumb, but he was ill at the time, and he could not do the interview.

716
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,700
But there were several that were willing, and so, and, and David Byrne was a big part of it.

717
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,240
Jonathan Demme had passed.

718
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,280
He was a part of it.

719
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,720
And, and so.

720
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:50,940
Hewie Herman.

721
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,920
Paul Rubens.

722
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,540
Yes, Paul, that's right.

723
00:41:53,660 --> 00:42:00,900
They were all, but these were the guys that not only did Nick Offerman and also Devo,

724
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,260
Jerry Casale.

725
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,380
Jerry Casale.

726
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,300
Yeah, but, Paul Rubens, too, right.

727
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,160
But those are the, the guys that interviewed were the ones that said, actually agreed to.

728
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:15,600
I sent out many requests, you know, and saying who has time and who can do this.

729
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:21,960
And, and, and the main thing, a lot of people that brought up some issues about why did you have Rick Linklater?

730
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,640
Well, the reason I had Rick is because he named his film Slacker.

731
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:32,940
And it was all during the subgenius unit that was going on in Austin in the early 80s.

732
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:44,580
And, and I got him to admit that, yes, it, you know, in Rick's way, well, yeah, it did come from the term slack or, you know, from the subgenius.

733
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,580
And that was a catch.

734
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,380
And that was a key point for selling this thing.

735
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,640
It was like, okay.

736
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,240
And people go, why Rick?

737
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,960
And I'm going, well, you know, this is why.

738
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:59,000
And then Nick Offerman, it was really, his story is amazing about living on a farm in this rural area.

739
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,260
And when he didn't get any of the subgenius until he had gone off to school.

740
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:15,560
And then Penn Jillette was the same situation where his life was blown out of the water by this and how this mentality and this humor, you know, affected his life and helped them be successful.

741
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:15,560


742
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:20,300
And it was a way for them to go beyond their, you know, visions of what they were brought up with in their childhood.

743
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,340
Oh, yes, yes, yes, dear friends.

744
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:33,220
Oh, we're coming down, getting, getting sort of close to the end of the hour there.

745
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:40,800
And I'm going to continue talking about the aspects of preachers going crazy on the radio.

746
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,260
Specifically here on the hour of slack.

747
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,740
A couple of weeks ago.

748
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:53,400
Now, you have to understand, friends, that being a jerk, that's my outlet for artistic, I mean, religious expression.

749
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:05,620
After all, most, I mean, preachers utilize the techniques of presumptuousness, orneriness, corniness, and a sort of posed intolerance.

750
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:11,280
And I also use stupidity and especially cantankerousness.

751
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,440
I can't really, you know, I can't relax.

752
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:20,300
Unless I'm being cantankerous and inflicting my personal bile and spleen on others.

753
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,880
It's hate, dear friends.

754
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,580
And you wouldn't interfere with my right to hate to do my own thing, now would you?

755
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,640
This is a free country.

756
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:32,060
Besides, how can you since I'm the one that's transmitting and you're only receiving?

757
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,060
Only receiving, friends.

758
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,820
Does that insult you like last time?

759
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,420
Well, good!

760
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,720
That shows that I'm succeeding in, in, in doing Bob's assignment of getting you to stop talking.

761
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:44,720


762
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,180
Stop letting the conspiracy, or even subgenius preachers, push you around.

763
00:44:49,500 --> 00:45:03,040
This obscure church would be the next inquisition where I'm not constantly training you through applied obnoxiousness to be in a continuous state of not merely defensiveness, but outright rebellion.

764
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,820
And if you let me get any more abusive, I'll have to kill you.

765
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,180
Because you'll deserve it.

766
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,580
It's like, I'm, I'm like an anti-role model.

767
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,560
That's what most subgenius, all subgeniuses should be.

768
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,680
Anti-role models.

769
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:22,140
Besides, how dare you criticize the judgments meted out by King Stang?

770
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:28,860
You, you mock my total disregard for the, the broadcast niceties.

771
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,580
Oh, but have you thought about your soul?

772
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,240
Have you even got a girlfriend yet, huh?

773
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,360
Oh, my jibes have but barely begun.

774
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:43,460
I could, I could rant a paragraph to you that would have every one of you listeners jumping off a high bridge

775
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,700
to escape the mob.

776
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,560
But the mocking truth wielded by my tongue.

777
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,860
Or Janeers.

778
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,940
Now, I didn't start out this way, nay.

779
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,380
I was a gentle man at one time.

780
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:58,400
But I've undergone teasings by the blackest minds of our generation.

781
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:08,100
If I can take it from the likes of Lies and G. Gordon Gordon, then you'd best urinate in fear at the thought of what I could dish out to you on the radio.

782
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,360
To the innocent and guilty alike.

783
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,360
For, as my ment, mentor, Dr. Drummond, told me.

784
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,300
None are so blind as those who have no eyes.

785
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:24,580
He who dares to mock King Stang and rouse him from his torpid reveries and clairvoyant visions

786
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:33,680
hath played out but the first move in a galactic game on which hinges the very fate of this physical universe itself.

787
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,460
Congratulations, dear friends.

788
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,400
You've now entered kindergarten in the school of terror.

789
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,420
Oh, don't worry.

790
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,400
It won't kill you.

791
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,340
Indeed, it'll actually help you to keep your intelligence up.

792
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,880
It's from decreasing at the same pace as your peers.

793
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,280
But, uh, but at what cost, dear listener?

794
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,880
At what cost?

795
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,380
At what cost?

796
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,280
Oh, I'm well aware of all your plans to assassinate me.

797
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,460
Ha! Oh, surprise you, nay.

798
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,140
Yes, I can see far, far more than you think.

799
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,720
More than you could ever imagine in your wildest LSD dreams.

800
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,220
Fine! Go ahead! Kill me!

801
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,180
You would-be Judas!

802
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,040
You would-be Judas and Luther!

803
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:26,720
Make your blindingly imbecilic move, your mere-hume attempt to wrest controls from the claws of this Stang demon you hallucinate.

804
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,180
Death would be but a step up in my ascension to ultimate power.

805
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,700
Next to Bob, of course.

806
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,460
And have you not guessed that certain contingency plans have been laid?

807
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,120
Thinketh you not of the Children of the Stang?

808
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,280
Oh, I've read my Frank Herbert closely.

809
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:50,320
The Atreides conspiracy is but a high school prank compared to the all-reaching arms of the Stang octopus.

810
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:58,220
Oh, your science fiction has ill-prepared you for the next generation of the Stang Ones.

811
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:13,020
What to your undiscerning ears is but a lively boy of seven and a sweet little girl of six have undergone since birth certain forbidden training regimens which will render all your weapons, all your propaganda, and all your mental hexes.

812
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,340
Impotent! Utterly impotent!

813
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,780
Kill Stang One and the Emperor Xandar is unchained.

814
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:28,480
And at that point, you can kiss your world, your human society, your innocent subgenius church goodbye forever.

815
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:36,240
Or perhaps, if by some accident of God, the Emperor Xandar were eliminated, oh, then you would face the Tev One.

816
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,460
And do you think they're my only offspring?

817
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,700
Have you fools never watched a Star Wars movie?

818
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,000
Just as Darth Vader?

819
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,720
Darth Vader's son Luke was kept from knowing of his own sister's existence.

820
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:53,940
Do you think that, that, um, I, the Darth Vader of Dallas, have shown all my cards?

821
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,120
Oh, no indeed, dear friends.

822
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,140
No indeedy, I say.

823
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,900
But you'll see.

824
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,420
Ha ha ha.

825
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,680
Well, stay tuned for, uh, he is now in our...

826
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,800
You've been listening to King Stang, ultimate stud groupie attractor

827
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,920
and mystic psychic power monger, the very left brain of Dobbs,

828
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,260
the chosen bringer, dear friends of terror and lawsuits,

829
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:26,740
owner of the trademark of God on Earth, slayer of would-be scribe ship usurpers,

830
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:31,880
subjector of all bobbies, decider of degrees of fame of subgenius mortals,

831
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:37,820
second chosen of the fishers of wallets, biggest-organed and sexiest-voiced entrapper of radio groupies,

832
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,780
subduer of hecklers, butt-splitter of moonies, exploiter of comedians,

833
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:46,040
idiot savant, master of the sardonic, over-the-cubed, violator of postal...

834
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,080
Oh, forget it.

835
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,500
Thank you for bringing up Slack, because I meant to bring that up with Reverend Drummond.

836
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,380
Uh, and that, I know you're adverse to trying to exactly define Slack,

837
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:02,820
but I, I'd just like to hear your take for the, for the uninitiated,

838
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:07,980
for those of us who have not been, uh, members of the, uh, the subgenius church,

839
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,220
how would you describe to an outsider what Slack is?

840
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,700
Well, let me ask you a question.

841
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,780
In your mind right now, what do you want Slack to be?

842
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,000
That's what it is.

843
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:22,900
That's what it is.

844
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,480
You got it.

845
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,600
You got it.

846
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,780
See, I put it right there in your mind, and you had your mind's eye, and you looked right at it.

847
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,560
Yeah, I did.

848
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:33,500
I did.

849
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,820
Well, that's, amen, amen, Reverend, amen to you.

850
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,600
I, I, uh, I'm at church today.

851
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,760
I, I want to thank you.

852
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,640
Thank you for all of that.

853
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,600
Um, well, this is, it's been a blast.

854
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,560
It's so much fun.

855
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,220
The film is so much fun.

856
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,100
Uh, it's called J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

857
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,740
It is in virtual theaters.

858
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,780
Actually, it's been in virtual theaters for a couple of weeks now.

859
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,800
Tell us if we want to see this somewhere down the line, if we can see it now,

860
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,480
or if we can see it in the near future.

861
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,440
Sandy K. Boone, how would we do that?

862
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,240
Uh, it's on Amazon.

863
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,620
It's on Fandango.

864
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,540
It's on iTunes.

865
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,720
It's on Apple.

866
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,780
And it's on Vudu right now.

867
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,580
I know.

868
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,220
It's on, yeah, it's on Amazon.

869
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,760
Oh, you said Amazon.

870
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:17,220
Okay.

871
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:17,900
Yeah, that's okay.

872
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,080
No.

873
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,220
And you can stream it.

874
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,700
The only way you can do it is rent it or buy it.

875
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,520
But it's what?

876
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,320
$4.99?

877
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:24,220


878
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,180
Yeah, it's like $3.99 to rent and $9.99 to buy.

879
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:28,980
To buy.

880
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,600
I mean, it's like, don't buy it.

881
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,880
You know, I'm never going to make my money back, but at least some money would be great.

882
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:40,700
Listen, is, is $9.99 worth changing your life for the future?

883
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,000
The better.

884
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,600
Is it?

885
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,200
I mean, is it?

886
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:42,920
Exactly.

887
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,700
It's cheaper than a membership.

888
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:45,620
That's right.

889
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,200
That's true.

890
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,840
Well, if for people who-

891
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,140
$35 will get you a membership.

892
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:51,860
Yeah, that's right.

893
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:52,600
You can be your own.

894
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:53,760
Well, and-

895
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,120
You can start your own church then.

896
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:55,900
Thank you.

897
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,080
They can, they can go to subgeniusmovie.com.

898
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:03,800
And if, and Reverend Drummond, if they choose to want to join the church, how would they

899
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,140
do that?

900
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:04,800
Where would they go?

901
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,800
They go to subgenius.com.

902
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:07,860
Yeah.

903
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,180
There you go.

904
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,760
Or look for the link that says new members.

905
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:10,640
Fantastic.

906
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:15,120
Well, I've got my hands in the air raised to the heavens.

907
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:20,800
And I want to thank both of you very, very much for spending some time with us.

908
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:28,580
Steve Wilcox, Dr. Phil Philodrumon, and also who is one of the founders of this amazing

909
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:35,380
institution, as well as director, producer, and writer of J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church

910
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,300
of the Subgenius.

911
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,460
And that would be Sandy K. Boone.

912
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,660
Thank you so very much.

913
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,420
Thank you.

914
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:40,800
All right.

915
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,520
Thanks a lot, Mike.

916
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:53,760

920
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:06,020
From PR News in Washington, I'm a humanitarian catastrophe.

921
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:07,920
We have a problem.

922
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,180
We don't have a leader in the county.

923
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,600
The person has history with the local government.

924
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:10,680
We don't have a leader in the county.

925
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:10,680


926
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:10,680


927
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:10,680


928
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,680
The DOW is 1.24453.

929
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,140
The State Department is upgrading its assessment of PR news.

930
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,300
It's mostly blank in Washington.

931
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:30,380
And this is your host, a king, pope killer, Reverend Ivan Stang, arbor of hypness, down

932
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:38,560
putter of talk show hosts in my mighty glibness, son of the king of bull shatters, he who has

933
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,200
hath been copied by David Byrne and Garrison Keillor,

934
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,000
payer of royalty checks to tight-running buddies,

935
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,060
contract signer of all paying subgenius projects,

936
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,320
president of the corporation of all Dobbs PR,

937
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,020
48% owner of the Janer tongue,

938
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,240
first interpreter of the dogma,

939
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,340
enrager of pinks and lesser subgeniuses alike,

940
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:04,980
living embodiment of hate, slack under Dobbs,

941
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,540
keeper of the original Dobbs image,

942
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:11,080
midge carrot dangler of long-promised magazines,

943
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,100
and returner of compliments.

944
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,480
You faithless.

945
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:28,060
You faithless.

946
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,700
Imagination is more important than knowledge.

947
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,100
Albert Einstein.

948
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,680
Imagine there's no heaven.

949
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,120
It's easy if you try.

950
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:11,580
No hell below us.

951
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,500
Above us only sky.

952
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,520
Imagine all the people

953
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,900
living for today.

954
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:34,000
Imagine there's no countries.

955
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,460
No heaven.

956
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,500
Isn't hard to do.

957
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,500
Nothing to kill or die for.

958
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,900
And no religion too.

959
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,820
Imagine all the people

960
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,480
living life in peace.

961
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,020
You may say,

962
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,740
I'm a dreamer.

963
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,980
But I'm not the only one.

964
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,400
I hope someday you will join us.

965
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,760
And the world will be as one.

966
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,880
Imagine no possessions.

967
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,000
Imagine no possessions.

968
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,520
Imagine no possessions.

969
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:37,520


970
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:45,760

00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:48,960
Imagine no symbols.

973
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:48,960


974
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,100
Imagine no any thing you'll never forget.

975
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:50,400
Imagine no any thing you'll never forget.

976
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:51,000


977
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,120
Imagine no evil beings posterior to fate.

978
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:52,680
Imagine no

979
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,040
any point in the planet.

980
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:54,060
Imagine no subscribers.

981
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:54,220
Imagine no life,

982
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:54,220


983
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:54,220

00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:54,220

Imagine all the people

Sure

1021
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,480
Also

1022
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,200
You have no side

1023
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,820
I really want to be

1024
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,520
Not see what may become

1025
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:17,520


1026
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,000
See what that will change

1027
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,320
See

1028
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,280
As it doesn't matter

1029
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:36,300
I'm not the only one

1030
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,200
and her husband, Carlos Santana.

1031
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,480
There's a pretty tripped-out video of that on YouTube.

1032
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,240
This is your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang,

1033
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,060
signing out and praising that old man, Bob.

1034
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,740
Ahimsa! Ahuga!
