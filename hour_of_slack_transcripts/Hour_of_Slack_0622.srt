1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
Oh boy!

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,640
I wonder with Bozo

3
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,620
On a tour with Bozo

4
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,540
Life will be as merry as a song

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,600
So when Bozo goes a dreamin'

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,460
Dream along, dream along, dream along with Bozo

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,600
Hehehehahahaha!

8
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,540
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,900
which reaches from the inner mind to

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,300
The subgenius power of SWAT!

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,960
Life is different

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,060
Time

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,720
We love you baby, we love you

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,940
Coming to a radio near you

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,460
The greatest program ever heard

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,860
Just press any afflicted body part against the radio

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,060
And feel the healing power of the fuel injected

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,020
Semi-far out subgenius hour of SLAT!

19
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,560
Cures fallen arches, impotence, hemorrhoids, bad teeth

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,640
Terminal conservatism and boredom

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,280
Gets a thousand bucks

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,220
A thousand miles to the gallon

23
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,820
Crashes into freeway supports at 500 miles per hour

24
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,360
And still comes back for more

25
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,060
Makes Christine look like a Yugo

26
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,900
Recharges dead batteries in seconds

27
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,080
Diverts tornadoes and sends lightning towards the nearest government building

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,880
Gets rid of wrinkles in everything

29
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,840
Turns black and white TVs into color models like that

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,980
The subgenius hour of SLAT!

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,780
Can turn a tiresome house cat into a lovely set of driving gloves instantly

32
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,660
Puts tread back on old tires

33
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,680
Mystically rebuilds gummy carburetors

34
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,660
Wipes your debts off computer rolls nationwide

35
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,360
And puts scorpions in the pants of your employers

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,820
Break the psychic speed limit of your own mind

37
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,280
By tuning into the subgenius hour of SLAT!

38
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,920
With your demonic pit crew boss

39
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,820
The high octane river and Ivan Stang

40
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,800
Oh that's me!

41
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,080
I guess that's where I was supposed to come in

42
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,640
Oh yeah, it was Hell Poe Kiwi

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,400
We've got everything tonight

44
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,620
We've got puzzling evidence

45
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,580
We've got tons and tons of really weird music

46
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,200
Well that's always true

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,100
That was true back in that show

48
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,700
What show was that?

49
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,280
Um...

50
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Hey where's my CD background noise?

51
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:02,960
Damn it!

52
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,120
Oh I had it plugged into the amp instead of into the mixer

53
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,320
Don't you see?

54
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,460
Yes friends

55
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,460
And uh...

56
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,600
Oh we do have...

57
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,440
That was Hell Poe Kiwi doing that old hour of SLAT promo

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,220
We're listening to Oseva in the background

59
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,920
I got to hear them do this live

60
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,800
Uh...

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,440
In New York

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,700
A couple of weeks ago

63
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,480
Friends it's been a very busy time

64
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,380
That's why I've had to send out re-runs

65
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,380
Although I'm happy to send out re-runs

66
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,600
It's important that you young people hear that old stuff by us old people

67
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,580
But I've got tapes from the Music Militia's amazing

68
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,440
Shall we call it Screw the Grammys

69
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,800
Event in New York

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,620
Which uh...

71
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,140
Oh god

72
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,080
It was everything that it was promised to be

73
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,720
Of course

74
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,980
And um...

75
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,460
What else have I got here?

76
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,880
Oh a wonderful Suzie the Floozy morality play

77
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,860
Concerning X Day

78
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,240
Which we'll get to I guess down towards the end

79
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,760
We have a new Jehovah Hates Fred album

80
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,220
That is very beer influenced

81
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,120
And yet despite that false SLAT ambience

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,520
They somehow managed to do a kick up job

83
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,600
Um...

84
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,820
The uh...

85
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,680
Screw the Grammys uh...

86
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,820
Awards uh...

87
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,640
Ceremony recording came out really good

88
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,440
Uh...

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,460
Praise um...

90
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,240
Oceva and Nick from Grass

91
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,540
Who uh...

92
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,160
Did all that

93
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,640
We'll be hearing a lot of that

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,140
Although friends

95
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,420
I've got to leave for the Seattle and Portland Devivals in a day or so

96
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,760
And I don't know if I have time to cut the cuss words out of the anti-Grammys stuff

97
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,180
Uh...

98
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,340
Dr. Legume was there

99
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,820
I was there

100
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,840
And of course uh...

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,720
And King Missile

102
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,040
John Hall of King Missile was there

103
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,120
I've got an excellent recording of his new stuff

104
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,820
But it's all very cuss worthy

105
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,260
It's very lathered in um...

106
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,460
Words that can only be played in uh...

107
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,680
Totalitarian countries such as Canada

108
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,140
Or on illegal pirate broadcast stations

109
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,920
Praise Bob

110
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
So um...

111
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,400
Uh...

112
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,840
Yes thank you thank you

113
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,160
Thank you Ender thank you

114
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,860
We also have some ESO of course

115
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,020
And um...

116
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,560
Oh!

117
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,160
Oh I should mention friends

118
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,180
That uh...

119
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,780
We finished

120
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,800
The sti...

121
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,440
You know I've been mentioned every now and then

122
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,040
The uh...

123
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,360
The Steve Jackson Games Illuminati New World Order subgenius game

124
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,020
And the graphics that I've been working really hard on

125
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,600
And that's done!

126
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,180
It's done my friends!

127
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,500
In fact I've got a uh...

128
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,280
Black and white print out of the...

129
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,400
The card...

130
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Each card in front of me

131
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,340
And the box

132
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,080
Oh god the box looks great

133
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,260
If only I could project this in color

134
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,980
If only radio wasn't just...

135
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,140
I don't know

136
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,140


137
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,140


138
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,140


139
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,140


140
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,140


141
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,140


142
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,140


143
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,140


144
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,140


145
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,140


146
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,140


147
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,920
2D black and white

148
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,320
Man I...

149
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,060
God I could...

150
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,000
Well like...

151
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,780
Like here's the...

152
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,120
Here's a typical card

153
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
Okay this is a...

154
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,540
A uh...

155
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,420
Card that requires subgenius action

156
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,060
In the game

157
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,720
I'm not sure what that means

158
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,680
I've never played this game

159
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,760
But it's uh...

160
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,220
It's uh...

161
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,220
The card is called Eternal Salvation

162
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,680
Or Triple Your Money Back

163
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,740
And it has a picture of Bob

164
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,680
A 3D graphic that I did

165
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,920
With Nenslo's help

166
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,020
Of Bob in Hell

167
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,120
And it's uh...

168
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,120


169
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,120


170
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,120


171
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,120


172
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,120


173
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,120


174
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,180
Holding out a refund check for $90

175
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,700
And there's a little blurb at the bottom of it

176
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,160
That says two!

177
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,560
Count em!

178
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:23,740
Two!

179
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,840
And this is true friends

180
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,160
Two paradises for $30

181
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,240
One while you're alive

182
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,660
Lasting as long as you want

183
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,260
And one when you decide to die

184
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,160
No other religion offers a better deal

185
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,460
Offer good through July 4th 1998

186
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,480
Did you hear that friends?

187
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,820
Offer good through July 4th 1998

188
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,260
Some restrictions apply

189
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,860
Void where prohibited by law

190
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,240
Close cover before striking

191
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,020
Please recycle

192
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:55,300
slightly higher in Canada. Play this card at any time. Draw enough new plots to fill your hand out

193
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:02,120
to five. You may only play this card once per game. It requires an action from one subgenius

194
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:09,760
group. The rules for this game are very arcane, and they're tied into the best-selling Illuminati

195
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:18,940
game that Steve Jackson... Actually, the boxed card set will be out in April or so. As far as I'm

196
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:26,180
concerned, it's one of the great final end-time subgenius products. It's actually a Discordian

197
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:34,820
slash subgenius collaboration, because Steve Jackson Games is about as close to a Discordian

198
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,700
center headquarters as I guess there'll ever be.

199
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,180
Well, I've got two little news things to read to you, friends. Number one, the Sacramento Bee

200
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,180
reported in November that a group of young people from the East Valley Four Square Church in

201
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:58,440
Orangevale, California, were recently observed playing what they call Bambi Baseball, supervised

202
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,580
by youth minister Robin Gattis. Bambi Baseball. The name came from what was used as a bat,

203
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,580
the frozen leg of a deer. A frozen cow tongue.

204
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,260
Number two, the game was played by a person who was a member of the Bambi Baseball League,

205
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:15,100
and the person who played the game was the ball. Bambi Baseball. It was also reported that an earlier

206
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:24,440
version of the game was played by swinging a frozen trout to hit a frozen squid. More about those

207
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:31,620
squids later, friends. At one point in the course of doing the game, I personally was called upon to

208
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:39,520
create an illustration to fit the card and concept, Reign of Prairie Squid.

209
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:48,580
And, in fact, using techniques perfected by assassinated Nen's Master Nen's Low, I was able to create

210
00:07:50,260 --> 00:08:01,500
80 3D squids and depict them raining from a clear blue sky. We'll play a song about that later.

211
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:08,340
Now, this last thing, and this is an Hour of Slack, as far as I know for radio and media, this is an

212
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,500
Hour of Slack exclusive.

213
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,360
This came off the internet, but, well, actually, it was emailed. It was something emailed directly to

214
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,020
subgenius Byron Werner by someone named Greg McGuire, who went...

215
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:30,940
Last week, I read an article about Monica Lewinsky, the president's girlfriend. Yes, it's okay. What?

216
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,800
Jennifer and I are going to go cruise around like crazy young ruffians.

217
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,320
You're going to cruise around?

218
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Like, well...

219
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,840
Heathens.

220
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,900
We are heathens around here.

221
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,220
Yeah. What are heathens?

222
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:46,700
Okay.

223
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:47,740
Okay.

224
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,300
Those are people who believe in Bob or don't believe in Bob. Have fun.

225
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,300
We're heathens.

226
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Okay. Anyway, this guy went to school, or went to the same school that Monica Lewinsky did, elementary school.

227
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,960
I read an article about Monica Lewinsky, discovered that she attended the same elementary school that my younger brother attended.

228
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,480
While I was visiting my parents, I was reading about the same school that my younger brother attended.

229
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,020
I was reading about her parents. Curiosity got to me, and I decided to look her up in the yearbook from 1982.

230
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:25,780
Monica must have missed picture day, because not a single third grader resembled her, though I did find a picture of Tori90210 spelling, who was in Monica's class.

231
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:33,840
However, I did find...what I did find was even more entertaining. A large section of the yearbook had stories and poems written by all the students.

232
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,420
The third grade students each wrote a poem called I Am...

233
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,080
. . .

234
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:46,200
Some titles include I Am a Monster, I Am a Doll, I Am Pac-Man. Remember, this is from 1982, and I Am Superman.

235
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,000
I submit to you, this email says, the poems by the two most famous third graders. This is not a joke.

236
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:06,660
The first one is by Tori Spelling, friends. Now, I've noticed that people, men anyway, seem to, and women both, I guess, seem to, if you bring up Tori Spelling, they either go,

237
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,060
She's the ugliest woman in the world!

238
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,520
She's the ugliest woman on TV!

239
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,200
Or else, and I'm of this latter group,

240
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,040
Yeah, that horse face makes her the most interesting looking woman on TV.

241
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,020
I, man, I...

242
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:34,740
I like Tori. I like Tori Spelling's looks, friends. Anyway, it's that, that, it's almost a joker face. Almost. But yet, it just, mmm, that jaw, ugh. She almost looks like a female bob.

243
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,040
Anyway, I Am an Elf, by Tori Spelling.

244
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,040


245
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:51,120
I am an elf, my own little self. I am so small, you can't see me at all. If you ask what I eat, only one small red beet. I hide on a shelf, my own little self, I am an elf.

246
00:10:51,400 --> 00:11:05,640
Now, um, that's just a cute, very bland poem. I don't think it says anything about Tori Spelling. All I care about Tori Spelling is that she has the richest dad in Hollywood, and the biggest house.

247
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,220
And if I could marry my son off to her, man, if I could marry her, huh, oh, whoa.

248
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,700
But Monica Lewinsky's poem is classic. It is called I Am a Pizza.

249
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:31,460
I am a pizza. I can be a delicious lunch, dinner, or breakfast if you're weird. I have a great deal of toppings on me.

250
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,800
I am a round and flat piece of dough

251
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:54,000
with lots of toppings. I make your mouth water. I am very good to eat, but I'm fattening. I am a mouth's best friend. I make you say yum yum. I am a pizza.

252
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,900
By Monica Lewinsky, third grade.

253
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,620
Now, um, I just think, friends, I think that that, uh,

254
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:15,180
I think that girl sounds like a bonobo type of, uh, subgenius, actually. She sounds like she just, the girl has to have it. The president had to have it.

255
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:23,280
Who, have I said this before on this show? Who would you rather have with their finger on the button that can destroy the world?

256
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,540
A, a pent-up old guy that has to pay for it?

257
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,980
Or a, a, a satisfied, fat and happy,

258
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,780
a, a, a satisfied, fat and happy,

259
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:34,780


260
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,020
guy that just finished,

261
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:48,360
uh, being a recipient of a, a fine sleeve job, friends. I just, I don't know, that kind of thing. It's...

262
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,160
But whatever happened to ethics and morality in our great land? Oh, it's...

263
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,700
Blah blah blah blah.

264
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,260
And it's fun. It's fun.

265
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,620
We did it at the Olympics.

266
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,560
Oh, we just did it, didn't we?

267
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, what the hell am I talking about?

268
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,860
Never mind.

269
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,340
Or you can get on the internet and broadcast to the whole wide world.

270
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,540
Or you could advertise your, uh, your, uh, your zoo, zoo phobias, your child restraining devices, some of the strange new designs you have this year.

271
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,320
Oh, those are coming up on the monitor right now.

272
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:28,980
Oh, what is this?

273
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh, these are the new products we got, Chaz.

274
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh, look, it's the product line. I didn't see this.

275
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,760
Oh, monitor 23.

276
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,740
Oh, they did a really good job with this.

277
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,620
Yeah, those guys ain't getting a raise from me, though. Don't worry about it.

278
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,020
Oh, look at it. It's the little bob heads in the corner.

279
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,840
Twirling around in each corner.

280
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,500
Yeah.

281
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,400
Yeah.

282
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,460
Wow, it's kind of 3D.

283
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,320
Yeah.

284
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,060
Man, the little, the little worms are creeping out of his eyeballs.

285
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,080
How'd they do that?

286
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,600
Oh, man, look.

287
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,860
It's the corruptigating worms.

288
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,960
Yeah, I think you can sing along to this one.

289
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,000
Yeah.

290
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,880
You look, man. They look pink and pale.

291
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,740
Prairie squids. Numinous, luminous prairie squids.

292
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:03,740


293
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,240
83D squids falling from the sky. 83D squids. Man, they get me so high.

294
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,200
83D squids. Now they're falling, oh no. 83D squids. Come on, let's go.

295
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
83D squids. Come on, let's go.

296
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,660
We were driving down the road. Something started to snow.

297
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,560
Looked like nothing, oh no.

298
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,720
But we had ever seen anything like it.

299
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,140
83D squids. 83D squids.

300
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,860
83D squids falling from the sky. 83D squids.

301
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,160
83D squids. Man, they get me so high. 83D squids. Now they're falling, oh no.

302
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,440
83D squids. I got them head to toe.

303
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,880
83D squids.

304
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,300


305
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,020
Well, we pulled off to the side. We just knew they wanted to ride.

306
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,000
Sweetest, sweetest you'll ever know.

307
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,120
Blow you right through the door

308
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,900
If you're ever out in your ride

309
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,940
Don't think you have to run and hide

310
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,820
When you see some hairy pink pink snow

311
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,920
Coming down, no, no

312
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,560
Coming down from the sky

313
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,440
Just pull over, let them come inside

314
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,520
Fallen prairie squid is the best, best kind

315
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,540
And you sub-D knees, enjoy the ride

316
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,040
83D squids, falling from the sky

317
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,200
83D squids, well they get you so high

318
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,140
83D squids, now they're coming, oh no

319
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,220
83D squids, now that's like the law

320
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,080
83D squids

321
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,920
83D squids

322
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,240
83D squids

323
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,220
83D squids

324
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,260
83D squids

325
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,180
83D squids

326
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,500
Leigh你說 particles

327
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:16,300
When they're out and about

328
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:22,760
Leigh says 용

329
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,100
sing it with me dave

330
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:52,020
it's all i could think of doing we yes and it turned out it was so left

331
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,380
so left i have to recount crazy people friends it's what they are

332
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,900
crazy people

333
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,860
it's a new sound

334
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:18,720
it sounds like to me it's a new sound for the 90s it's the 60s upside down

335
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,260
it's a new sound for this decade and it's all wrong

336
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,800
it's a new sound blasting through your ears it's a song total of your fears

337
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,680
new sound for today i wish the new sound would go away hit it all right all right

338
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,080
all right i'll stop i'll go back to my normal chorus and reverb you know

339
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,600
you know i'll stop that new sound if you want i was kind of digging that it sounds fine

340
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,200
we're looking for a new sound no no no we're not we're not

341
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,340
okay we're looking for the old sound

342
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:07,940
you know i remember when you know just before sound was invented people would be going around

343
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:15,280
going and going like and then going like and then and just basically not making any sounds

344
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,520
because you know it was before a sound was invented then long came a guy with new sound

345
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,960
you know freshly packaged with bright new labels you say new sound

346
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:34,240
it was very interesting and we opened up those boxes of sound and sound flooded the earth and

347
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:41,560
it was an amazing thing all this new sound that was uh you could hear the birds chirping and the

348
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:48,760
cats meowing and the dogs hoinking okay it was the wrong box but anyway we got that fixed up about a

349
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,980
year later and the dogs are barking and we were happy with this new sound you know we asked god

350
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,360
hey god why don't you think this sound will go away or not the sound that you hear is the same as that new sound

351
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,360


352
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:06,200
before he said well i just didn't think was that important and since that time a lot of thought has

353
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,540
been given to sound people have been binging it every which way you know coming up with a

354
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:19,060
newfangled thing called music and then people started you know getting into this music thing

355
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:25,440
devoting their life to it you know calling themselves musicians and then people would

356
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,420
follow these musicians you know to the point where they become fanatics but you know but

357
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:38,740
fanatic was too big of a word for them so they shortened it to fans so these musical fanatics

358
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:46,020
these music fans uh you know listen to music over and over and over and over again looking for new

359
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:53,240
sounds looking for new music and just basically wrapping up too much of their life in the music

360
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,320
until one day

361
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,420
you know

362
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,020
music stopped

363
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:06,480
and then the music started again because there were a bunch of people with nothing left to do

364
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:13,700
so they had to you know make something up and so you know they started banging on pots and pans and

365
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:21,140
uh using chainsaws on each other and until that started sounding pleasing to the ears

366
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,840
and formed its own kind of music

367
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,340
which is

368
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,640
um

369
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,500
uh

370
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,480
um

371
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:29,480


372
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:29,500
um

373
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,840
i'm not gonna explain to you because you don't care

374
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:41,540
plus i'm sure our listening audience if they even care about industrial they would have researched already well maybe they wouldn't

375
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:47,140
right right right right i need more beer researching music in laughs

376
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,860
the way they take rock musicians apart and go

377
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
interesting

378
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,580
um

379
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,420
um

380
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,420


381
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,420


382
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,420


383
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,420


384
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,600
Does long hair have something to do with music?

385
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,440
I think Vivisection might be the answer.

386
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,500
So when was it decided, then, you know, we would be a music thing?

387
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,740
I don't know.

388
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,160
You know, why was it decided that we would be a music thing?

389
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,940
I guess the force of our personalities is not enough, you see.

390
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,780
Well, your personality, yeah.

391
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,460
I can't justify myself on this tape.

392
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,280
We're not movers, we're not shakers.

393
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Well, I can't justify my presence on this tape unless I play guitar.

394
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,000
I think you are Andy Warhol.

395
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
You should be Andy Warhol.

396
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,200
Andrew, certainly Andy Warhol.

397
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,860
I don't care what you say.

398
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,960
St. Andrew there.

399
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,420
He is Andy Warhol.

400
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,040
And Fred, who Jehovah hates.

401
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,560
I wish I could be Andy Warhol.

402
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,800
Might as well be Andy Warhol.

403
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,900
Though not quite as dead.

404
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,480
I wish I could be Andy Warhol.

405
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,180
And not just some guy named Fred.

406
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,080
I'd have weird white hair and be thin.

407
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,820
I wouldn't be out, I'd be in.

408
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,000
If I were Andy Warhol.

409
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,560
I'd be cool.

410
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,380
Kansas soup would be the rage.

411
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,940
I'd have girls of every size and age.

412
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,720
And some guys too, but I'm not really into that.

413
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,100
I'd call it art.

414
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,680
Hey, how about that?

415
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,760
I wish I could be Andy Warhol.

416
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,920
Though not quite as dead.

417
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,500
Andy Warhol.

418
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,200
And if I were Andy Warhol.

419
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,920
I sure as hell wouldn't be Fred.

420
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,440
If I had an idea what I was singing.

421
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,740
I'd have a plot.

422
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,500
Not like his movies and...

423
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,660
I'll stop.

424
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,220
That was kind of good.

425
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:14,700
I like that.

426
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,600
I think you and me just heard Fred do that off the top of his head.

427
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,820
Another instant hit. Another instant classic.

428
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,760
Instant fragment.

429
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,960
Yeah, no kidding.

430
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,000
See, I like my fragments of stuff.

431
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,140
I don't know.

432
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,440
I told you it was beer.

433
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,620
One of these days I will write a book of just beginnings.

434
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,820
Because I never finish anything really.

435
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,960
It's all just beginnings.

436
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,720
Because you don't want to end anything.

437
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,180
See, now he sounds drunk.

438
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,480
But before he didn't sound drunk.

439
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,860
He sounded like he was...

440
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,100
He was trance spouting.

441
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,280
For lack of a better word.

442
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,380
Well, we should go back to that at some...

443
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,060
Because I need to get on to the anti-Grammys material.

444
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,320
Which kind of relates to what Jehovah Hates Fred just did.

445
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,500
And what we're doing here.

446
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,380
You hear these little cassette tapes?

447
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,660
Did you ever think that maybe...

448
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,160
Reverend Stang had this big fancy stash?

449
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,340
In his computer studio and so forth.

450
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,940
This is done with Sony and Radio Shack cassette decks.

451
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:27,260
And cast-off equalizer and so forth.

452
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,020
It's down and dirty.

453
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:35,260
And in a way, that's a part of the point of the...

454
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,260
Once again, shall we say screw the Grammys?

455
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,860
I'm going to...

456
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,480
I'm about to go into some...

457
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,280
I'm going to have to...

458
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,520
Put so many cuss words in and then cut them out again.

459
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,860
By the way, did I say that...

460
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,800
That other improv song, 83D Squids...

461
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,320
Was Einstein's Secret Orchestra with Princess Wiardo.

462
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,260
It was her special song.

463
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,340
About the hideous, hideous artwork.

464
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,020
Thank you.

465
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,600
And I'm going to say something quick and fast.

466
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,280
Because you're going to get about ten words out before the cops come.

467
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,160
Friends, we're outside the Radio City Music Hall.

468
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,940
During the night of the Grammys.

469
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,360
Which happens to be Ash Wednesday.

470
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,280
There's a lot of uptight looking chicks walking around with smudges on their foreheads.

471
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Sorry guys, can't stand.

472
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,220
Where can we stand?

473
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,720
Like that way?

474
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,400
This way.

475
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:34,880
Alright.

476
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,420
The Grammys are too important for people to be standing...

477
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,820
On the corner across the street.

478
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,060
As NYPD's finest have told us.

479
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,440
But...

480
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,280
Uh...

481
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,740
The Music Militia shall yet prevail!

482
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,880
Yes, the Music Militia, though there may be only two of them.

483
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,720
One imported from Colorado and the other two are us.

484
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,000
Yeah, and we're really not...

485
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,060
We got recruited in.

486
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,580
We were paid.

487
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,380
I just read the...

488
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:02,520
We were paid.

489
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,600
But still...

490
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,060
I just got done reading the manifesto so now I know what we believe.

491
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,740
That's right.

492
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,100
I have a polka dotted flag.

493
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:08,800
Well, we believe that...

494
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,200
We have pinks lined up in that huge crowd outside Radio City Music Hall.

495
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,720
And pinks of every description, by the way.

496
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,580
Every race of pink is represented.

497
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,500
Standing there waiting for the real masters.

498
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,460
The kings and queens.

499
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,440
For Hanson themselves.

500
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,440
For George Benson.

501
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,220
For maybe even Bruce Springsteen.

502
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:28,780
Yeah, maybe.

503
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,380
Maybe even Bob Dylan.

504
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,900
You know what?

505
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,540
There's a lot of freaking cops.

506
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,580
A lot of cops.

507
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,200
There's at least a ton.

508
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,420
There is a cop for every ten assholes.

509
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,180
Yeah.

510
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,560
And we're still waiting for our fearless leader standing where he was told not to stand.

511
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,140
Yes.

512
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,780
And as we...

513
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,200
Hopefully he will see that we are here.

514
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,180
There was supposed to be a sonic riot here.

515
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,640
Tim!

516
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:50,640


517
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,420
Five to ten thousand subversive...

518
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,460
Tim!

519
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,900
Five to ten thousand subversives were going to be here making noise.

520
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:05,860
But yet, as far as the public knows, those five to ten thousand people still are here.

521
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,960
Because Tim paid $600 to put it on the wire service.

522
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,980
So, therefore it did happen.

523
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,840
We recommended that anyone who was with us to wear a suit and tie.

524
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,140
And as I see quite a few people with a suit and tie.

525
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,600
Either a suit or a tie or a cop uniform representing...

526
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Those are our people.

527
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,760
So, at least everyone here is on our side.

528
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,040
Is part of the Music Militia.

529
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,300
Yes, friends!

530
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,380
There was a sonic riot outside the Radio City Music Hall!

531
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,600
The Music Militia triumphed!

532
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,920
Vastly, there were...

533
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,440
And just like the press release said.

534
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:38,940
There were firecrackers.

535
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:38,940


536
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:38,940


537
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:38,940


538
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:38,940


539
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:38,940


540
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:38,940


541
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:38,940


542
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,780
five to ten thousand people there.

543
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,100
Actually, five to ten thousand people

544
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
that were standing around gate yards

545
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,660
waiting for celebrities to drive up.

546
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,720
However, the cops were real nice to us

547
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,100
and let us do our hateful protest

548
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,100
over in the horse corral that they use.

549
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,480
Well, friends, it's Dr. Music outside the Grammys

550
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,960
here on the streets of New York City.

551
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,060
The Lord Jesus Christ is unveiling the flag

552
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,640
of the Music Militia.

553
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,380
The Music Militia flag.

554
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,080
It looks like somebody sold polka dot underwear.

555
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,160
It looks a lot like Bob's boxer shorts.

556
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,620
And the Sonic Riot now consists of

557
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,220
the faithful bass trombone player.

558
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,720
Who I caught earlier.

559
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,800
Now we're about to have some real noise, actually.

560
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,160
Yeah.

561
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,260
The hideous little electrical Devo instrument

562
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,600
hasn't been started up yet.

563
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:37,720
It has potential.

564
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,080
When the Devo instrument starts up,

565
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,120
that's when the cops will end this little party.

566
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,700
Yes, friends, there are protesters

567
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,640
as far as I can see.

568
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,540
Five to ten thousand anti-musicians

569
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,420
covering 6th Avenue,

570
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,040
Avenue of the Americas here in New York.

571
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,800
It's amazing.

572
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,560
It's horrifying.

573
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,720
It's frightening.

574
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,720
And yet it's real.

575
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,880
I never thought it would be as big as this,

576
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,000
but it truly, truly shows that...

577
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,060
Oh, my man.

578
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,620
All right.

579
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,540
One crazy man with one crazy idea.

580
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,080
The bass throngs have increased by one.

581
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,540
Those pinks that run the Grammys

582
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,820
are going to be running in fear

583
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,420
from this gigantic show of anti-Grammy protesting faith.

584
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,400
Oh, the Lord has not yet started using his bullhorn.

585
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,840
Oh, he's handed it to Tim.

586
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,540
Tim Martin.

587
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,660
The leader.

588
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,140
The Che Guevara of the music militia.

589
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,000
And the Lord Jesus Christ is holding the anti-Grammy award,

590
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,120
which looks like a hook-em horns or evil eye.

591
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,240
Uh-oh.

592
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,940
We are about to liberate the music

593
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,680
from the corporate accountants here now.

594
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,420
The police have not moved yet.

595
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:04,920
Amazing.

596
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,840
The police are moving.

597
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,860
They're moving in right now.

598
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,840
And I'm moving out right now.

599
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,740
I am only a journalist.

600
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,300
Reverend Stang will step outside the line here.

601
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,760
The police have just moved in and are about to...

602
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,040
They are now ordering the noisemakers to stop.

603
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,460
Now we can say we did it.

604
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,100
Now we can say we showed up.

605
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,920
The music militia showed up, tried.

606
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,540
We were there.

607
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,060
The man...

608
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,720
The first annual.

609
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,120
Yeah, the first annual.

610
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,920
This is the beginning.

611
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,000
Only the very beginning.

612
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,900
Anti-Grammy.

613
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,340
And surely the Grammys will be on their knee,

614
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,540
or the evil conspiracy overlords

615
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,620
who run the music business and the music...

616
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,480
Police conversation.

617
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,160
They've been for...

618
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,720
Who's...

619
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,380
Who is Tim?

620
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,460
Where'd Tim go?

621
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,400
Is he up there having...

622
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:54,980
Man.

623
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,500
Well, once again, one could say that conspiracy has won.

624
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,680
But how is that any different from any other day?

625
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,820
We'd be kidding ourselves if we pretended otherwise.

626
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,180
But by God!

627
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,020
You can't...

628
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,600
Say we went down without trying.

629
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,000
We did what we could.

630
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,260
You can't beat City Hall.

631
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,320
And, well, we may not have defeated the conspiracy yet tonight,

632
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,540
but at least it's one more piton up that hideous mountainside.

633
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:20,900
Ugh.

634
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,240
And it's rough.

635
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,740
I am the proud owner of two teenage kids, believe it or not.

636
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,500
And I tried to...

637
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,180
When they were about, you know, 11 or 12,

638
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,820
they started getting into pop music.

639
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,380
You know, and at that time, I think it was New Kids on the Block.

640
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,660
And I think my son really was heavy.

641
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,020
He got into Metallica.

642
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,920
So I was going, you know, you guys, that stuff's great,

643
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,820
but, you know, actually, they only let you hear

644
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,240
a tiny, tiny fraction of all the music that's being done.

645
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,980
And the only thing that you will ever hear on the radio

646
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,100
has been approved by people you hate.

647
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,800
And my kids, as always, said,

648
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,400
to quote that movie, The Abyss,

649
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,000
hippie, you think everything is a conspiracy.

650
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,220
Well, if you remember that movie, The Abyss,

651
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,880
the character hippie turned out to be fucking right.

652
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,800
Everything was a conspiracy.

653
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,920
And I'm proud to say my kids are finally starting to catch on.

654
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,880
But it's true.

655
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,080
It is, God, it sounds crazy

656
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,780
when you start talking about conspiracies, you know.

657
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,580
And in some cases, it sort of is.

658
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,220
If you get...

659
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,920
If you get locked into one or two of the conspiracies,

660
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,960
you know, oh, I think I know who really killed JFK.

661
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,160
I know where they hid those crashed flying saucers.

662
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,460
I know which haircut is really cool this month.

663
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,540
Friends, all of those conspiracies are all real,

664
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,220
and they're all...

665
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,100
And the music business conspiracy, duh.

666
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,260
You know, the movie business, publishing.

667
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,520
I think there are two publishers left now in this country

668
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,380
that do everything.

669
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,200
But those conspiracies,

670
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,440
they're all worth fighting.

671
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:11,480
But friends, those are just a tiny drop in a huge ocean

672
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,000
of the real conspiracy,

673
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,020
which is the conspiracy of dumbasses.

674
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:21,300
The conspiracy of normal fucking garden variety humans

675
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,480
who really hate you

676
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,960
if they think you're not acting like one of them

677
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,300
in just the right way for their particular clique or job

678
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,340
or scene or whatever.

679
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,520
And yes, you know,

680
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,180
we can all sit around and feel superior

681
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,280
to half-assed, mediocre bands and so forth,

682
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,920
and we can laugh at them,

683
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,340
but we must remember,

684
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:47,480
as the great late comedian Bill Hicks said,

685
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,260
they are demons sent from hell to lower the standards.

686
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:01,280
And you can take any pop band or TV show that you hate,

687
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,420
and they will fit that bill.

688
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,160
Demons.

689
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,220
Demons sent from hell to lower the standards,

690
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,880
to quote Bill Hicks.

691
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,020
You know, but then,

692
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,060
but then you have to ask yourself,

693
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,000
is it Hanson's fault that they won a Grammy,

694
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,660
or got nominated for a Grammy?

695
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,220
I don't know who,

696
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,900
I don't really know or care who wins that kind of stuff.

697
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,440
I'm sure don't.

698
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,620
But is it their fault?

699
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,000
Those, you know, sweet teen sensations from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

700
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,660
If winning a Grammy means that you sold out,

701
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,860
does not winning a Grammy mean that you haven't sold out?

702
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,900
I don't think so.

703
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,180
In my case, I can personally testify

704
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:46,340
that I have been trying to sell out for 20 goddamn years,

705
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,980
and the conspiracy just ain't buying.

706
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,840
Yeah, you know, so, and because of all this, you know,

707
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,620
this is a complicated issue,

708
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,500
and that's why I'd like to call this first half of the sermon

709
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,240
that I've already finished, in praise of failure.

710
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,040
Because in a way, I mean, that's sort of what we're,

711
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,600
you know, we're here for.

712
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,500
We're proud of the fact that we're not part of the,

713
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:20,420
well, we wish we had the money, the equipment, the groupies,

714
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,800
but not have to deal with the contracts,

715
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,780
the record companies, and the guys in the suits.

716
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,280
And, you know, I don't know anything about the bands.

717
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,360
In fact, I've come to, I've decided that,

718
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,660
if I've even heard of the band that's nominated for the Emmys,

719
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,720
then they're screwing up.

720
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,460
And what is it?

721
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,980
It's like Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and stuff.

722
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,540
Sorry, but I've heard of them.

723
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,320
I remember those guys vaguely.

724
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,520
But you ever see, when I was a kid, I used to watch the Oscars.

725
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,120
And then something came along called the Emmys,

726
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,260
and there's the Grammys, and to tell the honest to God truth,

727
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,320
I barely know the difference between them.

728
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,080
I had to do a little homework for tonight.

729
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,060
Oh, the Grammys, that's the music, and, you know,

730
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,340
that's the music.

731
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:03,500
I had to do that one.

732
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,420
But even as a kid, when I was watching the Oscars,

733
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,480
it was obvious.

734
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,940
It goes without saying.

735
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,240
It's totally rigged.

736
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,300
It's completely corrupt.

737
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,000
It's not what you know or what talent you have.

738
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,880
It's who you know and how much blow your agent was able to line up for

739
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,780
and what kind of suit your agent was wearing

740
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,900
and what kind of haircut your agent was wearing

741
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,560
and what the record company suit boys were wearing that day

742
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,960
and whether they were in a good mood,

743
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,780
how many martinis they'd had.

744
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,240
Those are the things that really,

745
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,840
really dictate who gets big.

746
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,380
And what infuriates us all, of course,

747
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,260
is that, you know, you think, okay,

748
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,960
these fucking pink boys, these arrogant bastards,

749
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,340
making all that you're probably getting paid $100,000 a year

750
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,960
to sit on their butts and brag,

751
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,280
bullshit, act like they know what's going on.

752
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,300
They are the ones who are deciding what is, quote, best.

753
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,680
Those are deciding.

754
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,840
You know, actually, we know.

755
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,520
We all know that they don't agree on what's best,

756
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,940
artistically or anything.

757
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,660
They get together and agree what is going to sell the best.

758
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,400
You know, oh, this year it's going to be Hanson, Fiona Apple,

759
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,300
the Titanic, Stephen King again.

760
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,900
And, oh, no, let's not do Stephen King.

761
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,820
Let's do Dean Koontz.

762
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,380
You know, let's give them a choice.

763
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,920
So, but, you know, and the most absurd thing about all that is,

764
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,200
since when is there a best?

765
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,500
When you're talking about music,

766
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,640
especially, or art, which is something that is,

767
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,560
by definition, a matter of opinion.

768
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,740
I don't know about you, but, you know, every,

769
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,540
opinions are like assholes, as Bob said.

770
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,580
Everybody's got one and they all stink.

771
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:52,100
You know, some of us may be the kind that are into, you know,

772
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,040
our idea of great, you know, really kick-ass music might be,

773
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,000
Captain Beefheart or Wesley Willis.

774
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,080
Oh, I knew there was some, I knew somebody here knew

775
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,500
about Wesley Willis.

776
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:02,500


777
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,220
Oh, I knew there was some.

778
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:03,220


779
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,500
And, oh, Daniel Johnston.

780
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,120
Let's see, who else can I think of?

781
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,000
Of course, poor Frank Zappa is the one exception to that rule.

782
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,760
But, you know, or, it is just, I happen to like the weird,

783
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,160
you know, arty farty crazy shit.

784
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,860
Actually, I'm a big Hendrix nut.

785
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,100
I got so burned out on Hendrix that I had

786
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,440
to switch to Mahogany Rush.

787
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,480
Anyway, but, you know, when it comes down to it,

788
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,580
it's just a matter of opinion.

789
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,480
The fact that, you know, I'm a big fan of, you know,

790
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:32,480


791
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,260
the fact that I might have a huge collection

792
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,480
of Captain Beefheart live bootlegs

793
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,380
and somebody else might collect Hanson records

794
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,620
that they bought at Blockbusters doesn't make me any better

795
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,940
than them at all.

796
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,140
In fact, that's why the second part

797
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,720
of my sermon is titled All Music is Stupid.

798
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,200
That kind of puts everything on a more even keel,

799
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,840
don't you think?

800
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,200
Don't you think that kind of puts things back in perspective?

801
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,040
You know, since when does music have

802
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,900
to be smart?

803
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,340
Since when does it have to be, quote, good or unquote,

804
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,280
you know, does it have to be even sold?

805
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,920
You know, whatever you like.

806
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,380
And yet, and yet, teenagers, God, oh, God.

807
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,520
It hurts the most because I was one myself.

808
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,840
I talked to teenagers and even older,

809
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,640
even people my own age who judge each other

810
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,020
by their taste in music.

811
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,600
Have you ever sat and watched a couple of kids talking

812
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,360
about how stupid that other kid was because they were

813
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,860
into the Ramones instead of Pink Floyd?

814
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,540
You may not remember those bands, but, you know,

815
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,840
you can probably transpose it to something modern day.

816
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,080
You know, but, and what I keep wanting to grab these kids

817
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,180
and shake them and going, do you realize,

818
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,040
think how many bands were cool until they won a Grammy?

819
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,100
And then suddenly they weren't cool anymore.

820
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,660
And, you know, the same, it happens

821
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,240
to everybody and for the point of that is reverse discrimination

822
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,420
against normal or popular is just as stupid as liking things only

823
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,760
because they're obscure and cool.

824
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,880
You know, just because you're the only guy who has ever heard

825
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,700
of a band, yep, that means that band is really cool.

826
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,560
But when the high school, when the, when the captain

827
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,640
of the football team at your high school is into that band too,

828
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,320
can they really be any good?

829
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,940
Sure. Hell yeah.

830
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,380
Well, then, then you got the, well,

831
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,480
you got the problem of, well, think of all those record company guys

832
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,380
that were going, yeah, Nirvana, it's the latest happening thing.

833
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,940
Well, let's Pearl Jam, they're just as good.

834
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,320
Let's make them the next happening thing.

835
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,300
You know, it's sort of almost the same.

836
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,460
So, I don't know, friends.

837
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,400
What is the solution?

838
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,260
The solution, they're, they're, they're, they're,

839
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,320
do like the music militia.

840
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,900
That's the only solution.

841
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,700
Form your own music awards ceremony.

842
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,280
Give the awards to yourselves and your,

843
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:01,660
your buddies.

844
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,740
Keep making music.

845
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,680
That's the main point.

846
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,640
Keep making music.

847
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
However the f*** you want.

848
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,140
And f*** the Grammys.

849
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,140
But, but you must not stop there.

850
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,460
You can't, that is just what they want you to do

851
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,160
is stop at f***ing the Grammys.

852
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,420
Don't be like those stupid teenagers.

853
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,520
The music conspiracy, friends,

854
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,520
is only another distraction.

855
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,920
Sure, the music industry is screwed up.

856
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,140
The movie industry.

857
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,960
Publishing is screwed up.

858
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,780
But, friends, the air is screwed up.

859
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,380
The water is screwed up.

860
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,160
Often the people are screwed up.

861
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,540
All human society is screwed up.

862
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,820
And that's why we say, dear friends,

863
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,780
legalize the pornography and ban work.

864
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,440
Ban work!

865
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,360
Erase the whole damn thing!

866
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,360


867
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:01,840
The damn system!

868
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,280
That's, there's your solution, friends.

869
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,120
And, uh, now that's said,

870
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,900
now we get back to the award ceremonies and the music.

871
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,700
Freedom for music!

872
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,180
Who's this guy?

873
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,840
Free doctor music here.

874
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,200
Only five dollars for free doctor music.

875
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:29,980
The polka-dotted boxer short-like free music flag is flying high.

876
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,580
As the evil overlords, the stormtroopers of the empire,

877
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,240
send the rebel forces scampering away under threat of arrest,

878
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,660
which could happen any second.

879
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,840
Uh, it's starting to get gnarly.

880
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,380
It's starting to get good.

881
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,420
The battle show raves on.

882
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,300
The Sonic riot has begun!

883
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,700
Sonic riot! Sonic riot!

884
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:57,360
Oh!

885
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,240
I need to find a bathroom.

886
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,480
It's too bad that this isn't a stereo recording,

887
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,800
because this would be a pretty classic Wotan moment.

888
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,980
Uh, you would hear, as I move down the line,

889
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,460
you would hear the music, the various tiny instruments.

890
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,800
Uh, it shifted. Oh, a little kazoo.

891
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,860
Here we go.

892
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,840
Tiny children's instruments.

893
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,620
And, of course, the bass trombone.

894
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,780
And, of course, the bass trombone.

895
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:26,960
And, of course, the bass trombone.

896
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,700
The bass trombone, which doesn't even need amplification.

897
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,660
How can they be missing this act inside the Grammys?

898
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,720
It's just unbelievable to me that they're gathering there

899
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,880
to listen to such washed-up old farts as Elton John,

900
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,520
Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, and so forth,

901
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:47,360
when these guys are out here jamming for free for the people, man!

902
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,160
Yeah!

903
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,000
It's Berkeley, man!

904
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,000
It's the Sonic riot!

905
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,980
It's the Sonic riot!

906
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:54,960
Christ, Bob!

907
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,220
It's the Sonic riot!

908
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,180
It's the Sonic riot!

909
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,760
It's the Sonic riot!

910
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,600
The Lord Jesus has, um, just donned his gas mask.

911
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,260
I hope it's a working gas mask.

912
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,440
We assume that the Sonic riot will prompt the Empire

913
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,320
to bring out all its evil stormtroopers, Nazis and monsters.

914
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:19,360
The Lord is displaying the evil-eye-shaped anti-Grammy award.

915
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,960
If you can hear my voice over this ungodly,

916
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,920
ungodly din,

917
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,240
I'm surprised you're even bothering to listen this long.

918
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,540
But we love you anyway, dear friends.

919
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,440
Now, the Oscars...

920
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:41,280
You know that some of those old gals that won Oscars

921
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,180
used them.

922
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,780
They didn't just put them on their mantle.

923
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,580
And I know that there's probably...

924
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:52,220
I don't know if any recipients of this award can really use them the same way, but...

925
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,800
By God, I'm gonna try!

926
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,560
And I'm sure...

927
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,460
Well, this one's not mine.

928
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,300
This one is the Lifetime Achievement Award, dear friends.

929
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,020
The achievement of a lifetime.

930
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,520
Unfortunately, the recipient of this has not lived a very long lifetime yet,

931
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,420
but that's great!

932
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,620
You know, he could get killed tomorrow.

933
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:11,660
Um...

934
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,820
I am speaking, of course, of John S. Hall and, uh,

935
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,700
King... King Missile!

936
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,020
Praise King Missile!

937
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,000
John Hall and the whole crew.

938
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,260
Actually, there's a whole...

939
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,820
Um, we are honored to have John and several special guests here tonight,

940
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,400
what you might call King Missile 3.

941
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,620
Hey.

942

¶¶

954
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,240
art nobody else has seen I cannot help it because I am so much more intelligent

955
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,800
and well-rounded than everybody in the whole fucking universe I stopped

956
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,720
watching television when I was six months old so boring and lame and stupid

957
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,660
and started reading books and going to recitals and art galleries I don't go to

958
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,740
recitals anymore because my hearing is too sensitive and I don't go to art

959
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,960
galleries anymore because there are people there and I cannot deal with

960
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,600
people because they don't understand me I stay home reading books that insult

961
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:55,380
my intelligence and working on my work which no one understands I am sensitive

962
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:14,500
I am sensitive I am sensitive I am a sensitive artist I am a sensitive artist

963
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,940
I am a sensitive artist I am a sensitive artist to this I am a sensitive

964
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:15,940


965
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:22,080
I'm a sensitive artist, a sensitive artist, sensitive artist.

966
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,260
I am a sensitive artist.

967
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,080
Sensitive.

968
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,680
I never know what it is.

969
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,400
It's John Rutherford.

970
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,740
Beautiful piece.

971
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,980
I think this is the last of the epic length pieces tonight.

972
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,760
I'm letting you know.

973
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,120
This is called Ed.

974
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,880
It was on the Happy Hour record.

975
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,220
It makes reference to Sterno, who was another subgenius guy.

976
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,780
He let the second King Missus stay at his house once, which was very nice.

977
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,680
And on the way from his house, I wrote this piece called Ed,

978
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,540
and that's why he's in it, just because I happen to write it the next day.

979
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:13,960
Okay.

980
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,400
Ed was at the end of his rope, an expression he detested.

981
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,880
There is no rope, he would scream at the laughing walls.

982
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,180
There is only the end.

983
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,680
No hope, no rope.

984
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,360
Ending is better than mending.

985
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,920
Doors of perception, windows of opportunity.

986
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,600
These are illusions, like the killing floor.

987
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:34,080
Ed spoke in a squeaky, whiny voice, with perhaps a slight tinge of glee.

988
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,760
But this was only because he couldn't be bothered to try to develop a manner of thinking

989
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,960
that truly reflected his mood.

990
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,260
This is a vacuum, he said.

991
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,220
There is no air.

992
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:43,560
There is no air anywhere.

993
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,600
Despair has lost its meaning.

994
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Nihilism knocked three times on the ceiling, but the rosy fingers of dawn

995
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,780
always inserted themselves into the asshole of unfulfilled promises.

996
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,240
Angels sang, hey, Zanna, ho, Zanna.

997
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,200
Paralyzed prima donnas danced in the street all day.

998
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,960
But when the darkness came, everybody went home.

999
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,380
I was ready, everybody else was asleep.

1000
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,680
And while it may have been a relief to see that I was right all along,

1001
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,960
here I am still, alone and trapped, awaiting the endless end.

1002
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,040
And I can turn it all around and laugh at it and laugh at myself.

1003
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:21,040
I can laugh louder than the walls, the halls, the waterfalls, louder than Charles de Gaulle or Fulton Mall.

1004
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,440
But I don't know what I'm laughing at.

1005
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,580
I don't know what I think is so goddamn funny.

1006
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,000
I don't know why I don't just shut up and give up and lay down and die.

1007
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,120
What do I have to complain about anyway?

1008
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,740
Ed asked his Picasso.

1009
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:33,980
I'm a millionaire.

1010
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,740
This wasn't actually true.

1011
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,480
Ed's Picasso was an obvious forgery.

1012
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,900
His three Rothkos had just been singled out in an article.

1013
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,460
An art forum entitled,

1014
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,680
The Three Most Insignificant Paintings of Mark Rothko.

1015
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,700
And his Barbara Kruegers had been irreparably damaged by rain sanction.

1016
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:56,520
And a few other bands from Florida that refused to acknowledge the value of art.

1017
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:01,580
Come to think of it, Ed mused to the laminated roadkill coffee table that he had purchased

1018
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,080
when times had seemed slightly less bleak.

1019
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:07,640
Come to think of it, not only does art have no intrinsic value,

1020
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,880
but my collection has no extrinsic value either.

1021
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,700
I know I'm not a millionaire, but that's no reason to complain.

1022
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,560
There is no reason to complain or do anything.

1023
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,200
I don't believe in reason or objective reality or collective farming.

1024
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,780
I don't believe in public speaking, which is another reason why I am here alone.

1025
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,920
I would kill myself, but I don't believe in suicide.

1026
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,660
Ed put on a red shirt and took a quick walk around the block while whistling softly to himself.

1027
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,800
He reentered his apartment screaming,

1028
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,400
There is no life on this planet.

1029
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,020
Jehovah One replaced all life with machinery five centuries ago.

1030
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,720
The so-called industrial revolution was just another hoax.

1031
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,900
And we all fell for it, because we were all programmed to.

1032
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,660
Even I fell for it.

1033
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,200
I believe in the steam engine, even though I don't believe in anything.

1034
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:01,780
Logical inconsistency is the Mr. Bubble I bathe in each and every evening,

1035
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,020
except for yesterday evening when I rollerbladed over to the Masonic Temple

1036
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,920
to play Pinochle with Pope John Paul I.

1037
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,460
I really had no choice in the matter.

1038
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,600
Ed certainly could go on and on, and he did and he would and he will,

1039
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,800
until you or I or somebody does something about it.

1040
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:22,420
Senator Sterno of Louisiana announced over closed circuit television,

1041
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,220
and as long as he continues to pontificate pointlessly, I will do nothing.

1042
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,400
Ed walked away from the program feeling fortified and stapled.

1043
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,720
His brain was buzzing the way it always did just after Jeopardy.

1044
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,340
He loaded up the microbus with atlases and Poseidons,

1045
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,640
and headed for Pope County.

1046
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:42,260
I've had it, he sang.

1047
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,020
I've had it with puns, alliteration, Russian literature, Italian neorealism,

1048
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,140
meaningless cross-references, and laundry lists of nonsense.

1049
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,960
I shall drive without a license, without clothing, without direction,

1050
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,160
and if I make it to Arkansas, fine.

1051
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,180
And if I'm running late, if I'm running a numbers game, it doesn't matter.

1052
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,420
I'll keep on running.

1053
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,880
Yes, this is the answer.

1054
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:02,980
This is the ending.

1055
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,780
I shall keep on running, because a body in motion tends to stay emotional,

1056
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,440
and it is better to feel.

1057
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,240
Pain is better than emptiness.

1058
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,300
Emptiness is better than nothing.

1059
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,660
And nothing is better than this.

1060
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,160
I'll keep on running.

1061
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,580
I'll keep on running.

1062
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,960
I'll keep on running.

1063
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,320
I'll keep on running.

1064
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:07,440
Tell your mother and your father, I want to go to school.

1065
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:08,720
I'll keep on running.

1066
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,220
I'll keep on running.

1067
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:32,280
I'll keep on running.

1068
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,620
Welcome to the Transportation Mall.

1069
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:41,260
Please remain in single file as you make your way to the boarding area.

1070
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,620
For the benefit of your fellow travelers, please have your subpoenaed...

1071
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,760
Damn! I thought X Day was going to be up at Brushwood like we planned.

1072
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:57,280
This sure doesn't look like a pagan nudist colony in western New York State.

1073
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,100
Oh no, and I'm in my underwear!

1074
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,560
Oh great, maybe no one will notice.

1075
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,180
Uh oh!

1076
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,520
Oh man!

1077
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,600
Oh good, here's my billfold tucked safely in the crack of my ass.

1078
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,960
Ah yes, and both of my subgenius membership cards.

1079
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:24,260
Oh wow, look at the old 1981 issue card.

1080
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,880
It didn't even have a picture of Bob on it back then.

1081
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,080
Well, it sure is all floppy after seven years.

1082
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,240
I mean, it's been 17 years of punishment.

1083
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,720
It was probably a good idea to snag another one when I re-upped back in 92.

1084
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,080
Boy, on a day like today, a girl can't be too safe.

1085
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,500
Ah, all your papers are an apple pie order, Dr. Howell.

1086
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,980
Thank you, and have a pleasant flight.

1087
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,440
Next please.

1088
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:56,580
Reverend Susie the Floozy, ask your cervix lady, let me at that escape vessel.

1089
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,580
Boy, I can't wait to get strapped in.

1090
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,220
Oh, how quaint.

1091
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,420
Just let me check your file.

1092
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:04,780
Hmm.

1093
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,180
Hey, what's that flashing red light on the screen mean?

1094
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,680
May I see your subgenius membership card, please?

1095
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,280
Oh, here you go.

1096
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,100
Hey!

1097
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,560
Oh, that's all right, lady. I got a backup card.

1098
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,680
Hey! You meant to do that!

1099
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:24,800
Look you!

1100
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,240
I'm very sorry, miss.

1101
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,560
But it appears that you've been...

1102
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,860
...rejected for boarding.

1103
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,560
Rejected? Why?

1104
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:39,720
I've been faithfully serving the church every other Saturday night for almost five years!

1105
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,940
Oh, your little radio show.

1106
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:47,040
Yes, according to your file, you dropped the ball on that job a long time ago.

1107
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,320
That's a lie!

1108
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:53,840
Look, miss, the church data bank doesn't lie, except for the accounting department.

1109
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,280
Take a look at your job performance graph here.

1110
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:05,940
You started out like a ball of subgenius fire, and then beginning right about here, we can trace a steady downward pattern.

1111
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,440
Oops, the last of it is so low, the screen won't scroll down far enough.

1112
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,780
Please return the person in front of the table.

1113
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,200
Oh, you haven't started drinking again, have you?

1114
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:15,540
No!

1115
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,340
Just trying to account for it somehow.

1116
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,140
I mean, look here.

1117
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:27,260
With 1998 ticking away, did you spend your valuable radio ministry time sending out the call for subgenius membership?

1118
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:37,180
Were you a jubilating Valkyrie on the battlements for Bob, rallying the forces of mutancy and girding your loins for the Armageddon to come?

1119
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:44,560
Were you out there on the front lines, up to the gunwales and the entrails of pinks, sailing on a sea of their blood?

1120
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:45,640
No.

1121
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,740
Right. No.

1122
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:56,860
In 1997, you wasted your time doing shows about prison and bad rock and roll and even food!

1123
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:01,020
There was scarcely a mention of Bob the whole damn year!

1124
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:09,660
And with X-Day zooming up on us all, you started out the last half year of subgenius life on Earth with...

1125
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,420
...an Elvis show.

1126
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,260
Ow!

1127
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:23,240
And then, the next show, you spent an hour gushing over your sleazy punk little brother on the air and playing lousy cover songs.

1128
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,300
Oh, and after that, it gets even worse.

1129
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,920
The next show, you...

1130
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,360
No! No! Stop!

1131
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:37,140
Oh, I'm sorry, but with that spotty a record, I'm sure you understand our position.

1132
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:45,840
Thank you for making X-Earth Airways your first choice for planetary escape, and good luck in the ensuing holocaust.

1133
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,260
Next, please.

1134
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,860
Out of my way, fat ass! I want a window seat next to Jesus!

1135
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,480
Certainly, Miss Ramsey. Here's your boarding pass.

1136
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,240
Please have a pleasant flight, and thank you for choosing X-Earth Airways.

1137
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:06,120
Wait a minute! That was JonBenet Ramsey! She wasn't even a subgenius!

1138
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:16,740
Look, this is your own doing. Using the formidable resources of WREK Atlanta, you did more to aggrandize her mystique than you did for Bob!

1139
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,260
Yes, JonBenet's appeal to our cult is undeniable.

1140
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,320
X-Earth Airways is...

1141
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,460
I'm afraid that your appeal, my dear, is highly deemed.

1142
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:31,160
What? How the bleeding hell did I get Oswalded by this whole stinkin' church?

1143
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,780
I'll have you know that the Reverend Ivan Stang is a personal friend of mine!

1144
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:46,180
Ha! You think putting in a few years as one of Stang's giggling, vacuous little subgenius interns earned you any brownie points?

1145
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:51,400
Yeah, you earned your standard subgenius knee pads, and that's all.

1146
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,440
Oh, you mean I was expected to do that? Gee, what a surprise.

1147
00:58:55,460 --> 00:59:01,420
Well, it's not like you're the only one missing out. Look, we're not letting Carla Faye Tucker on board.

1148
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,820
But she's an executed, born-again Christian pickaxe murderer!

1149
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:13,500
So you see our point. If you had taken your ministry seriously, I wouldn't be blowing you off right now, Toots.

1150
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:23,000
Thank you for choosing X-Earth Airways. And kindly get your fat ass out of the way so that some real subgeniuses can board, alright?

1151
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,060
Aaaaaah!

1152
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:39,800
Text on screen

1153
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:55,440
Yeah, looks.

1154
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:04,740
That is, of course, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1155
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,760
Oh, Susie.

1156
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:21,840
Once again, that's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1157
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,860
And Box 140306, 75214.

1158
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,540
Box 140306, 75214.

1159
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:42,800
Well, I think about the times when we were young, just singing and playing and having fun on a sunny afternoon in the summertime.

1160
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,340
These things to me were oh so fine, but away.

1161
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,700
But away.

1162
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,380
But away.

1163
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,840
But away.

1164
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,520
Oh.

1165
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,840
Whoa.

1166
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,720
Whoa.

1167
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:19,980
Whoa.

1168
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:20,180


1169
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:20,700
Whoa.

1170
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:20,820
Whoa.

1171
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:20,980


1172
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:21,220
Whoa.

1173
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:21,280
Whoa.

1174
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:21,700
Whoa.
