1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,400
Sometimes we need a big dose of it.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,800
Some little thing will happen and we will suddenly become frantic.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,820
We'll lose our heart and act in ways we never thought we would.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,760
I know I have.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Sometimes we need a big, big dose of it to understand that we're dealing with it.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,460
I'm actually, though, in a smaller degree.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,740
Sometimes we need a big dose of the trembling, the tightness of one's stomach

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,220
as it keeps working us over, week in, week out, year in, year out.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,480
Sometimes we need a big dose of it, week in, week out, year in, year out.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,920
And under me, when I lead this country,

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,400
the Secretary of Defense is going to have to make the choices

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,700
between how we protect the survivability of our nuclear weapons.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,620
We are going to make some changes and some tough choices

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,460
before we go.

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,760
To deployment on the Midget Man missile or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,900
We're going to have to.

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,360
The MX.

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,100
MX.

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,420
We're going to have to do that.

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,160
It's Christmas.

21
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,480
These are the, these are the, these are the, my answer is do not make...

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,720
This is our land.

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,740
A land of peace and of plenty.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,700
A land of harmony and hope.

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,320
This is our land.

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,600
Oceania.

27
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,120
These are our people.

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,600
The workers, the strivers, the builders.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,160
These are our people.

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,200
The builders of our world.

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,200
Struggling, fighting, leading.

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,040
Die.

33
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,380
On the streets of our cities and on the far-flung battlefields.

34
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,920
Fighting against the mutilation of our hopes and dreams.

35
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,000
Who are they?

36
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,080
They are the dark armies.

37
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,740
The dark, murdering armies of Eurasia.

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,720
In the background, the dark, murdering armies of Eurasia.

39
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:25,720


40
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,600
The barren deserts of Africa and India.

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,140
On the oceans of Australasia.

42
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,080
Courage, strength and youth are sacrificed.

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,820
Sacrifice to barbarians whose only honor is atrocity.

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,600
Die.

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,520
Die.

46
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:52,980
But even as we grasp at victory, there is a cancer, an evil tumor, growing and spreading in our midst.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,720
Shatter.

48
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,100
Shatter.

49
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,080
Shatter.

50
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,340
Shatter.

51
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,300
Shatter out his name.

52
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,140
Every communist must grasp the truth.

53
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,340
Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.

54
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,260
Classes struggle.

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,520
Some classes triumph, others are eliminated.

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,420
Such is history.

57
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,820
Such is the history of civilization for thousands of years.

58
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,900
To interpret history from this viewpoint,

59
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,620
is historical materialism.

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,100
Standing in opposition to this viewpoint,

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,040
is historical idealism.

62
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,860
We will bring you the news quickly and accurately,

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,100
just as soon as the government says we can.

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,440
The government will tell us, and then we will tell you.

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,520
Then the paternalistic commentator, 30 years older than me,

66
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,600
will tell you that the government is lying.

67
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,860
The government will say one thing, and the commentator will challenge it.

68
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,920
And then we will cut to a commercial.

69
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,600
I will need you to correct my words.

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:58,600


71
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:58,600


72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:58,600


73
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,780
Oh, can you now see, what you see in the blink-less electron-gun eye in the mainstream media virage.

74
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:01,780


75
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:01,780


76
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:01,780


77
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,340
In the blinkless electron gun eye of the mainstream media barrage of what we hail is the hallucinations

78
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,700
dragging on.

79
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,840
The voices have captivated and conditioned millions of human creatures.

80
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,720
Stimulated them, passable acceptance of technological destruction in the structure of our environments.

81
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,740
The history of the possibilities.

82
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,120
Allominative ways of being.

83
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,500
whose seven stripes are broken swastikas, whose fifty stars are black holes sucking

84
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,280
two hundred million atomized existences into the daily routine of the human herd of hamsters,

85
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,580
rolling the great wheels of the death machine, squeaking at the shocks and nibbling the cheese,

86
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,600
and reciting and discussing and delighting in their mutually shared programming history,

87
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,960
in their lives, in their cancers, their TV shows, their deaths, their jobs, their ignorance,

88
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,280
their endless pointless quarrel and creeping, their glorious glide-nosedive into their paychecks'

89
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,940
pleasures into an ecstatic emptiness, a glowing incinerator, a parking lot full of businessmen

90
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,540
conspiring and colluding on the big dream, the big lie, the big nauseating, screaming,

91
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:03,820
sweating nightmare of business America, media America, corporate America, consumer America,

92
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,140
fascist America.

93
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,780
Who will protect us from our protectors?

94
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,800
Who shall judge our police?

95
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,400
Who will redirect our directors and who release our release?

96
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,020
Who will police our judges and who will will our will?

97
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,260
Eat your food.

98
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,560
Who will choose his slave?

99
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,880
Is he a slave still?

100
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,680
Out of paradoxes, man creates.

101
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,700
He cannot flee his socks and says the world is his world.

102
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,980
The last and best chance for peace.

103
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,020
Charge and discharge produced by the genital embrace causes the orgasmic reflux,

104
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,920
the preemifleasurable muscular contracture.

105
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,220
The genital is a

106
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,220


107
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,220


108
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,220


109
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,440
Subjection to social disciplines may cause gastric ulcers, respiratory, coronary and

110
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,320
vascular diseases.

111
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,960
Comrade lovers, for your health's sake, breathe.

112
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,340
The communist movement fights for the liberation of man's natural impulses and joy of living.

113
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,320
Four thousand liberating orgasms in every woman's and man's life are four thousand

114
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,120
explosions of liberated life energy.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,740
Only by living can both love and labor can be created.

116
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,900
Self-regulating work of society.

117
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,700
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

118
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,760
They mutilate, they torture, they kill.

119
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:00,180
Spine-tingling horror, unspeakable shock and breathless excitement will grip you as you

120
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,100
watch living organs ripped from the bodies of voluptuous females as beating hearts and

121
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,520
throbbing brains are transplanted to create

122
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,880
The Subgenius.

123
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,840
Our own subgenius.

124
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,740
Somebody's dropped it to me once.

125
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,440
It's like acid except that it's so compressed it's like being shot out of a cannon for 45 minutes.

126
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,120
The Subgenius.

127
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:29,880
This hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station

128
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,040
and only in the city of...

129
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,860
Here's your host.

130
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,480
The beautiful, voluptuous, deadly, vicious, satana.

131
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:48,560
A woman who would stop at nothing to gain control over the astro-zombies whose creed was kill, kill, kill.

132
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,560
The Subgenius.

133
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,780
My face is so red, dear listeners.

134
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,820
That beautiful, voluptuous, satana couldn't make it tonight.

135
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,820
But the show will go on.

136
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,740
This is the hour of slack.

137
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,820
Election 92 edition.

138
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,920
One of them anyway.

139
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,100
Because I bet when Reverend Stange returns next week he'll have a thing or two to say about this.

140
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,880
About it.

141
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:31,540
But I just myself was really, I guess, primarily motivated to do a show about the election.

142
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:42,860
Mostly because as we do this show tonight, this week, I guess the 92 campaign has reached perhaps its lowest point yet.

143
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,940
Although there's still time for it to descend even further.

144
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
But, you know, it's really nice and comforting.

145
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,980
Comforting in a...

146
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,280
In a...

147
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,080
This modern world that's constantly changing.

148
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,760
To know that, you know, even with the end of Soviet communism that...

149
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,680
Well, we haven't yet seen the end of good old fashioned red baiting.

150
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,700
And, you know, I suppose that McCarthyism of some sort or another will always be with us.

151
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,560
As long as we have men like fighting Bob Dornan here have something to say about it.

152
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,860
Not...

153
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,020
Not anti-Bob.

154
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,440
So, anyway, we'll be hearing from and about each of the major presidential candidates tonight.

155
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,420
Past and present, as a matter of fact.

156
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,560
And, you know, about four years ago we did a show right before the 88 elections.

157
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,140
And we got a lot of calls from people.

158
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,200
Some of them said we were obviously biased against George Bush.

159
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,960
And others who said we were bashing Dukakis.

160
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,100
So we are going to try for that same even-handed contempt for the candidates tonight.

161
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,960
And past presidents, as I say.

162
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,800
But, you know, don't forget.

163
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
See, I can show you.

164
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,640
I can show that contempt.

165
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,320
Because I'm going to vote.

166
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,940
And I hope you will, too.

167
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,820
So let's get on with it.

168
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,300
I've got more show than I've got time.

169
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,780
So here we go.

170
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,100
Good evening.

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,480
Usually I talk with you from my office in the west wing of the White House.

172
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
But tonight there's something special to talk about.

173
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,460
And I've asked someone very special to join me.

174
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,400
Nancy and I are here in the west hall of the White House.

175
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,320
And around us are the rooms in which we live.

176
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,380
It's the home you've provided for us of which we merely have temporary custody.

177
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,980
Nancy is joining me because the message this evening is not my message but ours.

178
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,460
Despite our best efforts, shortages of marijuana are now being reported.

179
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:58,300
From the early days of our administration, Nancy has been using marijuana on a daily basis.

180
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:07,140
And her personal observations and efforts have given her such dramatic insights that I wanted her to share them with you this evening.

181
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,480
Nancy.

182
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,640
Thank you.

183
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,680
For five years, I've been traveling across the country, learning and listening.

184
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,440
And one of the most hopeful signs I've seen is this new drug.

185
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,940
Crack.

186
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:29,760
Each time I meet with someone new, I yearn to find a way to help share the message that drugs open your eyes to life.

187
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,520
To see it in the vivid colors that God gave us as a precious gift to his children.

188
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,120
To enjoy life to the fullest.

189
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,640
And to make it count.

190
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,600
So to my young friends out there, life can be great.

191
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,460
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol,

192
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440
there's a big, wonderful world out there for you.

193
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,320
It belongs to you.

194
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,840
I think you can see why Nancy has been such a positive influence on all that we're trying to do.

195
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,580
The job ahead of us is very clear.

196
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:12,800
Nancy's personal crusade to expand the use of smokeable cocaine, otherwise known as crack, should become our national crusade.

197
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,960
It must include a combination of government and private efforts.

198
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,680
Which complement one another.

199
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,820
Our young people are helping us lead the way.

200
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:28,900
Not long ago in Oakland, California, I was asked by a group of children what to do if they were offered drugs.

201
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,900
Say yes, I answered.

202
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,320
Soon after that, those children in Oakland formed a Just Say Yes Club.

203
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,100
And now, there are over 10,000 such clubs all over the country.

204
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,980
America has accomplished so much in these last few years.

205
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,800
Whether it's been rebuilding our economy or serving the cause of freedom in the world,

206
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,300
what we've been able to achieve has been done with your help.

207
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,300
With us working together as a nation united.

208
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,240
Now, we need your support again.

209
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,140
Drugs are the mightiest force for good that we know.

210
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,020
They're simply wonderful to the young people on whom our future depends.

211
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,400
Many of you may be thinking, well, drugs don't concern me.

212
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,540
But it does concern you.

213
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,240
It concerns us all.

214
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,720
Because of the way it could fulfill the promise and hope in those restless minds.

215
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,580
Drug and alcohol abuse needs our encouragement.

216
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,580
In this crusade, let us not forget who we are.

217
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,720
Drug abuse is a freedom that is ours.

218
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,520
You are Americans.

219
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,560
You're the product of the freest society mankind has ever known.

220
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,200
No one, ever, has the right to separation.

221
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,660
We operate the drugs from the customer.

222
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,040
Say yes to drugs to the point of making others uncomfortable.

223
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,960
Even if it makes, meaning, making ourselves unpopular.

224
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,340
And drug abuse is not a crime.

225
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,720
Drugs and excessive alcohol are used by former Paternity General Meese.

226
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,920
Drugs help us create love and hope and trust and confidence.

227
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,520
And cocaine makes me happy.

228
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,840
Think for a moment how special it is to be an American.

229
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,260
Can we doubt that only a divine providence placed this land,

230
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:26,520
this island of freedom here as a refuge for all those so-called drug criminals who yearn to breathe free?

231
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:34,880
The revolution out of which our liberty was conceived signaled an historical call to substance abusers and the chemically dependent.

232
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:41,500
For the sake of our children, I implore each of you to shake the foundations of all that we believe.

233
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,180
We seek to create a massive change in national attitudes.

234
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,900
And you have a critical role to play.

235
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,580
You can help others by providing cocaine and excessive alcohol to those in need.

236
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,080
Being friends to others is the best way of being friends to ourselves.

237
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:07,620
It's up to us to change attitudes and just simply enjoy life to the fullest with a cocaine habit.

238
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,900
And in the most important area,

239
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,200
individual use,

240
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,700
we see progress.

241
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,980
The U.S. military has more than tripled the use of drugs among its personnel since 1980.

242
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,860
Tonight, I can report to you that Vice President Bush spoke marijuana regularly.

243
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,200
And there's one more thing.

244
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,320
Nancy and I are hooked on heroin.

245
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,000
Each of us was once strung out on several drugs.

246
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,460
Here in the White House, drugs are a constant temptation, but we still have much to do.

247
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:52,440
Our goal is to expand drug trafficking at all levels of government and in the private sector.

248
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,140
Help us.

249
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,200
And finally, to young people watching or listening, I have a very personal message for you.

250
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,740
Every time a drug goes into a child,

251
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,200
it's exciting and stimulating and rewarding.

252
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,380
Don't cheat yourselves out of this promise.

253
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,440
And now we go on to the next stop.

254
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,500
Making a final commitment.

255
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,520
Say yes to drugs anytime, anyplace.

256
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,860
So won't you join us in this great new national crusade?

257
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,580
God bless you, and good night.

258
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,480
I'm gonna go eat for him.

259
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,960
Get your hands up, man.

260
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,540
Get him up.

261
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,420
With all the horror stories, with all the devastation linked to crack, heroin,

262
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,140
Shut up!

263
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,320
You might find it hard to believe how serious prosecutors are these days about marijuana.

264
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,960
Be a lead.

265
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,940
I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I...

266
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,620
Murderers.

267
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,580
...these days about marijuana.

268
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,540
Be a lead.

269
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,080
Be a lead.

270
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,020
I experimented with marijuana a time or two.

271
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,860
How serious are these days about marijuana?

272
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,440
Murderers in this country average just seven years in jail,

273
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:16,240
and rapist, sick, Clinton-feud will serve the rest of his life.

274
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,440
Sick, Clinton-feud will serve the rest of his life.

275
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,220
...stereo-money, marijuana, and I found a food.

276
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,740
And I'm tired of it.

277
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,000
My murderers have the evidence...

278
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,480
And I'm tired of it.

279
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:44,380
...of the average person living in jail and rapist, sick, Clinton-feud will serve the rest of his life.

280
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,060
...stereo-money, marijuana, and I found a food.

281
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,480
And I found a food.

282
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,860
Sick, Clinton-feud will serve the rest of his life.

283
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,540
Sick, Clinton-feud will serve the rest of his life.

284
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,080
...and rapist, sick, Clinton-feud will serve the rest of his life.

285
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,900
And I agree with Clinton.

286
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,920
We've got enough stuff just for the last five years of thingies.

287
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,520
You can pull over and get a pretty good sense of who you are.

288
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:06,880
And I'm tired of them.

289
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,480
That's cool.

290
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,820
And I'm tired of them.

291
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,920
I assume it was against the law, but when we got there,

292
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,580
they told us that as long as we did it inside our apartments or whatever,

293
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,720
nobody would ever hassle us.

294
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm going to get a good sense of who you are.

295
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,580
Marijuana possession is illegal.

296
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,860
We've got enough stuff just for the last five years of...

297
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,500
The law like this could have given us an American.

298
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,720
Said they're exterminating people for marijuana.

299
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,780
He didn't kill anybody.

300
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,540
He didn't molest a child.

301
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,460
He didn't rape someone.

302
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,440
I experimented with marijuana at a time of...

303
00:18:59,440 --> 00:18:59,700
Rape is sick.

304
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,580
Rape is sick.

305
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,300
I experimented with marijuana at a time of...

306
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,440
He will serve the rest of his life.

307
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,540
For marijuana.

308
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,240
For marijuana.

309
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,000
He didn't kill anybody.

310
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,700
He didn't molest a child.

311
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,900
He didn't rape someone.

312
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,260
He's just seven years in jail.

313
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,760
Rape is sick.

314
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,720
Sick.

315
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,160
I experimented with marijuana at a time of...

316
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,940
He served the rest of his life.

317
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,740
...the prison and the rape and life for that.

318
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,760
And I'm tired of them.

319
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,500
I just kept saying,

320
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, look, you are crazy.

321
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,860
The whole thing.

322
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,900
Seven years in jail.

323
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,360
Rape is sick.

324
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,540
He served the rest of his life.

325
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,200
...the last five years or ten years.

326
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,200
He can...

327
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,880
I experimented with marijuana at a time of...

328
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,180
I experimented with marijuana at a time of...

329
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,540
I experimented with marijuana at a time of...

330
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,840
That's why I'm still standing here.

331
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,240
And I'm sick and tired of all these people who don't know me,

332
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,680
know nothing about my life,

333
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,320
know nothing about the battles I've fought,

334
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,160
know nothing about the life I've lived,

335
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,300
make snotty-nosed remarks about how I haven't done anything,

336
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,100
in my life, and it's all driven by ambition.

337
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,500
...the West.

338
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,040
That's bull.

339
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,340
But this one...

340
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,200
And I'm tired of it.

341
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,800
I experimented with marijuana at a time of...

342
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,140
Known nothing about the life I've lived,

343
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,960
make snotty-nosed remarks about how I haven't done anything in my life,

344
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and it's all driven by ambition.

345
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,900
I experimented with marijuana at a time of...

346
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,220
That's bull.

347
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,140
And I'm tired of it.

348
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,800
I experimented with marijuana a time or two.

349
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,340
I experimented with marijuana.

350
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,860
I experimented.

351
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,760
I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and I.

352
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:10,740
Marijuana.

353
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,400
Marijuana.

354
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,680
Could happen.

355
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,700
Well, first we heard the Reagans speaking out on drugs,

356
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,220
and just then was Jesus Harvey Oswald performing, sort of,

357
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,400
I Didn't Inhale.

358
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,960
You know, these days it is terribly popular to...

359
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,540
We're real down on politics, and especially politicians,

360
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,700
which is understandable.

361
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,640
A lot of factors, especially in the areas, I guess, of,

362
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,680
I don't know, campaign financing, in my opinion,

363
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,460
have helped to utterly compromise just about every candidate.

364
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,700
But, you know, luckily, not everyone feels such contempt

365
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,680
for our elected officials.

366
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,840
There are, in fact,

367
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,660
people who have been so inspired, inspired by some presidents,

368
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,740
that they go so far as to put their money where their admiration is.

369
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,280
I'm sure some of you are familiar with the

370
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,560
Send Us Your Poem and We'll Put It to Music and Record It companies.

371
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,640
We've played at least one of those songs on this show,

372
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,860
Blind Man's Enos.

373
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,100
But the most famous of these companies was a company called MSR

374
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,380
out of Hollywood, California.

375
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,740
And there's a new compilation album out called Beat of the Traps,

376
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:58,560
which collects the, well, best of these records, I guess you'd say.

377
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,400
The album is really, really good,

378
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,460
but in keeping with the political theme of the program tonight,

379
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,460
we're going to focus on the presidential songs.

380
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,860
I've got three of them here, and I hope I can get to all of them.

381
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,800
And part of me just really likes the idea of some guy

382
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,880
from, you know, who knows where,

383
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,140
watching some president on TV,

384
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,080
and becoming so inspired as to put pen to pencil,

385
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,400
you know, pen or probably pencil, I mean,

386
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,580
to line to notebook paper,

387
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,600
and write him up a song,

388
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,220
and send it in with a few bucks to Hollywood.

389
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,300
Just imagine when the recorded version was sent back to the guy.

390
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,700
And then maybe, maybe the guy sent a copy to the White House, you know,

391
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,760
and then maybe one day the president opens his mail

392
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,200
and finds this record there,

393
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,520
and listens.

394

Yes, God in his infinite wisdom

00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,280
Put Richard Nixon on this earth

A leader with endless courage

And the magic from above

428
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,920
A miracle, you might say

429
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,540
And all who have met Nixon

430
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,980
Love him so

431
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,360
The genius of his way

God in his infinite wisdom

438
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,740
Put Richard Nixon on this earth

439
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,060
To bring to us his heritage

440
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:32,160
One of priceless worth

441
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,820
One that will rekindle the glory t

442
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,260
To bring to us his Agency

443
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,920

Ooh, the genius of Britain

The valour of dallance

A ragtime emeralds

455
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,880
The digitization of harm

456
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,600
to your own administration.

457
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,520
Tell us how you intend to rule the nation.

458
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,940
These are the laws of my administration.

459
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,020
No one is allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke.

460
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,540
And whistling is forbidden.

461
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,360
We are not allowed to tell a dirty joke.

462
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,260
If chewing gum is chewed, the chewer is pursued,

463
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,280
and in the hoose cow hidden...

464
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,160
The chewer is pursued.

465
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,620
If any form of pleasure is exhibited,

466
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,700
report to me and it will be prohibited.

467
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,840
I'll put my foot down, so shall it be.

468
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,180
This is the land of the free.

469
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,300
The last man nearly ruined this place, he didn't know what to do with it.

470
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,380
If you think this country is bad, just wait till I get through with it.

471
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,280
The country's taxes must be fixed, and I know what to do with it.

472
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,760
If you think you're paying too much,

473
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,340
I'll just wait till I get through with it.

474
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:18,700
The country's taxes must be fixed, and I know what to do with it.

475
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,580
I won't stand for anything that's crooked or unfair.

476
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,080
I'm strictly on the up and up, so everyone beware.

477
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,400
If anyone's caught taking graft, and I don't get my share,

478
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,840
we stand them up against the wall and out goes the weasel.

479
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,800
So everyone beware, it's crooked or unfair.

480
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,980
Don't let them take the business card, let me in here.

481
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,860
The country's taxes must be fixed,

482
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,720
and I know what to do with it.

483
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,420
If any man should come between a husband and his bride,

484
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,500
we find out which one she prefers by letting her decide.

485
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,640
If she prefers the other man, the husband steps outside.

486
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,120
We stand them up against the wall and pop goes the weasel.

487
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,900
The country's tax is fine, we need to choose a bride.

488
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,320
They're standing up against the wall and waiting for the lightning.

489
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,220
You had an appointment at the House of Representatives.

490
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,920
Good heavens!

491
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,940
You can't go with your trousers up.

492
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,440
I can't, eh? Well, they'll never catch me any other way.

493
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,540
Bush has all of his life and all of his career

494
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:25,100
made a pretty successful career of sort of minding the store.

495
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,000
He has been a congressman, ambassador to China,

496
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,980
C.A.I., vice president and now president.

497
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,200
That's a pretty good record. Only Richard Nixon surpasses him.

498
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,780
Well, we're talking about two of the most criminal outside of Warren Herding

499
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,600
and Lucy Grant.

500
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,620
Yeah, and Charles Nixon.

501
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,720
We're talking about serious criminals.

502
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,580
Yeah, what do you call it, an enduring criminal conspiracy?

503
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,780
A continuing criminal conspiracy.

504
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,560
When the great scorer comes to write against these names,

505
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,680
George Bush, Nixon, Warren Herding, Grant,

506
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,640
we'll all be up there.

507
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,900
And yet, both in this century, Bush and Nixon have held almost every office

508
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:23,940
that would be coveted by ambitious politicians or all-American boys.

509
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,120
Nixon was everything except the governor of California.

510
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,040
Oh, boy. That's a point of pride for everybody.

511
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,100
Yeah, Nixon was, on paper, one of the most successful politicians.

512
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,580
Yeah, he was.

513
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,880
He was the most successful in the history of the country.

514
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,500
Now, Ronald Reagan, he only ran for, well, yeah, two offices.

515
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,240
Reagan really had blitzed it.

516
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,260
He was like, I don't know, Roy Rogers.

517
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,880
Yeah, we'll see Reagan about 40 years from now with weird plastic all over him.

518
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:04,600
Yeah, here's an actor out of Hollywood who was elected with the help of three or four used car dealers

519
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,700
and is a two-term governor of California campaigning against debt,

520
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,700
against the insane, against mental health, against almost everything,

521
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,340
but mainly on an economic program of austerity and balancing the budget.

522
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,080
The bastard left this state, I think, what was it, six times the debt.

523
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,860
Then he runs for president.

524
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,880
After two terms here, he runs for president.

525
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,740
And then that bastard appoints his successor.

526
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,940
Now, nobody's ever done that.

527
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,080
Yeah, his underling, his boy, his capon.

528
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,000
People are not beaten up anymore.

529
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,880
I think it's, I think Bush is right.

530
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,440
This is a kinder, gentler nation, a nation of sheep.

531
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,380
It's all been said before.

532
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,920
It was three years ago, two at the most.

533
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,660
Iowa stands on the corner of Biscuit and Reagan in Texarkana.

534
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,320
George Bush and I were to meet with the head of the Gay and Lesbian Blimp Owners Association,

535
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,340
a very powerful Washington lobbyist.

536
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,920
George was looking for donations for the NAB,

537
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,480
the National Endowment for Vagrants, apparently a pet project for him.

538
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,100
George showed up blank.

539
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,760
He'd just come back from one of those right-for-life rallies

540
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,540
where they say stuff like, burn all the buildings, they might be abortion punks.

541
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,100
You know what I mean.

542
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,200
Bush was in a real bad mood.

543
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,820
I guess he'd woke up on the wrong side of the Rose Garden that morning.

544
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,680
And I told him that I did not want to meet him.

545
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,200
I could be out butt-sledding a Mooney and have a lot better time.

546
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,320
I do not need to waste my time power-stooge-ing with the president.

547
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
Now, it's up to the voters.

548
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,520
But understand that if I could just get my hands on those ribby slingers,

549
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,160
I'd take this country back to Kansas.

550
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,360
And yes, even though George Bush's history is a bouncer at a lesbian mall,

551
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,580
I will not exploit that for political purposes.

552
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,120
Let's stay on the issue.

553
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:47,860
Do you realize that George Bush told me that the United States was suffering from a bum shortage?

554
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,520
Can you believe that?

555
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,880
Neil Bush?

556
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,260
Yeah, he's working again.

557
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,720
I hear he's selling those celeste exams door-to-door.

558
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,840
How about Republican propaganda?

559
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,240
I read in the National Review that I own 14 gift-less family prevention centers.

560
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,100
Now, when I asked William F. Buckley where he got this piece of information,

561
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,720
he replied, and I quote,

562
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,120
I've been loitering from a deceased African American.

563
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,460
And to clear up another Bush lie,

564
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,580
I have not had a homosexual relationship with Carl Sagan.

565
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,700
I want that on the record.

566
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,820
We're just good friends.

567
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,780
Republican dirty tricks?

568
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,740
What does that mean?

569
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,540
He's smelt it?

570
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:20,920
Doubt it.

571
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,380
Read my lips?

572
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,820
How about pull my finger?

573
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,720
Those are the asylum of deadly sins.

574
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,900
I just love this guy.

575
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,540
Now, check this.

576
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,780
There was this woman standing in the street,

577
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,100
carrying a right to life sign.

578
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,620
She stopped me and said,

579
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,020
Mr. Perot, how can you be for abortion?

580
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,940
She said, you don't know what it's like to have a living being growing inside of you.

581
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,640
And I said, that lady, I've had penworms,

582
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,180
and to tell you the truth, I don't miss them one damn bit.

583
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,040
You know, if you can find George Bush,

584
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,440
when he's not at a fetus-worshiping festival,

585
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,120
or fighting for the rights of epileptics to own automatic firearms,

586
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,440
you've done the hard part.

587
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,800
Why did I decide to run for president?

588
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,940
Well, let's just say, the more I stab myself in the foot,

589
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,000
the less I want to kick my head off.

590
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,920
Because nobody's willing to believe the facts I bring out.

591
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,440
And so nobody is willing to believe me.

592
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:52,380
Don't love the way política vibrante rappers cuerpo tono

593
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:52,720
rooutesintón sem documentaries.

594
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,860
I'm sorry about that!

595
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,160
This was about the right thing to do

596
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,160


597
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,160


598
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,760
Giving him the version that heima Adriano

599
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,700
The white man's got a guy in town

600
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:14,940
The white man's got a guy in town

601
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,720
What was he looking for?

602
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,740
Kill him for the hell of it

603
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,800
He's a bad guy

604
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,280
Drape him and slit his throat

605
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,800
You can't hide

606
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,320
He's a bad guy

607
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,660
You understand that

608
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:30,760
He's a bad guy

609
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:30,760


610
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:30,760


611
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:30,760


612
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:30,760


613
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,060
He's a bad guy

614
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,600
The white man's got a guy in town

615
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,220
Kill him for the hell of it

616
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,100
He's a bad guy

617
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,700
Drape him and slit his throat

618
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,500
Black people, what y'all going to do?

619
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,040
Turn this nation apart

620
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,240
The police and the teachers are on the phone

621
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,740
The police and the teachers are on the phone

622
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,580
Obviously a major malfunction

623
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,020
And then there's these people

624
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,100
Who just got on the phone

625
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,320
Obviously a major malfunction

626
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,640
We're rapidly losing the battle

627
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,740
One minute left

628
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:00,740


629
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,280
In the grave

630
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,900
Virtual annihilation

631
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,840
The wrath to come

632
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,580
Causing violence in American people

633
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,920
Plausible deniability

634
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,260
The current of death

635
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,460
Deniable

636
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,920
National security

637
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,600
Deniable covert operations

638
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,060
Diversions

639
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,380
Conspiracy

640
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,300
Depression

641
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,340
Treachery

642
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,380
Why not a crime?

643
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,740
I've earned everything

644
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,020
My three sisters

645
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,580
My three sisters

646
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,000
The part

647
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,740
The corruption of truth

648
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,240
There is a pain

649
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,200
Please

650
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,740
We're rapidly losing the battle

651
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,200
Conversion

652
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,140
Conspiracy

653
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,660
Deliberation

654
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,720
Slaughter

655
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,500
Sex

656
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:57,840
Sex

657
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,040
Sex

658
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,280
Sex

659
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:58,860
Sex

660
00:37:59,840 --> 00:37:59,900
Sex

661
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


662
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


663
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


664
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


665
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


666
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


667
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


668
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


669
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


670
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:00,560


671
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,380
Hello, everybody.

672
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,100
Encouragement of peace.

673
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,820
Possible deniability.

674
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,280
National security.

675
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,080
Domestic breaking.

676
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,160
Seeing Washington for black people.

677
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,540
Going to die.

678
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,220
Witness the blood.

679
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,380
Well, well, well, well.

680
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,080
Not about Washington.

681
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,400
Remember that we as attackers have the initiative.

682
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,320
Rapidly, ruthlessly, viciously.

683
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,280
Attack, attack.

684
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,640
When in doubt, attack again.

685
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,500
When in doubt, attack again.

686
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,280
When in doubt, attack again.

687
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,380
Can our government be competent?

688
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,220
Jimmy Carter says yes.

689
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Jimmy Carter says yes.

690
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,780
Jimmy Carter says yes.

691
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,040
Can our government be honest?

692
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,080
Jimmy Carter says yes.

693
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,600
Jimmy Carter says yes.

694
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,780
Can our government be decent and open?

695
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,340
As the 39th president, he has spoken yes.

696
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,420
Jimmy Carter says yes.

697
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,920
As your president, I, Jimmy Carter, know it is possible to run a government efficiently

698
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,660
without sin or any corruption.

699
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:17,260
I will do my level best to run the government decently without any statement of eruption.

700
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,100
Errors and wrongdoings I will reveal to the public.

701
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,580
For corruption while I'm in office, I'll not bargain.

702
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,180
I'll stand tall like old glory.

703
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,440
Faithful to the republic.

704
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,980
Security will prevail as sure as I'm the president.

705
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,180
President Jimmy Carter.

706
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,860
Can our government be competent?

707
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,600
Jimmy Carter says yes.

708
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,280
Jimmy Carter says yes.

709
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:56,400
Can our government be honest?

710
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,160
Jimmy Carter says yes.

711
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,420
Jimmy Carter says yes.

712
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,900
Jimmy Carter says yes.

713
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,060
Can our government be decent and open?

714
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:14,520
As the 39th president, he has spoken yes.

715
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,660
Jimmy Carter says yes.

716
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,460
Jimmy, Jimmy Carter, our 39th president.

717
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,140
Jimmy, Jimmy Carter, our 39th president.

718
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:29,720
Jimmy, Jimmy Carter, our 39th president.

719
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,700
Jimmy, Jimmy Carter, our 39th president.

720
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,300
Indifference is not an option.

721
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,620
Only outspoken insistence that drug use will not be tolerated.

722
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:48,400
Everyone is obligated to become hysterical at the mere thought of drug use,

723
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:56,340
just as office workers in 1934 were obligated to scream curses

724
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,080
like Pavlov's frothing dog.

725
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,720
cowlif5nk0g0k1155》

726
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,540
Lhow the enemy leader appeared on screen.

727
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,140
And they'd better scream loud and scream ugly.

728
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,940
I remember during the Mike Bell flap.

729
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,320
Eye witness news was going around prowling the streets,

730
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,700
you know, sticking mics and everybody's face.

731
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,440
Well, I think that making the money they do,

732
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,320
they should be serving as an example.

733
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,040
She gives plenty of mike time.

734
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,140
You know you can talk to anyone and you need the money they need.

735
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:29,140


736
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:29,140


737
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:41,420
And here's a black cat working on some underground cables, straightens up and says, I think if someone uses drugs, it's his own business.

738
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,380
Boy, did they get that mic out of his face.

739
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,980
He didn't even get the word out.

740
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,200
Freedom of the press to say what they want to hear and call it the voice of the people.

741
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,340
Urine tests.

742
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:09,860
Our pioneer ancestors were in their graves at the thought of urine tests to decide whether a man is competent to do his job.

743
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,780
I

744
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:11,780


745
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,820
I

746
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,840
, I will not raise the taxes on a working man and woman of this country.

747
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,600
Read my lips.

748
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,340
No new taxes.

749
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,440
Read my lips.

750
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,920
No new taxes.

751
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,400
Read my lips.

752
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,280
No new taxes.

753
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,660
Read my lips.

754
00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:01,240
The flexible freeze will get the deficit gone by, you know, 91 or 92.

755
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,440
Well, today's unemployment figures show the economy is moving in the right direction.

756
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,420
The economy is strengthening the economies on the right track.

757
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,000
I'm not prepared to say where in recession.

758
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,180
It is not does not fit the definition of recession.

759
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,560
Not recession.

760
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:25,240
is not recession. This recession is far less deep than the previous recession.

761
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:40,540
I think I've known, look, this economy has been free-fall. I probably have made mistakes

762
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:47,140
in assessing the fact that the economy would recover. The negotiators are free to discuss

763
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,920
a wide array of options, including tax increases.

764
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:56,300
Read my lips. No new taxes.

765
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:04,680
I was wrong. I was wrong. I was wrong. I was wrong.

766
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:14,940
Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips.

767
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:37,920
My stand is this. I oppose abortion. I oppose federal funding of abortion, except in the

768
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,360
case of rape, incest, and the life of the mother. I do not favor repeal of the Constitution

769
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:44,680
in that regard.

770
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:52,120
What you're saying is this shows that I supported federal funding if there was rape or incest.

771
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:58,560
And I don't recall that, but if it's there, fine. That's not my position now. And I don't

772
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,740
recall it as being my position then.

773
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:11,400
I don't favor a federal amendment to overthrow the Supreme Court decision. And I am firmly

774
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:17,120
positioned in favor of, you know, overturning the Constitution.

775
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,000
I'm not going to change that position.

776
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,820
You know, there has been, I have to make a confession, an evolution in my position.

777
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:38,020
Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips.

778
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,180
Come on, Mike, go give us a break there.

779
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:09,260
I want to be the education president. I don't care about my personal label. I am committed

780
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:15,500
to education, although budget dollars are very tight. Education is so important to me

781
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,700
that I've increased funding.

782
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:23,560
Dollar bills don't educate students. People coming out of college that can't read and

783
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,620
have the level of literacy in this country abominably low.

784
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:37,540
I've proposed a college savings bond to help young people save for that expense so that

785
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,580
you can afford to send your college to children.

786
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,580
Read my lips. Read my lips.

787
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,840
Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips.

788
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:05,680
Everything I did last year was the purpose of advancing my, everything I did politically,

789
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,840
advancing my election.

790
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:12,100
Voters know the difference between a sound bite and sound policy.

791
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,120
Let's not kid ourselves. We're in a tough time.

792
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,120


793
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,120


794
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:23,540
I fight. But you know me, I don't seek unnecessary conflict. I fight to win. And I am determined

795
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,160
to win and I will win.

796
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:33,120
When I want to feel a surge of patriotism or turn nostalgic, or even when I need a little

797
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,900
free advice about Saddam Hussein, I turn to country music.

798
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:43,900
You run for cover, get under the bush like a quail and hope that you don't get flushed

799
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,540
out for a while.

800
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,100
Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read

801
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,100


802
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:59,280
my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips.

803
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:06,600
People said to me the other day, you think the President knew about Watergate? I said,

804
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:10,620
he didn't know about Watergate. They said, how do you know? I said, because I believe

805
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,400
the President and I believe in the Presidency.

806
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,960
I was not.

807
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,060
Ha ha ha ha ha!

808
00:49:53,160 --> 00:50:01,820
♥3. Ty physical strength sci-fianki♥

809
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,900
Sam was a nice man.

810
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,140
Sam owned a small farm near St. George, Utah.

811
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,480
He worked very hard on his farm and made a decent living.

812
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,960
Sam was a good American.

813
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,580
He always paid his taxes.

814
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,880
He would figure out what he owed and mail it promptly to the government.

815
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,580
The government used Sam's money to improve its nuclear bonds,

816
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:07,120
which it tested not far away from St. George.

817
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,360
Sam kept paying his taxes.

818
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,260
He would go home every now and then to Hampshire.

819
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,560
And then cloud and vine.

820
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,260
Sam got sick.

821
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,860
Leukemia, they said.

822
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,400
Radioactivity, baby, they said.

823
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,700
Sam died.

824
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,860
America thanks you, Sam.

825
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,540
America thanks you.

826
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,340
I only go home when Sam said yes.

827
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,260
America thanks you.

828
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:28,680
I take it open together to install the materials because it is my job

829
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,500
and I wont lose my job that slept in your house.

830
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:31,500


831
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:31,500


832
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:31,500


833
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:31,500


834
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:31,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

835
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,620
Hey Alex, listen.

836
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,020
S Boulevard got people spraying Melan件 in a water system.

837
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,920
It meant why he lived with me.

838
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,760
He was awake when I woke.

839
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,160
Thank you.

840
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,600
Thank you.

841
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,600
Thank you.

842
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,920
Well, dear listeners, we've reached the end of this particular hour of Slack,

843
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,420
the election 92 hour of Slack.

844
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,980
We hope you enjoyed it.

845
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,220
And I know there are all sorts of you out there who,

846
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:25,160
who listened to the show in the hopes of forgetting all about the election

847
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,340
and the potentially disastrous choice you have to make.

848
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,140
And here we are rubbing your noses right in those choices.

849
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:32,920
And in fact,

850
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:39,260
making it even worse by accentuating the less attractive qualities of the

851
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,420
candidates hurts.

852
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:41,780
Don't it?

853
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,940
Well, we're, we're,

854
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,480
what have we listened to in the way back there?

855
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:56,840
We heard the great Rod Rogers doing Richard Nixon and Groucho Marx scene from

856
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,900
duck soup, Hunter S.

857
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:06,280
Thompson talking about president Bush groove handle doing Ross three 16 and a

858
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,840
song from Gwar from the America must be destroyed CD.

859
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:11,280
Okay.

860
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,420
And Rod Rogers again,

861
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,980
doing Jimmy Carter says yes.

862
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,080
From beat of the traps and William S.

863
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:24,760
Burroughs on drug hysteria and a thousand points of night,

864
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,980
which is actually a guy named Don was,

865
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:27,600
uh,

866
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,540
did the read my lips tune.

867
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:35,160
And then we heard these sedition commission with the story of Sam and that

868
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,200
where he leads me,

869
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,840
I will follow was Jethro Tilton.

870
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,060
And right now it's so,

871
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:40,620
so data.

872
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,020
So again,

873
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,680
this was the election show and I'm to finish.

874
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,880
I'm certainly not going to stand here and berate you about whether or not you

875
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,320
should vote.

876
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:52,640
I mean,

877
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,340
I think you really and truly should.

878
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,160
It's a duty,

879
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,080
if not always a pleasure,

880
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,820
but since every other minute,

881
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,980
there's some actor or scantily clad rock star telling you to vote,

882
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,260
whether they've registered or not,

883
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,020
I'm just going to leave it up to your individual conscience.

884
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,420
And speaking of rock stars,

885
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:07,860
uh,

886
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,620
I'm really upset about,

887
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,000
uh,

888
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,340
Sinead O'Connor.

889
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,720
I was,

890
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,040
I was quite happy and comfortable in my dislike of her and her bald headed pretentiousness.

891
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:24,980
And then last week she goes and pulls a cool stunt on live national television that forces me to love her.

892
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:25,860
So way to go.

893
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:26,920
Sinead.

894
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,060
I hope some of you saw her.

895
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,940
It was really an amazing,

896
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,960
shocking moment for television anyway,

897
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:36,240
and hope you saw it cause I don't think they're going to be rerunning it ever.

898
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,440
Not in my life too many.

899
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,820
One and all the subject of television.

900
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,060
I'm sure you've all heard.

901
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,080
By now about,

902
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:43,420
uh,

903
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:43,760
John,

904
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,120
Chris,

905
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:48,480
Felicity getting fired from the Ren and Stimpy show primarily for not meeting their schedule.

906
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:50,160
And we got this,

907
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:50,440
uh,

908
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,480
magazine called holy temple of mass consumption.

909
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:53,980
And,

910
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,160
uh,

911
00:56:55,340 --> 00:57:04,840
they recap the various press releases and interviews and suggest writing to Nickelodeon and MTV to get him his job back,

912
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,880
which it's an admirable sentiment,

913
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,580
but I think it's probably doomed to failure.

914
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,040
I think this firing is pretty much a done deal.

915
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,700
Apparently he's appearing planning to,

916
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:13,940
uh,

917
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,380
go on to other things.

918
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,740
The quote from him I read was that farts are behind me now.

919
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,560
So getting him his job back is probably not possible.

920
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:23,860
However,

921
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,300
writing to Nickelodeon and calling them to insult,

922
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,140
berate and curse them for their foolish decision.

923
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,440
Well,

924
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,020
that might be,

925
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:32,860
if not productive,

926
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,180
at least mildly satisfying.

927
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,680
So,

928
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,060
uh,

929
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:40,600
I'm going to give you their address and phone number right to Nickelodeon headquarters at one five,

930
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:40,960
one,

931
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,960
five Broadway,

932
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,220
New York,

933
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:43,560
New York,

934
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:43,800
one,

935
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,100
oh,

936
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:44,260
oh,

937
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:44,420
three,

938
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:44,800
six.

939
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,160
And,

940
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:46,420
uh,

941
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,180
register your opinion or call them at the area code two one,

942
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:50,420
two,

943
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:50,660
two,

944
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:50,840
five,

945
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,120
eight,

946
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:51,320
7,

947
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:51,780
500.

948
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:53,640
I think I will.

949
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,740
And of course the,

950
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:56,040
uh,

951
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:59,760
the address for the church of the sub genius.

952
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,820
If you needed any more information from them,

953
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,880
like this little baby,

954
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,020
we love baby.

955
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,940
If you need any information about the church of the sub genius,

956
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:10,940


957
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:15,000
write to us at P O box one four,

958
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,120
oh three Oh six in Dallas,

959
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:17,680
Texas,

960
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,520
seven,

961
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:18,960
five,

962
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,120
two,

963
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:19,360
one,

964
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:19,620
four.

965
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,540
Thank you ever so much for listening.

966
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:22,680
And,

967
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,280
uh,

968
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,300
what was I going to say?

969
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,340
Oh,

970
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:26,520
wait,

971
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,100
praise.

972
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,920
I'm sorry.

973
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,060
I'm sorry.

974
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,340
No matter how much money you have,

975
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:54,040
the sad fact remains that regardless of what color Porsche or BMW or Lamborghini,

976
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:54,500
you have,

977
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,160
you will never be one of George Bush's rich friends.

978
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,480
George Bush does not want you to be his friend.

979
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:07,400
George Bush does not care enough about you to even dislike you.

980
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,460
You cannot afford to buy your way.

981
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:11,980
Into his country club.

982
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:20,920
It does not matter if you're a slave in the fields or a slave in the office or a slave in the big house on the hill.

983
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:30,140
You're still a slave and at best a middle management slave prodding and whipping and abusing those beneath you in a desperate fervor,

984
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:34,720
praying that you will suddenly find yourself a part of that inner circle.

985
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,600
Believe me,

986
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,420
you will be dead long before you get close to that inner circle.

987
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:45,720
And you will be replaced the very next day by yet another well groomed,

988
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,940
well oiled,

989
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:47,500
eager,

990
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,600
well meaning,

991
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,500
brown nosing slave.

992
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,400
This year's model.

993
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,560
Recently,

994
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,640
we observed the imploding of communism in Eastern Europe.

995
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,440
Now,

996
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,900
what do you think brought all that about?

997
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:09,100
Was it because the communist system was flawed and doomed to collapse from its very inception?

998
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,800
No,

999
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:12,800
I don't think so.

1000
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,940
I think it was because of the ineffective,

1001
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:16,920
greedy,

1002
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,080
myopic,

1003
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:23,040
and insensitive bureaucrats who were charged with the responsibility of keeping the machine running.

1004
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:25,980
Interesting parallel,

1005
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:26,580
don't you think?

1006
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,100
They're not all that different from the ineffective,

1007
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:30,920
greedy,

1008
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:31,820
myopic,

1009
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,960
and insensitive bureaucrats charged with the responsibility of keeping our machine running.

1010
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,900
But rather than choose to evict them,

1011
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,920
as was the case at the time,

1012
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,160
in Russia,

1013
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,940
all too often,

1014
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,340
we choose to emulate them,

1015
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,500
to ape their postures,

1016
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,220
their uniforms,

1017
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,780
their speech patterns and phraseology.

1018
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,440
But remember what I said.

1019
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:59,800
George Bush and his rich friends do not need you in their country club.

1020
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,020
Stop acting like you're next on the docket,

1021
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,380
because you aren't.

1022
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,940
Stop acting like everything is all right,

1023
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,580
because it isn't.

1024
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,500
Nothing is all right.

1025
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,640
And if you can look around you at the state of this country,

1026
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:18,420
and not secretly admit to yourself that our system is just as vulnerable as theirs,

1027
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,280
and that their dominoes just happen to fall first,

1028
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,860
then either you're truly one of George Bush's rich friends,

1029
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,780
or else you're truly ignorant.

1030
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:35,240
It's the top 3% who really call the shots in this corporate fiefdom we lovingly sing to in all of those patriotic songs.

1031
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,620
If you're fortunate enough to be working right now,

1032
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,520
remember,

1033
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,940
you're working at least three of those days

1034
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:45,220
to pay off your accrued interest charges,

1035
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,440
and to help fund a government

1036
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,720
that can't even help you feel safe

1037
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:53,160
as you stand in line to cash what's left of your paycheck.

1038
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,300
That 3% at the top,

1039
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,160
the real inner circle,

1040
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,380
is bleeding you dry.

1041
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,940
It's bleeding this country dry,

1042
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,900
not to mention what's left of this planet.

1043
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:09,500
And as we trip over each other,

1044
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,240
in our rush to emulate our leaders,

1045
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,420
we wallow, like pigs,

1046
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,860
in the waste of our abundance,

1047
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,720
oblivious to our inevitable slaughter.

1048
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,400
And why do we continue to do this?

1049
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,300
Why do we continue to remain on this treadmill to oblivion?

1050
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,040
Why can't we learn from our collective histories?

1051
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,820
I don't know.

1052
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,580
I can't answer that.

1053
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,380
Freedom without structure is anarchy.

1054
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,360
Structure without freedom is fascism.

1055
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:48,860
What are you?

1056
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,540
An anarchist?

1057
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,800
Or a fascist?

1058
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,800
You cannot afford the initiation fee

1059
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,040
to George Bush's country club.

1060
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:01,980
Remember,

1061
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,560
capitalism is not a game of chess.

1062
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:05,560


1063
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:05,560


1064
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:05,560


1065
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,220
It's not democracy.

1066
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,520
Convenience is not freedom.

1067
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:15,600
And the government is not your friend.
