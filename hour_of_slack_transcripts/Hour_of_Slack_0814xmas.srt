1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
The Stone Genius

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,120
Our

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,700
One

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,380
The Stone Genius

5
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,720
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,200
Just like the ones I used to know

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,120
Where the treetops glisten

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,000
And kiddies

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,600
listen to you hear

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,840
sleigh bells in the snow

11
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,580
I'm dreaming

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,940
of a white

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,960
Christmas

14
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,160
With every Christmas

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,920
I pray

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,260
May your days

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,780
be merry

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,080
and

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,080
rosy

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,420
with me

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,580
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

22
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:19,580
Just like the ones I used to know

23
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,440
May your days be merry

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,280
and rosy

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,820
with me

26
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,400
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,400


28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,400


29
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,400


30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,100
Just like the ones I used to know

31
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:36,200
May your days be merry

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,220
and rosy

33
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,220


34
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,540
Just like the ones I used to know

36
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,080
May your days be merry

37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,080


38
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,040
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

39
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,920
Just like the ones I used to know

40
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,940
May your days be merry

41
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,080
and rosy

42
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,460
With other humans

43
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,380
down attic

44
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:11,480
with others

45
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:11,480


46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,920
May your days

47
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,920
be merry

48
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,900
and rosy

49
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:22,900


50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,580
Oh, Christmas is just a day.

51
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,920
It's a frame of mind.

52
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,800
And that's what's been changing.

53
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,420
Yes, my friends.

54
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,940
An amazing collage there.

55
00:03:49,940 --> 00:04:00,240
White Christmas by Corporal Blossom from the CD called A Mutated Christmas from the Illegal Art label.

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:08,280
And I'll be playing tons more sound being measured in tons, tons of that more.

57
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,500
And I will give their address.

58
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,700
But you can also check out www.tryagemusic.com.

59
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,340
Tryagemusic.com.

60
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:26,340
It says on their PR of this collection, a bad trip Christmas song collages.

61
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:35,740
And boy, that describes these next three hours of slack that we'll be enjoying over the coming weeks because we've got so much sick Christmas music.

62
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,780
But now it is time to go back and drink out of the Christmas trough.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,800
Oh, look, Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

64
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,180
Oh, he's like a cowboy Santa.

65
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,780
How jolly.

66
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,680
Oh, Jazz is giving, gives Dave the show pills.

67
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,440
Boy, I really need one of those.

68
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,400
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit though?

69
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,660
I need the show bath.

70
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,820
The show de-lousing.

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,220
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.

72
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
That's enough of that.

73
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,400
Oh, he's got headphones now.

74
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,660
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.

75
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,320
It's been increased in size.

76
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,680
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.

77
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,720
Look, it's swelling.

78
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,860
I actually have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.

79
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,360
Come on.

80
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,320
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

81
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,220
Yeah.

82
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,320
Oh, those pills.

83
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,000
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

84
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,260
More pills.

85
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,180
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied crystals.

86
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,760
I'm shocked by the...

87
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,100
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
The red pills are really good.

89
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,320
I like to take the red pill.

90
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,320


91
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,320


92
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,120
The red one and the blue one.

93
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,500
Yes, the red one and the blue one.

94
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,880
At the same time.

95
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,000
That way you go in and out.

96
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,860
The warp mixes.

97
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,220
Up and down.

98
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,140
It's so high, you can't go over it.

99
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,400
You can't go over it.

100
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,220
You can't go over it.

101
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,100
You can't go over it.

102
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:48,300
Up and down.

103
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,080
You get to break up.

104
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,800
I didn't mean to only...

105
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,700
You can

106
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:10,080
Well, we're off to bed, daddy.

107
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,540
No fighting.

108
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,700
Nothing.

109
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,020
Which is wonderful.

110
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,400
Thank you, old man.

111
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,280


112
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,980
Ooooooooooooooooh!

113
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,060
Ooooooooooooh!

114
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,920
In excelsis Deo!

115
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,260
Ooooooooooooh!

116
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,940
Ooooooooooooh!

117
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,160
In excelsis Deo!

118
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,260
Ooooooooooooh!

119
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,880
Here's Grubbot!

120
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,700
A robot you can program to perform eight different functions!

121
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,540
Upsy Baby.

122
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,340
Upsy Baby.

123
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,400
The doll that stands up.

124
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,320
She's new.

125
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,400
From Kenner.

126
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,580
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

127
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,520
We must buy our toys.

128
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,040
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

129
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,820
It will empower us to resist us.

130
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:17,560
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.

131
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:24,500
It will be a barber for kids.

132
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,100
Do you understand and accept?

133
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,020
For the usual plus expenses.

134
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:33,880
Good.

135
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,160
Okay, I think the girls will have the star.

136
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,680
A rainbow.

137
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,500
Rainbow pipes.

138
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,040
And for the boy.

139
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,140
A little tiny transformer.

140
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,820
Robots will change into dollar bills and back again.

141
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:49,720
Yes.

142
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:59,500
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

143
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,940
Good has lots of muscles.

144
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,360
Good.

145
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,160
Good.

146
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,140
The primitive earth societies should exist.

147
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,120
Except this value judgment.

148
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,940
Good will have pre-physical attributes according to human desires.

149
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,720
Sexual desires.

150
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,340
Latent in children.

151
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,500
Brought out.

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,340
Through the vehicle of this so-called.

153
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,700
So far we're told these boys have church batteries now included.

154
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
Uh, yes.

155
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,380
Uh, the old subgenius toy marketing scheme recorded there at Dockstock 1984.

156
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,620
And me and Palmer VDs.

157
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,840
Um, angels we have heard on high.

158
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,120
It was by the Philistines.

159
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:02,320
Uh, the collage called all the money you've got is from the great obtuse Christmas collage

160
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,940
album, which you can get for free.

161
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,940
Get this.

162
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,080
Um, check out this website.

163
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,140

Obtuse.i-u-m-a.com.

165
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,880
That's ob- excuse me.

166
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,200
Some of these subgeniuses.

167
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,720
That's um, obtuse.i-u-m-a.com.

168
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,420
Free the obtuse thing.

169
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,560
And uh, before that, uh, jingle bells from the Mill Valley taters.

170
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,300
Uh, uh, oh, and this background music is a Christmas gas.

171
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,820
14 blasted holiday carols.

172
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,060
With Slim Spinkter.

173
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,400
Now his name is not spelled S-pink-tor.

174
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,020
But spinkter.

175
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:55,860
www.slimspinkter.com has, or you can write to slim at slim spinkter, but that's S-p-i-n-c-t-e-r.

176
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,020
Slim spinkter.com.

177
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,500
Ah, yes.

178
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,220
And next up, the real story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

179
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,300
Oh, yes.

180
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,300


181
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,800
Oh, yes.

182
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:37,620
Old Solar and Time

183
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,920
Trousers

184
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,620
Santa's Little Helper

185
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,120
And that's the real story of Christmas.

186
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,080
Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, a lot of people don't know this, but Lonesome Cowboy Dave was the original Mr. Jingling.

187
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,460
That was so long ago, Chaz. That was another life and that was another lifestyle.

188
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,420
I lived then with a very, very, very dear friend of mine still to this day.

189
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,600
Lovely Mr. Horace Joris Nobomont.

190
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,920
I was the inventor of the Betsy Wetsy doll.

191
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,500
Those were the days, weren't they?

192
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,240
I don't know. The sun never came up, but we still called them days.

193
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,220
That was a beautiful house.

194
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,880
We were feisty people then. The glass was always half full and we were always happy.

195
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:30,460
Wasn't that when you originally met Bob was when you were the original Mr. Jingling and you were hanging out down in the Greenwich Village?

196
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,000
Everything had tassels that year. I think it was 1953.

197
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,680
That's true. What bar did you run into him at? Was it Santa Claus?

198
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,060
You?

199
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,720
I think it was Bob.

200
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,480
We were looking for records at Bleaker Bob's one day and I was wearing the tutu.

201
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,420
And he recognized me as Swingin' Sam, also better known as Mr. Jingling here in Cleveland Town.

202
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,900
He could tell by my little elf tassels and the fact that I had the cute little arms.

203
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,720
How did that paternity suit ever turn out between Dobbs and Santa?

204
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,920
And who?

205
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,000
His dad.

206
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,080
Santa Dog.

207
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,880
I don't know.

208
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,700
I don't think it was Santa.

209
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,680
But St. Nicholas. This is fact.

210
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,780
St. Nicholas.

211
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:07,780


212
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,840
St. Nicholas punched another bishop in the nose and bloodied his nose.

213
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,480
And sucked him.

214
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,140
Really? The historical St. Nicholas?

215
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,140
Over the Trinity of God.

216
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,180
The original St. Nicholas in Turkey?

217
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,300
Who the hell is God?

218
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,960
Who the hell is God?

219
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,680
Who the hell is God?

220
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,620
Ask Dobbs one day.

221
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,440
That's the question we should be asking.

222
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,280
Suddenly, a lightning bolt struck from nowhere on that bright sunny day.

223
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,040
Bob did a backflip and from that day on, he too was a believer.

224
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,160
And from the snowdrift truck, a little child bearing flowers emerged.

225
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,500
And Chip, Chip, what else was on the TV bill with St. Nicholas?

226
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,020
Sip, sickened.

227
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:06,220
The historical Santa Claus is originally lived, as the caller knows,

228
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,640
as a bishop.

229
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,180
And the

230
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,560
fake beard and a CIA Wall Street credit card.

231
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,180
A saint he was, the girl said.

232
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,620
St. Nicholas.

233
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,660
Who invented the CIA.

234
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,800
That's good.

235
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,280
You got it, brother.

236
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,240
He snuck into people's houses through the chimney.

237
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,380
You got it, brother.

238
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,880
They knew when they were sleeping.

239
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,780
They knew when they were awake.

240
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,580
You got it, brother.

241
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,380
But like the CIA, he was protecting them.

242
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:50,780
That's Foucault, baby.

243
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,240
Foucault knew that St. Nick was a creeping, stinking spy.

244
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:55,760
What?

245
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,280
He knows when you've been sleeping.

246
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,840
He knows what you've been eating.

247
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,720
Hey, man, my kids still believe in St. Nicholas.

248
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,760
And who keeps that belief alive in their fevered, sick little brain?

249
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,780
Madison Avenue, of course.

250
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:07,780


251
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:07,780


252
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,840
No, the surveillance community.

253
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,480
And Disney.

254
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,540
Under your direction.

255
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,440
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.

256
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,640
Miller Bear.

257
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,500
He's a very powerful being.

258
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,140
If you're bad, he punishes you.

259
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,900
If you're good, he rewards you.

260
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,440
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus walking the earth.

261
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,360
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is.

262
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,040
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling when they're awake.

263
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,960
I think really if you want to make a deal, you have to do it with, you know...

264
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Could Dr. Claus in fact be the wandering, quote, milkman?

265
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,780
Rumor has it that he's the one who's the most dangerous person in the world.

266
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,480
Rumor to have fathered our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

267
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,980
Well, we find it a very likely possibility from the falsified documents we have here.

268
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,780
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet.

269
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,340
And the sperm count with the glowing red nose.

270
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,700
What could this mean?

271
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,820
Often, Bob's early girlfriends had to actually shave his feet, especially when he was...

272
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:05,060
Listen, if you're going to say Indians had to have flying saucers out in Minneapolis 15,000 years ago...

273
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,420
...and my dam got it...

274
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,360
It was for sure the beard, the fake beard.

275
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,840
And I want one of them new robots with the real intestinal bacteria.

276
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,280
Yeah, what about...

277
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,940
And one of those robots with a fish brain for a brain.

278
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,060
They're sold out.

279
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,360
And a new pony boy to scrub my sink.

280
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,600
Toys R Us has no more.

281
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:23,940
And whole peas.

282
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,720
Pat's got a pointer on the shelves.

283
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,620
Big player of the show.

284
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,280
Air teas.

285
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,140
Can't get them from Amazon.com.

286
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,500
Air teas.

287
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,820
Can't get them anywhere in time.

288
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,540
Hair rot's not boring.

289
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,620
I say.

290
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,520
Son of a...

291
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,700
Too late for Christmas.

292
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,580
Cause there's too many hair knots out there and...

293
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,760
Son of a...

294
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:47,400
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

295
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,560
Have yourself a merry little sysmus.

296
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,880
Have yoursel-

297
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Oh merry little hasmus.

298
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,040
Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

299
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,000
Have yourself a merry little

300
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,100
Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

301
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,180
Have yourself a merry little Christmas

302
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:21,960
Have yourself a merry little Christmas

303
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,400
Let your side be light

304
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:36,280
From the water triples with the outer sky

305
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,340
Have yourself a merry little Christmas

306
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:50,980
From the water miles away

307
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,140
From the water miles away

308
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,920
Once a day as in olden

309
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,280
Happy golden day

310
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,920
Miles of earth

311
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,160
Let your heart

312
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,860
Be out of sight

313
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,400
Out of sight

314
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,200
The Jackson 5

315
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,600
One wish

316
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,120
And all the rest

317
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,640
Everybody

318
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,900
Merry Christmas

319
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,840
Merry Christmas

320
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,860
And a good new year

321
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,460
Miles away

322
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,340
Have yourself

323
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,940
A merry little Christmas

324
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,540
Now

325
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,700
.

326
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,080
Through the years

327
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,360
We all will be together

328
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,800
If the fates allow

329
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,100
If the fates allow

330
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,100


331
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,100


332
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:31,540
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough

333
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:44,020
And have yourself a merry little Christmas

334
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,580
To me

335
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,160
To me

336
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,740
From Mutated Christmas, friends.

337
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,280
Have yourself a merry little Christmas by No-L.

338
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,080
No-L.

339
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,800
No-L.

340
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,320
Before that, some year-old ESO and Michael Shelley did that real story of Christmas

341
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:37,020
from the Tarkin Records All-Star Holiday Extravaganza.

342
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,140
I'm playing a lot from that.

343
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:44,120
So check out www.triage.com for that one also.

344
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,480
The Tarkin Records is also on www.triage.com.

345
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,920
And now, the Jethro's.

346
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,760
Here we go.

347
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,800
Go.

348
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:56,920
Go.

349
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,520
Go.

350
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,280
Go.

351
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,740
Go.

352
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,420
Go.

353
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:11,700
Go.

354
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,020
Go.

355
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,220
Go.

356
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:12,780
Go.

357
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,340
Go.

358
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:13,660
Go.

359
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:13,940
Go.

360
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,580
Go.

361
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:14,900
Go.

362
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,240
Go.

363
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,240


364
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,240


365
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:15,900
Go.

366
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,820
Go.

367
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,120
Go.

368
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:17,380
Go.

369
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,760
Go.

370
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,040
Go.

371
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220
The Weirbobs and Ima,

372
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,260
those who have the psychosis that convinces them

373
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,720
that they are the Santa Bob.

374
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,600
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

375
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,240
And they go shuffling through the snow

376
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,880
on their nameless, hideous errands,

377
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,560
the grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus

378
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,360
and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

379
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,760
And they stop using the locks of their doors

380
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,500
and they just kind of float into the keyhole.

381
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,000
Oh, friends, it's tough.

382
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,880
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.

383
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,360
You've got to send your money to the Santa Bob.

384
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,260
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me

385
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,100
told their kids that Santa Claus bills them

386
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,520
for the toys he brings.

387
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,460
Can you believe that?

388
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,440
The kids were asking if their parents,

389
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,280
maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

390
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,000
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.

391
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,020
We can't afford that.

392
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,020
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

393
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,240
Yeah, but at least he tells us.

394
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,240


395
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,800
He quotes the note.

396
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,520
Every Christmas Eve, children nestled in their beds

397
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,340
dream of Santa and the presents they hope he...

398
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,500
Hey, wait a second.

399
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,860
That's no kid.

400
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,420
All right, everyone, use your sign wings.

401
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,580
Sign.

402
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,540
All right, let's start Santa's workshop.

403
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,300
Don't worry, we're almost there.

404
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,640
See, that's where Santa lives.

405
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,080
Oh, wow.

406
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,480
Jinx, Jinx.

407
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,920
Is that Santa Claus?

408
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,620
What's going on?

409
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,620
Jinx is psychically projecting his story into our minds.

410
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,420
Holy Psalmate Jesus.

411
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,420
Is that Santa Claus?

412
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,480
Merry Christmas, Santa Claus.

413
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,220
A season for miracles.

414
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,720
Merry Christmas.

415
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,140
Oh, thanks, Wappers.

416
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,920
Don't forget Santa Claus.

417
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,120
And Jinx, too.

418
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,860
Is that Santa Claus?

419
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,240
It's doing.

420
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,760
Looks like we're gonna have a white Christmas.

421
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,820
We've got to.

422
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,160
Advanced dogmatic studies, dear.

423
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:28,540
Dear friends, also known as electricelfatloop.com.

424
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,760
How the Jinx Stole Christmas.

425
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,900
From their collection, have yourself an advanced dogmatic Christmas.

426
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,600
That's advanced dogmatic studies.

427
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,420
Did I say studios?

428
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,000
At, well, you can email information about that.

429
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:50,000
The whole album, which is available, the advanced dogmatic Christmas album,

430
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,140
from electricelfatloop.com.

431
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,380
Oh well.

432
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:55,380


433
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:55,380


434
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:55,380


435
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:55,380


436
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:55,380


437
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:01,680
Get him out, I-I don't have gifts to give you.

438
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:14,040
What's bothering you?

439
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:31,420
And they told me a rum pum pum pum

440
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,380
And you are going to see the rum pum pum pum

441
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,780
I'll find it if we make the rum pum pum pum

442
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:49,640
This is something for you to call rum pum pum rum pum rum pum rum pum

443
00:26:49,640 --> 00:27:00,500
Rum pum pum pum

444
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,320
When we

445
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,560
Oh

446
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,640
Oh

447
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,760
Oh

448
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,740
Oh

449
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,420
Oh

450
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,080
Oh

451
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:30,900
Oh

452
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,040
Oh

453
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,360
Oh

454
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,200
Oh

455
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,640
Oh

456
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,060
Oh

457
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:35,880
Oh

458
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:35,880


459
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,140
Oh

460
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,280
Oh

461
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,360
Oh

462
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:36,420
Oh

463
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:36,820
Oh

464
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:36,840
Oh

465
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:36,860
Oh

466
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:36,880
Oh

467
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,080
Oh

468
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,100
Oh

469
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,120
Oh

470
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,140
Oh

471
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,160
Oh

472
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,340
That's fair to give our king a rock-a-bum-bum

473
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,720
Rock-a-bum-bum, rock-a-bum-bum, rock-a-bum-bum

474
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,700
Yeah, I'll play for you

475
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,380
Rock-a-bum-bum

476
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,020
For my drum

477
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,240
Baby, I'm a rock-a-bum-bum

478
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,100
Baby, I'm a rock-a-bum-bum

479
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:41,800
I play my drum for you

480
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,160
I play my drum for you

481
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,040
I play my drum for you

482
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,220
Oh, rock a-bum-bum, rock a-bum-bum

483
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:58,240
Oh, rock a-bum-bum, rock a-bum-bum, rock a-bum-bum

484
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,280
...

485
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:20,300
Baby smile, me and my child

486
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,360
Me and my child

487
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,800
Me and my child

488
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,320
Me and my child

489
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,740
And, uh, amazing.

490
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,900
More from Corporal Blossom.

491
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,560
I am really impressed by their editing work.

492
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,240
And that's on...

493
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,440
Corporal Blossom and the Mutated Christmas

494
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,520
is on the Illegal Art label.

00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,300

497
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,960
www.detritus.net slash Illegal Art.

498
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,600
And now, more Jethro!

499
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,740
Jethro!

500
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,180
Jethro!

501
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,240
Jethro!

502
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,620
Jethro!

503
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,480
Jethro!

504
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,340
Jethro!

505
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,040
Jethro!

506
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,000
Jethro!

507
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,960
Jethro!

508
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:00,660
Jethro!

509
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,240
And whose birth

510
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,060
do we celebrate with this new

511
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,540
century?

512
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,300
Who was nailed on that great

513
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,400
manger cradle?

514
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,340
But Satan Claus.

515
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,340
Oh my God.

516
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,320
Dang, come on.

517
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,620
Whose father, Paul Bunyan,

518
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,600
and whose mother, Big Sister,

519
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,480
Did they have Christmas

520
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,080
before there were malls?

521
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,680
created the conspiracy.

522
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,540
Before there were malls,

523
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,960
there was no such thing as Christmas?

524
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,340
Yes.

525
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:26,980
The Pilgrims for Babies?

526
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,460
There were, there was a

527
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,240
down-home Norman Rockwell-style

528
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,000
It's a Wonderful Life type of Christmas.

529
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,820
It was a, it was a, it was a

530
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,320
kite-flying Coca-Cola-drinking Christmas,

531
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,820
not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.

532
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,900
Rolling holy dough,

533
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,260
It was a,

534
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,740
when your little brother

535
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,720
broke through the hole,

536
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,240
it fell through a hole in the ice,

537
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,700
slid, and you went and saved him.

538
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,360
You didn't laugh at him

539
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,460
and huff some more glue.

540
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,600
It was a wonderful life back then.

541
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,420
Remember when Uncle Bud would come in

542
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,160
with the candles?

543
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,120
Like most people have

544
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,780
Christmas candles.

545
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,340
But today Christmas is lost its meaning.

546
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,800
He just beaten the crap out of us.

547
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,280
I mean, we're dancing.

548
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,000
Santa Claus could...

549
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,880
Strange lights appear in the skies

550
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,100
all over the world.

551
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,220
The wife of a carpenter

552
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,900
experiences virgin birth,

553
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,240
and a baby is born with a head

554
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,780
that glows like a fluorescent light.

555
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,960
Dare I ask it?

556
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,780
Yes.

557
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,740
Was the infant Jesus

558
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,500
neither man nor God,

559
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,020
but merely one of the countless aliens

560
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,100
that visit the earth each and every day?

561
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,480
The answer?

562
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,120
Yes, definitely.

563
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,980
Take that and shove it up the tube,

564
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,640
mark certainty,

565
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,160
in the fuzzy place

566
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,800
called the Twilight Zone.

567
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,220
Friends, try to imagine

568
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,920
that you're in the middle of the world.

569
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,680
Somewhere in the snowy north,

570
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,600
the Santaibob trudging mindlessly

571
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,780
through the Himalayan snows,

572
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,260
driven by strange forces

573
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,140
to complete his nameless errand.

574
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,860
And he may show up at your house, my friend,

575
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,100
if you've been a bad subgenius

576
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,960
or a halfway subgenius,

577
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,200
or if we keep getting tangled up

578
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,220
in these other shows

579
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,680
and having strange microphones.

580
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,140
Oh, shit, this is a situation.

581
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,720
Down in the workshop

582
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,640
All the elves were making toys

583
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,520
For the good Gentile girls

584
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,640
And the good Gentile boys

585
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,720
When the boss busted in

586
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,680
Nearly scared him half to death

587
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,880
Had a rifle in his hands

588
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,720
And cheap whiskey on his breath

589
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,820
From his beard to his boots

590
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,940
He was covered with ammo

591
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,680
Like a big fat drunk

592
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,120
Disgruntled Yuletide Rambo

593
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,800
And he smiled as he said

594
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,860
With a twinkle in his eye

595
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,820
Merry Christmas to all

596
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,900
Now you're all gonna die!

597
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,220
The night Santa went crazy

598
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,760
The night Saint Nick went insane

599
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,760
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal

600
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,780
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

601
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,880
Well, the workshop is gone now

602
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,500
He decided to vomit

603
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,660
Everywhere you'll find pieces

604
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,800
Of Cupid and Comet

605
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,960
And he tied up his helpers

606
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,740
And he held the elves hostage

607
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,840
And he ground up poor Rudolph

608
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,540
Into reindeer sausage

609
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,760
He got Dancer and Prancer

610
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,760
With an old German Luger

611
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,620
And he slashed up Dasher

612
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,820
Just like Freddy Krueger

613
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,880
And he picked up a flamethrower

614
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,500
And he barbecued Blitzen

615
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,380
And he took a big bite

616
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,480
And said it tastes just like chicken

617
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,800
The night Santa went crazy

618
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,480
The night Kris Kringle went nuts

619
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,720
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole

620
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,160
Without stepping in reindeer guts

621
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,740
There's a national crime

622
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,620
Guarded in the FBI

623
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,760
There's a van from the eye

624
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,860
Wind is loose

625
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,720
And helicopters circling round in the sky

626
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,660
And the bullets are flying

627
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,840
The body counts rising

628
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,440
And everyone's dying to know

629
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,300
Who's Santa why?

630
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,440
My, my, my, my, my, my

631
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,420
You used to be such a jolly guy

632
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,720
But now you're a little more funny

633
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,420
Yes, Virginia

634
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,620
Now Santa's doing time

635
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,680
In a federal prison

636
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,500
For his infamous crime

637
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,040
Hey little friend now

638
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,640
Don't you cry no more tears

639
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,840
He'll be out with good behavior

640
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
In seven hundred more years

641
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,840
But now Mason's in therapy

642
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,820
And Donna's still nervous

643
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,660
And the elves all got jobs

644
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,940
Working for the postal service

645
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,460
And they say Mrs. Clark

646
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,580
She's on the phone every night

647
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,820
With her lawyer negotiating

648
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,460
The movie rights they're talking about

649
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,920
The night Santa went crazy

650
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,540
The night Saint Nicholas slipped

651
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,740
Broke his back for some milk and cookies

652
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,080
Sounds to me like he was

653
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,460
Tired of getting chipped

654
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,540
The night Santa went crazy

655
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,060
The night Saint Nick went insane

656
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,600
Realize he's been getting the wrong deal

657
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,960
Some finally must have snapped in his brain

658
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,740
Whoa, oh

659
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,880
Some finally must have snapped in his brain

660
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,500
Tell ya

661
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,060
Some finally must have snapped

662
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,780
In his brain

663
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,820
You better watch out

664
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,060
You better not cry

665
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,440
You better not pout

666
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,840
I'm telling you why

667
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,900
Santa Claus is coming to town

668
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,100
He's making a list

669
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,180
He's checking it twice

670
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,600
He's going to find out

671
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,640
Whose body we're knighting

672
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,400
Santa Claus is coming to town

673
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,440
He knows when you're sleeping

674
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,640
He knows when you're awake

675
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,500
He knows when you've been found

676
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,560
For good

677
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,480
For the good

678
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,740
For goodness sake

679
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,560
You better watch out

680
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,920
You better not cry

681
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,320
You better not pout

682
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,420
I'm telling you why

683
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,880
Santa Claus is coming to town

684
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,320
Santa Claus is coming to town

685
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,520
Santa Claus is coming to town

686
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,340
Santa Claus is coming to town

687
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,740
Santa Claus is coming to town

688
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,980
and you better not wet your pants

689
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,200
Isn't Santa Claus a good name?

690
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,460
Santa Claus is coming to town

691
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:18,780
I say be a good boy

692
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,960
But no, you'd better be safe

693
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:19,960


694
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:30,440
Santa Claus is coming to town

695
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:36,120
You better not cry

696
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:47,160
Jingle, jangle, jingle, we're on a sleigh ride to heck

697
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:53,400
Santa and his reindeer are really wicked

698
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:01,140
Wrapped in wrapping paper, we're gonna break our necks

699
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:07,900
Got a rocket in my pocket on a sleigh ride to heck

700
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,360
Sleigh ride to heck

701
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,840
The elves are full of cheer, the kids are tucked in bed

702
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,400
What?

703
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,500
Santa!

704
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,720
Ain't coming, we're on a sleigh ride to heck

705
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,880
Their dreams are filled with toys, but they're out of luck

706
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,560
Cause Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to fuck

707
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,160
Sleigh ride to heck

708
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,880
Sleigh ride to heck

709
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,000
Sleigh ride to

710
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
Heck

711
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,100
Thank you.

712
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,500
Sleigh ride to heck.

713
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,180
Svenue ride to heck.

714
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,040
Sleigh ride to heck.

715
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,700
Almost time for the bank.

716
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,360
Sleigh ride to heck.

717
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,080
Sleigh ride to heck.

718
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,940
Sleigh ride to heck.

719
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,560
And we will all

720
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:38,540
And we will all go down together, and we will all go down together.

721
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:07,760
And we will all go down

722
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,920
town

723
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,840
Hey crime, they're trying to compromise humanity

724
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,140
Death crime

725
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,000
Maniacal fitness

726
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,160
Some genius not intent

727
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,120
Annihilistic fate

728
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,100
We're heading to hell, thank

729
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,180
Our holy sin, we're made

730
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,800
No time to repent

731
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,280
Sleep hate

732
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,280
We're heading to a salvation

733
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,140
Sleep hate

734
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,360
We're creeping hell

735
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,420
Sleep hate

736
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,500
We're talking to damnation

737
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,220
Sleep hate

738
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,320
We're walking to hell

739
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,720
Sex life is in the past

740
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,780
Our harlech heaven here at last

741
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,740
Immortal firms for us to bear

742
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,680
Stop genius and affair

743
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,400
Best of fighters lose

744
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,960
Work, tribulation and true sex hurts

745
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,880
You've all been taken through

746
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,480
Fallen hands on pleasure

747
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:37,860
No

748
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,040
Sleep hate

749
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,260
We're heading to a salvation

750
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,440
Sleep hate

751
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,300
We're creeping hell

752
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,420
Sleep hate

753
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,500
We're talking to damnation

754
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,220
Sleep hate

755
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,340
We're walking to hell

756
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,780
Transcend into next plane

757
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,720
Higher goals to attain

758
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,740
As God you've left we have

759
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,880
Behind super universe

760
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:09,880
Unwind!

761
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,900
Attempt the stations

762
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,540
Trail of earthly temptations

763
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,220
Over and over, there's a key

764
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,180
Assure, fire and guarantee

765
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,220
Once you've proven your worth

766
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,120
You'll begin the rebirth

767
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,140
To the super universe

768
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,220
In which you will immerse

769
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,320
Sleep hate

770
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,000
Sleep hate

771
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,580
Sleep hate

772
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,600
Sleep hate

773
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,240
Now you're here to turn back

774
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,400
This is where your past is slack

775
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,280
Nothing left to hide

776
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,200
Now you're on the inside

777
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,280
Welcome to the fat head

778
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,160
And the curse that's straight ahead

779
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,360
All the things unsigned

780
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,220
Bring it to the punchline

781
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,080
Sleep hate

782
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,280
We're heading to a salvation

783
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,420
Sleep hate

784
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,340
We're creeping hell

785
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,420
Sleep hate

786
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,480
We're talking to damnation

787
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,580
Sleep hate

788
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,160
We're walking to hell

789
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,780
Sleep hate

790
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,260
We're heading to a salvation

791
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,280
Sleep hate

792
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,320
We're creeping hell

793
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,400
Sleep hate

794
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,120
We're talking to damnation

795
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,300
Sleep hate

796
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,140
We're walking to hell

797
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,560
We're going to heaven

798
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:51,960
We're talking to the inside

799
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,820
When the city is Superman

800
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:53,820


801
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:53,820


802
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:53,820


803
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:53,820


804
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,180
Sleep hate

805
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,080
Sleep hate

806
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,220
Sleep hate

807
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,940
Sleep hate

808
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:00,140
Sleep hate

809
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,380
Sleep hate

810
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,040
Sleep hate

utor

812
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:16,380
The mutants must appear The mutants must arrive

813
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:26,740
The saucers will fly And the darlings will die

814
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,960
The mutants will leave And fill our space

815
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,060
The doors will carry

816
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,020
The mutants will fly And the darlings will die

817
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:09,360
The mutants will leave And fill our space

00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,160
The

819
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:32,920
Oh, scary man. Totally scary. Scary Broke Fran with his new nameless album and nameless song

820
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,640
about

821
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:41,300
the well I call it Gary's X Day song. Before that Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket with

822
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:49,200
Welcome to Hell from their CD by the same name which you can get from www.minitru.org.

823
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:59,740
Minitru has no E in it. It's M-I-N-I-T-R-U dot org. The Slay Ride to Heck of course was

824
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:04,020
the great James Kochalka from his new album and album. I'm going to have to say that it's

825
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:04,020


826
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:15,360
a great song. And that's also on www.tryedgemusic.com or Indie World with a Y. IndieWorld.com slash

827
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:25,380
Kochalka with a bunch of K's. Oh and the Jethro's friends here's their address 212 and a half

828
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:32,040
Miller Avenue. This is the Jethro's 212 and a half. This is a strange number 212 and a

829
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,000
half Miller Avenue. Who's that? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I

830
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,040
don't know. I don't know who admittedly treated me like this I'm doing. This is weird.

831
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,380
Well you just flow the mind of a cow trying to do on it's own, son?

832
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:39,900
I'd be so Fallout under 13 years of marriage my 청set in a

833
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,780
liver And I just wanna have another of these

834
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,040
books. I just wanna have another one. Myani Boat Works and my düşünces

835
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,040
such as all of them tellxy-Ouch. Just because R revealed that they think we were

836
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,220
part AA Myani did On and on. And R gave me the

837
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,540
really cool time in week and everybody made an ud 건�chen keks pick up a $62 million

838
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:54,540


839
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:54,720
god is out right there. And then you think you are Cut Deck or something. And

840
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:02,640
the music brand Neel is in town with his Rarmed Threatété.lied Klu-ón

841
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:09,740
And at the very bitter end, after the rants, shall be Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh, a silent knight.

842
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,780
Oh, thank you, Slim Spincter.

843
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,380
After all these friendly calls, I got one call from somebody who said,

844
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,800
what are y'all, the usual thing, the usual question, what are y'all trying to do?

845
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,900
And I go, we're trying to give you some slack, okay?

846
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,220
You know, they go, who's Bob?

847
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,940
I said, well, give me your address and I'll send you some information or whatever, you know.

848
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,400
I'll give the number at the end of the broadcast.

849
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:47,800
And this person, you know, I knew there was something that they weren't saying.

850
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:53,060
And finally, he goes, well, I just hope that, it was something like,

851
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:57,500
I just hope that, you know, you can get right with Jesus or something like that.

852
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,060
And just hung up. He hung up. That was the key point.

853
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,440
He said he didn't want to hear what I had to say back about that because,

854
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,200
you know, see, a subgenius has so much faith

855
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,260
that he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob,

856
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,940
stomping on a picture of Bob, he'll do it himself.

857
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,360
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

858
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,060
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

859
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,720
Now, we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,

860
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,220
but we subgeni may be bad,

861
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,780
but our relationship,

862
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:35,840
our way of bad is holy, is holy compared to the evil of so,

863
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,640
not all, by any means, but so many American fundamentalists,

864
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,940
charismatics, evangelicals, et cetera, in general.

865
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:49,500
Of course, they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, et cetera,

866
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:53,620
if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.

867
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,700
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about.

868
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,480
I, we're, Jesus and Bob.

869
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,660
Like we say, our old drinking buddies got nothing against Jesus.

870
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,580
It's just his fan club.

871
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,840
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.

872
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,300
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief, just like you or me.

873
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:18,360
But the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief.

874
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,480
Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect.

875
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,260
He doesn't even sneeze.

876
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,260
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us,

877
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:30,580
and we have to go in the secret room, the bathroom.

878
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,800
To do awful things.

879
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,360
But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.

880
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,220
Oh, and he's male.

881
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:42,900
But he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do.

882
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,700
Because we sin.

883
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,100
Oh, yeah, we all sin.

884
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,040
We're bad.

885
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,900
We're worthless.

886
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,800
We're no good to God unless we sign a contract with his agent.

887
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:57,160
Well, friend, Jesus himself, he spouted just about as many great punchlines as Bob.

888
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:57,860
Probably more.

889
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,560
But, and this is true, this is historical fact.

890
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:09,060
The very early mainstream Christian church methodically censored about half of the existing gospels about Jesus.

891
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:18,300
And this, I'm not kidding, you can go to any real bookstore and pick up the censored gospels that they finally found years later.

892
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:24,780
They took out the parts where Jesus specifically said that every person had equal access to the Lord,

893
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:28,320
and that you didn't need no preacher between you and him.

894
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:32,380
That, in fact, was probably his main point, now lost in antiquity,

895
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:37,640
that you were the son or daughter of God just as much as Jesus was.

896
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,140
Or Bob, see?

897
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:42,540
But that's too humanistic for the conspiracy Christians,

898
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,440
so they wiped out the subgenius Gnostic Christians.

899
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,660
Anyway, I'm going to get off my soapbox.

900
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:55,600
We'll get into the hideous theological discussions coming up next week as we attack the Bobbies.

901
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,000
We interrupt this program for a special.

902
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,140
Promotional announcement.

903
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,280
Returns.

904
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,960
E-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

905
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,360
And you young people, listen to me today.

906
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,980
Quit playing games with Christmas trees.

907
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,900
Silent night

908
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,880
Holy night

909
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:26,540
All

910
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,160
is calm

911
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,480
All

912
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,140
is bright

913
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,640
Round

914
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,340
young virgins

915
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,980
Tender

916
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,480
and mild

917
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,340
Holy

918
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,200

919
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,960

920
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,660

921
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,020
Sleep

922
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:57,180
Sleep
