1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,560
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,200
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,580
The Subgenius Hour of Squash!

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,640
Yes, we're back, back, back, back, back, back, dear friends.

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,580
Where am I? Where am I?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,460
Oh, what a day, what a night, what a week, what a month.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,500
Let me adjust my little levels here, you know, we're, uh...

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,280
Working in a void, a void, dear friends.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,280
It's such a delightful void.

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,820
Listen to that, that's, um, the Flying Ryan Brothers in the background.

11
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,780
Well, that's cheery music, that's good, I need some cheery music.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,140
Don't worry, I'm not about to complain, although...

13
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,440
Well, I can't, because my mouth is full of Novocaine, dear friends.

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:15,580
It's true, I busted a tooth last night, and I just thought two hours ago had the dentist give me a new tooth,

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:23,820
and that required pumping my jawbone full of Novocaine, and on my left side, I don't know if I'm drooling or not.

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,980
And I feel like I must look like the Elephant Man on that side.

17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,280
Uh...

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,380
Uh, yes, yes, it's been a...

20
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,420
Hey, well, wait, before we go on, let's just go on here.

21
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,240
Oh, girls, they're flashing lights in all of the...

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,620
Let's see what the boys in the other town do.

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:43,940
Uh, let me ask you...

24
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,520
There's a minotaur who lights his face on fire constantly.

25
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,460
Yeah, I saw that minotaur.

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,260
Oh, did you ever see a movie called Jack the Giant Killer?

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:50,660
Yeah.

28
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,320
John, I've seen that.

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:51,900
Oh, I just watched that.

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,140
When I was a kid, I loved it.

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,480
What did you think of it?

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,880
Well, I'll ask you this, was it a musical?

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,600
No.

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:01:59,960
No?

35
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,220
No.

36
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,000
Then you've seen an unpolluted version of it, because that movie was bought by a character

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,560
named Moose Charlap.

38
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,440
And Moose changed it into a musical by pixelating the characters, making them jerk back and

39
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,760
forth, and apparently sing songs that he wrote and sang.

40
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,160
It is one of the most bizarre things you ever saw in your life.

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,920
Friends, I have to cut in, in the midst of my Novocaine-induced mumbling.

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,800
Dr. Howell there on the KPFA show is in fact expound...

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,540
Talking whatever, about...

44
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,360
A movie called Jack the Giant Killer.

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,600
I doubt if most of you have even seen it.

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,260
If you ever get a chance to, it is so, so brain damaged.

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,140
It's unbelievable.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,420
Bouncy, boingy-boingy style.

49
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,940
So that's the most interesting contemporary thing about Jack the Giant Killer.

51
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,280
Well, this was Ray Harryhausen's first movie.

52
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,280
It has nothing to do with Ray Harryhausen.

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,480
Oh, really?

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,440
How could that be?

55
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,740
Well, when Ray Harryhausen was making the seventh voyage of Sinbad toward the end of

56
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:08,420
the 1950s, he took the idea to producer Edward Small and offered the entire concept to Edward

57
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:08,420


58
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,080
I think the Purins made that movie at some point.

59
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,120
But Small turned it down, and so Harryhausen went back to Charles Schneer, who produced

60
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,680
the seventh voyage of Sinbad, which grossed highly at the box office.

61
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,160
So Edward Small decided to make Jack the Giant Killer a blatant rip-off of the seventh voyage

62
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,560
of Sinbad.

63
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:34,540
They even measured the Cyclops' steps, the walk cycle, and made their giant Cormoran walk

64
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,780
exactly the same way.

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,600
Well, I'm very surprised to find out that Harryhausen wasn't involved in that.

66
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,500
Not at all.

67
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,920
It's a imitation of Harryhausen.

68
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,120
Wow.

69
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,980
The best answer.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,580
The geekiness of the subgeniuses.

71
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:54,100
I actually know, not only do I know every detail of that obscure movie story that they're

72
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,760
talking about.

73
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,560
But I've handled it.

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,540
I've done it.

75
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,120
I've handled the Cormoran model, the original stop-motion model.

76
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,880
A tattered up, beat up, horrible looking little thing made by the young Jim Danforth.

77
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,140
It ended up in Dallas, that model did.

78
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,540
I used to be a stop-motion animator myself, inspired by the great Ray Harryhausen.

79
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:22,360
Up until recently when I heard Ray, right after Jurassic Park came out at a sci-fi convention,

80
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,240
my hero, my erstwhile hero, Ray Harryhausen, was heard to say,

81
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Well, those dinosaurs in Jurassic Park are just not as good as what we used to do back

82
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,200
in the days of King Kong and the Lost World.

83
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,080
Anyone can push buttons on a computer.

84
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,180
Well, friends, guess what?

85
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,200
I would much rather be working on my computer animation projects and 3D animation right

86
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,100
now than I would doing this show.

87
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,220
And if you knew what, could see what was inside my computer, you'd agree with me.

88
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,400
But, but, but we will nonetheless continue, friends.

89
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,280
A mouthful of mush and all.

90
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:12,260
Friends, we have been, you know, you would think I would have tons and tons of tape to play.

91
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,700
We have been traveling.

92
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,680
I'm sorry that we had to do reruns last week.

93
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,540
I wish I would love to do a rerun this week, actually.

94
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,240
We went to Rutgers University, did a D Bible there.

95
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,220
We went to Atlanta.

96
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:33,140
And it had the most amazing, it was a wonderful D Bible starring Sister Susie the floozy and

97
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,540
Dr. Legume and Papa Joe Mama and a really cool band and myself.

98
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,560
And you know what, friends?

99
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,620
I don't have a bit of tape of any of those shows.

100
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,700
Other people do, but not old Reverend Stang, no sir.

101
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,700
No sir.

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,660
Atlanta has always been a challenge.

103
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,200
For some reason in that city, it is very hard to record a program.

104
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,920
I didn't know much about it.

105
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:09,040
I's Б, you know, guide told me it is C but bad enough.

106
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,040


107
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,280
So, what can you do to the doctor businesses around town, and I just try not to have much

108
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,280


109
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,420
I really love Maslow's Voicing letterbox.

110
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:10,420


111
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:10,580
your health to find information.

112
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:10,580


113
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:10,580


114
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,260
I don't know what they're worries.

115
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,080
I have this.

116
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,680
This year, I was thinking over it, and they weren't very happy with it, dieses mobile

117
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,360
channel.

118
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,500
I love that, theони.

119
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:21,780
They re-lins TEDacement.

120
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,780
Is somebody like you possible, call me Cron?

121
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,440
The only place that has restraints big enough to hold him.

122
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,040
He's a very, very large dog.

123
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,980
And he gets very riled up if anybody messes with his hideous, diseased, lupus-ridden nose.

124
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,700
Ah, yes, dear friends.

125
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,020
But what else was I going to bitch and gripe about?

126
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,580
I don't know.

127
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,420
I don't know.

128
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,140
A couple of shows back, I was bitching and griping, wasn't I?

129
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,800
About the bobbies and such like.

130
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,020
I was griping about the endless.

131
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,800
No problems.

132
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,620
But you know what?

133
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:03,080
My friends, I've solved all of my problems with the bobby squabbling and all of that.

134
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,580
You know what I did?

135
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,440
I forgave them.

136
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,320
Just forgave them, friends.

137
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,320
Just decided to forgive everybody.

138
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,200
Forgave myself.

139
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,480
Forgave Jane Dobbs.

140
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,680
Forgave, that's Bob's mom.

141
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
I forgave, I forgave everybody.

142
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,240
I forgave John Benet Ramsey.

143
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,280
I did not forgive her parents, though.

144
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,760
Friends, I've...

145
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,460
I'm not going to tell you a bad thing that we did.

146
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,020
When in Atlanta, Sister Susie the floozy, well, she happened to know where the unmarked grave

147
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,180
of the little murdered child, John Benet Ramsey, was there in Atlanta.

148
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,460
And we went there, friends.

149
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,560
Jesus and Susie and I went to the grave of the murdered child.

150
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,480
And there were toys and letters there.

151
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,340
And we did a real bad thing, folks.

152
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,540
We did a real bad thing.

153
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,920
And when I get the tape of the Atlanta revival, then I can reveal to you the bad, bad thing

154
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,060
that we did at the grave of John Benet Ramsey.

155
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,160
I'm not proud.

156
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,480
I'm not proud of what I did.

157
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,140
And I'm not happy at all with the way the sound is on this setup.

158
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:24,240
But my headphones, if I loaned my headphones to somebody and they got wrecked and now I'm

159
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,020
on bad headphones.

160
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,120
One of my mixing devices just died.

161
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,500
And the volunteers that said so much stopped at that point.

162
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,740
And I should stop at that point and see if I can move on to find some other piece of tape.

163
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,400
When somebody else's show...

164
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,920
Okay, enough.

165
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,580
Enough.

166
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,520
Friends, I'm sorry.

167
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm really losing it.

168
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,860
I'm having to...

169
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,520
I need help.

170
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,220
I need...

171
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,060
I need physical help.

172
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,260
You know, maybe I ought to just do a Gene Scott.

173
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,320
What would Gene Scott do at a time like this?

174
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:11,260
He'd say, well, I guess you Bob believers just ain't believing in Bob like you used to, huh?

175
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,800
I guess you're just going to let me sit here.

176
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,460
I ain't hearing that phone ring.

177
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,740
And actually, it's true, friends.

178
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,920
We ain't been hearing the phone ring.

179
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,440
We haven't heard anybody call 1-888-669-2323.

180
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,000
We haven't...

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:35,400
You all haven't been emailing slack at subgenius.com or staying at subgenius.com, for that matter, to order.

182
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,280
Y'all just...

183
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,780
Y'all just...

184
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,200
I don't know.

185
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,800
I'm just going to...

186
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,540
I give up.

187
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,300
I'm just going to go back in time and let an...

188
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,640
I am going to just do reruns.

189
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,500
Hell, I've had it.

190
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,780
I've had it.

191
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,640
What do y'all care anyway?

192
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,240
There's no sense of possessiveness...

193
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,500
There will be a better world.

194
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,000
...in that...

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,360
...no zone of the saucers.

196
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,960
Time ceases to exist.

197
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,220
Or at least it feels that way.

198
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,400
And you don't need to be grasping anymore like you did on Earth.

199
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,860
The overwhelming feeling that you get on the escape vessels is like,

200
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,100
wow, the best part is it lasts as long as I want it to,

201
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,540
and I can take forever.

202
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,200
I'm immortal for now.

203
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,680
And I don't have the urge to grab this and keep it

204
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,220
so I can run somewhere else to grab some other thing.

205
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,980
I don't have to kill or defeat another monster.

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,560
I don't have to be a monkey man to hang on to these big round soft things.

207
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,100
I'll have plenty of time to get to those other big soft round things.

208
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,960
More than I could ever use.

209
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,440
My pipe overfloweth,

210
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,660
and the big round soft things shall follow me through the land of Dobbs,

211
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,500
and I will dwell in the cleft in between forever.

212
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,040
It's like, oh, how are your multiple partners today, dear?

213
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,040
Oh?

214
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,980
Big and random?

215
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,440
Round and soft?

216
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,980
Ah, yes.

217
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,840
And there's, but people ask so many questions.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,920
I say, well, Reverend Stang, is there just one giant saucer,

219
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,560
or is it a bunch of regional saucers, you know,

220
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,660
like an East Coast saucer and a West Coast saucer?

221
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,320
No, there's a million kinds of saucers, friends,

222
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,900
but it's like virtual reality.

223
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,340
So once you're inside one of them, you might as well be in all of them.

224
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,740
You might as well be on Planet X.

225
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,380
You're not in normal space.

226
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,960
You can sort of phase to the other side.

227
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,220
You can go to other saucers or find your friends telepathically.

228
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,720
And go, oh, I think I'll go to the Chinese saucer today,

229
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,400
or I'll go to the gay and lesbian saucer.

230
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,820
Gee, I always wanted to try being a lesbian female.

231
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,360
But meanwhile, those who are left behind,

232
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,740
which is 99% of the population and probably 90% of the subgeniuses,

233
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,940
all those who didn't sin, they're $20.

234
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,600
They'll miss out on X Day.

235
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,440
You know, come to think of it, I never sinned.

236
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,660
Technically, I mean, I've spent a lot of my own money on the church,

237
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,020
but I never sent my $20 in for a membership.

238
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,400
Dr. Drummond never did.

239
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,780
Palmer Vredes never did.

240
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,240
Puzzling Evidence never did.

241
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,400
Sterno never did.

242
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,780
And, you know, friends, it won't matter what you did for Bob.

243
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,760
What'll matter is whether you sent that for that membership card.

244
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,160
I guess I'm going to have to get around to that.

245
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
Well, I got plenty of time, plenty of time till X Day.

246
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,740
Oh, hell, that's 1998.

247
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,300
We got all the time in the world.

248
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,220
There will be one big escape vessel just for the doctors, for the hierarchy.

249
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,220
And I can just see Byron and Gordon and some of those other people up there going,

250
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,880
hey, you know, we ought to go down and save Ivan and Philo

251
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,240
and all those who never got around to sending the $20.

252
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,400
And then they'll go, well, we'll get around to it.

253
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,940
Heh, heh, heh.

254
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,340
We're not sure where the escape vessels of the sex goddesses go,

255
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:52,420


256
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:52,940
dear friends.

257
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,180
As far as I can tell, they probably just fly around.

258
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
But I'm going to go, I'm going to get off of this for right now.

259
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,180
We'll go to an old hymn.

260
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,060
This is a lovely old subgen...

261
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,080
And I do mean old.

262
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,000
This is like from 1981.

263
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Old subgenius hymn by someone we only know as Doug No. 4.

264
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,440
Oh, yes.

265
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,280
Oh, yes.

266
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,620
Oh, yes.

267
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,700
Oh, yes.

268
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,640
Oh, yes.

269
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,240
Oh, yes.

270
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,700
Oh, yes.

271
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:22,700


272
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:22,700


273
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:22,700


274
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,520
Young will die for caw.

275
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,540
I want to die in a holy hole and thrive.

276
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,840
The bank boys and the normals.

277
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:38,480
If we have to, if we have to, probably make them die,

278
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:46,320
and we'll all come back older men, we'll all come back older men,

279
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,920
and we'll all come back older men,

280
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,220
old older men.

281
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,780
The reason why.

282
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,020
See, we've got another key.

283
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,380
Praise Bob.

284
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,300
Kill me, Bob.

285
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,420
I want to buy from Bob.

286
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,460
I want to buy and ask the holy war fulfilled.

287
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,740
The pink boys and the corn boys.

288
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,600
They went, they went.

289
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,480
We can make them buy.

290
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,000
And we'll all come back home.

291
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,860
And we'll all come out over men.

292
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,480
If we don't come out over men, there ain't no reason why.

293
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:39,280
All times, gizms, they will fall beneath our laser blades.

294
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,700
And we'll all come back home.

295
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,020
And we'll all come back home.

296
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,940
And we'll all come back home.

297
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,880
But we'll all come back home.

298
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
And we'll all come back home.

299
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,840
And we'll all come back home.

300
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,900
But, well, he's not going to lack for royalties, dear friends.

301
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,760
Because he'll be on those saucers.

302
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,720
And I hope, I hope that you will, too.

303
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,720
I hope you'll join us there on that lovely day.

304
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:40,100
And to make sure that, let's go through some of these things to double check just before X Day.

305
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,380
There'll be more of this in our upcoming book, Revelation X.

306
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,940
This is where a lot of these notes are coming from, by the way, friends.

307
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,460
From a research session between myself and my wife.

308
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,860
And Dr. G. Gordon Gordon in conference with that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

309
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,960
Yes, sort of a teleconference that we were on.

310
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,120
Praise this modern day technology.

311
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,480
That way we didn't have to be in the same room with Bob.

312
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,440
Don't you see?

313
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:17,720
But anyway, I mean, you don't want to miss your chance to be on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses on X Day.

314
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,660
You don't want to end up down on Earth being fried.

315
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,700
You don't want to be on the same planet as the other sex goddesses.

316
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:26,700


317
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:26,700


318
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:26,700


319
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,200
Now, you never know.

320
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,460
X Day might come early.

321
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,260
So keep it with you.

322
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,940
Subgeniuses often lose those in the wash.

323
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,900
We get a lot of mail from people saying that.

324
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,680
I washed my membership card.

325
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,480
Can I have another one?

326
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,200
And you don't want that to happen just before X Day, friends.

327
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:47,360
So if you're members who have lost their cards, but who are paid up and on the master disk of souls,

328
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,820
because we can tell.

329
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,980
You can't fool us.

330
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,840
We'll give you a free replacement card from the Dallas headquarters anytime, free of charge,

331
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,240
just by sending your self-addressed stamped envelope.

332
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,440
This is members only.

333
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,840
To Bob.

334
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,640
And we'll be giving that post office box number soon in the broadcast.

335
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,140
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214 is what I'll be telling you.

336
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,960
But, ah, X Day.

337
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,160
You know, on X Day, for those down below on Earth,

338
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,420
you know, it'll be a little different than it would be up in the escape.

339
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,980
Vessels of the sex goddesses.

340
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,380
They'll look up trying to put while they're trying to put their clothes out.

341
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:37,960
There'll be this huge eyeball in the sky, this giant pyramid shaped light form with a big eye that just covers the whole sky.

342
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,480
And it's filming for the escape vessel screens.

343
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,120
Oh, yes.

344
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,700
When we can watch what's going on down there, we can watch any part of it we want.

345
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,960
And we can also leave messages because it.

346
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:57,520
The big eye projects sort of billboards, holographic billboards from horizon to horizon that say things like.

347
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,360
Smile.

348
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,940
You know, welcome to your stupid life.

349
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:09,160
You're being seen live on the escape vessels of the sex goddess screens where the subgeniuses are now partying.

350
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,760
You dumb idiots.

351
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,860
I mean, a big billboard stretching all across the planet in all languages saying fools.

352
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,540
We're having a great time.

353
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,620
And the subgeniuses can take turns broadcasting personal statements.

354
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:31,540
So, you know, this horrible pink evil person will be down there fighting the Robeast.

355
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,000
And suddenly there's this voice will ring out.

356
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,360
Hey, Mrs. Darden, I was in your 1959 fifth grade class.

357
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,180
Remember me?

358
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,620
Steve Wilcox.

359
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:41,920
Ha ha.

360
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,680
I'm up here.

361
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,340
You're down there.

362
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,780
Or like pain radio coming to you, Mr. Shaughnessy, the principal.

363
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,260
Remember when you expelled?

364
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,840
How do you like the pain?

365
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,960
And, you know, you get back at anybody.

366
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,760
Oh, you laughed at me in junior high, Max.

367
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,280
You put me upside down into a trash can.

368
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,660
You and your jock friends.

369
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,840
You aren't laughing quite so hard now, are you?

370
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,500
And there'll be little holographic ghost-like things.

371
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,880
Green slime type ghost sort of things.

372
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,760
Millions of little 3D Janers flying around taunting and saying you should have spent your $20.

373
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,400
You should have spent.

374
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,080
You're $20.

375
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, friends.

376
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,000
Friends.

377
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,580
Oh, praise Bob.

378
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,440
Praise Bob.

379
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,020
Praise Bob.

380
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,580
It's going to be so.

381
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,620
But, you know, and so we find that the world isn't really to be destroyed.

382
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,440
It's that the humans, what happens is the humans are given all this alien technology

383
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,380
and they screw everything up.

384
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,140
They've got a miracle machine there, this mom thing that could do anything they want,

385
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,320
but nobody pays any attention to it at first because they don't know what its capabilities are.

386
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,300
And it's real cautious about revealing itself too fast.

387
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:59,300
And they don't know that this fungus that's growing around them could fulfill their wildest desires

388
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,600
because they don't believe it can, because they don't have any wild desires,

389
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,240
because they didn't think to ask.

390
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:16,220
And people will be down there in the ruins begging us with their last potato to preach and deliver unto them the word of Dobbs

391
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,100
because it's the only thing that'll save them.

392
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:26,680
And subgenius artifacts like old copies of the book of the subgenius or illegal bootleg tapes of this radio show,

393
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:33,340
original pamphlet number ones, even an old Dobbs head, it'll be worth a boxcar full of canned peaches, friends,

394
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:39,320
because the luck shell, the luck shell that we've always claimed was around our various products

395
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,440
that you thought we were only kidding about, and that's real.

396
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:48,900
And it will become visible on X day, a glow that's visible even in daylight.

397
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,300
Any day.

398
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,180
Any given page of the printed word of Bob will be not only of practical use as lamps in the dark,

399
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,580
but more importantly, they'll be unthinkably valuable religious treasures, dear friends,

400
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,380
the most valuable things on the whole planet.

401
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,920
Because you're safer if you have that, if you've got a copy of the show with you.

402
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,540
It tips your luck playing.

403
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:18,760
It helps a whole lot against radiation and landslides and brain worms and noise demons and nerve runners

404
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,440
and all that.

405
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,280
It isn't nearly like having a membership card, but it's a lot better than having nothing.

406
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,800
Because friends, your faith, your faith in Bob will be all you have left on that day.

407
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,820
And he'll know whether you believed in him.

408
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,240
Wotan will know.

409
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,300
And he will come.

410
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,280
He will come to judge.

411
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,020
The X in the room.

412
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,640
The X in the room.

413
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:48,740
The X in the room.

414
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:48,740


415
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:48,740


416
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:56,680
Have landed, Earth's under their control.

417
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,400
Dobbs vision, sky's proven.

418
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,340
The city's radioactive holes.

419
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,880
We don't know what they're gaming.

420
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,880
But their name is unpronounceable.

421
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,400
We don't know what they came for.

422
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,060
But what they aim for is impossible.

423
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,540
But despair not, we beings.

424
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,320
In the second year before the millennium of the day of God,

425
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,620
come Wednesday, as in the twinkling,

426
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,580
of night, they will come among the Yarkatism,

427
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,920
which are like unto thy great white brothers.

428
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,760
They come as men, as grave and impetuous,

429
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,860
as a whirlwind and as a cloud,

430
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,940
and they are now the heavens, let it go.

431
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:09,720
The extras have landed, their machines,

432
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,160
following our tracks.

433
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:13,780
Yes.

434
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:14,880
Yes.

435
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:15,580
Yes.

436
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:15,860
Yes.

437
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:15,860


438
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,300
Then we're on the moon,

439
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,440
and thewrite,

440
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,220
glaring.

441
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,920
Everyone,

442
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:30,560
birds幡

443
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,620

445

The Thuoken

446
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,880
LIzos

447
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:34,880


448
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
O O

449
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,260
20th

450
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,860
27th

451
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,260
Destruction! Nuclear Armageddon! All-out war!

452
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,820
Now, most beings, they're afraid of what they see.

453
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,160
Oh, no, we might get hurt, they say.

454
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,180
Damn right! And that's the beauty of it.

455
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,120
Not only are they going to get hurt, they're going to get killed.

456
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,900
Each and every one of them.

457
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,300
They're going to be slimming in their own blood.

458
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,160
Now, what about the subgenies, you say?

459
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,640
Well, we're all in this together now, you say.

460
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,820
Right? Wrong!

461
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,720
We've got a lifeguard, someone to toss us a lifesaver.

462
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,540
That life preserver is none other than J.R. Bob Dobbs.

463
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,880
And the rope that connects us to his salvation is slack.

464
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,620
The only way you're going to be able to reach Bob Dobbs and stay afloat

465
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,500
is to have enough slack on your lifeline.

466
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,060
Now, friends, what does it take to have enough slack?

467
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,400
For one thing, you should always remember who you are working for.

468
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,780
Now, the pinks, they think they're going to retire for the conspiracy,

469
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,740
and the conspiracy is going to protect them.

470
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,380
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

471
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,920
Oh, they have a rude awakening in store for them now, don't they?

472
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,580
Yes.

473
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,980
It will begin as a small conflict, a police action, if you will.

474
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,660
Then it will expand and grow and engulf the Persian Gulf.

475
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,020
Next you'll know they'll be knocking at your door and ringing on your telephone.

476
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,240
Guess who gets an all-expense-paid trip to the Mediterranean?

477
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,840
They don't call it Club Med for nothing.

478
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,280
The Med stands for medical, because that's where you're going to wind up.

479
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,920
But the real fun doesn't even start until the bombs start going off in your very own neighborhood.

480
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,840
Oh, sure, at first it'll only be a local terrorist or two,

481
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,660
so it won't be as if you're being blown to bits by strangers.

482
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,000
But then again, what difference does it make when you're flying through air with the greatest of ease, eh?

483
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,000
Besides, it's only a matter of time before it begins to rain bombs from the heavens.

484
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,540
You won't be able to step outside without getting an instant flash burn.

485
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,880
What's that you say?

486
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,580
Everyone is on our side?

487
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,040
The world is united so no one would want to attack us?

488
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,420
Who said the bombs would be coming from anywhere on this world?

489
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,820
Friends, they'll be dropped from sub-orbits.

490
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:49,060
From intergalactic sanitation and sterilization ships dispatched from our good old friends up yonder on Planet 10.

491
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,960
They'll watch until the pinks are pretty well pooped from killing each other.

492
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,020
And then they'll come on down and mop up.

493
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,880
The killdozers and amphibious land shark ships will sweep across the countryside with typical efficiency.

494
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,720
They'll round up the pinks like cattle.

495
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,060
Death will take a holiday.

496
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,700
The lucky ones will die quick.

497
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,420
The unlucky ones will die slow.

498
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,240
And the moron majority won't die at all.

499
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,800
They'll be put in plastic bags and freeze-dried for convenient interplanetary self-surgery.

500
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:13,760
They'll be put in plastic bags and freeze-dried for convenient interplanetary self-surgery.

501
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,580
Oh, don't you believe the conspiracy lies that pinks don't taste good?

502
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:17,940
Oh, don't you believe the conspiracy lies that pinks don't taste good?

503
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,900
They may not have good taste, but they damn sure taste good!

504
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,740
This is just a plain and simple fact you must take on faith.

505
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:23,920
This is just a plain and simple fact you must take on faith.

506
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,100
For even Bob Dobbs does not suggest that you eat pinks before X-Day.

507
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,280
For even Bob Dobbs does not suggest that you eat pinks before X-Day.

508
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,060
Lick pinks, now that's alright, but eat them taboo!

509
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,080
They're a dessert to be savored, to be saved.

510
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:42,800
They're a dessert to be savored, to be saved.

511
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,660
I only think that a pink can't be freeze-dried.

512
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,980
And then thaw back to life.

513
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,240
But you're wrong.

514
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,280
Her talking about a conspiracy technology there folks.

515
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,400
but we're talking about the same brains

516
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,500
but we're talking about the same brains that can go traveling through light years

517
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,540
and instantaneous folding of space!

518
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,800
Do you think the minds that contain the wisdom of the universe

519
00:26:59,800 --> 00:26:59,960
Do you think the minds that contain the wisdom of the universe

520
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,300
Would allow the pinks to escape life with nothing more

521
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,360
Having nothing more than a FREEZE BURN?

522
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,800
Why, That only measures 265 candles on the agony scale.

523
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,840
Why, That only measures 265 candles on the agony scale.

524
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,520
Getting sliced to death by paper cuts earns less candles than that.

525
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:11,600
Getting sliced to death by paper cuts earns less candles than that.

526
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,660
done to you, you're willing to send them off with a mere million paper cuts? Have you no human

527
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:24,480
dignity? Have you at long last surrendered all semblance of common decency? Bob said, do unto

528
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,120
them as they have done unto you. So anything short of the glass rod ramming routine is fair game.

529
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,700
Then again, nah. Don't let anybody say the subgenius don't have a little compassion here

530
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:41,280
and there. So where does this leave us today, dear friends? It radiates new hope amongst the dark and

531
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,800
dreary horizon, while some whine and whimper about the possible loss of a few million lives,

532
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:52,880
hither tither and yon. We celebrate, for bubblical prophecy is coming to fruition.

533
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:00,080
At long last, the exes will come forth to wreak Bob's revenge. For lo, these many years of yearning,

534
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:05,900
burning, and churning amongst the pseudo-syllable substance some say sucks. Let my people go.

535
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,720
Swing low, sweet chariots of fire. They're coming to take us away, huh?

536
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:19,440
Yea, the indus nigh. So eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow they die. Praise Bob, amen.

537
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:26,020
Oh, praise Bob. Praise Bob. What a beautiful, beautiful thing. That was Father Joe Mama,

538
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,620
also known as Papa Joe Mama. We call him that sometimes. And before that, of course,

539
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,840
the redoubtable Pastor Butt Naked, Butt Naked and the Jaybirds, doing that classic

540
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,000
subgenius song, The Way It Should Be Done.

541
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,920
The exes have landed. Ah, yes. And while I'm thinking about show,

542
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,020
if anybody out there got a copy, a good stereo copy of this show,

543
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,540
particularly somebody who lives, like, in Arlington, give us a call up here at the station.

544
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,260
And, uh, because we'll probably, there's probably two or three people in there.

545
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:06,680
I guess we must have gotten a good stereo copy of that show somehow or another.

546
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,380
Friends, sorry to have to do reruns like this.

547
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,220
Number one, this stuff is really classic. That was a great rant by Father Joe Mama.

548
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,540
The other, the other thing is, friends, it's true that I do have hundreds of new tapes,

549
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,560
hundreds of new tapes that you haven't heard and I haven't heard, because they're all 90 minutes long.

550
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:36,380
And I have tried to listen to some of them while I was, you know, in between all the menial crap I have to do.

551
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,260
But, man, it's like there's, if there's 10 minutes of crud at the end of the show, it's like,

552
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,620
I can't, I can't, I just don't have time to edit this stuff anymore.

553
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,820
I don't have time to listen to all of your tune-ups, friends.

554
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,520
And I don't have time to listen to your pledge drive stuff for your local station.

555
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,120
I really want to be playing more hour, more original material on Hour of Slack,

556
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,980
but you aren't making it easy on me, man.

557
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,100
Um, and, and, and, oh, oh.

558
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,240
But, but I'm going to do, the side two of show will just be, I'm just going to start grabbing tapes.

559
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,160
I do have a hundred new tapes. I'm just going to start grabbing them.

560
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,140
I'm going to stick them in.

561
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,480
Paranoid yet? No?

562
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,440
Well, let me ask you this.

563
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,240
What do the American Communist Party, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Universal Church of the Subgenius have in common?

564
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,800
Government funding again, Dr. Void?

565
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,380
Hell no, stupid.

566
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,900
The conspiracy has learned its lesson about the funding part, and they don't waste any money on the church.

567
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,300
The informers.

568
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,240
The Church of the Subgenius.

569
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,100
The Church of the Subgenius is packed to the gills with government informers.

570
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,960
Think about it for a minute.

571
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,600
Hell, think about it for an hour.

572
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,620
Most so-called subgeniuses are loners.

573
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,460
Rebellious, maladjusted, antisocial, subversive, loners.

574
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,000
They do not join organizations because of their basic antisocial orientation.

575
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,840
No organization that is, except the Universal Church of the Subgenius.

576
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,360
All of us who would have fallen through the cracks of the conspiracy,

577
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:17,180
monitoring apparatus, all of you anti-American way, anti-conspiracy, rebel loners,

578
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,180
have been found and put on the list.

579
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:26,120
Hell, you put yourselves on the list when you first rode into Dallas for the free information about the church.

580
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,900
Ha! You thought then that you'd found something free,

581
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:34,380
even though you know damn good and well that this country is ruled by the conspiracy,

582
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,160
and under the conspiracy's rule, nothing, and I mean nothing, is for free.

583
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,500
You have paid and are still paying the price for your free information.

584
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,220
If you paid your $30 for a membership, then you're on the A-list, alright,

585
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,660
but not the A-list for any stupid pleasure ships or sex goddesses,

586
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:59,360
but the smaller list, the boiled down list of hardcore malcontents

587
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,200
who will be watched all the more for having become ministers.

588
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,040
What does the conspiracy value above all else? Money!

589
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,340
By sacrificing some of your money, you can get your money back.

590
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:10,340


591
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:10,340


592
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,060
By sacrificing your hard-earned money, you have proven to the conspiracy

593
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,460
that you are a greater threat than even those who merely rode in to ask about the church.

594
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:23,520
In this way, the conspiracy even gets you to identify yourself as the enemy they must identify,

595
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,280
categorize, and destroy.

596
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,540
The beauty of this is that you even help finance their infiltration efforts

597
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,120
instead of them supporting the church and its informers.

598
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,700
It's a self-financing operation.

599
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,680
But wait.

600
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,340
Am I accusing Reverend Stang of being a traitor?

601
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:40,340


602
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,300
Of being a government conspiracy agent?

603
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,800
A lying rat for the normal human forces of evil?

604
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,240
Of course not. He's not that smart.

605
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,340
But who is that smart?

606
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,120
Who's behind it?

607
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,300
Philo Drummond. Overman, first degree.

608
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,560
Why do you think Dr. Philo never rants,

609
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,900
never appears at devivals as a speaker,

610
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,480
but instead pretends to front a rock band called the Swinging Love Corpses

611
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,340
even though he can't sing, or even sing?

612
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,740
Or play an instrument worth a bucket of warm spit?

613
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,660
It's the perfect cover.

614
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,660
This way he can always be hanging around without incurring suspicion,

615
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,040
with Stang as his lightning rod frontman to attract all the attention.

616
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,200
Reverend Stang is actually FBI Special Agent Philo Drummond's dupe,

617
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,560
with the mission of locating and registering all you individualist rebels,

618
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,760
while Drummond looks over his shoulder at that ever-growing list.

619
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,840
Think about it.

620
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,180
It was Drummond who talked Stang into going on the internet in the first place,

621
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,880
even though Stang didn't want to in the beginning.

622
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,620
Drummond wants us all on the net,

623
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,460
so we can all be watched more effectively and easily.

624
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,780
He's even got Stang saying stupid things like,

625
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,780
the internet is the last lawless frontier of communication.

626
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:05,960
What a laugh. What a dirty, ironic laugh.

627
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,700
On the cover of USA Today just last week,

628
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,120
the conspiracy boasted that they busted over 40 child porno buyers,

629
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,400
by doing what?

630
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,400
Monitoring the net!

631
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,320
There are conspiracy law enforcement creeps crawling all over the internet,

632
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,780
watching everything you post there.

633
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,120
They maintain the illusion of freedom on it,

634
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:33,320
in order to encourage you to reveal yourself and your activities and plans.

635
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,500
They couldn't have found you by conventional investigation,

636
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,820
so they've gotten you to register yourself for it.

637
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,080
Why do you think I'm not on the net?

638
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,680
Because I know the free speech on the net crap is a lie.

639
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,560
A lie that Reverend Stang has been foolish enough to fall for.

640
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,180
Who knows, the poor sap probably has a Frankenstein computer god control microchip

641
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,900
planted right in his cerebrum and doesn't even know it himself.

642
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,320
And Philo, good old overman first degree Philo,

643
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,080
sits quietly in the shadows and chuckles at your blind stupidity.

644
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,620
He's got Stang urging you all to get on the internet and write to the church

645
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,660
and talk about what kind of anti-conspiracy scams you're cooking up

646
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,100
right there in the open for all to see and hear.

647
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,040
Tell you what, try posting something truly illegal on the internet,

648
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,780
like those kiddie porn people did, and see how fast they bust your ass.

649
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,500
The Church of the Subgenius is a conspiracy front,

650
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,660
and I for one am not afraid to say so.

651
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,880
If you're underground now and want to stay that way,

652
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,580
you'd better tear up all that church literature, change your name,

653
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,740
move with no forwarding address, and pay cash for everything you buy.

654
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:52,520
Even if you do all that, they are likely to find you, but maybe they won't.

655
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,320
Meanwhile, I am now announcing the formation of a new church,

656
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,120
a new religion for the unhappy, the unruly, and the untamed.

657
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:07,140
I'm calling it the Universal Church of the Not-Quite-So-Damn-Stupid.

658
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,740
But how can you know that you can trust me?

659
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,820
How can you be sure that I'm not an agent of the conspiracy

660
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:21,680
seeking to undermine your precious church of rebellion and sin of sarcasm?

661
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,500
I'll tell you how.

662
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,640
I don't want your freakin' name.

663
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,880
There's nothing to write in for, no place to write to to contact me,

664
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,800
and get your name, made-up church name or your real one, on any list.

665
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,320
I don't want to know who you are,

666
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,460
because I don't want the conspiracy to find out from me somehow

667
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,120
who you are or where you live.

668
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,640
I'd probably hate you if I knew you anyway,

669
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,000
if you're just another subgenius dumbass.

670
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,620
All I ask is that you tune into this show and get the truth,

671
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,060
the real, unvarnished, untraceable to you truth

672
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,920
about the conspiracy and their army of informers.

673
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,300
This show is the last real voice of freedom in this country,

674
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,120
and you can trust me.

675
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,920
Because I don't want to know who you are,

676
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,600
and the agents of the conspiracy will never know who you are.

677
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,200
What the hell? What are you idiots doing in here?

678
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,340
Can't you see I'm doing my show?

679
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,420
Get the hell out of my damn studio, you piece of crap!

680
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,020
Oh my God! No! No!

681
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,540
Turn off that microphone.

682
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,260
You really... Oh, God.

683
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,540
Eh, Reverend Dr. Nolan Void.

684
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,620
Uh...

685
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,980
Oh, man.

686
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,900
Oh, what a...

687
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,600
What a...

688
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,340
Really, man?

689
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,220
Who you gonna trust?

690
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,980
Well, one thing you...

691
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:56,080
One thing that you know we're serious about here at the Church of the Subgenius,

692
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,700
at least the Dallas headquarters,

693
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,340
we're not lying about this.

694
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,180
We really do want your money.

695
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,780
Now, let's see how Jehovah Hates Fred's new album sounds.

696
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,200
So far, it seems to be completely blank.

697
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:18,160
Is there any slack out there?

698
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,240
Is there any slack out there?

699
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,780
Is there any slack out there?

700
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,140
Is there any slack out there?

701
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,100
Is there any slack out there?

702
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:52,340
Is there any slack out there?

703
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,880
Is there any slack...

704
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,680
Out there

705
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:11,200
Well, okay.

706
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,040
We know how the first song goes.

707
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,520
Oh, good.

708
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,820
They faded it out just in time, I think.

709
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,400
I hope.

710
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,340
Well, let's see.

711
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,760
Friends, you see why it is actually rather time-consuming

712
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,180
to put together a radio show.

713
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,980
And because I would have to listen to all of this noodling

714
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:38,060
in order to know that it was, in fact, noodling.

715
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,940
It's probably pretty good noodling for a bunch of amateurs.

716
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,060
It's St. Andrew and Pope Fred.

717
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,160
Andrew is the cute one, and Pope Fred is the one that everyone likes.

718
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,400
There's supposed to be a song about Connie on this.

719
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,260
Well, there's...

720
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,440
Connie, do you think that Bob is dead?

721
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,060
Connie, do you think that X-Day will come?

722
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,560
Ooh, ah

723
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,380
What's up, genius? Just be dumb

724
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,160
Hush now, Bobby, Bobby, don't you fear

725
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:54,420
The X's will come and they soon will be here

726
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,040
Bob Dobbs is coming

727
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,460
I promised you they would be here

728
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:05,040
You'll be up on the saucers at day

729
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,800
Bakes will all fry, but you will be safe

730
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,580
Just so long that you've proved that you've paid

731
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,560
Ooh, Bob

732
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,940
Ooh, Bob

733
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,940
Of course we will help find the car

734
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,420
Connie, do you think I'm good enough?

735
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,860
Ooh, Bob

736
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,260
Ooh, Bob

737
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,160
Ooh, Bob

738
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,160


739
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,160


740
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,160


741
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,160


742
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,680
Connie, do you think I should quit?

743
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:10,620
Ooh, Bob

744
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,620
Ooh, Bob

745
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,120
Conny, do you think I'm good enough?

746
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,360
Connie, do you think I should quit?

747
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,160
Ooh,Spider, who's there to get me?

748
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,360
Who's there to get me when I'm gone?

749
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,280
Ooh, Bob

750
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,000
Ooh, Bob

751
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,120
Oh, Bob, come at all

752
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,700
Hush now, Bobby, Bobby, don't you fear

753
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,680
The exes will come and they soon will be here

754
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,220
Bob Dobbs has promised you they would be here

755
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,720
You'll be upon the saucers at day

756
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,500
Things will all die but you will be saved

757
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:17,260
For so long that you've proved that you've paid

758
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:36,920
Oh, Bob, oh, Bob, oh, Bob

759
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,300
Of course there will be an ex day

760
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,000
Connie, did they have to break the pipe?

761
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,740
Oh, isn't that sweet?

762
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,740
Well, I'm glad I checked some of the new tapes that came in

763
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,220
Yeah, Jehovah hates Fred

764
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:08,020
They're St. Andrew making, like, Sting or Bono or somebody

765
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,640
Uh, well, hold it

766
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,720
Where's that feedback coming from?

767
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,840
Hold it, hold it, hold it

768
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,240
On we go, we're the wild and young

769
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,480
Crying high into the storm

770
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,260
Hamaker Schlemmer is selling a shelter

771
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,540
Worthy of Kublai Khan's Xanadu Dome

772
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,880
Hushy and swanky with poshanky-panky

773
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,900
That affluent jankies can really call home

774
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,140
Hamaker Schlemmer is selling a shelter

775
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,340
A push-button palace, fluorescent repose

776
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,500
Electric devices for facing a crisis

777
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,560
With frozen fruit ices and cinema shows

778
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,680
Hamaker Schlemmer is selling a shelter

779
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,240
Our chromium kitchens and rubber-tiled dorms

780
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,180
With waterproof portals to echo the chortles

781
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,400
Of weatherproof mortals in hydrogen storms

782
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,660
What a great come to glory in Portland

783
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,600
To enjoy a deluxe moratorium

784
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,240
Where nuclear heat can beguile the elite

785
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,480
In a creme de la creme crematorium

786
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,560
I've been to Nagasaki, Hiroshima too

787
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,740
The same I did to them, baby, I can do to you

788
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,320
Cause I'm a fujiyama mama

789
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,800
And I'm just about to blow my top

790
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,240
Fujiyama, yama, fujiyama

791
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,020
And when I start erupting

792
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,360
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop

793
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,540
I drink a quarter sacky

794
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,060
Smoke dynamite

795
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,680
I chase it with the backy

796
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,120
And then shoot out the light

797
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,660
Cause I'm a fujiyama mama

798
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,080
And I'm just about to blow my top

799
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,520
Fujiyama, yama, fujiyama

800
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,260
And when I start erupting

801
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,680
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop

802
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,980
Well, you can talk about me

803
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,420
Say that I'm mean

804
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,060
I'll blow your head off, baby

805
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,560
With nitro glycerin

806
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,120
Cause I'm a fujiyama mama

807
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,560
And I'm just about to blow my top

808
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,020
Fujiyama, yama, fujiyama

809
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,740
And when I start erupting

810
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,160
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop

811
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,180
Well, you can say I'm crazy

812
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:24,660
But I'm not crazy at all

813
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,780
So deaf and dumb

814
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,240
But I can cause destruction

815
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,920
Just like the atom bomb

816
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,460
Cause I'm a fujiyama mama

817
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,920
And I'm just about to blow my top

818
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,680
Fujiyama, yama, fujiyama

819
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,060
And when I start erupting

820
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,500
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop

821
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,920
I drink a quarter sacky

822
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,420
Smoke dynamite

823
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,060
I chase it with the backy

824
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,480
And then shoot out the light

825
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,040
Cause I'm a fujiyama mama

826
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,660
And I'm just about to blow my top

827
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,920
Fujiyama, yama, fujiyama

828
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,640
And when I start erupting

829
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,120
Ain't nobody gonna make me stop

830
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,320
The planet is pulling loose from its moorings

831
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,920
Careening into space

832
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,160
Spilling cities and mountains and seas

833
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,580
Into the void

834
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,220
Spinning faster and faster

835
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,500
Days and nights

836
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,680
Flash by like subway stations

837
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,220
Iron penis chimneys

838
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,340
Ejaculate blue sparks

839
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,360
In a reek of ozone

840
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,460
Tunnels crunch down

841
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,700
Teeth of concrete and steel

842
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,200
Platining cars like beer cans

843
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,380
Graffiti through glass and steel

844
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,340
Like acid races across the sky

845
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,460
And tornadoes of flaming

846
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,520
Repent

847
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,220
Quit your job

848
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,460
Slack off

849
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,500
Friends

850
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,200
The old pooperoo

851
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,860
The old fart was smart

852
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,200
The old Bill Burrows there

853
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,140
So much of that rant of his got played in the last few shows

854
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,100
I honestly can't remember what got played and what didn't

855
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,080
Running a little bit of this music and stuff

856
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,860
Has been from Suzy the Floozy's Apocalypse show

857
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,120
And I was just sitting here listening to that

858
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,440
And I thought that maybe I should say something about that

859
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,160
I know you may know me

860
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:27,520
And I think that I know that I'm not on the show

861
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:27,520


862
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:27,520


863
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,380
This is a very long time ago

864
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,360
You may have noticed that lately I haven't been

865
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,740
Preparing special rants for the show

866
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,980
And ranting them

867
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,400
And you get the impression that I'm like

868
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,940
Throwing this show together in two hours

869
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,500
At the last minute before we have to start dubbing them

870
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,180
And sending them out

871
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,300
And that's exactly right

872
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:49,000
And the truth of the matter is

873
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,400
Folks, I'm trying to learn how to delegate

874
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,360
I've been babysitting

875
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:54,420
I've been babysitting

876
00:48:54,420 --> 00:49:03,600
subgeniuses for the last almost 20 years and it's just about driven me nuts so I decided

877
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:11,020
among other things that I was just gonna quit gonna start delegate just if when people offer

878
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:23,820
to do things I would say okay and when they don't do them it's not my fault you know it's like I

879
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:33,720
delegated it if it ain't getting done well too bad and and actually I have been a very hard-working

880
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:40,880
preacher on but it's in an area that nobody is gonna it's like everything else I've ever tried

881
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,840
to do my whole life I was working for Bob nobody's gonna understand it until it's all done and then

882
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:53,500
when it's all done you'll all go oh man I was gonna do that but I watched TV instead so I

883
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:59,680
we are working on something but friends are so damn much stuff we're trying to do around here

884
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:09,180
we got X days coming up in what 412 days and our as of as of the day I'm talking from and there's

885
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:13,640
just I mean we've got the the internet stuff we've just mailed out a stark fist y'all should have

886
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:20,520
that by now any dues paying members we you know we're doing the mail order stuff we're doing the

887
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,280
we're working on a game with Steve Jackson

888
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:32,080
we're working on a whole lot of men I've got these well it's it's the 3d Bob man it's the

889
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:37,540
Antichrist we he we have the technology we're getting closer I merged him with a naked woman

890
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:44,300
last night last night I created a form I've been making a lot of little about every night I make

891
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:49,880
a couple of new homunculus Dobbs is I'm not the only one working on him I get the image like the

892
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,800
Prophet Jim sent has sent a couple of his attempts at the world's greatest and the world's greatest

893
00:50:53,820 --> 00:51:04,920
the image map texture mapping it's tricky it's real hard but if we can get if we can master a false

894
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:16,740
Dobbs in virtual space I mean that's it we what we can if we give him enough personality we can

895
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:23,800
just release him he'll be the virus we can I'll be able to retire I'll actually be able to retire

896
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:23,800


897
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,980
I'll be able to watch that show the X-Files I've never watched that show because on Sunday night I

898
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:38,560
preach on the IRC actually on the internet hey hear that that's a phone call so you're asking

899
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:44,760

900
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:51,480

901
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,560

00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:23,240
when when y'all send tapes in don't send a not unless your sister Susie the floozy or a pretty girl don't send a 90 minute tape and it's and and and expect me to to weigh down to the very last song that has the cool part in it you know just have some mercy friends we've just you've got a I forget I forgive you I forgive you in advance for it

903
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,420
Unexpectedly

904
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:31,760
me Reverend Stang not Bob but me a just some dumb hippy redneck in Texas to make you rich and

905
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,800
famous like I am I forgive you for inviting me to do that that's not a problem

906
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,420
but you know just keep in mind that's all just fight tough

907
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:49,520
manners folks just remember your manners it politeness is so important and it's a forgotten

908
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,540
school in today's modern world with all this

909
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:58,280
hustle and bustle? Why, when was the last time you held the door open for a little old lady and

910
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,400
walked her across the street? When was the last time you called up your old ma and said, ma,

911
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:09,800
I love you? Friends, remember your manners. It's a message of love. Don't you run away.

912
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:17,040
A vast souvenir postcard of Grand Canyon. Repent. Quit your job. Slag off. Water trucks

913
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:26,460
slosh out paint. Outlaw painters armed with paint pistols paint everything and everyone in reach.

914
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:33,980
Survival artists paint cans strapped to their backs, grenades at their belts.

915
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,980
Paint anything and anybody within range.

916
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,540
Sky riders dogfight collide and explode.

917
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:54,140
Blood, fire, and pillars of smoke. The exact effects of a nuclear blast.

918
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,720
Zephaniah 118, the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy.

919
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,280
Malachi 4, on the day cometh that shall burn as an oven. Revelation 8, 7, a third part of the

920
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:11,100
trees was burned. All green grass was burned. And I want to pause there for a moment because it says

921
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,720
a third part of the earth was burned.

922
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,020
What is this?

923
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:16,920
What is this?

924
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,520
What is this?

925
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,000
You go for a lick of salamis!

926
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,580
You go for a lick, you salamis!

927
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,980
You go for a lick, you salamis!

928
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,820
You go for a lick, you salamis!

929
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,580
Oh, welcome back, Seekers.

930
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:51,640
It's just me again, your Spiritual wet-nap, Reverend Susie the Floozy.

931
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,000
Ooh, I'm feeling cooler since my hair fell out.

932
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,980
Can't tell if I'm getting much of a tan yet. These theta rays are real hard on the old peepers.

933
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:06,460
But hey, if crispness is any indication, I'll be looking fine and foxy by the end of this show.

934
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:13,260
But that's if we can survive, Seekers, because there are constantly forces at work striving to

935
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,280
bring about the end of the world as we or anyone or anything.

936
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,020
be looking fine and foxy by the end of this show. But that's if we can survive, Seekers, because there are constantly forces at work striving to bring about the end of the world as we or anyone or anything.

937
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:23,180
knows it. Even now, independent of each other, countless conspiracies are plotting just how

938
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:29,380
and when to imminentize the eschaton. And hey, when you get down to it, I'm all for

939
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:35,400
it any way it can happen. Because whether fried by the X's or the pinks, it would be

940
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:42,000
the greater planetary mercy. Because only global incineration can sterilize this reeking,

941
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:49,560
stinking cat box earth. Oh, sometimes, Seekers, I swear I don't think I can make it till

942
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:57,180
X-Day. Oh, but stop me before I pick up a hope habit like some people. Micro-phallus,

943
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:03,180
intellectual vermin like those L5 society losers are banking on technology to save their

944
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:09,760
larded asses. Ha! Who are they kidding? Oh, because of technology, they can't get out

945
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,900
of their Barca loungers to walk to the TV.

946
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,920
They can't even be to change channels anymore. They sure as hell won't be dragging their

947
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:23,780
flabby pink butts off the planet before our Armageddon shows up. Oh, but as for me, there

948
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:32,000
yet glimmers hope in my bosom. Oh wait, it's just a crusty old sequin. Oh, but still, I'm

949
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,720
feverishly scanning the horizon for the three stooges of the apocalypse. And there they

950
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,080
are, with a fourth stooge, Bob!

951
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,940
Oh hey, I'm back!

952
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,480
Hopping a walk big time! For I shall ascend up into the heavens in the glory of Bob, while

953
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:54,320
the pinks are too busy frying in their own rancid fat to look up my skirt. Oh, I shall

954
00:56:54,320 --> 00:57:00,420
be ruptured up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses, and smothered with mounds

955
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:07,740
of warm, squishy slack. Yay, though I walk through the valley of duh, I shall fear no

956
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:11,920
weasels, because Bob is with me, and I can tell by the lump in his pants.

957
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,320
Oh, I've got protection. Protection that money CAN buy!

958
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:24,020
Oh yes, the Church of the Subgenius dispenses better protective devices than Schmidt Laboratories,

959
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:31,080
kids. You can get that crucial, life-saving information from the source itself, the radiation-proof

960
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:38,080
subterranean bunkers of the Church of the Subgenius compound, way down in Dallas. Just

961
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,740
write to Bob, P.O. Box 140.

962
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:41,980


963
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:41,980


964
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:53,220
0306 Dallas, Texas 75214. And hey, lead shielding can't protect you from the X's death rays,

965
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,880
but a tiny pasteboard membership card can provide full-body protection from the Yakke-tizma

966
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:07,440
itself. Yes! Oh, my other car is an X's escape vessel, and you're not on it!

967
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,520
Will be added on text.

968
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:32,520
