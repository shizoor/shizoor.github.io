1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,860
Stuck in a nowhere job?

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,300
Tired of rhetoric about privacy rights,

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,000
illegal speech and seizure,

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,980
or innocence until proven guilty?

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,360
Don't get P.O.ed.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,480
Join the P.Lease.

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,320
Yes, the P.Lease.

8
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,900
America's fastest-growing organ of law enforcement.

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,500
In just one day, you'll become a highly-trained urinalysis deputy,

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,160
empowered by law to make on-the-spot urine checks.

11
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,480
Watch the fun as you make them drop drawers and pee in a cup anywhere.

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,560
In crowded elevators, in church, or family barbecues.

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,220
If any testees have used illegal substances in the last six years, you'll know.

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,620
And as a P.Lease deputy, you'll have the power to impound,

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,440
imprison, confiscate everything they own,

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,920
including illegal substances.

17
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,420
So the next time you hear them say civil rights,

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,720
don't get P.O.ed.

19
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,780
Join the P.Lease.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,900
Just send $2, cash, check, money order, or credit card

21
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,500
to You're in Trouble, One Vicious Circle, Utter, Missouri, 1330.

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,960
Act now while off or last and get the amazing little stoolie fecal sampler.

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,520
Don't get P.O.ed.

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,700
Join the P.Lease.

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,900
You say the taxman just took away your barrel and your bleep is freezing in a high wind.

26
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,000
Your car just made a sound like a dying moose and came to a halt on the off-ramp

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,820
after spitting out a bucket of gear teeth.

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,140
Just finished knocking back your third bottle of NyQuil during the Ren and Stimpy Festival

29
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,640
and you feel like taking a whiz on the electric fence.

30
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,180
The aliens removed your brain for their pathology studies and you don't even care?

31
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,200
Well, my friend, you're ready for a big healthy dose of the subgenius hour of slack.

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,080
No one knows how to put the m-huh back in Christmas like J.R. Bob Dobbs and his twisted henchman,

33
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,600
the Reverend Ivan Stang.

34
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,320
Your good friends and prayer partners in your bid to secure your place in hell

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,960
and stop worrying about all this unapproachable crapola.

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,040
So, refuse to take your medication for a week and tie yourself to the kitchen chair

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,000
for the next neuron-popping episode of the subgenius hour of slack

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,120
on that bastion of bogus southern hospitality, K-N-O-N.

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,940
K-N-O-N.

40
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,640
93FM in almighty Dallas, Texas, where the horses have silver wings,

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,560
the whales all speak French, and the politicians are honest.

42
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,900
Yeah, right, and Ross Perot's gonna pay off my student loan, too.

43
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,700
I mean, praise Bob!

44
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,760
Have the technology, have the tapes.

45
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,860
Bob told me to make this, not gonna resist.

46
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,860
And if during the proceedings a small chlorine-oxypropylene bag should drop down,

47
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,620
open the receiving flap and inhale deeply.

48
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,600
Don't ask questions.

49
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,240
Prepare to have your mind scanned for possible boson-sore traces.

50
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,320
Scanning now.

51
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,000
Only people here are people.

52
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,380
There is the advanced tech mode.

53
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:56,840
Whoa.

54
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,560
Technodroids can't hold up much of a conversation now.

55
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,320
The first of the subgenius.

56
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,280
For amusement, they toss children into pits with hungry dogs.

57
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,800
Are we not, men?

58
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,380
We are the subgenius!

59
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:17,520
Ah!

60
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,920
In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

61
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,220
None of sense of humor.

62
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,800
Continuing.

63
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,200
Take notes if need be.

64
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,000
Call for assistance.

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,380
Operators are standing by.

66
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,320
Forward when notified.

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,120
Void when prohibited.

68
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:33,960
Visitors only.

69
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,760
Ten minute parking.

70
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,220
Do not fold, spindle, or mutilate except in the presence of Krishna,

71
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,120
Mohammed, Buddha, Jehovah, Vincent Price, or Bob.

72
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,520
There can be only one.

73
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,820
He is the strongest of all the anarchists.

74
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,860
He is the top one.

75
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,620
We are incidentally guested this morning by a distinguished member of the clergy,

76
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,040
the Right Reverend Archbishop.

77
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,380
I am happy to say that I have received a vision from J.R. Bob Dobbs

78
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,900
that you have been promoted to Archbishop.

79
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,700
Oh, God, that's news to me.

80
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,820
That's pretty exciting.

81
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,260
I was just a sacred.

82
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,180
I couldn't even describe until half an hour ago.

83
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,660
Well, I guess being on this national broadcast has had a very good reaction.

84
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,780
We had a story yesterday that I'd like to get to the bottom of, frankly,

85
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,140
about cow mutilations.

86
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,520
Now, these cows were suffering from having their udders removed.

87
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,120
Their peni were sliced off, surgically, I might add.

88
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,240
With incredible surgical precision.

89
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes, it was.

90
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,440
And the other thing that was reamed out was,

91
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,980
I have no idea why anyone, and I quote from the Bible

92
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,860
to give some testimony to the fact that this is going.

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,400
The fire of God is fallen from heaven

94
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,260
and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them.

95
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,420
Am I only the escaped one alone to tell thee of?

96
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,040
And, of course, is Job chapter 1, verse 16.

97
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,020
Job.

98
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,900
Nowadays, when you've got a stale economy, you call them Job.

99
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,480
Job.

100
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,120
Cattle mutilations.

101
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,360
Can I give you some facts and see if you can verify these for me?

102
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,320
Oh, please do.

103
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,820
I am advised by a study done by my research director, Rob Robbie.

104
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,040
A tiny percentage are done by miscellaneous small cults

105
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,940
like Satanists and the Davidians, bikers, etc.

106
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,520
About 10% are done by one major Odinist right-wing Christian cult

107
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,700
composed mostly of Texas oil millionaires

108
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,900
who are essentially seeking, I guess, a ritualistic way of curing their impotence.

109
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,220
Now you know what Ross Perot does in his spare time.

110
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,260
Cow mutilations.

111
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,240
Yeah, well, he's got the silent choppers and, you know, all the equipment.

112
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,540
Well, I guess you really need...

113
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,120
And the motivation.

114
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,980
I am advised, sir, and I am glad I have you face-to-face

115
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,500
because I'm not going to be able to do that.

116
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,800
I don't like to back down from these types of confrontations.

117
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,560
But I am advised that a great deal of subgeniuses, part of your church,

118
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,260
all right, fresh from Dobstown on their first initiation test,

119
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
are involved in these mutilations.

120
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,380
And that it's not done as a test of their mettle.

121
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,160
It's a scientific fact that the only proper way, well,

122
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,840
to divine the future is by reading fresh animal bowels.

123
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,140
Well, I'm sorry.

124
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,320
This is a serious matter.

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,020
Hey, it's right there in Book of the Subgenius.

126
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,980
It says so right there in Black and White.

127
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,140
It does say that, then.

128
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,340
Then you have admitted to that.

129
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,420
Well, sure.

130
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,360
I mean, you haven't lived until you've gone out on a nice little cattle mutilation initiation hunt.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,300
Probably the largest and most ruthless gang of saboteurs in this country.

132
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,540
I know.

133
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,460
For six months, they thought I was one of them.

134
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,900
...assurance for all the lawyers, dockeys, ex-wives, and all the other gold diggers out there.

135
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,140
What is it, man?

136
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,240
Oh, and let them die with dignity.

137
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,040
Why, you dirty...

138
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,840
But, boss, but, but, but, but...

139
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,720
Isn't it wonderful what you can do with some wire and a few electric bulbs?

140
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,960
A little child looks up at me, sometimes with their eyes open.

141
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,160
You know, right about 500 grams is when their eyes,

142
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,100
they begin to open.

143
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,540
My half-staff turns to me and says,

144
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,000
Dr. Foreroth, what do we do?

145
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,540
I didn't come in here with three points and a poem today.

146
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,920
I could care less whether you think I can preach a lick or not.

147
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,820
You understand that?

148
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,620
All I care about is saying, thus saith the Spirit of God.

149
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,340
All I care about is getting in the mountain and standing behind that desk with lips anointed

150
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,940
from coals off the fire, ready to declare the Word of the Living God.

151
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,500
Thank you.

152
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,380
And I'm ready.

153
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,400
They were red as crimson, now they're white as wool.

154
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,140
You don't have to encourage somebody that knew they were a dirty rotten hunk of stinkin'

155
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,920
sinful flesh.

156
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:36,700
And yet, no matter how you slice it up, no matter how you dice it out, it's still another

157
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,380
eucystic, if it feels good to do it, anything goes.

158
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,880
Drug-induced hallucinogenic experience.

159
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,480
Well, uh, we're speaking to the Lord.

160
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,080
We're speaking now, of course, as you know, with Fr.

161
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,440
Joe Mama, who is at the end of the Democratic Convention parties.

162
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
We're looking down on the floor.

163
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,300
You can see at the Subgenius Convention just what happened.

164
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,260
We heard the news about Jesus and the handgun.

165
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,980
We'll be going to descriptions of that soon.

166
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,260
We just wondered if you- what you saw from where you were.

167
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:11,520
Well, I felt that the proceedings were very interesting from an academic standpoint, of

168
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:11,780
course.

169
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,040
Oh.

170
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,200
I can say that.

171
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:26,960
I can say that without any hesitation, that is, without any hesitation, that the chaos

172
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:35,560
that ensued was typical of that involving any sort of political assassination.

173
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,460
I personally think Jesus is a patsy.

174
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,140
Yeah.

175
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,180
He, uh, he's- I don't- this magic bullet theory is a magic bullet theory.

176
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,180


177
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,180


178
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,180


179
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,180


180
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,960
Yeah, me too.

181
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,900
The magic splinter theory also.

182
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,880
There are all these theories.

183
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,920
They're just theories.

184
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,740
Well, I mean, you know, I mean, they'd only try to- only Jesus would be accused of being

185
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,340
able to kill a man with one bullet with three different entry rules.

186
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,780
I mean, you know, would they think this guy is some sort of God?

187
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,180
I mean, let's get real.

188
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,580
I believe we got a whole lot of folks sitting in church think they're saved that aren't.

189
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,180
That's the reason we gotta hire 14 more preachers to counsel them.

190
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,180


191
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,180


192
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,180


193
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,180


194
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,180


195
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,180


196
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,180


197
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,180


198
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,180


199
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,180


200
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,180


201
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,980
We gotta counsel them all day long.

202
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,660
Shout now!

203
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Shout now!

204
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:21,800
Oh!

205
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,940
Brother Rod, don't put that condemnation on me.

206
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,500
Let's play God.

207
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,660
My dear young man, you know as well as I do that God is dying all over the world.

208
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,080
Man invented him but doesn't need him anymore.

209
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,700
Man is God now.

210
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,160
Man is God now.

211
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,480
As a matter of fact, he always was.

212
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:55,540
Overpopulation, pollution, famine, nuclear holocaust, war.

213
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,960
This civilization is driving us into the sea of extinction.

214
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,680
The keynote is control.

215
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,180
Bless the province of politicians, not scientists.

216
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,320
Yes, but we're the only ones who are trying to combat the problem now.

217
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,160
In 20 years' time, we will be the only ones who will be able to do it.

218
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,580
We will be in positions of power, and then we'll be ready to act for the good of humanity.

219
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,880
Ah, just like the Church of the Subgenius, dear friends.

220
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:40,800
We've been, uh, enjoying media barrages here on the Hour of Slack from many of our friends,

221
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,940
starting with the P. Leece by Brain Rot Theater.

222
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,040
I'm not sure if you've heard of Brain Rot.

223
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,140
It's a show that's been going on for a long time.

224
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,140


225
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,640
Uh, Hell Pope Huey's new contributions and promos,

226
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,020
Reverend Joe Riley's evil bulldada barrage,

227
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,040
and the barrages of Dr. Legume,

228
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,380
and, uh, KHSU Subgenius Show,

229
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,560
and good Reverend Morton Downey,

230
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,560
and a wonderful collection of Reverend Parsley

231
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,140
from our dear friends, the P. Leece.

232
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,540
And Reverend Uncle Jimmy.

233
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,240
As well as some KPFA Berkeley puzzling evidence,

234
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,420
and Papa Joe Mama,

235
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,640
and more of these things coming up, uh, friends.

236
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,920
Uh, by the way, as, uh, Vincent Price was just saying there,

237
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,860
we got an amazing document in the mail.

238
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,440
Uh, a top, uh, a copy of what supposedly is top secret material,

239
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,280
a document called Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars,

240
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,860
a blueprint for your eventual enslavement.

241
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,560
And, uh, I, I don't want to say who sent this to us.

242
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,120
Of course, this could, I suppose, possibly, uh, be a hoax.

243
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,980
Uh, whoa.

244
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,360
Oh, I can't put, I can't use that tape, friends.

245
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,360
That tape deck.

246
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,840
I'm gonna use this one up here.

247
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,620
Did you hear that?

248
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,580
That noise that came in?

249
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,240
There's no telling what they were trying to do to us there with that one.

250
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,940
But, you know, as the preface to this thing says here,

251
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,440
conspiracy theories are not new in history.

252
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,300
For example, plots to kill Caesar and overthrow Rome abounded.

253
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,260
But there are many who go out of their way to ridicule and silence

254
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,240
those who today speak of conspiracies.

255
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,300
Why do you think they don't want people to think about conspiracies?

256
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,080
As seldom does hard evidence emerge that by its very content indicates

257
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,300
it serves as a blueprint for a conspiracy.

258
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,980
Yet the very nature and information in the top secret Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars

259
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:07,120
introductory programming manual reads like a government technical manual

260
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,500
from some secret group of think tank planners

261
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:16,620
who have put many years of research and development into creating a new science of social engineering

262
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,020
so they can better manipulate the masses.

263
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,380
This document was uncovered quite by accident on July 7th, 1986,

264
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,860
when an employee of Boeing Aircraft Company purchased a surplus IBM copier for scrap parts at a sale

265
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:39,780
and discovered inside details of a plan hatched in the embryonic days of the Cold War,

266
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:44,460
which called for control of the masses through manipulation of industry,

267
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,020
people's pastimes, education and political leanings.

268
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,900
It called for a quiet revolution, pitting brother against brother

269
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:58,280
and diverting the public's attention from what was really going on.

270
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,640
And friends, here are some of the excerpts from this amazing document.

271
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,480
Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on Earth.

272
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:20,660
Natural science is the study of the sources of control of natural energy

273
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,860
and social science, theoretically expressed as economics,

274
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,340
is the study of the sources and control of social energy.

275
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,620
All science is merely a means to an end.

276
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:33,620


277
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:33,620


278
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,460
The means is knowledge.

279
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
The end is control.

280
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,080
Beyond this remains only one issue.

281
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,100
Who will be the beneficiary?

282
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,220
In 1954, this was the issue of primary concern.

283
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,340
Although the so-called moral issues were raised,

284
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,480
in view of the law of natural selection,

285
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,620
it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence

286
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,620
are no better than him.

287
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,680
Animals who do not have intelligence.

288
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:14,840
Such people are beasts of burden and stakes on the table by choice and consent.

289
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Consequently, in the interest of future world order, peace and tranquility,

290
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:27,160
it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American public

291
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,980
with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting the natural and social energy,

292
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,560
or wealth, of the undisciplined and irresponsible many

293
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,600
into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible and worthy few.

294
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:50,620
In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure and apply new weapons,

295
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,180
which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons so subtle and sophisticated

296
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,380
in their principle of operation and public appearance

297
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:05,000
as to earn for themselves the name Silent Weapons.

298
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:13,260
In conclusion, the objective of economic research as conducted by the magnates of capital, banking,

299
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,320
and the industries of goods and services,

300
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:24,180
is the establishment of an economy which is totally predictable and manipulatable.

301
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,380
In order to achieve a totally predictable economy,

302
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:34,180
the lower class elements of society must be brought under total control,

303
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:40,580
i.e., must be housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke,

304
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,060
and long-term social duties from a very early age,

305
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,480
before they have an opportunity to question the propriety of the matter.

306
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,260
In order to achieve such conformity,

307
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,680
the lower class family unit must be disintegrated

308
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,360
by a process of increasing preoccupation of the parents

309
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,520
and the establishment of government-operated daycare centers

310
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,620
for the occupationally orphaned children.

311
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,920
The quality of education given to the lower class must be of the poorest sort,

312
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:20,040
so that the mote of ignorance isolating the inferior class from the superior class

313
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,080
is and remains incomprehensible to the inferior class.

314
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,520
With such an initial handicap,

315
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,160
even bright lower class individuals will have little, if any, hope

316
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,380
of extricating themselves from their assigned lot in life.

317
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,880
This form of slavery is essential to maintaining some measure of social order,

318
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,440
peace, and tranquility for the ruling class.

319
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,660
plötzlich

320
00:18:52,660 --> 00:19:06,840
Theد المغامر

321
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,060
What hadn't been done

322
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:17,440
in vertex- behaves basically everyone,

323
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,480
instead of a military general.

324
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,840
The public cannot comprehend this weapon,

325
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:30,360
and therefore cannot believe that they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon.

326
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,160
The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong,

327
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,100
but because of the technical nature of the silent weapon,

328
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,800
cannot express their feeling in a rational way or handle the problem with intelligence.

329
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,400
Therefore, they do not know how to cry for help.

330
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,940
The silent weapon

331
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,720
Ah yes, and then it goes on to describe the silent weapon, dear friends.

332
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,400
Mr. Rothschild's energy discovery,

333
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,080
apparent capital as a paper inductor, and so forth.

334
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,120
And they use a sort of shock testing by which the prices of commodities are shocked

335
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,880
and the public consumer reaction is monitored.

336
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,960
The resulting echoes of the economic shock are interpreted

337
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,800
theoretically by computers,

338
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,800
and the psycho-economic structure of the economy is thus discovered.

339
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,440
It is by this process that partial differential and difference matrices

340
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:37,600
that define the family household make possible its evaluation as an economic industry,

341
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:43,940
or, in other words, the household as dissipative consumer structure.

342
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,940
Then the response of the household to fear,

343
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,520
and the future shocks,

344
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,620
can be predicted and manipulated,

345
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,800
and society becomes a real regulated animal,

346
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:02,280
with its reigns under the control of a sophisticated computer-regulated social energy bookkeeping system.

347
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:08,160
Eventually, every individual element of the structure comes under computer control

348
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,220
through a knowledge of personal preferences,

349
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,320
such knowledge guaranteed by computer association of consumer preferences.

350
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,180
Through the Universal Product Code, or UPC,

351
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:25,420
the Zebras cite pricing codes on packages with identified consumers,

352
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,000
identified via association with the use of a credit card,

353
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:37,240
and later a permanent tattooed body number invisible under normal ambient illumination.

354
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:44,320
The document, dear friends, then goes on to, uh, per-

355
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,280
describe the formula for the economic model of the silent weaponry,

356
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:55,640
with various, uh, diagrams of the three industrial classes,

357
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,060
and looks sort of almost electronic,

358
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,300
the way it's laid out with the E-model of economic inductance,

359
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,360
time-flow relationships, and self-destructive oscillations.

360
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,300
And then it comes to this little situation,

361
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,300


362
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,300


363
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,300


364
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,360
here, dear friends, by which we find that

365
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:24,180
the social welfare program is nothing more than an open-ended credit-

366
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,320
credit balance system,

367
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,180
which creates a false capital industry to give non-productive people

368
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,760
a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs.

369
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,360
This can be useful, however,

370
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,600
because the recipients become state property

371
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,220
in return for the gift of social welfare.

372
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,760
They become a standing army for the elite,

373
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,940
for he who pays the piper picks the tune.

374
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,660
Those who get hooked on the economic drug must go to the elite for a fix.

375
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,340
In this, the method of introducing large amounts of stabilizing capacitance

376
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,220
is by borrowing on the future credit of the world.

377
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,980
This is the fourth law of motion,

378
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,620
and consists of performing an action

379
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:22,220
and leaving the system before the reaction returns to the point of action.

380
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,600
A delayed reaction.

381
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,500
And by this means,

382
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,540
politicians become popular in their own time,

383
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,140
and the public pays for it later.

384
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,320
In fact, the measure of such a politician is the delay time.

385
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,160
The same thing is achieved by a government printing money

386
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,580
beyond the limit of growth,

387
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,540
and by the growth of the gross national product,

388
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,980
an economic process called inflation.

389
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,900
This puts a large quantity of money in the hands of the public

390
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,600
and maintains a balance against their greed,

391
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,760
creates a false self-confidence in them,

392
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,420
and for a while, stays the wolf from the door.

393
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,440
But they must eventually resort to war to balance the account,

394
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:12,480
because war ultimately is merely the act of destroying the creditor.

395
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,100
And the politicians are the publicly hired hitmen

396
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:23,580
that justify the act to keep the responsibility and blood off the public conscience.

397
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,800
If the people really cared about their fellow man,

398
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,040
they would control their appetites, their greed, their procreation, etc.,

399
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,800
so that they would not have to operate on a credit or welfare social system,

400
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,580
which steals from the worker to satisfy him.

401
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,060
Since most of the general public will not exercise restraint,

402
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:56,620
there are only two alternatives to reduce the economic inductance of the system.

403
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,320
One, let the population bludgeon each other to death in war,

404
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:08,340
which only results in the total destruction of the living earth.

405
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,980
Or two, take control of the world

406
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,260
by the use of economic silent weapons in a form of quiet warfare,

407
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,140
and reduce the economic inductance of the world to a safe level

408
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,360
by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide.

409
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,980
The latter option has been taken as the obviously better option.

410
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,800
At this point, it should be crystal clear to the reader

411
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,380
why absolute secrecy about the silent weapons is necessary.

412
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,960
The general public refuses to embrace the idea of the silent weapons,

413
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,500
and the government's own mentality and faith in its fellow man.

414
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,860
It has become a herd of proliferating barbarians,

415
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,300
and, so to speak, a blight upon the face of the earth.

416
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,880
They do not care enough about economic science

417
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,560
to learn why they have not been able to avoid war despite religious morality,

418
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,900
and their religious or self-gratifying refusal to deal with earthly problems

419
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,820
to solve the problem unreachable by them.

420
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:22,660
It is left to those few who are truly willing to think and survive

421
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,880
as the fittest to survive,

422
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,780
to solve the problem for themselves as the few who really care.

423
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:37,240
Otherwise, exposure of the silent weapon would destroy our only hope

424
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,860
of preserving the seed of future true humanity.

425
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:52,020
And see, dear friends, I have gone and just exposed the secret of the silent weapon over the radio,

426
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,600
destroying their hope of preserving the seed of future true humanity.

427
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:03,680
But since when, my friend, did we need to preserve full-blooded humanity?

428
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,220
Why, the full-blood human has not a drop of humanity.

429
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,300
Yeti blood in it.

430
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,300
And I don't see any point in us mollycoddling those people.

431
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,860
And as far as I'm concerned, you should respond to this,

432
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,100
the secrets revealed in this document,

433
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,940
obviously written by the higher-ups in the conspiracy itself,

434
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:33,620
by contributing to your voice of the church of the subgenius in your area, dear friend.

435
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,360
Ah, yes.

436
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:47,440
Because we love you and want to save you from that evil, evil conspiracy.

437
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,720
Ah, yes.

438
00:27:53,980 --> 00:28:04,440
To my home, on always glory forever I'll share.

439
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,700
God understands.

440
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,380
He doesn't condemn you.

441
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,800
No!

442
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,340
Excuse me!

443
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,120
God does not understand!

444
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:21,720
No!

445
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,180
Excuse me!

446
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,100
God does not understand!

447
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,240
I was moist and fully self-actualized, brimming with the vital juices of life,

448
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,880
a hero to every guy, a source of lust to every girl, and the nightmare of every mom.

449
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:44,020
Yes, I was flying high and leaving a trail of delightful turmoil in my fetid wake.

450
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,980
But just as I thought it couldn't get any better, just when I thought I was about to be elected God,

451
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,400
so as I could fix this mess good and proper once and for all,

452
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,660
Niggies sucked me dry.

453
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,780
Niggies sucked me dry.

454
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,220
Niggies sucked me dry.

455
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,640
I was set to run through the fields of middle-class complacency.

456
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,880
I was set to teach the fair maidens of the cheerleading society what it meant to be left widespread,

457
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,860
grass-stained, and sweaty in the wake of my gladular excesses.

458
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,920
All thoughts of Tupperware, pink bows, and evening news over a nice dinner

459
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,080
skewered on the pike of my flaming societal rage.

460
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,220
Oh, yes!

461
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:29,900
I was fully prepared to set fire to everything in sight, burning new pathways in the brains of the pink and mewling scum

462
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,480
who haunt the malls.

463
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,120
Making even my occasional excursions thereof in pursuit of some minor plastic crap,

464
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,480
a sleigh ride through hell unbounded.

465
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,100
I was fully loaded and snorting with hellish anticipation of the unforgettable rampage

466
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,140
which would splash the front pages of magazines and newspapers worldwide.

467
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,980
But suddenly,

468
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,940
Niggies sucked me dry.

469
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,340
The lab was fully stocked.

470
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,460
The quivering subjects strapped to the ground.

471
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,980
The batteries charged and the electrodes in place.

472
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,460
The drill bits were sharpened.

473
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,680
The clamps well-oiled.

474
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,720
The beakers filled with the vile fluids of my intent.

475
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,740
The hookahs were primed.

476
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,040
The incense burning.

477
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:21,700
The sacrificial chickens, goats, former employers, and imaginary enemies drugged and ready.

478
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,940
The generators were churning.

479
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,200
The light bill paid.

480
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,340
The guns loaded with the best explosive shells money could buy.

481
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,760
But suddenly,

482
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,540
Niggies sucked me dry.

483
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,000
Summary.

484
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,920
This revealed at the provided only apartment,

485
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,200
due to removing engine load accenter of a right

486
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,420
cedering these pulse changes at three of this test,

487
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,160
were reinforcement of this crush of the horizontal barrier barrier.

488
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:58,120
Anthropomorphic dummies were reduced by removing Strument Zone 2.

489
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,180
Results are listed.

490
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,580
And the impact became clear the experience.

491
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,900
Demonstructural integrity.

492
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,120
And results, intrusion of the D-sectives.

493
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:14,880
Although the moment zone femur locations not pre and were 44.1 mile per hour intrusional, X.

494
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,800
Accelerometry.

495
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,160
Rather compartment and post-test measurement.

496
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,220
Injury criteria or damage.

497
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,020
Oh!

498
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,380
You can wear a fake beard and dark glasses.

499
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,880
You can trade buses, planes and rickshaws till you're dizzy.

500
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,320
You can nail the basement door shut.

501
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,420
Crank up the anti-virus programs.

502
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,740
Turn out the lights and muzzle the kids.

503
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,780
You can wear three rubbers, a gas mask and a raincoat and nothing else.

504
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,580
You can buy an arsenal of automatic weapons and nerve gases.

505
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,880
You can build your own pocket nuke.

506
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,180
You can dig a moat around the house and fill it with piranha.

507
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,520
You can buy a six pack of slobbering pit bulls

508
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,480
and a gross of tigers for the perimeter.

509
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,820
You can put in voice print, retina print and tongue print computers

510
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,700
with criss-cross lasers aimed at the doormat where the subject to be scanned will stand.

511
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,960
You can hire Batman, Hannibal Lecter and Hulk Hogan for bodyguards.

512
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,580
You can fly straight up in the air, screaming like a banshee,

513
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,100
flinging fluids and vital organs everywhere.

514
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,320
But sooner or later, no matter how far you run or how big your gun,

515
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,320
you're gonna have to look in the mirror,

516
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,820
like everybody else, and admit to yourself,

517
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,560
Neagy sucked me dry.

518
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,360
You can't even see the

519
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,700
Excuse me! God does not understand!

520
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,460
Excuse me! God does not understand!

521
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,520
You said I'd pick up my foot, but he'd put it down.

522
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,300
You said the steps of a horse,

523
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,740
the good manner order of the Lord.

524
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,980
Lord, I don't want to fall in the ditch.

525
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,560
I don't want to be the blind leading the blind.

526
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,180
God, I need the Holy Ghost conviction to keep me on the right track,

527
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,500
to keep me in the center of your will,

528
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,120
to keep me progressing toward the glory.

529
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,680
I'm destined for the throne, and I refuse to take a bypass.

530
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,940
I refuse!

531
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:55,120
And we've got slaughtered men and women of God laying around us,

532
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,060
like cordwood.

533
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,620
They're dead. The life's gone out of them.

534
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,420
No unction, no anointing.

535
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,880
You know why? They refused conviction.

536
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,000
They were numb to conviction.

537
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,820
They turned a deaf ear to the wooing voice of the Spirit of God,

538
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,340
and now they're dead.

539
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,720
My God, that's worth the price of admission.

540
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,520
I know it's me!

541
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,840
We didn't leave with Lucifer!

542
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,020
The telephone rang.

543
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,660
It would not stop this President Kennedy calling me up.

544
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,840
He said, my friend Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?

545
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,220
I said, my friend John.

546
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,240
The subgenius must have slaps!

547
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,340
The subgenius!

548
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,220
Think, boys.

549
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,340
Breathe!

550
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:54,960
Remember, there's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over.

551
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,280
He didn't leave with Lucifer.

552
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,500
Kill Bob!

553
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,600
I know what you want.

554
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,720
You want to kill me.

555
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,580
holy

556
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:31,580


557
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:31,580


558
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:41,180
Do you know what's the event that we've got today at Makeale scient depende de l'automobile Internet booking site in the topure to do a review on this set out in the

559
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,160
Ohio's一个

560
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,320
the

561
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,160
yeah

562
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:53,780
cant, marshmallow smell of a female fly in heat. Ah, lucky fellow, he's found one. Yes, her mysterious

563
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:59,260
dance seems to lift up his day and light up his night, but it's all right. As she comes to accept

564
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,980
him, it's no secret that the fly's orgasmic pleasure is matched only by his built-in proportionate

565
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:08,620
inability to remain in a fixed location for any length of time, for no sooner has the mating

566
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:13,060
couple filled each other's goby nodules with albumin and spoo than the fly, ever touring,

567
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:17,900
ever seeking nectar, flies off to another destination, smiling all the while as the

568
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,040
facets in his mirror-like covering reflect grace, land, and mansions of endless stars,

569
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,660
thus filling in the blank spaces of nature's lost address book. Is it all in the name of love,

570
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,980
or is this conscious pest but a note in the marvelous symphony of nature's universe?

571
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,720
Perhaps we'll never know, but the next time you see a common fly, remember, there's more to this

572
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,820
pesky fellow's life than rancid oatmeal and his attraction to that light bulb over your bed.

573
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,520
Yes.

574
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:49,460
One of nature's most misunderstood anomalies, Mr. Fly will always be a part of our insect world.

575
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,040
That's it that time. Here I am again.

576
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,500
Welcome to the local cinema.

577
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,540
Kayat, let us prepare everything now, especially ourselves, for this wonderful situation.

578
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:18,840

579

Au revoir, Mr. Fly.

Good dressers, have you never kept clean off?

583
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,820
You all have forgotten everything you've been through.

584
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:43,200
You're right, second love, however naïve and cannot concentrate on the close-ups.

585
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,360
Your own fall short will end your fish.

586
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:46,760
Phil.

587
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,360
Say thank you.

588
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,340
I only can please you by hearing Ms. получить this tender, innocent hymn of love, Nenora by addressing the Prayers' message to me, now that you also consider to marry us.

Just like I said, that is true.

591
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,380
You're so handsome.

592
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,520
You're so damn cute!

593
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,500
And you're perfect, too!

594
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,100
I must be heading to my room.

595
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,920
Hi, Ze34!

596
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,420
Change your dress!

597
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,420
I'll be back, wherever you go, alright?

598
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:03,740
Take a look at this.

599
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,820
You have a pretty dress.

600
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,580
This young� second-year's URL is like me.

601
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,180
Sorry but I too,

602
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,120
know how to bail.

603
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,900
Oh, if that's gonna be ?

604
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,080
kind of a 직з

605
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,840
make it difficult for them.

606
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,640
La la ne para dun, some amateur sneak thief.

607
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,960
Floyd Robinson, big eye, na big eye, na ang da mahong, in sa peliculang, big eye.

608
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:32,960
Some told me that Beth Morgado, well, indeed a bomba on pelicula, a little sex lang.

609
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,620
Dear Mr. Auri, I am one of a million readers of your wonderful column,

610
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,940
which I believe can help me find a lot girl right for me.

611
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,360
I didn't even think before that I would be in need of your help,

612
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,180
for I had girlfriends, yet they all deceived me.

613
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,720
However, I don't blame even any one of them.

614
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,700
I've realized that we're not really meant for each other.

615
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,980
With regard to the girl I'm looking for, she must be of a practical type,

616
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,820
Caucasian, Catholic, understanding enough to get my situation.

617
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,040
She must not be necessarily beautiful or sexy,

618
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,820
but charming and sexy and beautiful and simple,

619
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,660
to please my sophisticated.

620
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:18,120
She must be a teacher, even pursuing still such profession,

621
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,260
at 22 to 25 years of age, standing five to five.

622
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,520
Speaking of my humble self, I am an A.B. degree holder,

623
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,160
and at present still pursuing my studies for a B.S.E. degree,

624
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,520
and at the same time employed in one of the private firms

625
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,660
in the greater Manila area, making Manila folders.

626
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,040
Till here, and I'll be hoping for the best of your kind health.

627
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,800
Thanks in advance and more.

628
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,820
Power to your column.

629
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,780
Very respectfully, Tyrone.

630
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,360
Lang-a-la-gang-pang-a-lang-mo, roadside mailbox,

631
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,840
saying house number na-lang.

632
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,660
Mang-a-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-man,

633
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,860
a-nig-a-sing-a-lang-a-pang-a-lang-a-num-ro-an-ba-yay, this way.

634
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,200
The Church of the Sun Genius.

635
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,820
T-O-box.

636
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,260
One, four, O.

637
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,040
Three, two.

638
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,320
Six, Dallas.

639
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,520
Ten, six, seven, five, two, one, four.

640
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,100
Three.

641
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,660
Praise Bob.

642
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,440
That's right.

643
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,920
That Malaysian address is

644
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:25,460
Bob at Post Office Box 140306,

645
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,820
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

646
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,840
And you really can write for more free information from

647
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,160
Bob at that number.

648
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,160
But I'll be giving that sacred Post Office Box number again.

649
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,000
But in the meantime,

650
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,420
I wanted to let you know what you have been listening to, dear friends.

651
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,760
We've heard Hell Pope Huey doing a knee-gee,

652
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,020
sucked me dry,

653
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,440
a lovely sort of testimony there.

654
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:05,160
More of Reverend Parsley from Reverend Uncle Jimmy's tape that he sent in.

655
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,060
We've barely scratched the surface of that.

656
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,780
Dr. Legume's media barrage,

657
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,740
Dr. Riley's media barrage,

658
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,120
Bleepo Abernathy talking about flies in rut.

659
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,360
And that was the Fire Sign Theater.

660
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:27,680
Very rare recordings doing the Filipino ads there.

661
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,400
And coming up,

662
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,720
we'll hear some ranting by Reverend Mike Cole in Cleveland.

663
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,040
A little bit of that.

664
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,280
And then we'll hear some,

665
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:50,600
an amazing little piece about snake handlers that was sent in on a tape called

666
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,780
America Freedom Acts by a devil guy.

667
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,340
I got a bag in the mail that had a,

668
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,640
it had inside a black hood,

669
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,000
an envelope of ashes,

670
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,440
a piece of paper with devil writing and blood on it,

671
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,360
and a vial of some milky fluid.

672
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,080
Ugh, dear friends.

673
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,160
And that tape.

674
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,780
And, um, more KPFA coming up.

675
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,840
And, well, we'll just see.

676
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,520
We'll try to get down to the Rudy Schwartz project.

677
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,180
Uh, uh, yes.

678
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,660
Are we not men?

679
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,340
We are the subgenius!

680
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:32,540
Ah!

681
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,260
Oh, and Crop Circles.

682
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,200
That was another one.

683
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,840
You're doing Crop Circles now.

684
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,020
Yeah.

685
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,640
It's, it, it, those two little old gentlemen.

686
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:41,720
Yeah.

687
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:41,720


688
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,960
Those gentlemen in England took credit for those 13,000 crop circles.

689
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,920
But obviously it had to have been a lot of subgenius help.

690
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,880
Well, I knew they had to have some help of some kind.

691
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,720
But I always thought that this was perhaps from a UFO.

692
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,820
A lot of them are from UFOs.

693
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,400
But they're, they're little minor, uh, joyriding UFOs.

694
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,720
Not the important UFOs that Bob Dobbs is in touch with.

695
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,340
Bob Dobbs is in touch.

696
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,260
Uh, one of Bob's main messages is that the world is going to end on July 5th,

697
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:11,700
1921.

698
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,020
And that's the date of the first of July, 1998, at 7 o'clock in the morning.

699
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,940
Why, why, why that particular time and that particular day?

700
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,800
Uh, just, I guess it's a random choice on the part of the aliens.

701
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,960
The men from Planet X, or the sex goddesses from Planet X, have found themselves better.

702
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:26,260
Oh, my God.

703
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:26,980
I, I...

704
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,700
You're listening to the Church of the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack with your host,

705
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:41,700


706
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:41,700


707
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:41,700


708
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:41,700


709
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:41,700


710
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:41,700


711
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:41,700


712
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:41,700


713
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,400
the Reverend Ivan Stang.

714
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,940
He'd never steer you wrong.

715
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,440
Tell me where to turn.

716
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:54,820
Here.

717
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:09,060
Well, I was, I was thinking just the other day that we don't have that many of them subgenius holidays.

718
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,580
Oh, well, yeah.

719
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:11,680
Oh, well, yeah.

720
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,080
Every, every day is Bob's birthday.

721
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,980
But, uh, that gets me a little bit tiresome after a while.

722
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,480
But I was thinking about July 5th.

723
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,100
Oh, it's, it's kind of a ways away.

724
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,880
You know, it's not that far away.

725
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,540
July 5th.

726
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,900
I remember, I remember...

727
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:45,080
Reverend, uh, Reverend Stang.

728
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:51,980
He was, uh, talking, he was talking about that, uh, what goes on.

729
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:01,800
And he was telling the importance of X-Day 1998.

730
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:09,160
And he, he, he was a-saying, he was saying...

731
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,960
Oh, wow.

732
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,680
What was he saying?

733
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:11,680


734
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,840
Oh, Bob, Bob, what was he saying?

735
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,140
He was saying...

736
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:15,480
He was saying...

737
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,240
But I've stayed up all night

738
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,440
Frobing and frobing and dooning and, and gleaning.

739
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:31,240
And, uh, doing X-Day chants about how the time is nigh for their arisal.

740
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,700
And, uh, songs, you know, X-Day holiday songs, like Take Me Off to Space,

741
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,100
which we'll be playing soon.

742
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,140
And, uh, on X-Day morning,

743
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:49,520
Of course, well, the grown-ups have been up all night, but the kids get up real early because on X-Day, the children are allowed to eat breakfast.

744
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,500
When we pulled up in the yard, I told the children here, I said, we're going to have ourselves a time tonight.

745
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:01,260
I just knew that old church was going to be full of spirit, and it was, honey. It was.

746
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:08,700
We went in there, after we sung about three songs, they were shouting all over that church.

747
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,500
I've never seen so many people in one church shout.

748
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:16,220
And in a little while, they shouted themselves right around in back of us.

749
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,620
Three ladies and two men.

750
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:25,560
Well, now, when we were hooking up, we saw some curtains or something laying over some boxes back there.

751
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,880
We didn't pay any attention to it, didn't know what was in there, and didn't care.

752
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:38,680
But in a little while, they came out around us with five of the biggest rattlesnakes I have ever seen.

753
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,060
And I never laid my eyes on them.

754
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,200
I like to dive.

755
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:57,580
When the service was over, they told us that the biggest rattlesnake they had in that service was five feet long.

756
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,580
Honey, the one they brought by me was 27 feet long.

757
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,780
Let me say this.

758
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,120
I'm not knocking these people.

759
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,180
I promise you.

760
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,020
I'm not knocking them.

761
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,920
I don't know if they're right or wrong, you know.

762
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,240
I'll tell you.

763
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:22,500
They claim that they read in the Bible where Moses had enough faith to take up the serpent.

764
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,140
And some members of their congregation claim to have that much faith.

765
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,100
And I'll tell you one thing I found out before I left there.

766
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,100
They had a whole lot more faith than what I had.

767
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,980
Now, this one woman stopped about two feet from where I was trying to pick.

768
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:43,520
And she said,

769
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,040
I didn't even know what kiosk is.

770
00:47:50,880 --> 00:48:00,840
She took that rattlesnake with a head as big as your fist and held it up and stuck it right down in her face and shouted in its ear.

771
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,580
If a rattlesnake's got an ear.

772
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,680
She wrapped that thing around her neck.

773
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:13,180
She threw it down on the floor, kicked off her shoe, and put her bare feet on it.

774
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,380
Foot on top of its head.

775
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:18,040
When she threw that thing down on the floor.

776
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,680
It's tail missed my foot about that far.

777
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,500
I done a little shouting myself.

778
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,540
And she thought I was in the spirit.

779
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,780
And brought me one up.

780
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,920
What in the world are we going to do?

781
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,300
And I said, just take it easy.

782
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,640
Don't panic.

783
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:11,820
I said, just look around and find out where the back door is.

784
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,340
She said, I already looked and there ain't none.

785
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,820
I said, reckon, where do they want one?

786
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,120
And this lady walked up to me.

787
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:42,100
She said, Brother Wendy, you mean to tell me if the Lord commanded you to take up the serpent, you wouldn't take him up?

788
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:42,660
No.

789
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,440
I said, yes, ma'am, I surely would.

790
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,700
But he didn't and I ain't.

791
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,580
Then the devil pulls off a mask.

792
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,460
It's me, Bob.

793
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,240
I'm a flower.

794
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,680
I'm a flower.

795
00:49:59,680 --> 00:49:59,840
I don't know.

796
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,220
We better get back, because it will be dark soon.

797
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,780
And they mostly come at night. Mostly.

798
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:40,100
I need your money as a dwelling place while I am here on your earth.

799
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,980
Where do you put it? You got a hollow leg?

800
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:46,240
It exists in almost every city and hamlet in the country.

801
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:52,700
And you must stand united on this, and stamp out this frightful assassin of our youth.

802
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,800
Because it is only through enlightenment that this scourge can be wiped out.

803
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,080
Hooray!

804
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,620
Hooray!

805
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:01,620


806
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,140
Ah!

807
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,860
Ah!

808
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,520
You're going to be ready for the finals in 1998, my friend.

809
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,440
Let me be slack.

810
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,640
Hooray!

811
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:16,580
Ah!

812
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,940
Let me give you this shit. You don't do anything to stimulate me.

813
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,480
Why don't you buy me a vibrator?

814
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,560
Why don't I put it in your mouth and you hum?

815
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:40,720
A person walking down a sandy beach barefoot, whose foot has been numbed by Novocaine,

816
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:48,240
steps on the jagged edge of a broken bottle, slits their foot and bleeds to death.

817
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,740
Because they never knew there was a problem.

818
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,980
My loss was his gain.

819
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,140
This was a manipulation.

820
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:03,900
A tilting of the luck plane in his favor.

821
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,160
And what goes up must come down.

822
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:11,680
And when you're talking about the luck plane, you're talking about both sides at once.

823
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,020
One goes up, the other goes down.

824
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,860
I happen to be on the wrong end of the luck plane.

825
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:24,480
But Mr. Rob Dobson, you see, was on the right side of the luck plane.

826
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:28,020
And I bet he had a damn good seat for tonight's game.

827
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,040
Yeah.

828
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:29,120
Yeah.

829
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,120


830
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,120


831
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,120


832
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,120


833
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,120


834
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,120


835
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,060
Wonderful paradise.

836
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,840
He's got a paradise?

837
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:33,600
Sort of.

838
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:41,660
He's on the coast up north here with all of his, well, what can you say, aliens or friends?

839
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,840
Oh, it's a family reunion.

840
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,340
What about me?

841
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,480
That's the code word we use, too.

842
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,380
Yes.

843
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,400
It's a mighty big family tree we subgenius grow from.

844
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,020
That's right.

845
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,280
You never can tell what sort of branches.

846
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,220
You can branch off here.

847
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:05,240
Well, we're going to the convention floor right now for that report about Jesus and the handgun.

848
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,660
Let's see what they have to say down there.

849
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,380
Jesus was running around at the spa last night with a handgun.

850
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:11,860
Really?

851
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,180
Okay.

852
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,680
You can see Reverend Stang there.

853
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:14,280
Yeah.

854
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:20,340
And a wounded side and a crown on his head and a loincloth and a handgun.

855
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,760
He was hunting for Bob.

856
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,180
He was hunting for Bob.

857
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:24,740
And so what happened?

858
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,580
Well, he was bumming drinks.

859
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,080
Yeah.

860
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,840
He was real upset.

861
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,000
I didn't see him running.

862
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:29,800
He was running around town.

863
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,900
You'd be on the lookout.

864
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:31,480
Okay.

865
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,040
There he was.

866
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,920
And a wound in his side and a crown of thorns, a loincloth.

867
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:36,740
Yeah.

868
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,080
And then I saw him going off with Connie, too.

869
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,260
That's a drinking, fighting Jesus for you.

870
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:41,680
I tell you.

871
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,640
He was fighting one of them.

872
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,440
Very bad.

873
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,420
Did he hit Bob?

874
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:44,940
Yeah.

875
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,560
I wasn't around at that point.

876
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,600
I don't think he hit Bob.

877
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,080
He missed him.

878
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:48,420
Yeah.

879
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,740
Something must have happened.

880
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:54,200
We think the bullets were caught in some sort of void time warp or something.

881
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:54,480
Yeah.

882
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:54,840
I saw it.

883
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,600
He was in an office.

884
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,280
He had three different heads.

885
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,680
Boy, I love time warp.

886
00:53:59,140 --> 00:53:59,520
Yeah.

887
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,980
That's always a problem with those deities.

888
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:04,540
One of the main things you have to do on the show here is wash the little H-bombs.

889
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,340
Over here in the corner is a sink over here.

890
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,760
And you can wash their white bodies.

891
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,640
That makes them all happy.

892
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:11,940
Okay.

893
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,180
Yeah.

894
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:12,720
Yeah.

895
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,180
Yeah.

896
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:13,520
Yeah.

897
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:13,900
Okay.

898
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,640
We might have to leave the floor.

899
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,100
It looks like the crowd's getting ugly down there with the river and I'm staying.

900
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:19,820
Uh-oh.

901
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,840
Uh-oh.

902
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,140
They busted through the...

903
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,620
Are you afraid to die?

904
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,560
No.

905
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:24,920
No.

906
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,260
No.

907
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:26,760
No.

908
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:27,260


909
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:27,260


910
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:27,260


911
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:27,260


912
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,380
No.

913
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:28,480


914
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:28,480


915
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:28,480


916
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:28,700


917
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:28,700


918
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:28,700


919
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:28,700


920
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:28,700


921
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,900
Well, there you go.

922
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,700
They busted through the third medium into Stang's brain.

923
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,160
They now reside there until we can perform the radio exercise on the second half of the show.

924
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,140
Yes, I was there in the bar that night, the night that Jesus was allegedly running around,

925
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,620
but that was no handgun in his pocket.

926
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,500
Was it?

927
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:45,840
Let me tell you...

928
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,300
He was just happy to see another cult.

929
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,840
He wanted those followers back.

930
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:49,960
Customer service.

931
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,940
Yes, dear.

932
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,160
Papa Joe here.

933
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:57,880
You know, you're far too young to remember this, but when I was a boy, we didn't have

934
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,520
any of these.

935
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,720
We cleaned Jesus with a handgun.

936
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,200
Jesus.

937
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:02,240
Jesus.

938
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:08,140
We only prayed to an almighty God that puts fear, fear in his disciples.

939
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,540
I'm talking about Jesus with a hand grenade.

940
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,520
Fear in his cereal?

941
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:13,420
No.

942
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,600
Jesus, back in my day, Jesus had AK-47.

943
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,860
Jesus had a Stinger missile.

944
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:18,880
I know.

945
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,740
I just understand that's the old world.

946
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,500
They're in new thinking now.

947
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,580
See, that's what's happened today.

948
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,560
People get sloughed off with these cheap imitations.

949
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,420
Yeah.

950
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:34,600
Papa Joe, Mama, I can't believe you have a list of high-ranking officials that were

951
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,720
there that night and were actually subgenius.

952
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:37,420
All right, punch it up.

953
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:37,980
Name?

954
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:46,560
Well, it has been alleged that certain hierarchies have carried weapons of destruction on their

955
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:51,480
persons during public appearances, but this is merely a defensive measure, let me assure

956
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:51,780
you.

957
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:57,140
These allegations of opening up on the audience, dispensing with people that didn't applaud

958
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:57,700
loud enough.

959
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,160
These are...

960
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,940
These are purely exaggerations.

961
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,900
They tell me it feels something like...

962
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:03,580
Okay, all right.

963
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,400
There was some shooting on the audience, but it was target practice.

964
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,160
We were deliberately missing.

965
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,360
Tell the truth.

966
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,620
Okay, okay, so, all right, a few people were hit, but that was from...

967
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,820
Yeah, we dialed up Rocket Man.

968
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,280
What a beautiful future it is.

969
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,060
And how many people were taken in?

970
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,220
Listen, what I lie to you, what I lie to you...

971
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,120
We're the elite of the world.

972
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:28,040
Those people that died, those were people that wanted...

973
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,340
They wanted to die.

974
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,040
They jumped up in the line of fire.

975
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,160
Would you lie to me?

976
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,280
What about that night you told me you were...

977
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,060
Well, never mind.

978
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,140
Never mind, never mind.

979
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,280
Close the raven, never mind.

980
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,940
Head of home, Shelly!

981
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:48,240
He screamed at the orderlies, when told he was actually Farlow Fudd, doctor of dental

982
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:48,660
surgery.

983
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,360
He struggled with his bonds and snapped his jaws at them viciously, his mouth foaming

984
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,360
like a St. Bernard's.

985
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,000
The drug's head showed some beneficial effect at first.

986
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,020
But as time...

987
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,880
Time wore on, his violent reassertion of his fictitious persona pushed aside any hope that

988
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,520
chemical management would lead to a breakthrough.

989
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,300
Get the electrodes, sighed Dr. Fine.

990
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,680
He shook his head in resigned frustration.

991
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:14,400
The man had already absorbed the full charge of four die-hard batteries and was still no

992
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:14,640
better.

993
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,880
His burning devotion to this Bob Dobbs was most disturbing.

994
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:24,220
Either it was the product of a fevered, sick mind, or this Bob had somehow tormented the

995
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,940
man into a state of burning psychotic loyalty unlike anything they'd seen before.

996
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,340
Perhaps it was both.

997
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,220
Hell-poke Huey and Dee.

998
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,200
Well, regardless, I have a job to do, thought the doctor, as he pulled on his thick rubber

999
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,340
gloves and goggles.

1000
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,580
And to think I used to enjoy this, he thought.

1001
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,400
Something had to work soon.

1002
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:46,740
There were only three orderlies left, and one of them refused to approach this patient

1003
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,340
again, even with the peril of being fired over his head.

1004
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:54,380
As the raving men had put the others in the ICU, with snapped bones and large pieces bitten

1005
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,460
out of them, the doctor couldn't really blame him.

1006
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,920
Perhaps he really was a doctor.

1007
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:57,920


1008
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,660
He was the pope of hell.

1009
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,120
He was certainly earning his self-imposed title.

1010
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,220
Oh well.

1011
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:06,000
One last try with electricity, and then it would be time to turn to firearms.

1012
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,120
Suddenly there were screams in the hall, followed by a terrifying, rumbling crash that sounded

1013
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,980
like someone had loosed a thunderhead in the building.

1014
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,100
The multifaceted sonic chaos made him feel like a frightened child again, and his bladder

1015
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,880
loosened violently.

1016
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:24,320
Against his better judgment, he ran from the room and turned the corner to see the orderlies

1017
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,580
in pools of their own blood, their arms ripped from the sockets.

1018
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:32,020
Unimaginable burns, smoking and filling the air with the acrid tang of ozone.

1019
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:37,980
Worse yet, one of them had been separated from his head, which lay forlornly in the corner

1020
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:43,340
like a discarded ragdoll, except that ragdolls didn't ooze loops of intestine and purple-pink

1021
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:44,160
brain matter.

1022
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:49,340
My dear God, his nose has been bitten off, Dr. Fine thought as he vomited.

1023
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,340
I guess he shouldn't have called the man names when all this started, he thought absently,

1024
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,560
part of his fractured mind shutting itself off in a bid to prevent a complete death.

1025
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:57,560


1026
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,220
He was in a state of complete breakdown.

1027
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:03,660
There was a huge hole in the wall, jaggedly rent as if some unimaginable force of nature

1028
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:07,500
had gone berserk, which was, ironically, exactly what had happened.

1029
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:13,020
A few bricks fell from the smoking edges of the gash as he watched, mouth agape, vomitous

1030
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:17,240
unwiped, as he tried to wrap a protective cocoon around his mind until he could get

1031
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,180
to some tranquilizers.

1032
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:22,560
Hmm, Bob Dobbs and Hell Pope Huey, he mused absently.

1033
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,420
I'll remember those names.

1034
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:39,140
HOPE is the name of the emperor Alan fixing his celebrate, Edmund complacently writes

1035
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:39,200
abouthorals in a 5000 page old comic.

Why this GR Paladins Doll, or worse.

01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,300
You can write Bob.

1046
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,020
You got that pencil ready, friend?

1047
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,200
I'm going to give you a couple of different addresses tonight.

1048
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:26,280
You can write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas at 75214.

1049
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,960
Oh, yes.

1050
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:32,960
There's a lot more besides this radio show that you need to know about at P.O.

1051
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,020
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1052
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:47,640
And our good friend Onan Canobite is apparently doing a book about SPK, the band SPK.

1053
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:54,060
And he is looking for anything you've got, like interviews, discographies, tour data,

1054
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,240
names and addresses of men.

1055
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:04,680
Members, any language, reviews, all contributors will be credited and all inquiries answered.

1056
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:11,540
And you can write to Trevor Blake at Post Office Box 2321.

1057
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:19,200
That's Box 2321, Portland, Oregon 97208.

1058
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,140
That's Zip once again in Portland, Oregon 97208.

1059
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,260
But that doesn't tell you about...

1060
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,760
Bob does it.

1061
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,540
I know.

1062
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:30,460
No.

1063
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,160
But this might.

1064
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:39,740
Now, the conspiracy talks about something called deviant sex.

1065
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:49,440
To the conspiracy, deviant sex is anything except having, trying to have a baby in the missionary position.

1066
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,240
That's the only thing we consider to be a sin.

1067
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:53,980
All right!

1068
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,140
I'm a preacher.

1069
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:08,140
You putting that on ultimate liberty.

1070
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:17,940
prove it.

1071
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:23,940
There's no guarantee to your life.

1072
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:24,900
Honestly, I just wannaיע

1073
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:24,940
I'm a senior bass very force-and- wow.

1074
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:25,040
If you lift it up, it'll come up.

1075
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:25,040

1079
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:25,840
