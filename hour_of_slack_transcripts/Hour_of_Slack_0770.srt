1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,840
No, no, no.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,920
How does that start?

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,920
God, I can't remember.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,360
I guess, friends.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,860
No, I guess, dear friends.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,620
You're listening.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,100
No.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,360
It's the subgenius radio ministry hour of slime.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,900
Brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,060
Produced here at the beautiful studios of WCSB, Cleveland.

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,200
I love that show.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,620
It's so iconoclastic.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,800
And, you know, everything is worthy of poking at and making fun.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,800
And sometimes throwing dirt on the shoes and pulling a knife at it.

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,760
Yeah, they're just a mirror that reflects the illness in society.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,680
No, no, no.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,400
They're not sad.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,040
No, no, no.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,400
Look at the mirror.

20
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,160
You're listening to...

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,060
The subgenius radio ministry hour of slime.

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,160
Now I really do have to flip it.

23
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,060
Oh, please don't look in the mirror.

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,100
You're not going to like what you see there.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,640
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,580
and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,240
Then we dip them in the sacred water.

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,900
And what exactly does this do for them?

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,980
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned

30
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,800
and it prepares their mind for the slate.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,300
Like impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.

32
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,080
Maybe one is gone.

33
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,200
Try it.

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:38,980
I mean, three.

35
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,340
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

36
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,400
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,380
Well, I can...

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,540
He took my headphones away.

39
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,200
I don't know what the music is doing.

40
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,860
He took my headphones.

41
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,740
Look, oh, wait.

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,940
Oh, I can hear.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,160
That's all right. I know I hear what the listener is hearing when his car speakers are in really bad shape.

44
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,240
Sounds just like my car.

45
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,840
I thought you were going to say you hear what the car listener hears when his car rams into an abutment at 85 miles an hour.

46
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,480
I hear what the car listener is thinking, and it's very depressing.

47
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:29,000
Especially as his car goes off the cliff, and he frantically pushes his foot all the way, the pedal, all the way through the floor.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,880
And like in a Goofy Goose cartoon, his foot goes all the way through, out to the other side, and he begins pedaling like Fred Fuzz areas.

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,320
And I wish that we could be funnier in his last moments, but it's just the way it is.

50
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,380
It's just right there.

51
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,460
It's just right there.

52
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,540
It's just right there.

53
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,620
It may be that some of you here are indeed yourselves human.

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,940
In fact, in fact, most of you here are...

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,720
You are probably pink human beings.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,820
It's possible.

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,440
And that's why we're here.

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:05,980
It didn't happen.

59
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,660
Bob.

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,520
The Bob.

61
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,680
I want to meet him.

62
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
Many, uh-huh.

63
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,940
Many have seen him.

64
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,000
You try to meet Bob.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,900
Exactly, and you never will.

66
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,480
And you never will.

67
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,260
So this is the closest I'm going to get to meeting Bob.

68
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,860
No, no, no.

69
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,180
One day a man will come up to you and sell you something you don't really need, and when he does, you have been touched by Bob.

70
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,720
But even though you didn't need it, you will somehow have gotten slack.

71
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,400
True slack.

72
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
And you will have to have it.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,840
It's so hard for people to understand, especially in this country.

74
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,280
In a great deal of the rest of the world, it's very simple.

75
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,240
Slack is having enough food in your stomach.

76
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:45,800
But in America, we are plagued with false slack and false money, false sex, false everything.

77
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,420
False drugs.

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,640
Bob delivers the real thing, the real pills, the pills of revolution, my friend.

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,980
Bob delivers...

80
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,000
And the slack that heals.

81
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,520
Remember, slack that only moves, it can remove.

82
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,020
Uh-huh.

83
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,980
I want one of you...

84
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,380
I want you two to deliver me a rant.

85
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,700
What do you think you've been doing?

86
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,660
It's not enough to be done that way.

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,020
You must also work.

88
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,880
Oh, we are out of there!

89
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,060
Oh, that is my favorite song for sure.

90
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,320
Oh, we're out of that Belfast battle zone.

91
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,080
Slave driver drove his tank into his reserved parking spot.

92
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,980
And stepped out looking like Margaret Thatcher.

93
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,420
The war was on.

94
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,980
Ah, the keys on the typewriter had sharp points that kept sticking into our fingers.

95
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,320
The dictating equipment started asking us questions.

96
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:57,160
And our beepers sent electric shocks just through our body like a cattle prod.

97
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,960
Out in the warehouse...

98
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,680
The trucks kept banging into the docks.

99
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,880
Not even thinking about stopping.

100
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,980
Oh, our frail bodies were strapped to the chairs.

101
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,680
And our chairs were chained to the desks.

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,740
Our pleas for justice were ignored.

103
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,800
And the end seemed near.

104
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,960
But we busted our Margaret Thatcher.

105
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,020
Slave driver's little bitty balls.

106
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,740
We've charged out of their brick fortress.

107
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,500
The streets are ours because...

108
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,600
It's Friday!

109
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,320
Friday!

110
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,840
FRIDAY!

111
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,960
You see, it doesn't matter.

112
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,940
It doesn't matter how sinful it is.

113
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,400
It doesn't matter how miserable you are.

114
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,500
It doesn't matter how much you've had to kiss ass on some ignorant lout who happens to make more money than you.

115
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,880
You can still find slack!

116
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,540
Now unfortunately, unfortunately, that doesn't sit well with many.

117
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,180
No siree.

118
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,300
Most of you, most of you, most of you believe that you already have slack.

119
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,880
That ain't what Jesus said.

120
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,420
Broad is the way that leadeth to destruction.

121
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,480
Narrow is the way that leadeth to life.

122
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,980
And few there be that find it.

123
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,040
Few, he said.

124
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,760
So, you must ask yourself.

125
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,620
Why do you think you're a subgenius?

126
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,360
How do you know you have slack?

127
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,340
As the prophet Hyperclete said,

128
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,460
Many hear the call, but few have correct change for the pay toilet.

129
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,700
Now this is harsh.

130
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,760
It's harsh, it's blunt, but it's true.

131
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,720
Most of the churches in this country, in Canada, and around the world,

132
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,340
they go by the name of subgenius, or Christian, or Hindu, or Muslim.

133
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:15,340
Most of these churches do not teach a full gospel of slack and are by and large useless.

134
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,740
Most of the preachers, hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of preachers,

135
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,940
do not preach a full gospel of slack.

136
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,340
Most of them preach no slack at all.

137
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,700
Some do. Some do. Some do.

138
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,460
Thank God for the good churches.

139
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,960
And there are some, but they're precious few.

140
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,000
Most of the people, millions upon millions of people,

141
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,940
all over the world, do not know Bob, do not have slack,

142
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,560
have never been re-killed in Bob's mighty fire,

143
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,540
and unless they get slack, they will die without Bob and be lost forever.

144
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,180
They don't love you, Bob! They don't love you, Bob!

145
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,660
They don't love you like I do!

146
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,300
Bill Clinton was governor for 300 years in Arkansas,

147
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,420
and he never did anything about doctors for Bob.

148
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,680
Clinton actually, he did. He married one of doctors for Bob in the governor's mansion.

149
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,640
Hey, so what about Bush's daughters?

150
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,960
Hot little things there, huh? Little cokeheads a bit, huh?

151
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,240
She's cute.

152
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,880
I bet they all get their coke from daddy.

153
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,800
Wouldn't that be terrible?

154
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,020
They call him the Michael Corleone of the Michael Corleones in the New York Times.

155
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,600
One guy. I forget if he was a guy or not.

156
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,440
Those are hired daughters. Those aren't the real daughters.

157
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,720
That's what I thought. They were models. Yeah, dancers.

158
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,760
They've been groomed for a long time. Remember the old Soviet programs?

159
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,220
They all spoke Russian, too, from an earlier program.

160
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,980
Crazy whores or something like that.

161
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,120
At least with Chelsea.

162
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,000
No, they used those for the jeans.

163
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,080
She was definitely the kid of both of them.

164
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,100
Of regular people. Yeah, regular people.

165
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:01,220
These were specially bred and fed, the Bush children, each to resemble something in Elan or Teen Magazine or something like that.

166
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,220
They're perfectly normal looking. And attractive. Very logical looking.

167
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:16,240
If you're a young, fleshy, or some person that can only ditto an agreement to many things, get a look at that and stop thinking even more so as your memory swells.

168
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,720
You say to yourself, finally normality has returned.

169
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,380
We can all be proud to be normal and serve the, you know, whoever.

170
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,940
Someone better and more important.

171
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,160
Someone is taking care of you.

172
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,260
Someone who's got more money than me.

173
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,900
While you may have to move from your house and live on the street.

174
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,820
A true master. Someone superior.

175
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,740
It's going to be just fine.

176
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,680
Someone I can work for.

177
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,720
Everything is going to be just peachy.

178
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,260
Someone I can serve.

179
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,360
That's right, you'll find a new life in Bush Haven, Thurston.

180
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,700
Someone I can force everyone to join me.

181
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:58,660
Where everyone gets a special voucher worth 29 cents towards the advancement of their career or enrichment as a human being.

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,600
Everyone will also receive 45 cents as transportation passage for one year.

183
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,920
Thanks to the Republican Party of the United States of America and the corporate states of America.

184
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,600
Everyone will receive 40 acres and a mule.

185
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,120
It's welcome to the new New Deal in the new old age.

186
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,640
Yes, 40 acres and a mule from hell.

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,620
Jesus is back with a coat hanger.

188
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,560
A rusty coat hanger.

189
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,500
Yes, the Lord has returned with a rusty coat hanger.

190
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,740
I think that says more than it wants to.

191
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,600
That says it all.

192
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,180
We should make bumper stickers.

193
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,060
Sterno was going to make a bumper sticker.

194
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,220
Oh, my God.

195
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,400
20 years ago.

196
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,100
When they were trying to outrun him.

197
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,100


198
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,000
I love any kind of abortion that just had a picture of a coat hanger that said, welcome back.

199
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,020
Okay, here's a thought.

200
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,940
I don't want to be shot or procrastinated or even put in a broadcast delay for the next 45 minutes.

201
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,220
What if instead of doing away with a lot of these things they want to do away with, we did away with Jesus?

202
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,380
Okay, forget about that.

203
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,240
That was a bad idea.

204
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,840
Do you think anything would change?

205
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,280
I mean, it was just like an errant thought that came in there and put a little mushroom cloud and left.

206
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,760
Do away with Jesus?

207
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,620
How do you think we got?

208
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,800
That's where they made the mistake the first time.

209
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,580
Let's do away with Jesus.

210
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,520
That's how this started.

211
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,000
Now, by the same token, they decided they'd do away with Martin Luther King.

212
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:37,980
Well, this token is no longer valid.

213
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,400
So, let's just see what happens with that one.

214
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,260
This token is no longer valid.

215
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,900
They decide they'd do away with Mr. David Korek.

216
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,160
Now, you're going to need a transfer.

217
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,740
Let's just see what happens now.

218
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,340
They decide this token is no longer valid.

219
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,060
They said they'd just do away with all those people in Bhopal, India.

220
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,560
Well, let's just see what happens now.

221
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,800
It's going to be a bummer, my friends.

222
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,220
It's going to be a stone bummer, baby.

223
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,400
I'm getting there and the south end of the flats have to go to work every day.

224
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,480
Let's do away with all those people that have to put meat on the potatoes and bread on both sides of the butter.

225
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,700
Let's do away with all those people that have to do away with people.

226
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,020
Well, at least have a way with poople.

227
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,620
Because those are the real pooples.

228
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,180
The pooples that we're trying to reel.

229
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,860
Mr. Sinehoff, it's time to reel in.

230
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,380
Could you please sit down here, please?

231
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:28,880
Thank you.

232
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,620
Okay, just take this clipboard and put it on your knees.

233
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,840
You're going to feel a tingling in a few short minutes.

234
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,660
Just let your eyes roll back in your head.

235
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,320
That's right.

236
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,900
You're going to see a lot of silly things.

237
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,940
You had a little laugh before.

238
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,160
Okay.

239
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,680
Here we go.

240
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,140
Kill me, Bob.

241
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,500
I want to die for Bob.

242
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,080
I want to die for Bob.

243
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,160
People of America, people of the United Snakes, please.

244
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,980
Please, if you can, stay tuned to your radios, your appliances.

245
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:11,180
Stay close to your Mixmax or perhaps even your microwave if it has to be very special.

246
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,500
We're going to have to sign off the air.

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,980
I don't want to sign off the air.

248
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,820
You stay here all night and stay on the air.

249
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,580
Stay away from your windows if you can.

250
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,780
I've got to do an hour's work.

251
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,580
You can just do it live on the air, record it, and dub it off on the air.

252
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,160
Only in two minutes.

253
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,700
Okay.

254
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,020
It's all right.

255
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,760
I don't want to get old.

256
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,280
You can just do it live on the air.

257
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:42,680
Record it and dub them off on the air.

258
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,120
I'm going to get home.

259
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:43,920
Price

260
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,820
I'm a killer, I'll kill the asshole

261
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,140
What do you want, you son of a bitch?

262
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,780
I want to cry, I want to cry

263
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,140
I'm a killer, I'll kill the asshole

264
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,920
What do you want, what do you want?

265
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,680
I want to cry, I want to cry

266
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,220
This is a song dedicated to Miki

267
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,700
and to all his family

268
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,420
and to Iñaki, his brother

269
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:35,820
Fuck!

270
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,940
They kick him in the ass

271
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,380
Fuck!

272
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,940
They kick him in the ass

273
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,380
Fuck!

274
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,020
They kick him in the ass

275
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,780
Fuck!

276
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,760
Fuck!

277
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,460
Fuck!

278
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,040
They kick him in the ass

279
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,400
Fuck!

280
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,060
They kick him in the ass

281
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,420
Fuck!

282
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,200
They kick him in the ass

283
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,660
Fuck!

284
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,480
Fuck!

285
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,520
I'm a killer

286
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,380
I'll kill the asshole

287
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,720
What do you want, you son of a bitch?

288
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,940
I want to cry! I want to cry!

289
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,640
I'm a killer

290
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,520
I'll kill the asshole

291
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,420
What do you want, you asshole?

292
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,220
I want to cry! I want to cry!

293
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,180
Fuck!

294
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,600
That's such a perfect image for what we're going through right now,

295
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,840
what's trying to pierce our humble little voice.

296
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,540
And there you see, once the administration is in place,

297
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,380
the administration is in place now.

298
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,640
You know, at least with Clinton, it was a literal screw.

299
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,840
Yeah, right.

300
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,540
When they said you were getting screwed, that's exactly what they meant.

301
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,660
I mean, that's what it was.

302
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,760
That meant if you were like some blonde fired...

303
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,740
This secondary thing.

304
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,760
It's like, think how many Monica Lewinsky's there are in between us and George now.

305
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,660
And none of them are cute.

306
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,900
None of them have been women.

307
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,940
They're just more ugly old white men all the way down the line,

308
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,520
except for a few old white women who are really ugly old white men in disguise.

309
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,980
Well, that is where our power structure is today.

310
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,040
We have 500 ugly old women disguised as 500 ugly old men.

311
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,520
Now there's like thousands of them.

312
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,920
Most of them don't even look as much like a woman as she does.

313
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,900
Or even as much like Janet.

314
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,920
And not that, you know, I mean, hey, I don't judge a book by its cover.

315
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,300
I judge it by how many pages are stuck together.

316
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,320
Here you come fully equipped with a bunch of those quotable quotes.

317
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,720
Janice Joplin or Janet Reno, who sings the blues better?

318
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,780
With a grading system of 10 to 9.

319
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,100
In what way?

320
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,540
Who had more soul?

321
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,880
Who had the greater range?

322
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,820
Who does ball and chain better might be another way to look at it, which would give you...

323
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,600
That was Aerodite.

324
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,520
That was Laconic.

325
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,500
That was Lagoobish.

326
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,180
I mean, I mean, forget all of that.

327
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,640
That was quick.

328
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,520
That was a panacea.

329
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,080
Love is like a ball and a chain.

330
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,560
Hey, yay, yay, yay, yay, baby.

331
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,420
Oh, my God.

332
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,260
Oh, my God.

333
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,560
We just watched one of his strangest...

334
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,360
We're looking at the internet monitor right now.

335
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,100
We're not going to get the internet porno on the radio anymore.

336
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,940
Mr. Hellman, I can understand why you're so popular with the ladies.

337
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,740
You've left a string of pregnancies everywhere you've been.

338
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,400
Hey, ladies, you just about got my ass shot off back there.

339
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,560
Now we're going into hostile mutant territory at full throttle.

340
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,460
Damn, I hope you know what you're doing.

341
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,000
She can supply you with endless nights of pleasure.

342
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,920
Hey, what do you do walking around like that with no top on?

343
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,660
I'm free.

344
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,580
I'm proud.

345
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,780
I'm woman.

346
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,280
Okay, let me just see if I can get this straight in my head.

347
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,600
There are these guys who sell freaks in bottles.

348
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,200
And you're like this class A, big time freak collector.

349
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,720
Biological oddities.

350
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,660
You're right.

351
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,160
And like your job is, selling the freaks in the bottles that this guy buys.

352
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,060
That's right.

353
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,640
You're like the chief freak broker in this freak collecting underground.

354
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,720
And I put up with your typing for three years because I thought you were too stupid to stab me in the back.

355
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,160
You're fired.

356
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,540
You're fired from everywhere.

357
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,940
You're fired from the f***ing universe.

358
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,480
Huh?

359
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,960
Well, shoot.

360
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,800
I don't want to go to jail.

361
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,780
There are lesbians there.

362
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,320
I always thought that was one of the advantages.

363
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,420
You got some place to go?

364
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,200
Hey, if I had some place to go, I certainly wouldn't be in Cleveland.

365
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,820
Even now, there are great numbers of werewolves living secretly among us.

366
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,700
Keep your eyes and ears open and close your mouth, Blaine.

367
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,640
Blaine closed this.

368
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,940
Blaine opened that.

369
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,380
Just like prison.

370
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,700
Damn hybrid alien.

371
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,040
Snake man creature.

372
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:06,380
As well as round-the-clock radio messages to the American population urging them to overthrow the evil robber.

373
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,720
The Barons will seize power in this bloodless coup.

374
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:17,440
Presidential appointee George W. Bush showed little understanding of the gravity of the situation after UN sanctions were explained to him.

375
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:23,740
If they don't like it, maybe they should look for a new home for their organization, he reportedly said.

376
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,380
Sanctions are scheduled to begin immediately.

377
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,060
What kind of flavor sanctions are we going to be having?

378
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:31,960
Ugh.

379
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,500
Well, that's not only disturbing, but it's also very...

380
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,180
I don't know, kind of exhilarating to think that we might be liberated by UN troops who...

381
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,020
Yeah, yeah, I guess...

382
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,560
...come to restore Martian law.

383
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:51,040
Right, the Nicaraguans and Colombians and so forth will be sending peacekeeping troops here too.

384
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,920
I hope the drug lord sends a few squads or squadrons...

385
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:56,860
Squat teams.

386
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,120
Squat teams.

387
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,920
That's all you can think about, isn't it, Dave?

388
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,260
Squatting or teams?

389
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:01,960
Boats.

390
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,500
Teeing and squatting and stuff.

391
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,300
Actually, all I can think about is like...

392
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,500
Disgusting.

393
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,380
...riding around in a...

394
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,480
...boat with a bunch of girls.

395
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,080
But that's...

396
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,620
That almost got me into an accident on the way here.

397
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,960
I saw some whole movies of you skiing behind a boatload of girls.

398
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,740
Yeah, but that...

399
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,100
They were all laughing at you and you had no skis.

400
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,000
See, I was an extra.

401
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,580
Remember the island of Dr. Moreau?

402
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,760
Not the ones...

403
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,520
You said there were three major classics and a couple rip-offs?

404
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,860
No, two classics and one terrible rip-off.

405
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,320
Well, this was kind of like an island of Dr. Moreau thing.

406
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,480
There were all these sexed-up babes who had lived near a nuclear power plant and stuff.

407
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,400
And testosterone was somehow quantized with it, too.

408
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,500
And I had to water ski like endlessly, like for hours and hours and hours around the same little puddle.

409
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,680
I had seen everything before a thousand times.

410
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,920
I heard they made you do that.

411
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,800
And I got no pay.

412
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:56,060
You know, your usual chicken sandwich bidet and so forth that you get as your offerings for having done your doo-doo.

413
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,040
You just...

414
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,160
I didn't make anything off of it.

415
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,740
Not even a concept that made sense.

416
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,340
And still don't.

417
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,320
But if you can imagine a bunch of like...

418
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,120
Female werewolf queens.

419
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:08,860
Whoa!

420
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,080
Now you're talking.

421
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,420
And one of those like really hot Chris Craft, you know, like outboards and stuff from the 50s and everything.

422
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,580
Wearing those Donna Reed bathing suits, like smiling and waving and stuff like that.

423
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:25,720
And sometimes their hands fall off because I guess they're trying to weave a leper colony thing in there with, you know, the people being beastial and so forth.

424
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,980
And I had to have sex with all of them, too.

425
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,380
With the werewolf cheerleader babes, did you say?

426
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,160
A cheerleader kind of beach babes.

427
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,280
More like a net, you know, fungicide or something.

428
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,860
You know, some...

429
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,120
You bet.

430
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,440
You know...

431
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:43,560
Well, the sexy aspect of werewolf women, werewomen wolves has not been explored except in very few movies that...

432
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,260
The howling.

433
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:56,400
The first howling movie I remember had a sexy werewolf scene where this couple goes out waiting for the full moon because they're into it.

434
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,600
Yeah, I remember that.

435
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,380
The full moon comes up and they're making the beast with two backs.

436
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,220
While they change into werewolves, of course, they end up...

437
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,700
At the end of the climax of the scene, the male is...

438
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,660
And talk about dog breath.

439
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,640
And talk about dog breath.

440
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,900
A coffee to Bob Doglin.

441
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,860
Also to Bob Doglin.

442
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,320
Bob Doglin.

443
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,180
arrival

444
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:04,520
This movie was shot between May 21 and early November, descried as ter Berkeley Dogherland 3.

445
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:15,520
A beer Healthyiska investic simultaneity movie made for abused Bombadoom.

446
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:16,640


447
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,560
Outro Music

448
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,580
Outro Music

449
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,800
Outro Music

450
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,560
Outro Music

451
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:36,900
Outro Music

452
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,020
This is like art brew or something like that.

453
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,620
This is crude.

454
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,560
This is not really...

455
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,120
This is if we have no professional...

456
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,480
What is this Ashcroft?

457
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:46,900
Fellow.

458
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,920
What have these...

459
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,520
All these...

460
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,600
I almost started looking at the news.

461
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,960
I had to sit in a dentist's office.

462
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,040
What was there to read?

463
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,900
Wasn't anything there to read but Time Magazine.

464
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,300
Oh, well.

465
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,500
He's a non-benign bigot.

466
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,860
He is a big old pile of poo.

467
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,100
Excuse my language.

468
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,880
I could be sued by him as the Attorney General of the United States.

469
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:04,960
I'm coming.

470
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,740
In the tanks?

471
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,800
Yeah, and he'd be wearing those like weird...

472
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,100
Putting what they call it on his armpits.

473
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,280
Eggs and stuff.

474
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,060
What do they call that?

475
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,860
On his epaulets.

476
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,400
Chaz, what are you worried about?

477
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,080
You're a...

478
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,000
You're a...

479
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,180
A middle-aged, job-holding, white man.

480
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,440
You're a non-combatant.

481
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:21,720
Smith.

482
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,780
You're a non-combatant.

483
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,100
He's Smith, no less.

484
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,440
Probably from some sort of a Protestant background.

485
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,240
When they run your check, when they run your check, you go,

486
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,040
Yeah, Smith.

487
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,560
You can pass through us now.

488
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,120
You could be a horrible wasp.

489
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:31,820
Yeah, Smith.

490
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,400
Smith, fine name, Smith.

491
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,080
So what are you worried about?

492
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,580
Mr. Smith, come and tell your place next to me.

493
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,080
Did I say I was worried?

494
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,240
Mr. Smith, yeah, right across from Mr. Jones.

495
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,700
Mr. Jones, meet Mr. Smith.

496
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,840
I have to use the guy that started going off.

497
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,700
I know, I know.

498
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:42,900
I know, I know.

499
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,300
I'm confused.

500
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,180
You're Bill Smith.

501
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,260
I was too scared to do that the previous weeks.

502
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,820
And you're Bob Jones.

503
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,100
No, I can't wait till the born-again take over.

504
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,600
William Smith and Bill.

505
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,700
Meet Bill, meet Bob.

506
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,140
I'm sorry.

507
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,920
No, I was just going through the family tree like a feathered chimpanzee with thoughts that...

508
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,600
Just like...

509
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,520
Can't you wait until the born-again take over?

510
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,800
I can't wait.

511
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,880
I just can't wait.

512
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,660
I started early.

513
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:07,900


514
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,940
I started early.

515
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,840
First, I sent him the certificate, which I burned promptly.

516
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,160
And then I did the bondage.

517
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,880
I set a bonfire in the backyard.

518
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,880
I initiated a few of the younger teens.

519
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,500
And in the hopes that by the time they got to my house or your house, everything would

520
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,520
already be done.

521
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,460
You know what I'm saying?

522
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,100
Well, Dave, how come this time I'm the one who's all worried about the fascists and you're

523
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,140
the one who's being all escapist and hiding your head in the sand and under a rock inside

524
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,420
a record player?

525
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,480
I made a special deal that if I shaved my eyebrows, not just my hair...

526
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,280
Not just your knees.

527
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:43,880
Oh, no.

528
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,520
Not just my knees or my hair.

529
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,960
Is it like a skinhead in the neo-fascist world?

530
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,980
I shaved my eyebrows, my face, and most parts, other parts of my body.

531
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,920
Now you're cool.

532
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,480
No, no, no.

533
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,740
This is the beginning of it.

534
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,600
I made myself perfectly clean because I'm going to be one of this one class and I get

535
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,220
out of...

536
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,400
You're going to be in the dome.

537
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,300
I don't die.

538
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,780
You don't want to be caught outside the dome.

539
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,080
No.

540
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,380
You're in the country club.

541
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,120
No.

542
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,500
You changed...

543
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,820
No, you're in the country club.

544
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,300
I'm just one of the guys who look at stuff all day and get confused and wonder where

545
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,740
they're, you know, why they're there and what they're doing.

546
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,980
You actually have some privileges, I guess, from what I heard about your card, but my

547
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,240
card means I get out free, but I don't have a very pleasant life.

548
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,900
No, I can't get into the...

549
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,380
I can't get into the dome.

550
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,760
I didn't know you were refused.

551
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,760
No, I'm not on the outside for sure.

552
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,600
Stang.

553
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,080
There was a time when I actually thought that I was going to be inside the dome.

554
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,720
Man, that's exactly how they keep you going.

555
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,240
It's an honor to be in the same room with Ivan Stang.

556
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,960
Chaz, Stang is honored to be in the same room with himself and he's...

557
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,760
Monica Lewinsky again.

558
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,160
Sorry.

559
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,640
Sir, who are you?

560
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,460
Could you please pronounce your last name as slowly as possible?

561
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,060
This is Julian Lisping.

562
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:49,860
Jelan.

563
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,040
You're supposed to pronounce it...

564
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,100
This is the guy who's had the bizarre numerical experience.

565
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,720
That's the all seven.

566
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,480
The one, one, underscore, one, one, one, underscore, one, one, three separated by three with the

567
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,360
one in the middle deciding the rule, that whole thing.

568
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,500
Well, I don't think you ever really went through your tables of seven or else you'd

569
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,580
be so freaked out right now.

570
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:10,720
No, he did.

571
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,380
You wouldn't be calling.

572
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,040
He did.

573
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,620
You would...

574
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,560
Well, I have.

575
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,920
And I taught it to my children, each and every one of it.

576
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,840
I read your website and it's really striking how this fellow, this caller has been pursued

577
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,040
by the most incredible waterfall of synchronicity for his, like his whole life.

578
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,700
You're saying that synchronicity began cascading and you're trying to, you're trying to say

579
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:34,980
that...

580
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,720
You've met people who see 23s everywhere.

581
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,020
Princess Wiardo is in there.

582
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,180
I heard that.

583
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,140
William Burroughs.

584
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,220
Right.

585
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,200
And well, and if you look for...

586
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,420
For a number, then it becomes magical and pops up all the time.

587
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,980
As I have, as I have stated.

588
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,620
Have you ever studied besides, I know you said you've, you've done cut up work with

589
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,720
Bill Burroughs in the backyard there and also at the shopping barn, I think it was.

590
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,040
But have you ever read the words...

591
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,040
I told you before, I'm in Lawrence.

592
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:01,960
I'm in Lawrence, Kansas.

593
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,700
I'm in Lawrence, Kansas right now.

594
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,440
You're, you're talking with a man himself, are you?

595
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,680
Anyway, how about William, I mean, Edgar Rice Burroughs?

596
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,060
He saw things we never...

597
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,100
Never saw before and he didn't need to take heroin in his nostril, Ryan.

598
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,820
I really...

599
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,140
I really...

600
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,900
I really...

601
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:32,940
I really...

602
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,780
I really...

603
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,040
I really...

604
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,380


605
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,520
To each one of my eyelids

606
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,420
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did

607
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,080
Price it and get fucked up

608
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,200
Worse than my life is

609
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,460
My brain's dead weight

610
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,840
I'm trying to get my head straight

611
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,380
But I can't figure out which spice

612
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,600
Girl, I wanna win pregnant

613
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,960
And Dr. Dre said

614
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,760
You ever say that you a bass head?

615
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,360
To watch your face red

616
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,300
Man, you wasted

617
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,320
Well, on day 12

618
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,820
I felt like I'm someone else

619
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,120
Cause I hung my original self

620
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,560
From the top bar with a belt

621
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,720
Got pills off

622
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,400
And ripped Ham and the Lee's tits off

623
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,420
And smacked her so hard

624
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,540
I knocked her clothes backwards

625
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,280
Like Chris Ford

626
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,040
I flew for fat down the grass

627
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,260
To fall on my ass faster than a fat bitch

628
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,400
Sat down so fast

629
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,540
Come here, sludge

630
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,460
Amy, wait a minute

631
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,700
That's my girl, dawg

632
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,460
I don't give a fuck

633
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,280
God sent me to piss the world off

634
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,600
Hi, my name is

635
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:24,900
What?

636
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,940
My name is

637
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,240
Who?

638
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,300
My name is

639
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,600
The Funk Soul Rubber

640
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,100
Hi, my name is

641
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,380
Huh?

642
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,460
My name is

643
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:31,840
What?

644
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,800
My name is

645
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,140
The Funk Soul Rubber

646
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,300
Right about now

647
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:35,660
What?

648
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,160
The Funk Soul Rubber

649
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,120
Check it out now

650
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,380
Who?

651
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,920
The Funk Soul Rubber

652
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,840
Right about now

653
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,220
Huh?

654
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,260
The Funk Soul Rubber

655
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,560
Check it out now

656
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,080
What?

657
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,440
The Funk Soul Rubber

658
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,360
Stop the tape

659
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,980
This kid needs to be locked away

660
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,560
Get it

661
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,080
Dr. Dre

662
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,160
Don't just stand there

663
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,920
Operate

664
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,120
I'm not ready to leave

665
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,380
It's scary to die

666
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,780
I'll have to be carried inside

667
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,480
The cemetery and buried alive

668
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,140
Am I coming or going?

669
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,300
I can barely decide

670
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,060
I just drank a fifth of vodka

671
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,120
Dare me to drive?

672
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,900
All my life I was very deprived

673
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,800
I ain't had a woman in years

674
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,580
My palms are too hairy to hide

675
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,960
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk

676
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,140
I spit when I talk

677
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,260
I fuck anything I want

678
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,740
Dainty walks

679
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,900
When I was little I used to get so hungry

680
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,700
I would throw fists

681
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,480
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom?

682
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,560
You ain't got no tits

683
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,060
I lay awake and strap myself into bed

684
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,540
With a bulletproof vest on

685
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,760
Shoot myself in the head

686
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,100
Bang

687
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,900
I'm a demon mad

688
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,880
By the way

689
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,920
When you see my dad

690
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,260
Yeah

691
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,480
Tell him that I slit his throat

692
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,660
In the dream I had

693
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,020
Hi

694
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,900
My name is

695
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,220
What?

696
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,300
My name is

697
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,560
Who?

698
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,600
My name is

699
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,000
The Funk Soul Rubber

700
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,260
Nostradamus forecast that Armageddon would come in the 20th century

701
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,480
The days in which we live

702
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,280
Born and hailed a little green bastard

703
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,400
Hey, hey look up in the sky

704
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,680
So what Ozzy, it's just a rainbow

705
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,200
It's a magic rainbow

706
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,040
Dad, that was not an animal

707
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,340
Okay, I know what it feels like when a man caresses my legs

708
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,720
You do?

709
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,220
Whether or not I like someone doesn't depend on what kind of genitals they have

710
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,980
The most interesting fact is that I'm a man

711
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,460
And one of a few sounds like that we've found

712
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,900
These killings occur during sexual intercourse

713
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,280
My theory is that these creatures

714
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
Aliens feed on people

715
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,520
Redo other creatures

716
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,260
That they need for sustenance

717
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,820
A substance similar to opiates

718
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,040
Heroin is an opiate

719
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,560
So this one can hear for it

720
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,540
We've found something better

721
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,260
That substance is produced in the brain to ing elevated the orgasm

722
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,140
And is similar in chemical structure to opiates

723
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,300
Eric, I told you those books work

724
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,260
They're real

725
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,960
It might not be a good idea to use words like that

726
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,120
from them. We don't even know what they say. For all we know, you could be reading Latin

727
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:44,380
insults about our mothers. Dr. Hughes called you and told you that the tumor on her neck

728
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:51,620
is deadly a fetus. Just assume for a moment, sir, that this woman is a young woman? Yeah,

729
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,340
a young woman. Just assume that she has a problem. Now assume also this problem has

730
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:02,060
to do with Indian magic. Oh, my God, son, you do have one hell of a problem. That doesn't

731
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,940
look like me at all. If you were turned inside out, that's the way you'd look. I married

732
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:15,300
a monster from outer space. A space goddess from planet X who can take the form of whatever

733
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:22,700
you want her to be. And you notice in my case, she looks like Princess Wiardo. That is true,

734
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,400
but I have seen her gone through her transformation before. When she gets excited or, you know,

735
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,840
uh, excited, she will...

736
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:36,260
She'll go through this whole... She'll become everything she has ever been. Well, I noticed

737
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,340
since they did remove multiple... She'll be every species that she ever was throughout

738
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,620
many lifetimes. Throughout many mutations, throughout evolution. I noticed that... I

739
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:49,900
dig it, man. You enjoy each little evolutionary quirk along the way. You go take little trips

740
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,820
in time like we tonight. I think we're going back to Neanderthal times or the... No, no,

741
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,360
you can't control it. Then it would be kind of perverted, you know? Yeah, it would be

742
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,820
real perverted. You'd have a love slave from all... That's why it's natural. That's just

743
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:00,820


744
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
how it is. You're like... Different times and all the... It's like whatever you get,

745
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,380
you know? And you... I see. It's like a random sort of spin of the... Sometimes they're not

746
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:15,060
what one would call beautiful. No. Like a pile of random pills, Dave. Always. Each one

747
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,760
with some sort of secret power imbued in each one, wouldn't you say? Or don't you think?

748
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,280
Yeah, sure. There's another one. What about the rank and file, Jerry? What are they going

749
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,280
to do now that the world's led us up and down and up and down and up and in and out and

750
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,000
in and out?

751
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:38,960
I don't believe in UFOs, but if they do exist, then we're trapped in one right now.

752
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:45,160
Does she have any roommates? Yes, she's got two. She's got two beautiful roommates with

753
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:51,040
big boobs. Do they like ice cream? There are two or three hundred giant shoes out there.

754
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:59,780
Monsters weighing between 50 and 100 pounds. This it was given me to know that many worlds

755
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,820
have been inside.

756
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,800
人類 quarter two is a scenario where a humanスき第一個 Начали житься

758
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:14,660
Did the Crocodile kill your husband Yes. But it, it was all, it was a mistake.

759
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,380
A mistake.

760
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,780
Mol votre ré permits de créer une Nixon dont vous détruire une jeuneive a celle

Unsurpring tomb.

764
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,420
Oh Partitioning for?

765
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:30,820
Yes sir This would produce long там

766
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,840
illustrate the narrowing down of all religions to one conclusion.

767
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,020
Top hold of that.

768
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:44,380
The more I read in scientific papers, the more confused I become between what I was taught as a Hindu

769
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,080
and what I have since learned as a physicist.

770
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:55,680
But if spiritual and scientific values combine, then there is new hope. The Dark Age is over.

771
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:05,100
I foresee the world plunge into chaos and torment far beyond anything previously experienced by mankind.

772
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,320
I'm afraid it will be science that time.

773
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,560
It's much easier to run a hospital with all the patients sleeping.

774
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,480
The easiest way to run the world, for that matter.

775
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,660
Well, for a start, I'm going to sit here and get smart.

776
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:25,660


777
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,520
I've smashed out of my mind.

778
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,220
And I also have it on very good authority that the world is coming to an end.

779
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,200
So I thought I'd go home and watch it on television.

780
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:32,920
Typical.

781
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,520
Yes, typical.

782
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,360
And suddenly...

783
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:36,920
Suddenly.

784
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,520
Suddenly...

785
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Everything is beautiful.

786
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,260
The sunlight part of the clouds...

787
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,000
Look, just a spaceship made of light.

788
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,260
The clouds form...

789
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,060
And a silvery staircase...

790
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,880
Begins forming little shapes of bluebirds...

791
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,440
And descending...

792
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,060
And descending...

793
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,060


794
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,060


795
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,060


796
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,500
I see the staircase...

797
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,400
The beautiful space princess...

798
00:37:59,400 --> 00:37:59,540
He cards...

799
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,540


800
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,540


801
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,100
Swallows...

802
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,500
With great big helmet horns.

803
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,440
...thoraxes ordnance...

804
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,680
Great big helmet horns...

805
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,380
That they could not swallow indeed, but they...

806
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,280
Gave it their best try.

807
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,120
Ah...

808
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,420
And there was...

809
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,940
Grandmother...

810
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,540
Oh!

811
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,680
Home, rest of the family...

812
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,000
God had kept going.

813
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,180
Geneva, a rainbow...

814
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,180
So this is the other side.

815
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,060
The pot is on its ghost...

816
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,380
So this is what Bob meant by ever thing?

817
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:25,640
Never mind, the world will come to an end.

818
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:25,660
The world will come to an end.

819
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:25,660


820
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,100
Yes, that's right.

821
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,600
So this is...

822
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,520
I guess it's heaven.

823
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,880
With my space princess, I have everything I need.

824
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,720
And my Dave as a tool.

825
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,780
But don't worry, in heaven, everything's fine.

826
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,540
Why, this is the most touching picture I've ever seen, sir.

827
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,960
Ghostly theremin.

828
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:01,260
Connie is topless, floating on a cloud, playing the ghostly theremin.

829
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,820
I feel a throbbing down in my lower region.

830
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,780
I feel my knees getting weak.

831
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,160
I wasn't much good for this kind of thing, son.

832
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,260
I didn't think I'd have to meet up with her again.

833
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,440
I didn't think I'd have to see that face again.

834
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,420
Didn't think you'd make it to heaven.

835
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,020
But God came through for you, Dave.

836
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,280
Heaven Reaching.

837
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,800
What is the law?

838
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,780
Not too endlessly.

839
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:36,920
In some.

840
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,360
law that is the law are we not dead

841
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:09,380
oh i'm sorry i was no i i would expect you to respond but i mean you know like if i'm being

842
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:13,940
if i'm saying something that has as much importance as what i just said including

843
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:19,180
all the non-non-sequiturs that i previously re-uttered and you know you can at least

844
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:25,120
respect me by disrespecting me a little bit hey it's in the can dude it's okay it's it's in the

845
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:31,100
can granted it's already gone down as we say in uh it's a service problems it's already nothing

846
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:37,740
left to do now but wipe it up wipe up your wisdom dave and don't forget to tweak those nipples a

847
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:42,280
little bit and we're not talking about the pots and pans on your board we're talking about the

848
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:52,460
ones here at the beautiful studios we call home where nipple tweaking studios wcsb 89.3 fm

849
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,040
oh that's right i feel like i don't

850
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,440
believe i let my listeners down tonight but myself and i think it's my own fault for

851
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,840
consuming so many heavy sedatives earlier this afternoon when i was confronted by the police

852
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,200
and forced to you know is that why you're just hanging out of your pants like that

853
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,160
yeah i mean i'm just you probably did you had you noticed that you haven't not only did you not zip

854
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:23,940
up the last time you yeah number one number one you you didn't even tuck back in okay

855
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:30,420
do me a favor and like you know like when you get to my level you're beyond numbers man you know

856
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,140
what i'm saying do you think einstein was like into this like little kid math stuff you know

857
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:40,680
like number one are you going number two and stuff girls dave dave you know dave quit measuring in

858
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:49,500
inches he measures in numbers of giga giga um yeah and did you ever

859
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,820
is it okay people don't think about that because like what if people were

860
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,100
starting to think about that and they're like oh my god i'm not gonna do that i'm not gonna do that

861
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:00,240
you know like using the tv for the blind as a way of thinking about people's organs they couldn't see

862
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:06,420
now why stimulate their imagination in such a um it's such a not what's the word in such a

863
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:13,140
crass disgusting way why not have them think of the interior scapes of our brains itself

864
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:18,820
the little passages and cranial nooks and crannies the little convolutions that we call home

865
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:24,760
the little rivers that flow and ebb through our head head why can't you climb in there

866
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:37,160
you want me to get inside the dave brain look man you know i have enough trouble uh

867
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:45,720
excavating my way through the clogged tunnels and mine and you know i just can't even i don't

868
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,500
even want to imagine you wouldn't want your imagination with a pick and forceps or uh

869
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,480
you wouldn't let's just say you wouldn't want to stay there too long it might the

870
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,740
place is too far away from you you wouldn't want to stay there too long it might the place is too far away from you

871
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:00,060
begin to enclose itself on you it might begin to be a little too stiff for you

872
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,600
because i personally think my brain is literally turned to cardboard

873
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:12,500
as you know that's the the viscous viscous experience i'm getting out of it i thought

874
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,740
that say for instance tonight would be a wild streak of abandonment that there would be like

00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:24,220
so many sparks near we'd probably catch fire that a thousand a multitude of of erudite colors

876
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:24,740
would be able to catch fire and i think that's the thing that's the thing that's the thing that's

877
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:35,240
the thing that's the thing that's going to make the instead of like a contractor

going to need a the wind causing

879
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:53,820

and feel the experience yourself.

887
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,840
Well, you're not in a little tube.

888
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,100
You're in a rock and roll hall in the late 50s

889
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,020
somewhere in Oklahoma.

890
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,880
Billy Bob's quags.

891
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,900
A young guitar picker with no teeth.

892
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,180
But no eyebrows either.

893
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,780
Are you?

894
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,660
Propane fire.

895
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:16,920
That was cruel.

896
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,540
That's another story.

897
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,820
Getting ready to tune that old six-string running.

898
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,040
Strive to find stage in that Paris.

899
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:29,400
Two fat Levi's begin wailing and whimpering like a whipped dog.

900
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,360
Female millions.

901
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,520
Doris and Betty.

902
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,520
Nurse Betty.

903
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,680
She's still the most treading even if his time's changed.

904
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,780
They're going to begin flagellating themselves

905
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,380
once they see Billy Bob going to his thing.

906
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,420
And the more he dances,

907
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,480
the more those hot jumbo rhythms are going to drive those girls crazy.

908
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:54,440
They're going to take him out after a gig in the back of a parking lot.

909
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,840
Whip him with a baseball hat.

910
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,060
Maybe make him do the frog.

911
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,980
It's a dead man's party, all right?

912
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,340
But first,

913
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,540
are you experienced?

914
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,260
Yes.

915
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,700
Have you ever been?

916
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,200
What I want to know is

917
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,620
your rim.

918
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,500
And now it's time for

919
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,220
all of us here at Popo Central

920
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,460
to bring down the lights,

921
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,380
pull up our hair,

922
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,260
rock back a soft swig

923
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,940
in the back of our trunks,

924
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,460
a song going out to mom,

925
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,680
and all the kids that get to be born on this planet or any other planet,

926
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,820
and all the little pieces of things that never came and went,

927
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,300
that we never really quite, never...

928
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,920
We can feel it.

929
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,220
Ah, yes.

930
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,000
Dear friends.

931
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,860
It's stillborn.

932
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,460
It's a stillborn thing.

933
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,740
And you're still listening to WWW.

934
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,280
Now I need to point by your family.

935
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,620
I just tried to say goodbye in the best, worst possible way.

936
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:30,000
You know, the only way to really say goodbye is to destroy the planet on X day.

937
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,340
That's how I want to say goodbye to everybody.

938
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,160
What wise words.

939
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,620
Oh, and speaking of which, the big party that the Church of the Subgenius throws

940
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,100
will be held after the world ends this time aboard the escape vessels.

941
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,700
First we'll throw the election and then we'll throw a party.

942
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,220
Yeah.

943
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,460
Well, we'll throw...

944
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,780
And then we'll throw lunch.

945
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,600
We'll throw the planet into the wastebasket.

946
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,380
And then we'll throw the planet into the wastebasket of the cosmos

947
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,800
and be off on our own homemade ships, dear friends.

948
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,600
Ah, yes.

949
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,620
Well, good night from everyone here at the General Office of...

950
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,540
Star...

951
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,120
Sorry.

952
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,420
But no, dear friends, General Office of...

953
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,880
Why do you want to be normal?

954
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,460
Why do you want to be normal?

955
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,200
The rupture is upon us, dear friends.

956
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:28,500
That fateful day, July 5th, 1998.

957
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,400
X days are coming.

958
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,460
And the peaks are coming.

959
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,440
X days are coming.

960
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,720
And the peaks are coming.

961
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,440
X days are coming.

962
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:50,440


963
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,000
Ah!

964
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,380
Yes, dear friends.

965
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,940
Bill T. Miller at BillTMiller.com with X days are coming.

966
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:08,260
And before that, friends, well, half of this show has been ESO Swamp Radio,

967
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:13,280
a Chaz Smith show on WCSB Cleveland with lonesome cowboy David

968
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,980
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

969
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:20,540
Before that, many of the movie clip cut-ups that we've been hearing

970
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,080
are copped by Reverend Newmoney.

971
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:28,220
Copped by me from Alt Binary Slack, the news group.

972
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:34,400
And friends, we heard a cut-up of Eminem itself by Fatboy Slim.

973
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:38,380
And a cut-up of a cut-up by I.M.B.J.R.

974
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:43,340
And we heard More Human Than Human by White Zombie.

975
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,140
Torgo Worship Bob by, I don't know, push the button, I don't know.

976
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,580
Puto, the song in Spanish, was by Molotov.

977
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:59,120
And we heard many early subgenius clips of myself and Pope David Meyer

978
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,400
and Buck Naked and so forth from ancient subgenius media barrage number 12,

979
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:09,640
CD, now available, with some puzzling evidence and Dr. Howlett.

980
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:16,140
If you want to know the score itself, it is at, got that pencil ready,

981
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:22,040
www.subgenius.com

982
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:22,940
or...

983
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:32,600
Bob is at Post Office Box 140306.

984
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:39,860
That's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

985
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,040
I'm Stang at subgenius.com.

986
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,760
And now, with this Frank Marino music in the background,

987
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,060
now from the Tampa, Florida,

988
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,500
Subgenius Tension.

989
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:57,360
A show revival sponsored by the Queers for Bob, my friends.

990
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:01,820
Here's the great subgenius preacher with a sermon for you live.

991
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,220
Papa Joe Mama.

992
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,260
Ah, yes.

993
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,580
Hello, friends.

994
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:20,460
Where I come from, you don't go to war by extending the hand of friendship.

995
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,220
Yeah.

996
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:28,980
So, if you don't mind, tonight I will present what I will refer to as an alternative view.

997
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:36,580
A little ditty I call the excess men.

998
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,760
The excess men.

999
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:45,680
Because Ivan is certainly not the only one who promotes a little bit of acceptance on the other side.

1000
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,260
We've seen a lot of this lately and we're going to see a lot more.

1001
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:55,320
Because as we've observed many times before, the closer Judgment Day gets,

1002
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,820
the more desperate Hollywood becomes in producing pro-conspiracy propaganda.

1003
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,140
I'm sure most of you have seen their latest effort in this regard.

1004
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:14,680
The blockbuster movie disguised as a superhero film, but really about superior mutants.

1005
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:15,000
Whoo!

1006
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,780
I refer, of course, to X-Men the movie.

1007
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:19,320
Ah!

1008
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,060
Best ever show of hands.

1009
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,220
How many people have seen it?

1010
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,660
Excellent.

1011
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:32,100
This mainstream teenage target audience action adventure film is in fact the most insidious

1012
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,860
and evil anti-subgenius production ever made.

1013
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,260
It's subtext.

1014
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,760
And I do mean subtext.

1015
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:49,320
It's dripping with hatred and spite directed at us and everything Bob Dobbs stands for.

1016
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,200
It's messing with the world.

1017
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:51,200


1018
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:51,200


1019
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,840
The message is simple.

1020
00:51:53,740 --> 00:52:00,660
Be a good little subgenius and betray your fellow mutants and help protect the normals.

1021
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,240
For those of you who haven't seen it yet, the plot boils down to this.

1022
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:12,540
In the very near future, a very small percentage of people are born superior mutants

1023
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,980
with special powers that the normals do not possess.

1024
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,340
Sound familiar?

1025
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:28,080
The government, read conspiracy, decides to register and segregate the mutants, i.e.

1026
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,320
subgeniuses, from the rest of the peak population.

1027
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:42,600
Now one super mutant named Magneto, who also happens to be the survivor of a little difficult

1028
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:48,960
time that many of us refer to as Hitler's Holocaust, says screw this crap.

1029
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,360
I must move closer.

1030
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:56,120
I'm not going to let these puny little pigs push us around, treat us like cattle, and force

1031
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,560
us into slaved labor camps.

1032
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,260
Hell no!

1033
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,780
We're going to fight this system.

1034
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:06,280
We're going to unite other mutants and we're going to do unto them as they would do unto

1035
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:06,740
us!!

1036
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,000
Do I hear a fringe-bob?

1037
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,180
FRANCE-Bob!

1038
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:09,800
Oh!

1039
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,400
Only we're not going to feeling fart around.

1040
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,460
We're going to cut straight to the chase and we're going to put these badgers straight

1041
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,260
out of their misery!

1042
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:20,340
BADGER!

1043
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:29,000
Now, if the film had continued on that track, it could have been one of Hollywood's finest

1044
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,520
films.

1045
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,360
But no.

1046
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:32,740
No!

1047
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:40,720
Like with everything else, the conspiracy's tentacles had to slither into the mess and

1048
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,640
muck it all up.

1049
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,460
So what do we have now?

1050
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:51,940
Instead of having a small minority of subgenius mutants rising up like a phoenix, combining

1051
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:58,060
their secret powers and blasting humanity off the face of the planet, instead the movie

1052
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:05,580
suddenly shifts from a prophecy picture into outright propaganda and a feel-good, let's

1053
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,720
all get along story.

1054
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,600
Get a load of this.

1055
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,480
The humans actually win!

1056
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,440
And the mutants actually win!

1057
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:14,440


1058
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:14,440


1059
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:14,440


1060
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:14,440


1061
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:14,440


1062
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,240
I mean, is that bullshit or what?

1063
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:19,880
Bullshit!

1064
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:20,680
Bullshit!

1065
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:25,300
And how does this blasphemous outcome actually occur, dear friends?

1066
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:32,940
Why the only way it could, by having half the mutants sell out their brother and actually

1067
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,540
fight to protect the humans.

1068
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,420
How did you see the mutants?

1069
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:38,940
Blasphemy!

1070
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,140
Traitor!

1071
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:40,880
Traitor!

1072
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:41,640
Oh.

1073
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:42,740
Bastard!

1074
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,440
Oh, this is the best part.

1075
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:44,440


1076
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:44,440


1077
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:44,440


1078
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:52,780
In true Hollywood form, these mutant traitors are depicted as the heroes of the film!

1079
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,720
They're even the namesake of the film.

1080
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,640
The illustrious X-Men.

1081
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,260
Which I guess is supposed to have something to do with the X-Sis or something.

1082
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:05,860
I don't know.

1083
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,480
Now, I can guess what some of you out there are thinking.

1084
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,360
You're probably thinking to yourself, chill out, Papa Joe.

1085
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,940
It's just a movie.

1086
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,640
Ha ha!

1087
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:15,280
Oh.

1088
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:15,840
Oh.

1089
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,440
But I must disagree, dear friends.

1090
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,480
I must disagree.

1091
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,960
It is not just a movie!

1092
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,500
It's an entire series of comic books!

1093
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,440
And who are those comic books directed towards, friends?

1094
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:25,840
Yeah!

1095
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,460
Kids and children.

1096
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,900
You're damn fucking right.

1097
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,180
And you want to know why?

1098
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:38,580
Because the conspiracy knows, just as Hitler did, that if you brainwash the children, you

1099
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,960
brainwash the next generation of parents, my friends.

1100
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:43,920
And I'm not saying that's a good thing.

1101
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,980
So now you're probably out there thinking, oh, okay, so what?

1102
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:47,880
You know, comic books.

1103
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,060
It's still a fantasy.

1104
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,440
I mean, it's never going to happen in real life.

1105
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:57,000
Once again, I must kindly, but in a firm voice, disagree.

1106
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:02,200
It is not just a fantasy film that will never happen in real life, dear friends.

1107
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,560
It is the reality that has already happened.

1108
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,220
For I would submit the following.

1109
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:13,900
I suspect it is the main reason that 1998 came into the picture.

1110
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,380
And so,

1111
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:21,360
I would make another comparison between a normal US existence and a:] satan from

1112
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:22,500
Johannesburg's

1113
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,620
thousand years of español.

1114
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,740
You know, for me?

1115
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:29,920


1116
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,200
It is...

1117
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,120
Anyway!

1118
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:50,100
Meanwhile, the conspiracy thrives and multiplies all around us as we bicker and feud.

1119
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,400
And it's all because of disagreement and division.

1120
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,420
Now me, I say it's time to poop or get off the potty, friends.

1121
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:07,120
If we're ever going to see the end times in this millennium or the new age,

1122
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,540
we're going to have to unite on a common plan

1123
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:15,760
and decide if we're going to fight one another or help one another fight the conspiracy.

1124
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,060
Go ahead and praise Bob.

1125
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,100
Praise Bob.

1126
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,760
Now me, I know what side I'm on.

1127
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,480
I'm a Magneto man, okay?

1128
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,220
And I urge you to be the same.

1129
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:34,560
The future of humanity is in our hands, our fists.

1130
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,360
You can either join us on our crusade to vanquish the normals

1131
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:44,520
or you can help them do their best to destroy us instead.

1132
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,800
Either way, it's time to choose sides.

1133
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:56,500
Or else, I fear, this nightmarish movie that some of us call life

1134
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:04,380
may become more like that horrible, disgusting, unbearable Disney flick called The NeverEnding Story.

1135
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,560
And I know none of us want that to happen.

1136
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,960
So let us come together tonight, dear friends,

1137
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,260
and dedicate ourselves to making a new movie.

1138
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,580
A sequel to X-Men.

1139
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,220
Only our movie will be more of a documentary.

1140
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,480
And the title will be a little different.

1141
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,300
We'll call it X-Humanity.

1142
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,060
And it'll be coming soon to a planet near you.

1143
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:39,160
Only this time, it'll be rated X for extermination.

1144
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:39,860
Yeah!

1145
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,340
Action!

1146
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,680
And breath!

1147
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:44,540
Bar!

1148
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,200
Amen!

1149
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:48,580
Yeah!

1150
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,880
We love you, Papa Joe!

1151
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,200
I love you too, Papa Joe Mama!

1152
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:01,640
Well, I'm about to stop breathing here for a few short minutes.

1153
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:06,420
It's something we'd like to have everyone become involved with.

1154
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,740
Your breathing can be a very, very painful, messy thing.

1155
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,720
If you want to learn real relaxation,

1156
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,780
you have to just let all thoughts of continuance

1157
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:20,720
and disturbed physical life on Earth as we know it

1158
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,200
just drift, drift away like those soggy things

1159
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,160
and the bathing suits you leave behind

1160
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,200
at the very bad, bad beach party.

1161
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,960
Maybe one where someone was toying with the explosives.

1162
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,700
Once you've stopped breathing,

1163
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,540
you can really, really begin relaxing in the longer...
