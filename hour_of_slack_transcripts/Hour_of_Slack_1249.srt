1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Somewhere in the forbidding tundra mountains of Lapland, high above the Arctic Circle,

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,640
a group of mining engineers were prospecting for copper.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,020
But what they unearthed was a story.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,280
A story that was to terrorize the whole world.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,160
I'm in there and have to dig life with father, and I mean Father Slack.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,300
The Soft Genius Power of Slack

7
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:39,480
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry

8
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,640
Let me get you radio boneheads going.

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,020
Watch out. No, no, no, no.

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,880
Okay, okay, watch out.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,980
Okay, all right, get us going.

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,180
We're waiting.

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,940
Lay before me, Earthman.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,520
Hey, he said he's going to get us going.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,220
Ivan, come on, let the guy talk.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,060
Emperor of planet Earth.

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,820
Okay, shut up, Ivan.

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,280
And I have...

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,720
I have come to destroy your beauty.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,000
The cause is going to get us going.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,140
Lamo, both of you are Lamos.

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,460
I know, I think he's in for the world.

23
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,360
The first group are right over there behind Reverend Patterson.

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,220
How do you know there's both of us?

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,220
How do you know there's not three of us being Lamos?

26
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,400
Each time he says it, he has to pay that.

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,580
Obviously, there's four of us being lame here, not two.

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,880
Both would imply a couplet.

29
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,440
Yeah, it's easy to say lame.

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,280
It's easy to say lame.

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:27,780
I can say lame.

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,040
I can say lame.

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,540
Lame, lame, lame, lame, lame, lame.

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,740
The lamest show with the lamest callers.

35
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,880
So if you get really close to the mouthpiece, does that mean you can talk a lot more loudly?

36
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,120
I don't know.

37
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,520
But you can say lame.

38
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Come on, say lame.

39
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,440
One more time.

40
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,560
Lame, lame, lame.

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,760
Oh, my God, there'll be a molestation.

42
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,300
You're an adolescent and you overcompensate.

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,220
Oh, no.

44
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,140
How many cans of Red Bull have you had?

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:52,920
Adolescent.

46
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,780
Adolescent?

47
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:55,920
Yeah.

48
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:56,940
Adolescent.

49
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,280
Adolescent.

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,480
No, I just reached puberty.

51
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,240
Hey, I have four hairs on my nuts.

52
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,260
Are you sure?

53
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,540
That just stopped the show.

54
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,640
Hey, we're cruising now.

55
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,020
That's not what your mom said.

56
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,500
I should make jokes about flame over there.

57
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,480
Because we are cruising now.

58
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,580
Now we're cruising.

59
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,440
Thanks to that caller, we're kicked off.

60
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,120
We are cruising down the road.

61
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,900
I feel the wheels turning.

62
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,200
Yeah, and I have to.

63
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,180
I feel the gears meshing.

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,940
I feel the wheels meshing.

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,300
I feel the wheels meshing.

66
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,300


67
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,300


68
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,300


69
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,300


70
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,300


71
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,300


72
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,300


73
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,940
Michael Poopy.

74
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,060
Because this is the last show of the millennium, folks.

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,560
Michael Poopy on the last show of the millennium?

76
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,040
Yep.

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,040
It is the last show.

78
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,520
The show is cooking now.

79
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,300
Have you noticed that?

80
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,640
There's a little smoke coming out of that box over there.

81
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,400
Oh, yeah.

82
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,020
Nice.

83
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,340
Eggs Benedict.

84
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,020
Smells kind of like Eggs Benedict.

85
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,600
Or you could think, some could say it smells like burning rubber.

86
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,160
Yeah.

87
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:55,920
Yeah.

88
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,800
Yeah.

89
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:56,880
Yeah.

90
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,260
Yeah.

91
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,260


92
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,260


93
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,260


94
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,260


95
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,260


96
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,260


97
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,260


98
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,260


99
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,260


100
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,980
to it in a state of hyperthermal activity.

101
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:22,020
But you know, friends, the real subgeniuses are the ones who literally, totally gave their

102
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,420
brains over to Bob.

103
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,560
Now, that turns some people off.

104
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,920
That's why we're not, maybe, we're a little faster growing than, say, the Scientologists

105
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,780
or the Mormons.

106
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,500
But we're not there yet.

107
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,120
And I think it's a lot of times because people, they see these subgeniuses who are really

108
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,800
into it, and they're acting just wrong.

109
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,060
You know, there's just something.

110
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:51,420
But friends, you can't imagine how much those are the ones who truly, truly believe in Bob.

111
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,720
They have given their brains to Bob for good, forever.

112
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,380
Forever.

113
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,120
They're never going to get those brain cells back, and they don't want them.

114
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,500
Those weren't the brain cells they needed in the first place.

115
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,380
But friends, you, too, can give your brain to Bob just temporarily.

116
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,640
You don't have to do it for all time.

117
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,520
Just say, for tonight, you know.

118
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,440
Once you've been slack, you'll never go back, my friends.

119
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,720
If you could be slack for one Saturday night, you'd never want to be pink again.

120
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,720
And, you know, as, now, some people also question the church.

121
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,820
And, you know, I'm not going to give you a track record of our track record regarding

122
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,140
ends of the world happening every July 5th or not.

123
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,420
And, as I've said before, are we going to let the Jehovah's Witnesses out-cook us?

124
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,180
Hell no.

125
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,440
But, you know, Bob has held these, they're drills.

126
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,860
They're sort of culling drills that we hold every year to weed out the faithless from

127
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,080
those who have faith.

128
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,280
And, friends, here in the Church of the Subgenius, we have no faith!

129
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,460
We don't use faith instead.

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,260
We use magic.

131
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,920
But it's a special kind of magic.

132
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,420
The Bob's keys to magic begin, his first key to magic is, get off your ass.

133
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,520
And his final key of magic is wash your ass.

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,980
And I think I'll let you worry about the in-between stuff.

135
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,580
We can't, you know, give away all our secrets for free.

136
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,360
But, you know, depending on magic is kind of tricky.

137
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,360
Because, you know, we're not going to be able to do it.

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
But, you know, in a way, what you're saying is you're feeling lucky.

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,460
You know?

140
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,200
So I'm going to go ahead and invest that money that I borrowed from my friend, because I'm

141
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,940
feeling lucky.

142
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:40,540
Friends, when you feel lucky, you taunt the subgenius demon, which is called Nihigi.

143
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,100
You taunt him.

144
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,520
It's as if you're saying, oh, Nihigi, you are ineffective.

145
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,300
You can't hurt me.

146
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,940
I feel lucky.

147
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,020
No, no, no.

148
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,700
You have to get off your ass every now and then, friends.

149
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,940
I've been constantly and I hope dispassionately considering this very problem.

150
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,260
I have come to the unalterable conclusion that man is unfit as yet to receive such knowledge,

151
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,960
such almost limitless power.

152
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,020
An invisible being that cannot be disintegrated by atomic fission.

153
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,660
That is our God.

154
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,960
That is a scientific impossibility.

155
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,320
There's your answer.

156
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,540
Only for you small minded monkey man.

157
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,400
It must have been renewing its molecular structure from one microsecond to the next.

158
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,340
Trapped in the middle of the universe.

159
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,340


160
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,340


161
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,340


162
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,340


163
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,340


164
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,340


165
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,340


166
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,340


167
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,020
Trapped in your cage of only three dimensions.

168
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,080
Take it down now.

169
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,180
Take it down.

170
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,240
We're scoping this entire life for you.

171
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,800
Now listen to him.

172
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,380
Maybe if we reasoned with him.

173
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,040
A meddling idiot.

174
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,100
As always, Abe's brain could contain the secrets of the Krell.

175
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,420
Reason.

176
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,320
As if reason would be the key.

177
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,200
They could hardly have understood what power was destroying them.

178
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,100
Reason could turn as quickly as a watch into the hand of death.

179
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,620
You have got to reason.

180
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,300
I've got to reason.

181
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,660
You could hardly have understood what power destroyed them.

182
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,220
You know, I just don't think that's the right word.

183
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,320
You're just a fool.

184
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,320


185
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,320


186
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,320


187
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,320


188
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,320


189
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,320


190
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,120
You think I've ever given me a chance to be me.

191
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
Nothing but smoke and ashes man.

192
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,480
From miles and miles we found a stream and well like it was all pink.

193
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,480
Yeah and it was slimy but we drank and where it moved we cupped our hands and we took as

194
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,880
much water as we could in because our gills were already expanding and the mutations were

195
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
starting to happen.

196
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,020
We knew it wasn't going to be easy but we tried to have fun along the way.

197
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,760
Any way we could.

198
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,020
Our sensations were expanded.

199
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,280
Not much more.

200
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,760
The pain was more and so was the joy and the pleasure so we advanced ourselves along those

201
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,160
lines.

202
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,240
He who thought unpleasurable thought was unfit.

203
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,420
He who thought painful thought was unfit.

204
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,520
He who was painful was unfit and was excluded from us or else we would perish from our own

205
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,460
suffering.

206
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,240
Sure ma.

207
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,020
Sure pa.

208
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,680
Sure ma.

209
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:53,780
Sure pa.

210
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:53,780


211
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,260
Sure pa.

212
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:54,260


213
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:54,260


214
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:54,260


215
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:55,960
Sure pa.

216
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,040
So man, what are you people talking about?

217
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:58,840
What.

218
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,560
Are.

219
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,160
You.

220
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,540
Somebody restrain on you.

221
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:01,860
What.

222
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,580
Are.

223
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:02,840
You.

224
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,900
Eat one quart of milk in a heavy utensil.

225
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,460
What are you, dude?

226
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,100
Now we're on the show in milk for fewer calories.

227
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,480
Yeah, man.

228
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,120
Is the beat doing something for you?

229
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,240
Yeah, man.

230
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,200
I'm swinging.

231
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,260
Hanging mighty low.

232
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,120
Hanging low.

233
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,060
Did you never think.

234
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,140
So, get out of the devil's seat.

235
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,180
There are insecurities.

236
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,980
How you doing there boy?

237
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,480
I think you're a killer.

238
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,020
I'm a killer.

239
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,100
I'm a killer.

240
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,260
I'm a killer.

241
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,400
Sure, yeah, yeah. Okay.

242
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,000
Well, things have taken a much worse turn.

243
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,760
Look at them all.

244
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,180
Look at them all.

245
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,800
Get up all of you.

246
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,100
Spin their heads around like that, they'll pop out.

247
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,780
We use a big old wad right on top there.

248
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,960
More recently, what if you had a shot at killing Hitler?

249
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,500
You see, it's kind of a slippery slope.

250
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,300
Justifying premeditated murder.

251
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,080
Oh, yeah, sure.

252
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,580
That's easy for you to say.

253
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,920
You keep saying that.

254
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,820
Saying you can justify murder.

255
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,920
I don't believe so.

256
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,500
I don't believe you can...

257
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,480
Well, okay, I take that back.

258
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,320
I do believe you can justify murder.

259
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,060
So now you have to kill me.

260
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,500
Under certain conditions, yes.

261
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,780
You have to kill me.

262
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
It's part of Cult Stock, 2001.

263
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,500
Eli, Eli.

264
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,600
Eli, like a dog, like a scurvy dog you are.

265
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,200
I want you to let me kill someone that's...

266
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,380
Kill her.

267
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,600
Sure, yeah.

268
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,640
Kill them.

269
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,620
Kill them all.

270
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,260
That's what they say.

271
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,640
Kill them all.

272
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,360
You killed my baby!

273
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,060
Dear Barbara.

274
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:41,280
It's a hard, hard work to blend so many different spices in your head.

275
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,540
Y'all, come back down on the flip side.

276
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,800
Because it's gonna be a groovy time here.

277
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,200
And...

278
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:50,840
Oh!

279
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,560
Oh!

280
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:53,540
Oh!

281
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,820
Oh!

282
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,240
You know I can't refuse.

283
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,080
Build it.

284
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,740
And you.

285
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,720
I believe as I did before.

286
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,180
In theory, it should work.

287
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,160
Always theories.

288
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,120
Jigsaw puzzles on paper.

289
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,320
Aren't you fellows ever positive?

290
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,460
I am golden slippers.

291
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,340
Only about doomsday.

292
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,580
Touch me, levitate now.

293
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,140
Only about doomsday.

294
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,680
Yes.

295
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,780
I have the power in my feet.

296
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,320
Look at my carpical toenails.

297
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,700
Look at the fungus, it shines.

298
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,720
I...

299
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,260
I...

300
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,380
I...

301
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,460
I...

302
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:25,580
I...

303
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,100
Now I look down at you.

304
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,640
See?

305
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,080
And I can move around the room with it.

306
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,320
You think being an insect is not...

307
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,560
Of doomsday, we are all too sure.

308
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,420
Damn that man.

309
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,400
Spend too much time with the stars.

310
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,200
You don't know anything about living.

311
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,700
The law of the jungle.

312
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,540
The human jungle.

313
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,560
I do.

314
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,780
I've spent my life at it.

315
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,640
It's coming.

316
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,040
You don't know what your civilized people will do...

317
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,820
to cling to life.

318
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,100
I do because I know I'd cling if I had to kill to do it.

319
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,100
And so will you.

320
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,900
We're the lucky ones.

321
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,500
The handful with the chance to reach another world.

322
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,500
And we'll use those guns.

323
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,940
You'll use them, Doctor.

324
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,360
Yes.

325
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,600
To keep your only chance to stay alive.

326
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,680
Yes, I'll use them.

327
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,260
I...

328
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,020
There it is.

329
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
If I can figure out how to make this thing work.

330
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,040
My friends...

331
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,400
It's backwards, sir.

332
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,660
It is imperative that you listen closely.

333
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,780
I was in the cave painting these pictures the way we saw them on the viewer screen.

334
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,020
Why were you doing that, Doctor?

335
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,160
Well, I was trying to get my hands on the picture.

336
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,160


337
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,160


338
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,160


339
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,160


340
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,260
So in case you did wipe out the human race, there'd be some record of how it happened.

341
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,220
Go on, go on.

342
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,100
I need guidance, great one.

343
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,280
For the first time in my life, I am not sure.

344
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,220
You sound like a human, not a Roman.

345
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,580
Can you not verify a fact?

346
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,960
I'm bossy.

347
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,380
You're so bossy, you ought to be milked before you come home at night.

348
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,420
Calculate your chances.

349
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,880
Negative.

350
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,420
Negative.

351
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:50,980
Negative.

352
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,000
Is there a chance that you'll be a human?

353
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000


354
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000


355
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I never had a choice between a painless surrender death and the horror of resistance death.

356
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,620
Show yourselves.

357
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,660
I think you're just a big bully picking on people smaller than you are.

358
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,100
Now, I will kill you.

359
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,380
Raise, raise, raise.

360
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,520
Because I love you.

361
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,280
And you've got to let me eat your brain.

362
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,020
Frankie, have you ever, uh, had unnatural urges?

363
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,700
Alright, I'm not gonna say that.

364
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:23,840
I just wanna say that I've had a couple.

365
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,880


366
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,880


367
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,880


368
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,880


369
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,880


370
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,880


371
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,880


372
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,880


373
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:23,880


374
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,920
Do you know the way to the Hershey Highway? Do you know the way?

375
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,480
Oh, you make me sick!

376
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,100
So how'd it feel, girl?

377
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,780
Felt good. Felt real good. Yeah.

378
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:45,840
Had this big particle on my toe and I couldn't get it off, so I had to take a pair of pliers and I grabbed that sucker and I wrenched him over.

379
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,640
What?

380
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,660
Yeah, I grabbed them pliers and took them pliers and...

381
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,840
Hello, Ivan. How you doing?

382
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,320
Oh, it's you guys!

383
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,800
Yeah, it's the show, man.

384
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,960
Do you have any pliers?

385
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,780
Yeah, I got some pliers for you, son. Right here.

386
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,920
I got your pliers swinging.

387
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,960
Must be 5 a.m. there or something.

388
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,700
And we're on the last show. This is the last, last show.

389
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,040
What'd you do? Did you get up early?

390
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,580
Oh, you wish it was the last show.

391
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,960
It's the last show.

392
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,080
We don't have any more to do.

393
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,040
It's the last show.

394
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,460
It's the last show of the millennia.

395
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:17,900
This is the last show.

396
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,940
It's the last show of the old age.

397
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,380
But now the new old age begins.

398
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,400
The new age.

399
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,480
Ever more infirm.

400
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,100
And Alzheimer's ridden.

401
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,640
We hobble on into the future.

402
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,260
Yeah, you hob. Hobnob.

403
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:44,760
For this time, young baby 2001 is actually still just old man 2000.

404
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,640
What's that dripping sound I hear?

405
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,620
Is that you dripping?

406
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,520
The morphine drip.

407
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:51,980
Are you dripping wet?

408
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,620
No, I think that's just the morphine drip.

409
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,740
What time is it there in the middle, mid-America?

410
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:09,040
Oh, here in the great salt mines underneath Lake Erie, 6.57 a.m.

411
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,580
Wow.

412
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,040
So you don't actually feel the cold and horrible temperatures that other people are stuck with there?

413
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,160
No, no, not, not.

414
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Well, I would if I let down my concentration.

415
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,240
I would let down my concentration for a little while.

416
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,600
Yeah, I know.

417
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,780
Like the Yeti, I may wander naked through the snow.

418
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,540
Yeah, I saw those pictures on the website.

419
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:35,700
Melting the snow before it hits you because of the radiant heat you generate with your mighty brain.

420
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,020
Well, it's not my brain, actually.

421
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,180
It's the mighty bowl of chili that I eat every hour to fuel them.

422
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,520
The huge cans.

423
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,280
The one-ton cans being emptied at one end and the thoughts coming out the other.

424
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:50,640
Yeah.

425
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:50,920
Yeah.

426
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


427
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


428
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


429
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


430
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


431
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


432
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


433
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


434
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


435
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


436
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


437
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:50,920


438
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,980
I was one of the benefactors of the leftover chili.

439
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:04,780
I actually, well, Dr. Drummond, please, you are my mentor in this arena of pyroflatulation.

440
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,500
Yes, it's an art form that some of us claim mastery of.

441
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,480
Some of us are still learning to be ascended masters and some are just...

442
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,560
I have often been burnt by the heat of your passing.

443
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,840
You quit your sassum.

444
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,400
Boy, I've pulled you out of your mother and I'll shove you right back in.

445
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,500
Now, you get in that truck and you skedaddle.

446
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,700
Ha, ha, I like knockers.

447
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,460
Do you ever fantasize about being killed?

448
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,420
One question, Frank.

449
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,640
This guy's screaming in here.

450
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,960
You sure he's a dead cadaver?

451
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,660
Why don't you open the door and find out?

452
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,100
No, it's all right, Frank.

453
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,980
I'll take your word for that.

454
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,360
They report they can't use the flamethrowers.

455
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,420
Can't get close because of the acid slime.

456
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:48,960
All right.

457
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,300
We'll take other measures.

458
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:50,860
All right.

459
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:50,920


460
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:50,920


461
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:50,920


462
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:50,920


463
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,880
You're going to love this place.

464
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,480
It's a dynamite camping spot and it's got a pond to piss in.

465
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,480
Sniffing butts is probably more the articulate science.

466
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,580
Not just X-Day, but the combination of X-Day, all of them subgeniuses, and Brushwood itself.

467
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,300
The weird energies of that strange campground in Sherman, New York.

468
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,480
That sounds like an immune system deficiency.

469
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,340
It changes people.

470
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,340
Yeah.

471
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,640
It does change people.

472
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,920
It's an immune system thing.

473
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,480
I've witnessed that firsthand.

474
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,860
Well, there's also transitional drifting.

475
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,660
People do things out there that they would never imagine doing.

476
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,300
Have you noticed trans-dimensional drift?

477
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,020
Back in the world.

478
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Have you noticed a trans-dimensional drift in some of the subjects or unsubjected ones who are out there?

479
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,100
Perhaps floundering in the field, kissing a rocket butt or something.

480
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,740
The next thing you know, they've disappeared off the face of the groin.

481
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,340
I believe that there is a reason for that.

482
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,660
An explainable reason for that transference.

483
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,440
Explain it if you can, but I dare you not.

484
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,300
I believe that you will not.

485
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,260
Well, what I have to say would sound so ridiculous and so ludicrous to your ears.

486
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,780
Well, as if what we've been saying so far was so erudite and clear.

487
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,740
It would almost guarantee disbelief, so I might as well go ahead and say it.

488
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:01,100
Oh, so I believe everything you guys have been saying about Mojo's huge testicles and the rockets coming out of his head and everything so far like that.

489
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,540
Well, many of us feel like we're on the wrong planet, sort of.

490
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,080
Ha, ha, ha.

491
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,680
You know, right.

492
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,620
Susie the Flusie said right hemisphere, wrong planet.

493
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,340
Ha, ha, ha.

494
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:09,920
I see.

495
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,460
It's like a trans-dimensional gate or like a Zardo's plate.

496
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,440
Maybe we really are on the wrong planet.

497
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,660
Now, you know that it is possible to move planets out of there.

498
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,640
Or to orbit to, in fact, even switch planets.

499
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:31,100
And many of us have suspected, of course, that the planet we now call Mars, the dead, empty, poison-atmosphered planet,

500
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:37,340
is actually what was once Earth, the native planet of some of us in our yeti days.

501
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,840
But it was polluted by the humans.

502
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,600
It was made red with the blood of many, many creatures.

503
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,780
And what we used to call Mars had brought it to this part of the solar system.

504
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,240
Earth.

505
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,360
One second.

506
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,300
And we now live on what was Mars, only it is now called Earth by the conspiracy.

507
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,540
And in fact, to make it, they are trying to make it more like Mars.

508
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,640
Covered with concrete or rock, whatever, concrete for now.

509
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,740
Painting the buildings red.

510
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,220
Poisoning the atmosphere.

511
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,640
Painting people's eyelids red as if they hadn't slept for days.

512
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,700
Exposing them to radiation.

513
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,380
Making them take nitrogen and subcutaneously anally.

514
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,740
Recreating Mars here on Earth.

515
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,460
And yet Mars.

516
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,340
They're secretly planning to turn it back into the...

517
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,260
Into their special conspiracy hideout.

518
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,480
But it is our planet.

519
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,460
Earth.

520
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,140
Back to Mars.

521
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,620
Earth.

522
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,720
Back to Mars.

523
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:43,080
So few astronaut Americans have been willing to come out and admit that, yes, Fred, sure,

524
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,640
many of you at this point are going, yeah, maybe Sang's right.

525
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,520
This all makes sense.

526
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,760
It's no wonder I felt so weird in high school.

527
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,420
No matter I'm such a mutant.

528
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:58,640
But what if, friends, of course you're thinking, but I'm sure they did this switch thousands of years ago.

529
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,320
No!

530
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,060
It happened in 1953!

531
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:11,820
In 1953, Earth and Mars changed places by the strange forces wielded by the conspiracy and their alien allies.

532
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,620
And to this day, the mystery of it is, how did they do it without anyone noticing?

533
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,600
It is very hard.

534
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,500
But if you look at the...

535
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:24,900
If you look at the comic books, if you look in the bottom of the wine bottle after it's been finished off,

536
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,680
you will see that what I say is true.

537
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,720
It did happen in 1953.

538
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,440
Earth was switched with Mars.

539
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,680
Okay, now let's elaborate on the substance of it, you MSNBC-ish guy.

540
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,860
You've made the point that Clinton was a dirty liar or something, whatever point you wanted to make.

541
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,240
I'm going to miss Bill.

542
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,900
Now let's have the proof.

543
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,120
I don't care what you guys say.

544
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,840
It's hard to change planets midstream.

545
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,640
Imagine Chaz over there trying to catch an RTA.

546
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,280
That is why it's...

547
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,460
I don't expect you to believe me.

548
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,640
And yet what I said was the one serious thing I've ever said on this show.

549
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,520
It doesn't matter.

550
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,240
You can burn it all down.

551
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,900
Burn the whole planet down because we're going to get off soon.

552
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,800
Let them burn it down.

553
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,540
See, Chaz, that's where we differ.

554
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,580
But see, they don't want to let us off.

555
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,800
They're trying to keep us here.

556
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,060
They're going to get off soon.

557
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,880
Chaz is like an Earth let's get off guy.

558
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,620
And I'm like one of those Earth first guys.

559
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,280
I think we should turn this into a terrestrial paradise.

560
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,060
Yeah, I believe in that.

561
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,820
Earth first.

562
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,580
Then we can...

563
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,200
Then, you know, torch the other planets later.

564
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,400
But see, they've already done that.

565
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,780
Attila the Chaz.

566
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,360
We're just now getting the idea.

567
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,680
The conspiracy's been doing this for billions of years.

568
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,660
This is the last planet of the solar system.

569
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,340
They've already done it to all the other planets.

570
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,460
Well, I can't wait to turn it to cinders either then.

571
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,300
Man, Neptune was great before the conspiracy started building walls on it.

572
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,120
We swam on Neptune.

573
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,200
We swam on Neptune.

574
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:41,900
We were like...

575
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,620
It was the air and it was the water.

576
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,400
It was like this nitrogenous stuff.

577
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,720
And it was like a jelly.

578
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,400
And Saturn didn't used to have any atmosphere at all hardly.

579
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,640
Until we blew that up too.

580
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,220
That's really a small planet actually.

581
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,960
Those rings were originally a beautiful moon sculpted in the shape of Bob's head.

582
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,900
It was our home.

583
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,980
The conspiracy destroyed it.

584
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,260
We lived in that pipe and we blew it up.

585
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,740
We're killing everyone.

586
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,980
We lived in the pipe.

587
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,820
We are the children of the pipe of the ring of the pipe of the ring of Saturn.

588
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,640
No, that was pretty good.

589
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:19,360
We are the children of the pipe of the ring of the pipe of the ring.

590
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,060
Of the children of Saturn.

591
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,540
Ring.

592
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,120
Saturn.

593
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,520
Whatever you guys are on.

594
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,060
I don't want any of it.

595
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,060
Talk about B-Wolf and all them guys.

596
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,780
Jeez, man.

597
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,080
Yes, this is the last show, folks.

598
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,400
The last show.

599
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:35,900
The last show.

600
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,700
Oh, thank God.

601
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,540
The very last show.

602
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,100
It's about damn time.

603
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,540
Can you believe it's lasted this long and they hadn't killed us yet?

604
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,120
Really?

605
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,800
That's the thing that amazes me.

606
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,440
I can't believe it.

607
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,280
So now that...

608
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,600
Uh...

609
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,340
Staying in...

610
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,060
The final line of call to Burning Man is...

611
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,820
Is Doug going to go to...

612
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,300
Well, I'm going to go to...

613
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:54,980
Yeah, to...

614
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,800
To Jane-er stock in New York.

615
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,940
Hey, get out of the way, man!

616
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,500
Hey, shut the door.

617
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:00,720
I think we just...

618
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,340
There was a terrible controversy over whether the giant subgenius party of 4X Day should

619
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,780
be held after the world ends or before.

620
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,080
Yeah, I like those questions.

621
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,800
Well, what do you think?

622
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,040
What's the vote count?

623
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,040
I vote yes.

624
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,200
Well, there was a vote and the principal...

625
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,660
I vote yes.

626
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,000
...chose to party aboard the escape vessels.

627
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,320
After July...

628
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:28,400
In other words, the celebration of X Day will begin at 7 a.m. July 5th, which is Thursday

629
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,740
this year.

630
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,220
Sure.

631
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,000
And we'll...

632
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,720
I vote maybe.

633
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,640
And it will never end.

634
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,620
This will be the X Day that never ends.

635
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,040
Bring your moon pants.

636
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,220
Breach them not.

637
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,400
Bring your...

638
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,040
And you enter the vacuum.

639
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,280
Ah, yes.

640
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,620
Wow, free watermelon.

641
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,540
Bring your moon pants.

642
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,400
And your, um...

643
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,880
Your moon rocks.

644
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,220
Bring your moon rocks, too.

645
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,380
...mellor...

646
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:53,860
Mellor...

647
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:53,880
...mellor...

648
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Bring your moon rocks, too.

649
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,460
...mitten devices.

650
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Bring your...

651
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,420
Bring...

652
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:57,760
Yeah, your...

653
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,820
Your gland shoes.

654
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,180
Bring your mattress.

655
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,320
Prairie squid.

656
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,020
Bring your mattress back with you.

657
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,580
Go to camp, man.

658
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,620
I'm bringing mine, hm?

659
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,500
Bring your old mattress back there.

660
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,480
Take her on down.

661
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,200
Back in that back room, you know, where all that stuff is.

662
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,780
Back where we made the real plan.

663
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,060
Hehehe.

664
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,520
I'm going to go.

665
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,520


666
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,520


667
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,520


668
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,520


669
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,520


670
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,520


671
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,460
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

672
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,340
Are you talking about the place where Tendively convenience waxed Sterno in the head?

673
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,220
That back room?

674
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:25,840
Yeah.

675
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,900
That was the corner room of the...

676
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,800
That was in Chicago.

677
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,720
...back of the head.

678
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,620
That was a long time ago, folks.

679
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,120
Well, you'd have hit him in the head, too.

680
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,220
Yeah.

681
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,720
You could have.

682
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,640
You're just jealous because Tendively got there first.

683
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,380
Here's Tendively dancing around naked in a tunnel, whipping a dead cow.

684
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,260
Everybody wanted some Sterno in the head back in those days.

685
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,460
I really wanted some Tendively head.

686
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,520


687
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,520


688
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,520


689
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,520


690
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,520


691
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,520


692
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:48,520


693
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,080
Now these people are old, crotchety men.

694
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,220
Sad, old bags of pissed off-ness.

695
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,460
Sad, old bags of...

696
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,260
Hey, I remember when...

697
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,380
...self genius owned the world.

698
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,400
I remember when they was the preeminent cult in America and now the Mormons have completely

699
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,180
taken over.

700
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:14,520
I've got everything in sync, and I don't mean in synchronization.

701
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,460
I take a load now and then

702
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,520
Some people flush it down the toilet

703
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,460
I depend on the sink

704
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,300
The sink

705
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,920
The sink

706
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,380
And then the plumber happened to arrive

707
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,680
And they took that little electrical snake

708
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,020
And they plunged it down the sink

709
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,660
And you wouldn't believe what they came up with

710
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,540
In the sink

711
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,580
In the sink

712
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,180
So anymore I don't do that procedure

713
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,960
Cause it stopped up the drain

714
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,180
It stopped up the sink

715
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,240
So if you've got a master bed

716
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,700
Don't use the sink

717
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,640
In the sink

718
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,760
Cause you're just giving a dog

719
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,020
To a plumber

720
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,140
Don't top up the sink with cum

721
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,880
Don't shoot your wand

722
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,880
Down the sink

723
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,920
It's not the kind of thing

724
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,440
That works against the sink

725
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,600
Don't sink your wand

726
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,600
Down the sink

727
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,900
In the day it does

728
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,080
When heaven and earth

729
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,100
Belong to one

730
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,140
You can look back in the sink

731
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,820
I hate these memories

732
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,600
I hate the sink

733
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,720
Everything goes back to the sink

734
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,140
How do you make babies

735
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,200
How do you stop births

736
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,300
Short of abortion

737
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,420
How do you do it with a sink

738
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,120
How do you stop babies

739
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,820
Without abortion

740
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,800
How do you do it

741
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,400
Well I say you do it with a sink

742
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,180
You push them little spermies

743
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,460
Down the sink

744
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,720
Oh yeah darlin'

745
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,420
Ooh, I've got this

746
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:00,960
That's done

747
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,360
Down, the sink

748
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,300
That's done

749
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:07,900
Down, the sink

750
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,140
Down the sink

751
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,660
Down, the sink

752
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:09,840
Down, the sink

753
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


754
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


755
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


756
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


757
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


758
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


759
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


760
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


761
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


762
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


763
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


764
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


765
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


766
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


767
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


768
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


769
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


770
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


771
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


772
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


773
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


774
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


775
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


776
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


777
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


778
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


779
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


780
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


781
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:09,840


782
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,500
Like

783
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:10,580
Ale

784
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:10,580


785
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,520
Hay

786
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,480
to the Alt Binaries Slack News Group.

787
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,760
And friends, we've also been listening

788
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,420
to the last show of the millennium

789
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,480
on KPFA in Berkeley.

790
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,060
The subgenius, non-subgenius,

791
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,580
more than an hour, less than a show, show

792
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,520
with puzzling evidence.

793
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,280
And normally has Dr. Howell,

794
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,500
but in this case, Dr. Philodrummon,

795
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,560
the overman, the true, one true,

796
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,660
the only overman yet so far

797
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,560
that we have in the church.

798
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,620
The only proof we have that Bob is even true.

799
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,040
Oh, no.

800
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,260
Oh, man, no wonder.

801
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,520
Well, anyway, that show was all mottered up

802
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,300
with the ESO Swamp Radio show

803
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,140
at WCSB Cleveland

804
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,280
with Professor Chaz Smith

805
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,920
and lonesome cowboy,

806
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,360
Dave, and yours truly,

807
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,040
and maybe Princess We Are Doe

808
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,860
got in there somewhere.

809
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,040
And there's some media barrage clips,

810
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,080
monster movie stuff

811
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,600
by our friend New Monet,

812
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,860
the mysterious New Monet.

813
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,620
The music in the background

814
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,700
is Einstein's Secret Orchestra

815
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,800
with Ron Slade

816
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,740
recorded just a couple of weeks ago

817
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,720
at Winterstar Symposium

818
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,500
sponsored by Ace.

819
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,480
This show is a great way to get to know us.

820
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,480


821
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,480


822
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,480


823
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,480


824
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,480


825
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,480


826
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,480


827
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,480


828
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,480


829
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,480


830
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:40,800
We're going to be back next week

831
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,280
with a song called

832
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,640
Trippy Beard P-Boy Muff.

833
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,520
Oh, speaking of hippie weird stuff,

834
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,020
I've got the schedule for Winterstar

835
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,000
where we have to work, boys.

836
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,640
What do we, do we have to slosh the kitchen

837
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,680
or do we have to remove the urinals and stuff?

838
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,400
You have to do a consciousness expanding jam

839
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,200
at the end of the evening.

840
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,540
I thought I was the P-Boy.

841
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,460
Get this, man.

842
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,780
Halim El-Dab.

843
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,000
Halim El-Dab?

844
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,200
Notice that name, Halim El-Dab,

845
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,480
who is a pharaoh,

846
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,220
an actual pharaoh?

847
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,280
I am proud to call an acquaintance,

848
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,560
perhaps even a friend.

849
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,840
Certainly, I admire his great drumming

850
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,660
I know you used to hang with Ramsey's

851
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,700
and Tootin' Common

852
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,960
and all the rest of the guys

853
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,460
that are seriously mortified.

854
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,440
He will be drumming across the great rivers

855
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,400
while you can stretch yourself out of pain

856
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,740
Oh, string theory again.

857
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,500
with Anomi, that abnormal girl.

858
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,360
You can turn yourself into a G-flat

859
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,420
or an A-shark.

860
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,220
And Halim El-Dab,

861
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,240
will guide you in slack.

862
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,580
And at 3 o'clock, actually at 3.30,

863
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,040
then I give a scientific talk

864
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,440
about the scientific basis of slack.

865
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,140
Okay, now who's the guy?

866
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,320
My new neighbor, Nathar,

867
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,960
will be doing the electronic meditation devices.

868
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,920
Do you have a new home or domicile?

869
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,480
Something is happening.

870
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,560
You don't have to say where it is.

871
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:02,980
I'm just saying.

872
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,160
We're tunneling.

873
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,960
Let me put it that way.

874
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,880
The tunnel is progressing.

875
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,520
You're taking the bags of dirt out

876
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,700
and you're making sure that nobody knows where you're going?

877
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,400
Yes.

878
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,340
We have to hide the bags of dirt.

879
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:12,960
Imagine.

880
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,900
That ain't easy.

881
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,520
Oh, and then Pope Bob Wilson

882
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,260
I noticed your toenails were filled.

883
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,380
after it doesn't,

884
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,240
will tell it,

885
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,000
give everyone a new map of their consciousness.

886
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,380
Pope Dozier?

887
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,100
Pope Bob,

888
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,540
Robert Anton Wilson

889
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,760
is his fancy author name.

890
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,120
We'll connect our consciousness

891
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,200
in the key of a flat tire.

892
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,780
But we subgeniuses know him

893
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,160
as just a regular feller pope.

894
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,040
Who appears and disappears

895
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,940
magnanimously without any reason.

896
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,140
Sometimes in a bar or a kitchen,

897
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
escutcheoning it with his...

898
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,220
It's the way.

899
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,580
It's the way?

900
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,580
It's the way it's been done for billions of years.

901
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:51,640
So what was life like to an early dungeon of the pipe of the ring of the pipe of the ring of the moon of the Saturn?

902
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,160
It was like working at Playboy.

903
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,940
It was like as if you worked at Playboy.

904
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,960
I was gonna say it's like working at Kmart.

905
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,440
The endless droning.

906
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,440
No, it's like working.

907
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:01,800
The blue shirts.

908
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,220
The red shirts.

909
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,440
It's as if you were the photographer's assistant at Playboy.

910
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:06,880
We are happy to help you.

911
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,380
No, the makeup.

912
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,780
The makeup person's assistant.

913
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,660
Can I help you?

914
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,700
At Playboy.

915
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,480
And what else is happening then?

916
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,340
The spritzerer.

917
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,260
I'm the spritzerer.

918
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,200
The one who comes and spritzes the babe.

919
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,420
What else is happening then?

920
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:18,620
You're supposed to look sweaty.

921
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,860
Um, oh and then, uh, I, that's when my page ran out.

922
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,200
But what they didn't dare print on,

923
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,700
my printer refused to print was something about a space jam

924
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,060
in the middle of the frozen night in those cabins.

925
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,160
Covered with icicles.

926
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:45,180
Did it say anything about Space Trance 1 Workshop Meditation Trance Drone?

927
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,400

¶¶

1045
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,840
Give up your civil rights from 9 to 5 every day.

1046
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,520
You know, and don't even think anything about that.

1047
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,420
You clock out from what freedom you pretended to have,

1048
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,020
and then you go home and watch TV and go to sleep.

1049
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,500
So what is left, friends, except to use every spare second,

1050
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,760
every spare stolen minute, working like a crazed lab rat

1051
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,620
with a wire up our asses on anything that will give ourselves slack.

1052
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,740
Even if that means laying in bed watching TV for hours.

1053
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,340
Praise Bob.

1054
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,740
But it could also mean energetic monkey wrenching.

1055
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,780
And I don't mean monkey wrenching of machines.

1056
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,320
The machines are our friends.

1057
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,760
You know, the robots, let them serve us.

1058
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,900
But the monkey wrenching of men's minds, friends.

1059
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,960
Yes, you know, a strong pink back is a terrible thing to waste.

1060
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:52,800
And some of my fellow subgeniuses feel that on July 5th, 19, well, 2001, whatever,

1061
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,100
when the aliens finally arrive and the dues-paying subgeniuses

1062
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,000
are ruptured up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

1063
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,720
on that day, some subgeniuses, the holocaustal group,

1064
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:12,040
feel that we should just simply wipe out every normal human being

1065
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,400
who didn't send Bob 30 bucks.

1066
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,200
Now others, like such as the evangelicals,

1067
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,740
the schism that I got stuck with,

1068
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:29,780
we believe that, you know, why waste them if you can put them to work, you know?

1069
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,200
If we can control their drone-like behavior, like is already being done,

1070
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,200
like the toy robot stick men they already are,

1071
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,760
why don't we do it, you know?

1072
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,760
Now, how each individual does this,

1073
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,420
that's between you and Bob.

1074
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,480
Unlike every other conspiracy and religion,

1075
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,520
we're not going to tell you what to do or what to think.

1076
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,000
We'll just tell you how to think.

1077
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,180
That's the, really, that's the great thing about this church, friends,

1078
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,700
because only you pay Bob to tell you what you really think slack is.

1079
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,080
No other subgenius will even try to tell you what your slack is.

1080
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,320
And the real subgeniuses, they know that,

1081
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,640
that if they could telepathically gaze deep into the soul of another subgenius,

1082
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,100
all of the other ones would seem utterly incomprehensible and completely insane

1083
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,220
at the basis of their very soul.

1084
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,060
And they are!

1085
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,000
But we know that, and that is the difference.

1086
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,400
Praise Bob and hail Connie.

1087
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:36,800
Whoo!

1088
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:38,840
Ugh!

1089
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,820
Soon a Star Wars battle will be fought among the planets,

1090
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,240
and the headquarters of these spirits will be transferred to the Earth.

1091
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,880
Who are these ETs?

1092
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,160
Lucifer and his fallen angels,

1093
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,820
the devil and his demons.

1094
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,840
Who's behind it all?

1095
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,720
What this mysterious ET called Satan.

1096
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,800
We must have all good, young blood for this kite war.

1097
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,440
The evil is free.

1098
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,540
May God have mercy on us.

00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:06,680
Praise Bob.

1123
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,600
Good luck.

1124
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,640
The Dobsian gene pool has expanded.

1125
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:13,720
Incrementally.

1126
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,440
Have you ever heard of insect politics?

1127
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,480
Those are the best.

1128
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,340
Insects.

1129
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,380
We don't have politics.

1130
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,100
No, not bad.

1131
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,380
But insects are sex.

1132
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,760
They're very brutal.

1133
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,060
Yeah.

1134
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,200
No compassion.

1135
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,900
No compromise.

1136
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:31,900
No feeling.

1137
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,880
We can't trust the insect.

1138
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,580
I'd like to become

1139
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:42,900
the first insect

1140
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,580
politician

1141
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,380
you see, I'd like to.

1142
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,800
And don't we have one?

1143
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,820
Isn't George W.

1144
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,000
I'm afraid, John.

1145
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:52,620
W.

1146
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:53,600
W.

1147
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,940
I don't know what you're trying to say.

1148
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,160
I like what you're saying.

1149
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,080
I'm saying, I'm an insect.

1150
00:44:59,360 --> 00:44:59,800
Yes.

1151
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,960
I'm saying I'm an insect.

1152
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,660
Who dreamt he was a man.

1153
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,260
Yes.

1154
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,360
And loved it.

1155
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,560
Loved it.

1156
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,880
But now the dream is over.

1157
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:11,980
Now the dream is over.

1158
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:12,800
I know now.

1159
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,560
The insect is awake.

1160
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:21,040
We're all insects who dreamt we were men.

1161
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,420
But now the dream is over.

1162
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,060
They're saying I'm an insect.

1163
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,740
At the board of unemployment, they're saying I'm an insect.

1164
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,040
At the job I'd like to get, they're saying I'm an insect.

1165
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,600
My church and in my home, they're calling me an insect.

1166
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,660
And your insect has arrived.

1167
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,020
You can just step right on it here.

1168
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,800
As you're off, you'll fly again.

1169
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,200
I think I...

1170
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,800
Uh-oh.

1171
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,220
Call me an insect, man. I'm sick.

1172
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,880
Death of a fly.

1173
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,060
Death of a fly.

1174
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,100
Death of a fly.

1175
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,840
Death of a fly.

1176
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,280
Death of a fly.

1177
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,880
Death of a fly.

1178
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,660
Death of a fly.

1179
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,040
Death of a fly.

1180
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,420
Death of a fly.

1181
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,700
Death of a fly.

1182
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,020
Death of a fly.

1183
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:28,320
Death of a fly.

1184
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,100
By the way, Ivan, have you ever listened to this show on KPFA.org?

1185
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,360
I just did.

1186
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,120
I listened to the whole first half of it just this morning, but...

1187
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,240
It was your show.

1188
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,780
It was the same damn show.

1189
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,940
CD that I just sent to you

1190
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,720
only if it sounded all watery.

1191
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,780
That's right, because we were upstairs conferring.

1192
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,040
Yeah, we had to be upstairs conferring

1193
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,480
to get my drift.

1194
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,660
If you catch my

1195
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,460
mean in there.

1196
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,080
Let me do some more show here.

1197
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,860
We had this Norton show.

1198
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,460
Oh, man, this is a great show.

1199
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,160
All right.

1200
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,080
I think this show's been stepped on.

1201
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,640
See, that's our version of Popus Lilith

1202
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,600
doing her, you know,

1203
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,720
hey, is that a frop?

1204
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,260
I thought that was

1205
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,360
hilarious, actually.

1206
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,540
And you know what's funny?

1207
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,500
I recognize it right away as Popus Lilith.

1208
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,560
It was Popus Lilith pretending to be a guy.

1209
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,460
Did you know that in his lifetime,

1210
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,340
I'm going to give you a little fact

1211
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,460
here, Reverend Stans,

1212
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,420
that in his lifetime, the average person

1213
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,080
will have eaten, I know this assumes

1214
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,440
that they're not a vegan

1215
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,000
or a vegetarian,

1216
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,440
but they will have eaten 14 cattle,

1217
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,620
12 sheep,

1218
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,700
2 calves, 23 hogs,

1219
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:42,860
35 turkeys,

1220
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,720
770 pounds of fish,

1221
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,060
and 880 chickens.

1222
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,320
I heard it was thousands of chickens.

1223
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,880
Well, yeah, it could be thousands by now.

1224
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,620
I mean, how does that help us with our last short of the lalunium?

1225
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,060
Less calves and more chickens by now.

1226
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,520
I don't eat as much veal as I used to.

1227
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,480
Only 14 cattle, but they're big cattle.

1228
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,280
They're like ox.

1229
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,480
I don't even want to think about what they do to calves.

1230
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:07,940
Calves.

1231
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,280
Oh, they torture them mercilessly

1232
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:10,700
before they eat.

1233
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:10,700


1234
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,800
Before they kill them and feed them to us.

1235
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,580
They make us eat them.

1236
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,480
But that's okay because it's people doing it.

1237
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,680
It's not other calves.

1238
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:19,540
Yeah, it's okay.

1239
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,420
It would be brutality if it was another cow doing it.

1240
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,060
My God, that would be unthinkable.

1241
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:24,720
That would be.

1242
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,140
I couldn't think about that.

1243
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,260
As long as I know that's not happening.

1244
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,840
By the way, folks, if you're watching on Channel X,

1245
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,140
you can see Ivan saying eating psychopops.

1246
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,600
I've heard that do that.

1247
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,460
They forced the animal's parents

1248
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,300
to do it in other foreign countries.

1249
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,320
Boy, it's going to be an exciting,

1250
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,360
subgenius show.

1251
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,700
The one and two's gone.

1252
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,040
In some foreign countries,

1253
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,860
they force tigers to eat antelopes.

1254
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,340
They force lions to eat zebras.

1255
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,500
Did you know that...

1256
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,620
That's how cruel people are to animals.

1257
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,960
In this country,

1258
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,420
they force cats to eat songbirds.

1259
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,680
We raise house cats

1260
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,900
so that they can go out and kill the songbirds.

1261
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,500
And that's why we have so many bugs.

1262
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,040
Good night, Ford.

1263
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,180
Four hundred million girls

1264
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:12,760
were interviewed

1265
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,080
after why they had

1266
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,040
their gentleman, Beebees.

1267
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,500
They said,

1268
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,680
not just the words,

1269
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,760
but Beebees.

1270
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,080
I don't believe I'm crying, Steven.

1271
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:22,780
No.

1272
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,740
I will when they make me

1273
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:25,500
feel conscious, though,

1274
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:25,860
won't they?

1275
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,960
You figure that out if you want to.

1276
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,620
They instigate wars,

1277
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,400
terrorism,

1278
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,600
assassinations,

1279
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,340
murders,

1280
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,020
rapes,

1281
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,240
and every other evil act

1282
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,140
committed globally.

1283
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,220
The Soviets,

1284
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,300


1285
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,300


1286
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,300


1287
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,300


1288
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,300


1289
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,300


1290
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,300


1291
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,300


1292
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,300


1293
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,300


1294
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,300


1295
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,300


1296
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,660
You don't know what Jim Jones is all about. You can't even follow him.

1297
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,560
These are not just the words, the beats.

1298
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,460
The fertility rights of the jungles are the same beats

1299
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,600
incorporated in this modern rock.

1300
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,000
We haven't gotten next to him, but I've got all kinds of things in store.

1301
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,800
Who and what are these ETs?

1302
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,680
Who created them and why?

1303
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,680
Can their existence be proven?

1304
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,380
Sex on the street.

1305
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:11,860
You who are stupid piss ants and reptiles and lower than the primates,

1306
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,660
you can make a hoopy if you want.

1307
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,920
Sex on the street.

1308
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,440
So you can make your hoopy while I do.

1309
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,780
Do you feel blind? Are you mad?

1310
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,780
Do you feel like moose about to run planet?

1311
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:32,220
That's where the music comes up and everybody gets really, really, really scared.

1312
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,460
What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen this?

1313
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,360
Man, this has been a lot of fun.

1314
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,600
It's been a lot of fun because we've had the...

1315
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,600
We've had everybody here tonight.

1316
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,220
We've had the only three important people in the Church of the Subgenius.

1317
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah, that's true.

1318
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,880
Phineas, me, and Wellman.

1319
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,620
Wait, let me look at my card here.

1320
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,720
Hey, what? What?

1321
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,600
Yes, you've been listening to the last show of the Millennium.

1322
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:59,380
Only the three most important, but not the greatest of all subgenii.

1323
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,120
Where was Bob in all this time?

1324
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,360
Well, Bob's just a made-up...

1325
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,280
Bob's a made-up guy. Don't worry about that.

1326
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,140
And where then was Bob in this time, son?

1327
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,300
I'll tell you about him.

1328
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,340
Bob's in your mother.

1329
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,900
Where are you thinking of Bob?

1330
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,500
If I were one of the subgeniuses, I'd claim that I made up Bob, right?

1331
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,260
About now.

1332
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,040
Did you even have the common decency to pull your knife out of Bob's belly that day, eh?

1333
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,220
I'll tell you where he is, Stans. He's at your mama's house.

1334
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,020
Eating the black stuff inside your skeleton.

1335
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,800
I was going to ask, sir, what about the black stuff?

1336
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,980
Hey, cut your belly open and I'll show you the black stuff.

1337
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,360
I'm going to show you the black stuff.

1338
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:34,360


1339
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:34,360


1340
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:34,360


1341
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,900
I'd like to rub your little round belly with the black stuff inside your mother's skeleton.

1342
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,660
Is Sal there?

1343
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,560
The rabbit suffer.

1344
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:42,600
Is Sal there?

1345
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,400
Sal?

1346
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,040
I'm going to go to the rabbit stew.

1347
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:46,900
Sal?

1348
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,020
Sal who?

1349
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,800
Sal Army?

1350
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,580

00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,120

00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,500
I did that finally.

1431
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,460
And for the promise.

1432
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,940
The promise of Mojo World is so great.

1433
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:27,800
It is.

1434
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,380
So great.

1435
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:29,700
Grandiose.

Yes.

1438
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,100
Ah.

1439
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,100

00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:35,600
I will.

1441
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,280
And I did.

1442
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:38,840
It pulls and tugs at me.

1443
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,420
Like a Pied Piper.

1444
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:47,140
I'm like a rat of Hamlin wanting to follow the promise of Mojo World.

1445
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:51,300
That's www.pandromeda.com.

1446

Get to work.

1456
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,380
This man.

1457
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,100
Legume has slack.

1458
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:06,980
If you call him a man.

1459
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:07,620
Take it away.

1460
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,900
Has designs on your consciousness.

1461
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,640
That was an actual quote wasn't it?

1462
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,800
Look into your computer screen.

1463
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,820
Don't you see what's happening?

1464
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:18,100
Your mind is being Mojo-ized and you don't even know it.

1465
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,580
Stand back Dr. Grineker.

1466
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,720
I have to disconnect the wires.

1467
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,160
It's okay Dave.

1468
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:22,760
It's a problem.

1469
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:23,520
I've seen Dave.

1470
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:23,800
I've seen Dave.

1471
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:23,800


1472
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:23,800


1473
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:23,800


1474
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:23,800


1475
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:23,800


1476
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,840
Don't freak out on it.

1477
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,060
Just accept it.

1478
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,580
It's the new paradigm.

1479
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:32,680
I have seen Dave get freaked out just looking at an ordinary videotape of computer animation.

1480
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,360
Just some real trippy computer animation.

1481
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:41,320
And Dave late at night we exposed him to this stuff and he was going it's getting too.

1482
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,480
This is too intense.

1483
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,040
They're going to watch us back.

1484
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:44,720
He watched it.

1485
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:45,400
It's all virtual.

1486
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,520
Nobody has a real life anymore.

1487
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,580
He pulled his head right up to the screen and he said.

1488
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,780
I need blue light baby.

1489
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,940
I need blue light baby.

1490
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:53,800
I need blue light baby.

1491
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:53,800


1492
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:53,800


1493
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:53,800


1494
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:54,580
I need blue light.

1495
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:47,380
I need blue light baby.

1496
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,080
I see you a

1497
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:51,120

00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,400
I will follow your steps

I will stay on the way

00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,840
I will go through the night

1501
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,440
And save the night

1502
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,660
I will stay on the way

1503
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,340
And save the night

1504
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:19,020
I will go through the night

1505
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,260
And save the night
