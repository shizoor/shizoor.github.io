Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Salak, and saint of saints on planet Earth.
You have to love Bob. He loves you, but you love Bob. You have to.
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?
He'll kill you. He'll Bob you out.
He'll Bob you out, folks. You heard it here first. If you don't love Bob, he'll Bob you out, man.
You are letting yourself go. A little more. And a little more.
Every nerve. Every tongue.
He has 92.9% air.
I'm dead.
I'm dead.
That's Texas.
See you, Tristel.
I'm dead.
I'm dead.
I'm dead.
So nice to be with you again.
Start a new week together?
Tomorrow, tomorrow, we'll start the day tomorrow with a song or two.
I'm not the only solo.
Choose not.
Hit.
Run, run, run, run.
I must leave your planet now
and return to a world of cold and unemotional galaxy beings.
I will give them my report and I will be destroyed.
I have failed in my mission, not because I am weak,
but because you are stronger.
Kimi tobi, Kimi tobi.
We call this reality a national today charge the Argentine government
with frequent violations of human rights of the period.
Bone, code, nucleus, also by the house.
Blue.
Blood.
Turn into sign of host.
Some brave and right to cheer.
All is your name, nature and joy.
You look up and I'll be gone.
Bit by bit I came for you, for you, I came for you,
but you did not heed my urgency.
Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today?
Make it a camp to be out in the cold.
Watching all the tag girls.
Oh.
They shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
Now, yeah, we got for you.
I'm cleaning, too.
We're cleaning our time.
We're cleaning.
We're cleaning our time.
Oh, we?
We're the communication people.
People whose talk is strictly state of the art technology.
It's disposable, reversible, reusable with almost any leading round of our bill,
including our box line, yours.
Hey, booboo, I'll save you.
Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop.
Hey, you talk to me.
Oh, oh.
Number nine.
All to see.
The twist.
A ride.
Can you draw me on him?
Can you draw me on him?
I remember a wild fetch.
A guy standing on the train station in the rain with his eyes kicked out.
Go ahead and shoot him.
He'll be doing me a favor.
That old monsieur Mr. Dancy for pain.
My nose told me that I've come out of my hell the way you described it.
You said I'd be better dead than alive.
Dripping legs hanging from their backs.
Oh, boy.

Station identification.
Mr. President, look out!
KKD, San Francisco.
I scare myself when other bubbles run.
I cast away as they pour out of the atmosphere.
Seven-and-a-half minutes, station, to that end.
So come to London, England.
You are here to participate in an atomic bomb.
How your baby has gone down.
Oh, my God.
And it was radiation from heaven that whooshed down the city.
It was very devilish, this city.
It was God's fire.
And God said, grab all your stuff.
And they made all these deals.
And the evil just kept going up and up and up.
And God just turned around right then with a whoosh.
And he opened the sixth seal.
And behold, the sun became black as sackcloth.
The full moon became like blood.
And the sky vanished like a scroll that has rolled up.
And I saw an angel call to the birds of midheaven.
Come, gather for the great song.
Come, gather for the great song.
To eat the flesh of man.
Plasma palamita, avloquitas vala bodhisattva.
But the bodhisattva realizes that all five scoundrels are empty.
He is freed from the cycle of birth, death, and suffering.
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
They're all unsaved, you know, and unwashed.
The great unwashed are not so great.
Don't let those eyes roll back in the head of you.
And the unsaved are only great because we still haven't got their 30 bucks.
No frothing.
They're potentially great.
But the pink can never be great.
The pink is like a blind, deaf snake crawling on the floor of a pitch black cave.
But old speedunker Bob, my friends, he's got a flashlight.
And he's got a bucket and a long, sharp dick.
And soon enough, you will be searching for dobs on the scaly roof of your mouth, my friend.
It's not a scaly thing.
There's a man searching for dobs on the scaly roof face of another person's mouth.
Does anyone believe anything anymore?
No, they believe more in soaps.
Except the midriff.
Soaps thrown in anthracite are the now common mediums for getting the message across.
I only honor the current marketing.
Quirk.
What is the current marketing?
16-year-old midriff.
16-year-old midriff?
The halter top.
The teenage halter top.
Yeah, that's what's going on in all the test markets.
Oh, that's this year's model.
Yeah, it's fine with me.
Next, it'll be the back of the knee.
That's fine, too.
Yeah, but...
I'm telling you, from Columbus to Utah...
So you'll buy it as long as it's the buying part.
No, he sells it.
You download it from the internet.
Like the great faucet of pornography.
Spewing and spewing.
He does not buy.
No, as a cultural motivation.
Yeah, sure.
Well, my cultural icon would be perhaps to see...
I back him up.
To see, like...
Have you ever seen, like, a religious picture of the Virgin Mary?
Oh, it's hippie.
Maybe hit me one more time.
Showing her midriff.
I wonder what kind of psychic impact that would have on people.
You're hitting them with two things at one time.
Your fist and your soft-gloved foot.
You know what I mean?
Or the...
Yeah.
No, I know what you mean.
Yeah, yeah.
I know what you mean.
You know what I mean?
You're sneaking into the...
It's like being under the waterfall.
Yeah.
Only you're behind the waterfall.
Well, that's more...
You're not getting directly wet.
Yeah.
You're just sort of enjoying the spray coming from the...
Indirect wetness.
...flow.
Now, see, that should be the marketing ploy's...
...the strategy name.
Indirect wetness.
I think people could understand that easily.
Especially what it has to do with zygotes.
Killer sperms.
Perhaps that blue, blue mansion on the top of that green, green hill right there.
Where so many thousands...
...of folks like you have gone before...
...will walk through that door...
...taking a nocturnal omission through the backyards.
Maybe smoked a little pie in the oyster beds...
...or hung out by the farm...
...waiting for Dad to come back.
But no.
He's never coming back.
But the dead must come back.
Sooner or later, heaven can't last forever.
Soon the dads will walk the earth again.
I'm sorry, son.
The dead will never walk the earth again.
Unless, of course, someone...
...with a very sharp little brain like yours...
...can figure out the proper sequence of these syllables...
...to reanimate the flesh.
Repeat after me.
But it must be your inflection, not mine.
It must be your inflection, not mine.
Not that.
No, no, no, no, no.
The secret words.
Now hold your hand over the top of your head...
...so as not to let any emissions...
...come out of the top.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll say it's a...
...rock and roll, baby.
...was the part of the scene.
Going to the rhythm now, I guess.
Oh, he was about to give the secret words...
...and Chaz is sitting here looking at internet pornography.
Just come...
Chaz, you've got a computer at home.
You could do this.
I'm singing rock and roll.
You can make...
Oh, you can't listen to rock and roll...
...and look at internet pornography at the same time.
Rock and roll.
Rock and roll.
Oh, look what he's doing.
Look what came out of his ear.
His hairy, hairy ear.
Gross.
The Bonobo sect will now come to order.
Oh, oh, most of all...
Most of all, you're not supposed to get up on the console...
...and do the same thing to the monitor.
Now I got this.
Bonobo, bonobo, bonobo, bonobo, bonobo, bonobo, bonobo.
She's saying it over and over again.
Bonobo, bonobo, bonobo.
Save your phone cup for the revival...
...at the Euclid Tavern on May 12th.
Oh, my breath.
Save up that spunk!
Not that I practice what I...
You're a spunky punk.
All good listening mums and...
You know our...
...out there in listening land...
...should be aware of the sexual dangers...
...of copulating with the noble monkey.
Hey, speaking of sexual...
Stick to your own species.
Stay with your own species.
Now, it's a good way of procreating the right species.
That's all about really doing it with mums in America.
Oh, better.
It's a metaphor, man.
Yeah, man.
You're a monkey.
It's a metaphor, my man.
Ah, yes.
The bishop carries some music along with us in the background.
And welcome to Hour of Slack number 785.
Ah, yes.
We listened to a little bit of recent ESO radio on WCSB Cleveland live there.
Thanks to Chaz Smith.
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
Getting ready for the Euclid Tavern revival,
which will probably be going on about the time that you hear this.
The rest of the show, a lot of it is from Hour of Slack number 106,
back around like 1987.
And, in fact, this rant I'm about to play is even older than that, I think.
And somebody else saved this off the internet.
It's a...
Oh, what the hell.
Here it is.
Ah, yes, friends.
I'm all hooked up.
And ready to answer your questions.
Now, we've been getting letters and phone calls from noble subgeniuses out there asking,
Reverend Stang, how can I be more subversive?
How can I be of more service to Bob in bringing down the conspiracy that enslaves us?
And, friends, I'm afraid that that is entirely up to you.
Now, the conspiracy will tell you.
How to be more subversive against it.
So we sure won't.
But I can give you one helpful hint, friends.
There's nothing wrong with looking normal.
If you want to be more subversive, friends, you don't have to show off about it.
If you were a uniform, like a high-fashioned punk haircut,
or leather and spandex and whatever,
unless it's really extreme, friends,
you're just playing along with the conspiracy,
joining a conformity of nonconformists.
You're labeling yourself as someone who the conspiracy doesn't really need to worry about.
Because you're going to follow a predictable pattern.
One that they've co-opted already.
But what kind of subversion are we talking about anyway, friends?
Friends?
Being down the state?
Blowing up polluters?
Nay, nay.
That only kills people, friends, and gets you in jail to boot.
It's stupid.
But not stupid in the right way.
Bob said,
Bob said,
Thou shalt kill none but me.
Unless they're literally about to kill you or if they insult your ancestors.
That's what Bob said.
And, you know,
there's no such thing as a subversion.
There's nothing wrong with technology, friends.
We don't need to subvert technology.
After all, only technology is the only thing we've got to clean up the mess we already made.
So, who are we trying to subvert?
The Republicans?
Oh, friends, an awful lot of subgeniuses are Republicans.
But, you know, subgenius doesn't mean left-wing pinko or right-wing anything.
It's not a thing.
It's not a thing.
It's the spy who's going to send an invitation to the United States.
It's the good guy that's going to send a message to the United States.
It doesn't matter what party is in control.
As long as none of the parties really have that much control over how much you party.
Besides, what you're fighting ain't just a political system.
I mean, as political systems go, the U.S. is one of the least evil.
And just as Jesus is okay, it's just that some members of his fan club make him look bad.
Same goes with Bob and the Bobbies.
Surely some of you have met nerds on the street who started trying to talk Bob at you and you were just embarrassed.
Well, friends, see, the conspiracy is a great combination of things.
Work is one of the main ones.
That's how you're really controlled, friends.
You have to work for someone else to make a living.
Now, the subgenius actually likes to work at what he likes to work at.
But that's the rub and the bub, my friend.
The conspiracy is also ancient customs and new invented customs.
It's a whole background attitude.
The conspiracy is an attitude.
An attitude of hatred.
For anything weird.
So what you want to subvert, friend, is that attitude.
Now, some strange things are bad.
But all great inventions and ideas started out as strange ones.
So if you want to subvert the government or some manufacturer or blow buildings up,
that's just what the conspiracy wants you to do, my friend, so they can catch you.
Make you look like a kook in front of millions.
Now, history proves that every time...
you overthrow something overnight,
ditch some old government,
what replaces it always ends up just as bad.
We have to break that cycle, friends.
And this isn't anarchy we're talking about.
Anarchy is just another political system.
Just like atheism is just another religion.
To truly subvert, my friend, you work alone at your own pace, casually, but with alertness.
To subvert the attitude of hatred.




To use my own super cool, scuttly self as an example.
Oh, darn person, I don't really...
Normals who can't possibly appreciate it anyway.
That just makes them hate weirdness more.
I don't really appear...
You should like a mad prophet.
...abnormality, my friend.
You have to break them in a little at a time.
It depends.
And you can't indiscriminately...
hate all normals,
because that only proves that you are a normal yourself,
because you don't understand yet...
To use my own...
...what you call normals are actually weirder than you are.
Use my own super cool, scuttly self as an example.
Now, in person, I don't really appear like a mad prophet of the airwaves.
I very deliberately look like an innocent computer.
I'm not a whiz or something.
If a policeman stops me for speeding, I look like a regular citizen.
And part of me is.
And so he doesn't look in the trunk to see if I'm carrying 5,000 copies of subgenius pamphlets
to hand out to grade school kids, which I am.
Get away with murder this way, friend.
And that time the Secret Service came to my house.
They took one look and said,
Oh, he's just a poor humorist.
He isn't building bombs.
Not physical bombs.
Nay, my friends.
But me and perhaps many of you are from that 1970s post-hippie nihilistic generation, more or less.
And aside from not working for a living,
I and perhaps you are still that same devious hippie.
Not a commie, nay.
Not a pinko.
But a soldier for slack.
A warrior against the conspiracy of the normals.
And so you truly suffer to smite them.
But not physically.
Smite them psychologically.
With your jokes.
Your cryptic statements.
Your band.
Your paintings.
Your weird car.
Your whole attitude.
Not just your haircut and clothes.
My God.
The normals.
They can wear weird haircuts and clothes.
And they do it all the time.
If they are normals, my friend,
they'll recoil in fear and jealousy
to see a free man or woman.
But for latent subgeni who are ripe to be saved,
you are setting a good example
to be weird in your own way.
Achieve slack in your own life.
My friend and those who are worthy
will turn toward it as towards a beacon
as a moth dives headlong into the flames.
They're not trying to steal your slack
or to imitate you,
but merely to see what is possible.
Then and only then will they learn
to pull the wool over their own eyes.
So you don't have to talk about Bob, friends.
They have to just stumble upon Bob
in their own sweet time.
And I'm not saying,
be yourself.
Quote, unquote.
There are too many yourselves.
You might end up being your own
conspiracy normal lynch mob self.
You must try to try not to
achieve the development of your Bob self.
That in you, which is Bob-like.
And there is no rule book for this, my friend,
except the one.
The one you make
and the one that you buy
from Bob.
Praise Bob!
Help me, somebody!
Pull the lever!
Down you go!
Help!
I gotta keep sweeping, sweeping
Before the bill, the bill, the bill, the bill
I see
The thing I got to keep on, keep on
I gotta keep up sweeping
Sweeping and sweeping
Get off my feet
I gotta keep sleeping, sleeping
You see like I see Bob
Seem like I see Bob
It's still, still said
Would you clean
It is still
emerged
Go ahead and clean
and clean
because you're learning
about him
Is a good $2 room
Hun Adjusttı
Why I think
he's a good $2 room
Why do you think
you're learnin'
is a good $2 room
is a good $2 room
aboron
Oh, it's pretty, friends.
But how long would I make you listen to it?
That weird Captain Beefheart mix that just ran through there was from some folks in Canada, Toronto, called Mystery Tapes.
John Oswald.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I was trying to get it back, but it's turning pretty black.
State dip on the coals.
Yeah.
Wiener on the foil.
The skin begins to boil.
I dropped it in the soil.
I thought that it was spoiled.
So I washed it with a hose and fed it to Aunt Rose.
Wiener on the foil.
Burgers on the grill.
Burgers on the grill.
Burgers on the grill.
By Bob Rivers.
Thanks to Why Ask Why.
Ask Why.
Posted to alt.binaries.slack.
Oh, and the Beefheart cut up there was by John Oswald of Plunder Phonics.
My frosty brown lips and my bright blue culo have often done the man-volda.
Listen to the beginning of this, Dave.
Listen real careful to the beginning.
La entrada.
Listen when the guitar comes in.
La entrada.
Right on it, baby.
Okay.
Okay.
That's the way we don't want you to do it at the Euclid Tavern.
I would not.
I would not remind you.
Well, you don't have to worry about that.
It's Saturday week.
When is it?
Saturday week.
May 12th.
May 12th.
Yeah.
I got to go to Madison, Wisconsin this weekend.
Really?
We're playing the University of Wisconsin.
That's a wonderful place to go and hang out with.
Your team is playing the Madison team?
That's an all-woman team, isn't it?
Actually.
Not all women.
The Cobra Verde is against the Madison Badgers.
The Madison Monkey Girls.
The Vicious Monkey Girls.
The Wisconsin Badgers.
Actually.
I stayed in Madison.
We're playing the Vast Seamans next week.
Well, we're heard in Madison on WORT.
That wonderful station.
Home of the wars.
I stayed at the Monkey House when I was in Madison.
Me and Jesus and Legan.
And you were forever changed because of the experiments.
Oh, man.
Here's that chorus part.
Those cows know how to experiment.
Listen, if you do this one, why don't you listen?
Okay, but listen.
Listen to this.
Listen to this.
Right here.
Right here.
Right on it.
Right on it.
Chaz is reminding me of everything you reminded me of practice the other day.
And it'd be really good if you could look like Clint Eastwood when you did that.
Well, I'm going to have to wear all this.
Yeah, of course.
You're going to need a hat down low.
With a gun.
I'm going to need all this.
Yeah, you need a gun on.
You need a little.
Can you grow a couple days growth for that show?
Oh, yeah.
That's no problem.
I grow a couple days growth in 45 minutes.
Yeah.
I don't know if you guys notice that.
Usually when I come up gray, just shave.
Can you grow it for like three days and then die?
You were down on speed at the end of the show.
It's more like one of those floor on purple things.
Like, remember the old days of the trobs?
You know, girls would put on their dashboards and stuff, and you'd know it was okay to try
and jump them at the wrong time?
Yeah.
Yeah, that was when no didn't mean no.
When it meant no.
Do you know fighting, please?
Yeah, it's not bleepo.
The only reason I'm answering is because I said he might call.
Bleepo, I don't think you made it into town this week.
No, no, but he said he might call anyway.
All right.
All right.
Okay, here it is again.
Oh, oh.
Oh, oh.
With the fuzz box.
We're playing this.
If you want to come and see this song live, come to the Euclid Tavern if you want to see
this.
May 12th, Saturday night.
Bend sympathy for the devil, right?
Yeah, we haven't even worked.
We haven't done that yet.
And Saint Anne will be there himself.
Well, Dave's going to sing sympathy.
Who is Saint Anne?
Saint Anne.
Wait, you missed it.
You missed it.
What?
This is important.
Dave is going to sing sympathy.
If I can remember the words, I'll sing it.
I'll sing it.
I was working on a takeoff called Sympathy for the Salesman.
Well, we were working on a takeoff called You Can't.
What was it, Dave?
You Can't Always Get Sympathy for the Devil.
You Can't Always Get Sympathy for the Devil, right.
You Can't Always Get Sympathy for the Devil.
You're good.
I'm going to do kind of a battery below great, you know,
ethotic storm.
Yeah.
Chaz, you did a wonderful Devo-like Sympathy for the Devil
at Winterstar, just sort of practicing and warming up.
I don't even remember.
Oh, it's on tape number one.
Oh.
Which is the first number.
Yeah.
Oh, you think so?
Oh.
I thought you were spatially disoriented right now.
I mean, I see that puddle down by your shoes.
I noticed that you did evacuate there.
I do that every time.
Well, I'm getting a little tired of it, but outside of the fact, it's kind of a fluorescent color.
I don't really know.
I'm not going to.
You were asking who Saint Anne is?
Well, no, I was asking why you urinated so suddenly and so spasmodically throughout the whole studio.
Well, I mean, that's a simple question.
Hey, that's old news, dude.
What?
Well, why?
But no one in Cleveland.
And nor I have ever seen Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket.
So they're playing to not real people?
Yeah, they do kind of like computer techno subgenius music.
Let's see what else they're going to play.
Well, then we don't have to really look at them, do we?
Evil buy.
You know, since no one's seen them.
Oh, Helena.
Right.
You don't have to, but you will.
So you're saying Helena Handbasket is a treat for the eyeballs?
You will be.
Welcome to the future.
People of Earth, listen and obey.
People of Earth, listen and obey.
You must not be afraid.
You must not dosen't.
You must not do ends when you complete.
You must not talk against your enemies.
Look right into my eyes.
You must not be afraid.

You know I've got my switch.
A place within us
I am your new master.
The어� boat Berti chi имеет you, col.
They will worship me as their god.
A startling new world is upon you.
An army of atomic robots.
Welcome to the future.
A vivere la dolce vita.
Blitzkrieg 3D.
I will have my revenge.
Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge.
Yes, dear friends.
Saint N and Helena Handbasket from their CD Slogans Run.
I'm about to give you information on how you can procure such a CD.
In fact, it's a website that you should look at just in general.
It's a great subgenius website for a great subgenius clench.
Reverend Armand Geddon and Barbie Geddon's Mini True.
And they're at www.minitrue.org.
But mini true is spelled without an E.
That's www.minitrue.org.

The road signs flashed by at a particularly high speed.
Slippery when wet.
Low shoulder.
Low shoulder.
Speed limit 45.
You are now entering God's kingdom.
Ray had to stop at that one.
The rental car bounced and shuddered roughly over the low shoulder to a crooked stop right in front of the sign.
That's exactly what it said.
You are now entering God's kingdom.
Ray got out of the car and looked around.
The scenery looked desperately similar to the last 50 miles of country's two-lane highway
that he had been driving on.
The road signs were very similar to the one he had been traveling on.
And was most likely going to look very much like the next 50.
God then looked out from behind the cloud and frowned at him.
Ray looked up and noticed this.
Being a typical Catholic,
this was the very last thing that he had to do.

This was the first sign that he had ever expected to see.
He looked up and gazed.
Don't make fun of the sign.
I happen to like it.
God said in a deep, loud voice,
echoing across the countryside,
and then returned.
To whatever he had been doing before.
Behind the cloud.
Ray got back into his car
and drove off
very slowly.
Very slowly.

If you smoke a pack of cigarettes a day,
if you took all the nicotine that you ingest

you would die.
Man, I would have died five times a day.
Exactly.
And if you took it as an enema,
you would trip.
Wow.
What would you rather do?
What would you rather do?
You would have my friend.

That's about what I said.

thank you
thanks
that's you this is unlucky
Mmm
that should be easy
let's look at the video

there's a lot other

very cringy
or this radio show will be transmitted
through a magical intergalactic time warp
into Hamburg,
where they're actually going to play this show
somewhere in the next couple of days,
or actually a couple of days ago.
Well, here's Dave to explain about this.
See, Germany is a very, very, very slack country.
I think the Germans invented slack, actually,
and the conspiracy sent Hitler to take it away from them.
The German, Germany was full of slack
before Hitler got there.
Those people, they did not even, they weren't,
and if they...
Actually, J.R. Bob Dobbs actually fought
in the Second World War on the American side, of course,
thus fathering lots and lots of children.
As I heard Stang say the other day,
lots and lots of children here in Europe.
That doesn't mean there's any lawsuits.
There's no point in...
There's no point in pursuing any of those class action lawsuits
against, paternity suits against Dobbs from the war.
I mean, that was a long time ago.
Those kids are grown up now.
They're world leaders and great hobos.
Well, you know, before the war, before...
That's the most meaningless, wonderful rubbish I've ever heard.
What?
That's why I'm here.
That's exactly what I wanted.
You heard it here a lot.
I heard it here first.
I heard it here first.
I heard it here first.

Is anyone there?
Come on, bike truckers, and talk to Teddy Bear.
Well, I keyed the mic, and I said,
you got it, Teddy Bear.
And the little boy's voice came back on the air.
Appreciate the break.
Who we got on that end?
I told him my handle, and then he began.
Now, I'm not supposed to bother you fellas out there.
Mom says you're busy, and for me to stay off there.
But you see, I get lonely, and it helps to talk.
because that's about all I can do. I'm crippled and I can't walk. I came back and told him to
fire up that mic and I talked to him as long as he liked. This was my dad's radio, the little boy
said, but I guess it's mine and mom's now because my daddy's dead. Dad had a wreck about a month ago.
He was trying to get home in a blinding snow. Mom has to work now to make ends meet
and I'm not much help with my two crippled feet. She says not to worry that we'll make it all right,
but I hear her crying sometimes late at night. You know, there's one thing I want more than
anything else to see. Oh, I know you guys are too busy to bother with me,
but you see, my dad used to take me for rides when he was home, but I guess it's all over now
since my daddy's gone. Not one breaker came on the old CB as that little crippled boy talked with me.
I tried hard to swallow a lump that just wouldn't stay down as I thought about my boy
back in Greenville town.
Dad was going to take mom and me with him later on this year.
Well, I remember him saying someday this old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear,
but I know I'll never get to ride an 18 wheeler again,
but this old base will keep me in touch with all my trucker friends.
Teddy Bear is going to back on out now and leave you alone because it's about time for mom to come
home. But you give me a shout when you pass,
and I'll be happy to come back to you.
Well, I came back and I said, before you go, 1010, what's your home 20, little CB friend?
Well, he gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate because this hot load of freight is just
going to have to wait. I turned that truck around on a dime and headed straight for Jackson Street,
229. And as I rounded the corner, oh,
that one heck of a shock. 18 wheelers were lined up for three city blocks.
Well, I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's car.
And that little cripple boy was having a ball. For as fast as one driver would carry him in,
another would carry him to his truck and take off again.
Well, you better believe I took my turn at riding Teddy Bear.
And then I carried him back in and put him down in his chair.
And buddy,
if I never live to see happiness again,
I want you to know I saw it that day in the face of that little man.
We took up a collection for him before his mama got home.
And each driver said goodbye. And then they were all gone.
He shook my hand with a mile long grin and said, so long, Tucker. I'll catch you again.
Well, I hit that interstate with tears in my eyes.
I turned on the radio.
And I got another surprise.
Breaker one nine came a voice on the air.
Just one word of thanks for Mama Teddy Bear.
We wish each and every one a special prayer for you.
Because you just made my little boy's dream come true.
I'll sign off now before I start to cry.
May God ride with you.
10-4.
And goodbye.
No.
Ah.
Bye.
Bye.

I don't feel like little children ought to be exposed to anything.
First you take the train to respond.
All the water today is like a lake.
Canarsie Beach is filled with all the happy people.
On the southern side of Canarsie Beach is filled with happy people.
On a sunny day where there's no haze, you can look all the way down the beach to Coney Island.
And you can still hear the fat lady singing.
Singing so soon, far away.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Did you boys get your new ESO's Hour of Slag List best of CD or latest CD release?
You missed the release party.
Yeah, I did.
About all I did was put a little ad on the website.

Reverend Einstein, won't you come with me?
Einstein Secret Orchestra.
Who else?
Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket will take us all to hell and back, friends.
If you can make it down there.
Well, you really shouldn't, though.
It's not for humans or people.
It's just for...
Can you live through this experience?
Do you dare to try to live through this experience?
Enjoy a virtual night out with the Church of the Subgenius.
If you can survive, if you can stay alive.
But now, it's time to get high.
Come on, let's get high.
Hey, look, there's pretzels in the pedenda.
Good night.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Gorgomoli.
Ha, ha.

Ha.
Hum.
Buona.
Not just...
Come on, everybody, get up.
I can't get up right now.
The bolts from the back of my neck.
That's it.
That's it.
There goes the machine.
Anyway, for the bottom of my ghost cart.
That calls me on the telephone.
Everything else is gone to my radio.
But I'm still singing a song of you.
It's a lonely Saturday night.
Now, if I was an actor.
If I was an actor.
Or a dancer.
Or a dancer.
Whose glamorous.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.




It would soon be my end.
I would soon be my end.
But now the tense light has stopped.
All of these mistakes.
So it's hard to forget my heartbreak.
And at eleven o'clock I watch the network news.
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Something tells me that you're clearly gone.
You said we could be friends, but that's not what I want.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I can hear the birds in the back.
See you next week, kids.
May 12th, Saturday night, Eagle Tavern.
See you next week.
See you next week.
See you next week.
See you next week.
See you next week.
