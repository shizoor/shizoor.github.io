1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
Ready? One, two, ready, go!

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,440
Thank you.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,080
Like to drop by the testy pad

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,980
Well, welcome to the hour of slack

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,840
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,680
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,360
Look what you get. You get the non-stick crab basket.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,960
You get a package of elastic chicken cakes.

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,780
And one more thing, folks.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,620
Of course you're going to get pot.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,660
Please return it to us.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,080
My house smells inside.

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,480
My favorite thing is that the food comes out.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,680
My husband hates chicken.

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,520
So I made the chicken the other night.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,540
And he's like, chicken, chicken.

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,640
I really appreciate the fat on the meat.

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,080
Another thing that's really nice, you can have a cocktail.

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,460
My favorite thing.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,200
Is the fact that it's my family.

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,260
You salmon is too dry, a little too soggy.

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,600
And the family kept saying,

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,840
The boss, the boss.

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,700
I like the oven.

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,600
I came home and made my husband chicken.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,980
Such a wonderful shock.

27
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,460
We just love that machine.

28
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,280
The machine surprised me.

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,760
In the woods, it's fabulous.

30
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,280
I love the electricity.

31
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,360
Call now and order the all-purpose chicken video

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,980
and an instructional non-stick platform.

33
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,400
Order right now.

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,420
And you'll also get 30 gloves worth $250.

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,280
Order right now.

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,500
And you'll also get the $30 dual chicken ties

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,920
for only 400 easy payments of only $19.99 plus SNH.

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,660
Or send $99.99, $99.95 plus SNH to Beverly Hills, California.

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,320
Hurrah!

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,560
As soon as you're born, they make you feel small.

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,600
By giving you no time instead of it all.

42
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,640
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all.

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,420
A working class hero is something to be.

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,400
A working class hero is something to be.

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,720
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,920
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool.

47
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,740
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules.

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,660
A working class hero is something to be.

49
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:58,660


50
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,320
A working class hero is something to be.

51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,360
A working class hero is something to be.

52
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,360
When they tortured and scared you for 20 odd years.

53
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,300
Then they expect you to pick a career.

54
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,520
Then they expect you to pick a career.

55
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,260
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear.

56
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,020
A working class hero is something to be.

57
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,100
A working class hero is something to be.

58
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,420
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV.

59
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,520
And you think you're so clever and classless and free.

60
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,160
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see.

61
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,120
A working class hero is something to be.

62
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,620
A working class hero is something to be.

63
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,400
There's room at the top, they are telling you still.

64
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,960
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill.

65
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,640
If you want to be like the folks on the hill.

66
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,280
A working class hero is something to be.

67
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,780
A working class hero is something to be.

68
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,480
If you want to be a hero, well just follow me.

69
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,280
If you want to be a hero, well just follow me.

70
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,980
I am a subgenius and by that virtue I am in touch with forces greater than men

71
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,220
I dare you to kill me, I am not a dupe of the conspiracy, I know more than they do

72
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,880
I am a subgenius, that's all I need to be, fuck, I'm one of the good guys, I shall prevail

73
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,320
Let out the crazy man inside you, he knows what's what, smile when you call me a fanatic

74
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,560
Me primate, me overman, I say to the pigs, give me your money, you won't need it

75
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,360
The future offers you nothing but destruction

76
00:05:52,360 --> 00:06:03,080
Unlike this 500 pound mouse that is inside of you, Jesus spoke of it when he said, here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty

77
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,260
The United Nations would betray the purpose of its founding

78
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:16,900
Members of Congress of both political parties agree that the United Nations Security Council is a threat to peace

79
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,900
We agree that horrible poisons

80
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,360
And diseases

81
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,180
And gases

82
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,260
And atomic weapons

83
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,420
Since we all agree on this goal

84
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,560
The issue is

85
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,800
How best can we achieve it?

86
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,300
What I can't understand is why no one has seen them until now

87
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,040
Many Americans have raised legitimate questions

88
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:44,520
If they follow the usual pattern of their species, the nest may contain from several hundreds to several thousands

89
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,960
The head of more than 30,000 anthrax

90
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,340
Had likely produced

91
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,100
Two to four times that amount

92
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,500
If we know dangerous weapons

93
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,480
Does it make more dangerous weapons?

94
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,820
This is capable of killing at least 20 people

95
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,720
We produce thousands of tons of sarin nerve gas

96
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,400
These actions killed or injured at least 20 people

97
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,580
More than six people died in the attacks

98
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,820
And surveillance weapons

99
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,560
Every chemical and biological weapon of the war

100
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:19,880
Every chemical and biological weapon of the war

101
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,420
The Kalas and entire以

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,800
Tur eyebrow

103
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,140
We have

104
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,140


105
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,860
Watch all the farce

106
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:49,860


107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,700
ego

108
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:56,480
And of course, all that might be required are a small container in the United States to deliver it.

109
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,380
Now you're talking, talking like a man.

110
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,860
And that is including 12 Americans, killing an American passenger.

111
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,840
We know that Iraq and the United States of America go back a decade.

112
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,920
We know that Iraq and the United States have had high-level contacts.

113
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,920
These include chemical and biological attacks.

114
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,460
We've learned in bomb-making and poisons.

115
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:34,220
And we know that after deadly gases, we've gleefully celebrated the instruments of mass death and destruction.

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,320
May God...

117
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,620
Just the one he got to hit in that bottle.

118
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,940
And an era of new hope will begin.

119
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,020
The right stuff.

120
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,300
The right stuff.

121
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,560
The right stuff.

122
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:52,580


123
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:09,860
Gentlemen, as good, loyal Americans, I think we should take it over that the secrets of Jed Clampett's awesome experiments will never leave this room.

124
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,720
Yeah!

125
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,500
White House.

126
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,460
We've got this!

127
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:19,760
It's begun.

128
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,780
I can't look.

129
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,740
Oh, look, he's got, like, clothespins on his nipples.

130
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,040
I can't look.

131
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,760
I can't look.

132
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,280
The top of his head is shaven.

133
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,420
Let's just shut the hatch.

134
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,980
Oh, my God.

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,160
Now he wants to get in.

136
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,240
He's banging on the window.

137
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,020
No, we should just shut the hatch.

138
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,760
The joke's over, you know?

139
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,360
We just need to get out of here now.

140
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:38,960
What's that smell?

141
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,840
What's that smell?

142
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,500
Yeah.

143
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,760
What's that smell?

144
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,720
I don't think we...

145
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,320
If one of those kraut gunners get him, he's a goner.

146
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,620
I believe we should...

147
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,580
Stopped firing on the beach now because it's quiet here.

148
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,100
And the second batch are droning over now.

149
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,200
I can see them.

150
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,900
They're casting off the gliders as they circle around over the beach.

151
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,020
Ah, yes, dear friends.

152
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,080
That was ESO Radio.

153
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,820
Thanks to WCSB and Clave Moment's Professor Chaz Smith,

154
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,080
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Princess Wiardo,

155
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,640
and your surely Reverend Ivan Stang.

156
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,020
We've also been hearing lots and lots of lemur.

157
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,700
That's right, cut-ups by Fernanda Nde Limor,

158
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,680
the great graphic artist of alt.binary slack,

159
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,600
and now the great class cut-up of our of slack.

160
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,180
Slack, good slack.

161
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,860
And speaking of slack, friends,

162
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,720
I was poking around on the Internet

163
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,920
looking at alt.binary sounds MP3 full CDs,

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,320
and I found this Brazilian band.

165
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,000
It had a cool name.

166
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,580
Ligia Urbana.

167
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,660
And it was doing, most of their stuff was in Portuguese,

168
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,600
but they were doing this one song in English

169
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,640
that I was familiar with.

170
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,740
And I downloaded it and listened to it,

171
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,560
and it's, friends, it falls into the category of

172
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,660
inadvertent bulldada.

173
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,780
In this case, tell me if you don't think this is

174
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,340
Jim Morrison beats Billy Idol.

175
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,720
FRANCIS

176
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,300
Yeah, this is just different music,

177
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,300


178
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,300


179
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,620
Well, it's kinda good for that.

180
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,780
That's good, isn't it?

181
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:30,780


182
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:30,980


183
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:30,980


184
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,200
That's some Pop Rock.

185
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,240

Drugs

197
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,660

of the Week contest

202
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,460
closed and opened

203
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:16,940
the envelope.

204
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,520
Mystery Girl of the Week

205
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,240
this week goes to

206
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,940
North Korea

207
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,980
who dumped

208
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,820
that one.

209
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,440
I love the way

210
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,400
they dumped the news.

211
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,000
They like were

212
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,880
in a meeting

213
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,500
and they just sort of

214
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,320
looked at the Americans

215
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,680
and said,

216
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,640
of course we have

217
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,360
the fucking bomb,

218
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,000
you moron.

219
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,560
I think pretty much,

220
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,840
I think Zimbabwe's

221
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,460
got the bomb.

222
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,140
I think,

223
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,120
I think

224
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,080
Upper Mongolia

225
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,800
or whatever it's called,

226
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,280
yeah,

227
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,440
Outer Mongolia

228
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,420
might have the bomb too.

229
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,860
I think we've reached

230
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,680
the level that they

231
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,220
talked about.

232
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,020
The Tagalog Islands.

233
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,560
Yes.

234
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,200
Pongo, Pongo.

235
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,220
Timor has a

236
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,580
200 new key.

237
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,360
So what are you

238
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,140
going to do about that?

239
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,760
You're just going to

240
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,840
go plowing every place,

241
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,780
waving the bombs

242
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,560
and hoping they don't

243
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,440
bomb everything back?

244
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,980
It's kind of silly.

245
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,500
Well, you've got to

246
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,340
deliver the bomb.

247
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,420
I mean,

248
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,140
you can't just

249
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,740
have a bomb.

250
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,260
Right.

251
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,900
You've got to have

252
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,540
one of those mailers

253
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:09,920
You just have

254
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,080
a bomb.

255
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,300
You just have a bomb

256
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,400
and you detonate it

257
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,760
then you blow yourself up.

258
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,240
Yeah.

259
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,420
You have to deliver it

260
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:14,700
somehow.

261
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,600
Yeah, you have to make

262
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,500
it go somewhere else

263
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,160
to, you know,

264
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,800
whoever, whatever

265
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,460
you don't like

266
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,140
and then have it

267
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,680
blow up there.

268
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,540
And you need one

269
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,260
of those mailing systems

270
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,840
too because

271
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,200
I did download

272
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,540
a tactical nuke

273
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,480
video

274
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,040
that was amazing.

275
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,140
It was shot

276
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,960
with like a

277
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,100
like about a

278
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,220
50 or 60 foot

279
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,100
long cannon.

280
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,340
Really?

281
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,300
Yeah, a big recoil

282
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,660
thing.

283
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,320
One of those

284
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,640
track.

285
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,280
Yeah, they're like

286
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,980
back a little.

287
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,920
Yeah, those tubes

288
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,460
they use now.

289
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,200
The thing shot

290
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,040
and then about

291
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,100
two seconds later

292
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,800
the mountain range

293
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,080
way off in the distance

294
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,020
just went white

295
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,260
and then

296
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,160
the

297
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,540
worship

298
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,980
the gods of war

299
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,540
and then

300
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,260
where there once

301
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,460
was a mountain

302
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,800
Stand at the stone feet

303
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,340
of the red god of war.

304
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:54,960
This was just

305
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,460
punched with a cannon

306
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,460
into the hill, you know.

307
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,900
They call them tubes now.

308
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,940
There's a lot of

309
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,920
baby acrimony

310
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,480
going around

311
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,880
in the svelte world.

312
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,400
They're probably

313
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,260
letting a lot of

314
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,740
these type videos out

315
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,760
so that, you know.

316
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,580
I've also noticed

317
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,500
a lot of stories

318
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,640
that kind of talk about

319
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,760
how cool it is

320
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,060
that when America

321
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,920
goes to war

322
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,620
it goes to war

323
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,360
packing everything

324
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,560
and they start talking

325
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,300
about how

326
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,020
that some of the things

327
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,440
being ordered for the war

328
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,520
and being packed was

329
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,340
well, a sumo wrestler's

330
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,440
suit was one of them.

331
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,100
That's not much of a suit.

332
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,480
A sumo wrestler's

333
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,280
suit was going along

334
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,120
with the rest of

335
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,780
the guy's gear?

336
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,180
Yeah.

337
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,220
Well, jeez,

338
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:32,740
they're going to have

339
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,840
some entertainment there.

340
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,740
They call it sumo wrestler

341
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,880
for the news purposes

342
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,000
but what they really mean

343
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,020
is the extra costume

344
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,480
for the sumo wrestler.

345
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,140
He's a superhero.

346
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,860
Oh, and the belt

347
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,640
that he's wearing

348
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,480
actually that goes up

349
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:43,960
his crotch

350
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,320
actually propels him

351
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,160
over Baghdad

352
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,220
and drops him asunder

353
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,320
like some mighty sack

354
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,920
of flat.

355
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,640
All that mutant stuff.

356
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,540
All those movies

357
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,880
with Spider-Man

358
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,320
all these mutant power guys

359
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,120
and so forth

360
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,540
that are coming into vogue now.

361
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,820
Real big budget,

362
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,140
exciting, well done

363
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,420
comic book movies.

364
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,360
It's all based on

365
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,140
It's all based on

366
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,740
But the gist of the stories

367
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,580
are generally that

368
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,780
nobody goes to war

369
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,120
like the U.S. does.

370
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,460
Nobody takes as much

371
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,480
stuff with them.

372
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:09,500


373
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,200
Sheesh.

374
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,420
It's kind of self-facing

375
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,180
not self-

376
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,020
but you know

377
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,180
too overconfident.

378
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,400
Pretty arrogant really.

379
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,020
Yeah, arrogant.

380
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,820
That's the word.

381
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,440
I knew it started with an A.

382
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:19,920
They can sort of

383
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,140
control space.

384
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,160
Every blade of grass

385
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,440
dang.

386
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,580
They want to control

387
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,860
every blade of grass

388
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,900
and every molecule

389
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,740
on the planet.

390
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,340
They have

391
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,980
good surveillance.

392
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,020
That was scary

393
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,780
watching Dave do that one.

394
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,860
I'm not going to look

395
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,740
over there anymore.

396
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,340
I missed it.

397
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:39,480
I missed it.

398
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,320
I'm not looking over there.

399
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,280
I'm looking at

400
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,420
I'm going to go look at

401
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,420
porn on the internet

402
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,060
or something.

403
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
I don't want to see that again.

404
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,780
I could see Donald Rumsfeld

405
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,540
as a superhero.

406
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,660
Couldn't you?

407
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,160
Like wearing a sumo belt,

408
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,700
bare chested,

409
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,340
bare legged,

410
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,200
like maybe with long

411
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,140
like lawyer socks on.

412
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,120
And the power belt

413
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,880
between his legs

414
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,380
propelling him

415
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,180
through space.

416
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,040
They said he was

417
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,260
afraid of birds.

418
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,360
But wasn't he

419
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,280
some sort of

420
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,400
Pleistocene bird?

421
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,460
Pleistocene bird.

422
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,000
Bird himself?

423
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,840
I'm so tired.

424
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,160
Wasn't that beak

425
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,480
made for chopping

426
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,300
lamb chops?

427
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,980
Wasn't that nozzle

428
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,960
made for eating

429
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,880
human flesh?

430
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,700
Donald Rumsfeld.

431
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,840
Don't look under

432
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,180
your television set.

433
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,760
He's back.

434
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,460
How about

435
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,040
Dick Cheney?

436
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,280
How about

437
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,460
Dick Cheney?

438
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,980
The grandson

439
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,080
of Lon Chaney.

440
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,260
Please no.

441
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,260


442
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:39,560
No.

443
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
He is actually

444
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,580
a man of a thousand

445
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,880
billion dollar faces.

446
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,240
The man of a million

447
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,180
petrodollars.

448
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,880
Tonight in your theater.

449
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,560
Don't come if you've

450
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,540
got a heart condition

451
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,980
or wear sunglasses

452
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
past twelve.

453
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,560
Don't come if your

454
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,820
knees are too

455
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,400
to your pants.

456
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,500
Shepard Nazi

457
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,900
the engine.

458
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,220
I don't know what happened.

459
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,420
I don't know.

460
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,280
The Senate.

461
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,120
The Senate will come to order.

462
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,640
The chaplain will leave

463
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,760
the Senate in prayer.

464
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,040
Gracious God,

465
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,240
you have made grief.

466
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,560
As a Senate family,

467
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,120
we thank you for our dear

468
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,960
friends on timely deaths.

469
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,160
We are grateful for Saul

470
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,100
and Sheila Wellstone's

471
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,000
courageous deaths.

472
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,280
His indefatigable commitment

473
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,500
to help the debt of our society.

474
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,820
We praise you for grief

475
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,120
for all people, particularly police,

476
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,760
police officers,

477
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,600
those who serve to make

478
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,860
the Senate run smoothly.

479
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,660
Dear God, you have enriched

480
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,480
all of our lives so generously

481
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,300
through their untimely deaths.

482
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,880
Heal our grief over

483
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,020
maintenance personnel

484
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,140
and fill us with your

485
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,780
untimely deaths.

486
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:02,720
Amen.

487
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,180
The Senate prayer delivered by Fernanda Nende-Lee Murr.

488
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,800
So that's a sign of oppression

489
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,540
from the Ubermans that are keeping us down

490
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,160
with their ragged bags and feet.

491
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,400
These tagged raggedy old baggity faggity feet

492
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,120
smelling us.

493
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,140
My pups are barking, boy.

494
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,600
My pups is dead.

495
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm a smelly friend.

496
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,220
You know what I mean.

497
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,400
Yeah, you gotta feed them.

498
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,260
You gotta feed those puppies.

499
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,480
I've just been so whooped and beaten down

500
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,860
by the conspiracy, I just gave up.

501
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,140
You know what they like, Stan?

502
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,220
They like when you trim your toenails,

503
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,960
you grind them up, you put them in a little bit

504
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,460
of hot sauce and you drip them back

505
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,060
on your self-same toes.

506
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,260
That's appreciation for you.

507
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,680
Recycling.

508
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,860
Yes, it's a form of internal sacrosanctivity.

509
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,780
Sacrosanctivity.

510
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,700
You know, you make yourself holier than you thou

511
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,400
or something every day.

512
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,280
At least I do.

513
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,540
I gave up on that, on thou, holiness and than.

514
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,940
Well, making yourself holier.

515
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,860
I just gave up.

516
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,060
I can see it.

517
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,240
Give up!

518
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,300
I can see it.

519
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:20,980
Give up!

520
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,720
Give up!

521
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,240
Holy and holy.

522
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,320
Loudspeakers spoke up and said.

523
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,000
Holy and holy.

524
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,600
It is holy and holy.

525
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,420
Holy and holy.

526
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,100
To think of the-

527
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,540
Christianity is stupid.

528
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,240
Isn't it about the-

529
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,540
Communism is stupid.

530
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:33,960
Communism is good.

531
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,580
Do you have a copy of that we could play real loud?

532
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,840
Common sense is stupid.

533
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,900
Common sense is stupid.

534
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:43,820
Common sense is stupid.

535
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,880
Common sense is stupid.

536
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:52,260
The very idea of offing yourself because of some stupid little problem like that makes

537
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:59,260
me think, well, what is a problem that's worthy of killing yourself?

538
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:06,280
So what I want you to do is imagine that you're in the car with the windshield wipers going.

539
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,360
It reminded me when I was a child.

540
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,180
And you're listening to this religious show on the radio.

541
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,960
Okay.

542
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,100
And you're wondering to yourself, who are these guys?

543
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,920
Gotcha.

544
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,940
Okay, I'm there.

545
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,220
I'm driving.

546
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,760
I'm beginning to visualize now.

547
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,340
Oh, what?

548
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,860
Don't take your eyes off the road, though.

549
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,000
And now I can see it.

550
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,800
I can see it.

551
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,340
I can begin to see the beginning.

552
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,960
The beginnings of it.

553
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,280
It was an old military junkyard full of trash.

554
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,580
Tranks and tucks and such.

555
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,520
Tranks and tucks and some.

556
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,900
Yeah, that's the kind of stuff we used to listen to on the radio back in the old days,

557
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,200
driving around Texas.

558
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,700
I understand that Texas is about the size of Iraq.

559
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,300
Really?

560
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:00,760
Yeah.

561
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,000
Is that true?

562
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,360
So when they say, go in and see if you can find some nukes.

563
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:13,780
My test would be, well, let's go see if we can hide a suitcase full of nukes in Texas somewhere and say, now go see if you can find it.

564
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,180
We only have the whole state of Texas to do it in.

565
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,800
You know, I think that.

566
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,680
That would work.

567
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,720
You could build an invisibility chamber if you had to and put it into the.

568
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:27,980
Hide it in Texas?

569
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,860
And hide it in Texas.

570
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,120
You could put it up by Amarillo next to Cadillac Ranch and then.

571
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,580
I'd take it out to the.

572
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,200
They just wouldn't see it.

573
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:41,800
To the Texas Triangle, which is kind of like a different version of the Bermuda Triangle, but on land in Texas.

574
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,820
And I would just put it out in the middle and it would disappear.

575
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:44,780
Wow.

576
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,320
Until.

577
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,300
That's like the playa out there.

578
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,520
I needed to find it.

579
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,600
That was, dear friends, puzzling evidence.

580
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:58,580
Dr. Philodrum and Dr. Howland, the Howland, a funny Dr. Howland, KPFA in Berkeley.

581
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,600
This genius, more than an hour, less than a show type show.

582
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,000
The show that dare not speak its name.

583
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,520
And now.

584
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:19,500
The past year resembles nothing so much as the bad alternate timeline that the hero of a cheap science fiction book or has to go back and fix.

585
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,500
It certainly resembles that to me.

586
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,080
And you, the listener, are that time traveler.

587
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,620
Yes, you, humble listener.

588
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,880
If only your memory could be restored to you.

589
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,140
You are the humble time traveler.

590
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,680
I know what you mean, though.

591
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,000
It does.

592
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,560
Yeah, that would explain a lot.

593
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,840
It would explain the wooden-headed people coming up to us while we're taking our sulfur baths.

594
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,640
It would certainly explain all the money that's now going to be flowing into arms.

595
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,980
And legs.

596
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,820
And think of how fully well laundered that money it is.

597
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,640
It must be very squeaky clean by now.

598
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:58,420
Just think about George the bushy-haired one himself and counting that money back in some room.

599
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,640
He's got to replace those behind the oval orifice.

600
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,980
That's not what we're talking about.

601
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,860
This is all about revenge. That's it.

602
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,960
Taking over Mars.

603
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,080
Yes, eventually to take back Mars.

604
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,240
Take over Mars. To take Mars back.

605
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,540
Our rightful home that we, the true Martians, were expelled from.

606
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:28,620
So that they, the oil sheiks and the oil billionaires and all the oily characters would have some...

607
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,580
So we're living in the Martian time slip?

608
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,820
Oh, I can grok to that.

609
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,060
In this time continuum?

610
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,500
I can grok to that, my water brother, but by the same token, when do we...

611
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,220
We were enslaved.

612
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,460
We've got to go back in time and kill Bob's mom.

613
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,080
The psychic shackles still at their feet.

614
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,740
After Bob was born.

615
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,360
Enslaved thousands and millions and bazillions of years ago.

616
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,240
Does this mean that there's a big bin with all the money we want near the front of our house and we can pick it up and just...

617
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,680
It doesn't mean anything like that.

618
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:56,900
No, man.

619
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,240
It just means that we were kidnapped from our home world and we're stuck here.

620
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,160
With you...

621
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,380
Twerps.

622
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,680
Yeah, you guys.

623
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,140
You just...

624
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,740
You guys.

625
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,220
Ha!

626
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,960
It's a space junkie cowboy just looking for a fight.

627
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,180
His mama's calling.

628
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:19,940
Son is dear.

629
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,140
He says, mama I'll be alright.

630
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,440
I'm fighting all the Yankees.

631
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,580
The sons of JFK.

632
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,740
The Cubans and the Mafia said man, he'll be okay.

633
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,220
But the cowboy in his space gun and his bitch is...

634
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


635
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


636
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


637
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


638
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


639
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


640
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


641
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


642
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


643
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


644
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


645
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


646
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:30,220


647
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,260
He's got to save the day

648
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,060
Defeat the force of evil with his worst name

649
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,940
SPICE BRAIN!

650
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,120
Well, the space junkie cowboy, he will not be denied

651
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,700
There's pot roasts on the table, many villains roast outside

652
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,900
He's fighting all the criminals who stopped him sitting low

653
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,560
The whiteys came from Europe to kill you, no they wouldn't

654
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,800
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day

655
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,740
Defeat the force of evil with his worst name

656
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,140
SPICE BRAIN!

657
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,900
Well, the space junkie cowboy, he does not give a damn

658
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,280
His mama says, come on in boys, his mama's got a plan

659
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,860
I'm gonna fight the men in white sheets who come from the Kloot Klutz clan

660
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,140
They're fixing to kill a black man who grows by the name of Sam

661
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,740
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day

662
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,540
Defeat the force of evil with his NITRO

663
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,120
SPICE BRAIN!

664
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,340
Well, the space junkie cowboy, he will not be coerced

665
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,740
His mama says, come on in sir, this is where my lab been cursed

666
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,900
I'm set to fight a bad man who's killing all the Jews

667
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,120
Making mincemeat of his continent, gotta stop him for a while

668
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,820
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day

669
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,760
Defeat the force of evil with his worst name

670
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,660
SPICE BRAIN!

671
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,240
Space junkie cowboy

672
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,920
Space junkie cowboy

673
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,220
Space junkie cowboy

674
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,100
SPICE BRAIN!

675
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,940

SPICE BRAIN!

678
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,100
by Drexel

679
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,180
yes, that's a D-R-E-X-E-L

680
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,180
Drexel, from Drexel, Ohio

681
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,160
That's the album name is

682
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,120
uh, and they are at this website

683
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,740
www dot

684
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,100

685

Drexelent dot com

686
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,480
That's B-R-E-X-E-L-L-E-N-T.

687
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:08,020
And now back to, well, some Lemur-ish cut-up collages,

688
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:11,200
puzzling evidences, howling over men,

689
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,540
lonesome cowboys, and Chaz right here.

690
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,320
Well, we were through the looking glass with David Ferry and Nico.

691
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,400
One, two, three, four.

692
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,760
That's good. There we go, George.

693
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,220
You're looking good on camera.

694
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,260
Yeah, don't worry about it.

695
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,580
Your hair looks fine.

696
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,680
Boss, you want to make sure his hand stays up in the wave gesture for a long time.

697
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,680
We've got to go off over here.

698
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,400
It looks like there's about 45 of them ready.

699
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,120
Mr. President, 30 seconds.

700
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,920
Do you want to take some of the shine off the big guy's nose?

701
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,260
I can't get back in there again.

702
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,560
It smells like shit.

703
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,660
Commies keep talking like that.

704
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,620
I'll be throwing some food over the concentration camp fence to you.

705
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,080
How's that?

706
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Right after the bad days, Tank.

707
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,740
Come on in and take a bath.

708
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,020
Hey, look at this special emollient they put in the bath water.

709
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,800
It makes you feel so good.

710
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,760
You don't want to think about things.

711
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,600
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

712
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,940
Knee pads truly make a world of difference.

713
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,220
Yep, yep.

714
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,320
More proof that makes knee pads possible.

715
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,180
Yep, yep.

716
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,540
Call now to order the two-piece ratchet knee pads or clamp set.

717
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,220
737-338-1318.

718
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:21,620
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

719
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

720
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,200
Then, of course, there was the time when...

721
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,060
We're recording down there.

722
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,180
...they tried to fit the baseball bat in my corner.

723
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,560
I think you can't use that either now.

724
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,200
And then...

725
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,880
MK Ultra.

726
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,420
MK Ultra.

727
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,640
Hey, he knows about the mind control experiments.

728
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,780
What did they do to you?

729
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,580
Oh, he signed off because he's scared.

730
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,440
He was silent.

731
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,020
He was scared.

732
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,980
They stopped him.

733
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,520
Well, they stopped him mentally a long time ago in the past.

734
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,640
See, that's what he doesn't understand.

735
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,600
It was also a time control experiment, much like the Church of the Subgenius is.

736
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,700
And therefore...

737
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,580
The stars will be.

738
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,700
You're right.

739
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,440
Yeah.

740
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,140
That's one of the ipso-hipso's of the time biz.

741
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:02,540
Yeah.

742
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,240
Yeah.

743
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,400
But this guy wasn't hip to that fact, I think,

744
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,460
as he danced jolly-ly-ly-ly down there in this lane.

745
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,200
Well, I don't know that he was hip.

746
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,320
You know, if you...

747
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:12,820
He might have been.

748
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,180
The problem with the great conspiracy revealers...

749
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,520
How come they're not dead yet?

750
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,220
You mean like Michael Moore?

751
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,360
Oh, not...

752
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,920
But no, no.

753
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,300
He didn't...

754
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,540
Because he's not revealing...

755
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,180
He's not revealing great conspiracies.

756
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,380
I'm talking about the really great conspiracy.

757
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,420
Well, maybe they've lost their twang or their old epizoodle.

758
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,260
Why haven't the conspiracy silenced them?

759
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,260
Well, the silence is probably something arranged by the conspiracy.

760
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:40,800
No.

761
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,880
Beforehand, it's like the time control experiments.

762
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,260
Think of it that way, if you can.

763
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:45,900
Huh?

764
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:50,740
For example, you know, people look at an elephant and it just looks so enormous.

765
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,280
But...

766
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,160
Or someone told me earlier, you know, you eat a...

767
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,020
Or given enough time, they can.

768
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,960
Can an ant eat an elephant?

769
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,660
Uh, precisely.

770
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,060
Uh...

771
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,940
By eight properties, I don't think you could.

772
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:06,740
It'd be impossible.

773
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,920
For example...

774
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,160
You folks all are now unsophisticated barbarians.

775
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,700
And breaking news out of Bethlehem right now,

776
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:21,720
Israeli forces leaving a trail of sludge to prevent gunmen from seeking refuge in the explosive device at a checkpoint late this afternoon.

777
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,080
This in retaliation for a Palestinian church in Jerusalem.

778
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,800
The passenger apparently grabbed the sludge, killing 11 people.

779
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,880
Cleanup boats menace the coastline, causing an environmental hazard.

780
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,180
Tom Daschle and other wannabes are creating security threats to his family.

781
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,580
Hard Car correspondent David Schuster has the story.

782
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:45,680
The question is, has Tom Daschle gone too far, or is Tom Daschle a sore loser?

783
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,160
This program is known for asking you to call him.

784
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,300
With his majority gone and his party floundering, Tom Daschle handling defeat poorly.

785
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,520
But definitely...

786
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,980
Democrats routinely unpatriotic and un-American.

787
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,200
Tom Daschle shrill, nasty, and dangerous in Washington.

788
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,660
Foment hatred, the very essence of anger that we love.

789
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,480
Goodbye, Fernanda Nende.

790
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:11,520
Lee Moore.

791
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,600
I often want to say to a couple,

792
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,600
I put him down for my pizda, and then she shrieked,

793
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,440
We're hungry for you.

794
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,880
Guy back off.

795
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,800
Guy back off.

796
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,700
Guy back off.

797
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,720
Guy blown away.

798
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,240
Guy.

799
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,420
Guy.

800
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:25,500


801
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:25,500


802
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:25,500


803
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:25,500


804
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:25,500


805
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:25,500


806
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:25,500


807
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,040
Guy.

808
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,040


809
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,040


810
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,040


811
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,960
Guy in the cracks with mouths full of my cheese.

812
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,360
Bah, my cheese.

813
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,580
Bah, my cheese.

814
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,880
Bah, my cheese.

815
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,200
Bah, blown away.

816
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,280
As husbands and wives come together, bah creates a glow within you.

817
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,180
We really lost our minds and I needed to do something else.

818
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:46,040
I was struck recently by Hull and their seeking cheese, and they don't get it.

819
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,120
Oh, you mean that kind of bone crushing time.

820
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,160
That kind of bone crushing.

821
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,400
Guy died unexpectedly in an automobile accident this weekend.

822
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:55,480
Guy died unexpectedly in an automobile accident this weekend.

823
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:55,480


824
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,980
and they don't get it.

825
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,120
They are normal.

826
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,940
Bob threatened to be ripped asunder by God.

827
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,300
And Jesus has been in a series of unsatisfying relationships with men

828
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,360
and invites him into a relationship with Bob.

829
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,000
And they bury the dog in the food.

830
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,360
But I can't say that.

831
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,800
And they don't get it.

832
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,060
And they don't get it.

833
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,400
Slut.

834
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,280
Slut.

835
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,120
And I'm the devil.

836
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,620
Welcome to hell.

837
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,800
I am Satan.

838
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,040
I'll be your hostess for eternity.

839
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,000
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

840
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,160
Slut.

841
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,760
Slut.

842
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,200
Heart ignition.

843
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,200
And now, Lemur.

844
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,600
Lemur.

845
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,160
We believe

846
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,400
in any inflation.

847
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,800
In any inflationary set of pressures that might emerge

848
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,420
and any negative effects

849
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,820
that we put in place.

850
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,800
Similarly, the reason

851
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,020
for this chronic and growing

852
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,520
gross P in the United States

853
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,640
continuously rising

854
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,320
or rising as much.

855
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,360
That means that

856
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,460
our short P induces P

857
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,640
in the United States.

858
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,420
And that's been going on

859
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,460
to prevent this from continuing.

860
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,420
Bob.

861
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,540
I have argued

862
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,500
that the best we can do

863
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,800
is to judge for decades.

864
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,880
Either way.

865
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,840
I'm having a heart attack.

866
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,180
Can't be the same

867
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,440
until I get my baby back.

868
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,640
She's gone and left me brokenhearted.

869
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,920
Came to stay but now we've parted.

870
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,760
Like a transcontinental island.

871
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,360
Burning and floating across the seven seas.

872
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,180
Causing the cost of formation of delicate bacteria.

873
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,300
Cuted in a mustard keg.

874
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,680
Her lemon made a beautiful sunset.

875
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,500
She's gone and left me.

876
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,980
What shall I do?

877
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,260
She got back to her residence

878
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,640
on Sunset Boulevard

879
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,480
where the residue of her love

880
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,320
is dying through.

881
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,300
I got bit and stoned

882
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,320
by a Ned fly.

883
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,280
Went swelled up into a baby.

884
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,200
And floated away up into outer space.

885
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,580
Like a Jules Verne hot air balloon.

886
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,240
Jacob Bartley took a dollax

887
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,200
and fled his tiny gym

888
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,460
with all his little friends.

889
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,300
Visiting from Scarsdale.

890
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,520
That's why I'm having

891
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,180
a heart attack.

892
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,680
Can't be the same

893
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,760
until I get my baby back.

894
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,540
She's gone and left me brokenhearted.

895
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,740
Came to stay but now we've parted.

896
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,700
Like a transcontinental island.

897
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,800
Burning and floating across the seven seas.

898
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,540
Causing the cost of formation of delicate bacteria.

899
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,900
Cuted in a mustard keg.

900
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,140
Her lemon made a beautiful sunset.

901
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,940
She's gone and left me.

902
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,160
What shall I do?

903
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,600
She got back to her residence

904
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,820
on Sunset Boulevard.

905
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,700
With a residue of her love

906
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,520
is dying through.

907
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,300
I got bit and stoned

908
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,240
by a Ned fly.

909
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,900
Went swelled up into a baby.

910
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,520
And floated away up into outer space.

911
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,320
Like a Jules Verne hot air balloon.

912
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,900
Jacob Bartley took a dollax

913
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,280
and fled his tiny gym.

914
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,620
With all his little friends.

915
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,920
Visiting from Scarsdale.

916
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,620
That's why I'm having

917
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,420
a heart attack.

918
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,060
Can't be the same

919
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,260
till I get my baby back.

920
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,760
She's gone and left me brokenhearted.

921
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,300
Came to stay but now we've parted.

922
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,860
I'm having a heart attack.

923
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,300
Zug's Riff, dear friends.

924
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,020
This is coming off of a 30th anniversary

925
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,960
two CD-R set

926
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,420
that has 175 Zug's Riff songs

927
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,780
from 1971 to 2001.

928
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,880
The great, great Zug's Riff

929
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,960
can be reached by you

930
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,480
if you have a pencil ready.

931
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,860
Um, at, got that pencil ready?

932
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,480
Now?

933
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,780
Zug's Riff at,

934
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,440
thank you Fine Lying Brothers,

935
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,500
at, at, subgenius heaven.

936
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,320
He boarded the saucers prematurely,

937
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,640
friends, long ago, yet long after

938
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,800
this show was assembled in 2002.

939
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,400
For this is a rerun of number 11,

940
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,420
number 868, a war show.

941
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,960
It was a different war, but hey,

942
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,660
many things never change.

943
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,120
I had to resort to a rerun

944
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,940
because I had to nurse my injured dog, Buddy,

945
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,780
who was in a war

946
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,460
with other dogs.

947
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,900
A civil war.

948
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,360
And now this.

949
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,040
This is the voice of London.

950
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,500
Yes, my young padlock.

951
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,080
Somebody's parked a bus in my butt.

952
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,080
Well, there's an explosive device in there.

953
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,160
We're talking about a code yellow.

954
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,500
You are not using the force,

955
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,920
my young padlock.

956
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,160
We are a code yellow right now, you guys.

957
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,400
I'll have you know that.

958
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,600
Code yellow in what?

959
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,340
In the air.

960
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,340


961
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,340


962
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,340


963
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,340


964
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,340


965
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,340


966
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,340


967
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:10,340


968
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,080
In Portuguese, which is

969
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,460
gauta jaurda.

970
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,240
These are not the drugs you're looking for.

971
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,840
No, we are at code yellow right now.

972
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,480
The force is not with us, you silly arses.

973
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,480
Come on, man.

974
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,960
First place cops looked was at that.

975
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,000
I've fallen and I can't get up.

976
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:32,940
Just lay there.

977
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,320
She's lying.

978
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,920
What are you going to say,

979
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,480
pack the car near Havignyad or something?

980
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,440
I mean, come on, boys.

981
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,860
Let's stop this inane game here.

982
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,660
Let's nail the hammer on the head.

983
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,660
The president is trying to...

984
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:44,940
Canadian?

985
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,660
Oh, yeah, right.

986
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:45,940
Okay.

987
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,880
Trying to attack Canada.

988
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,520
I can't do the president,

989
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,140
the prime minister of Canada.

990
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,920
I can't do Jean Quatien.

991
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,360
I can't do his voice.

992
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,620
And we are tired of what they are saying.

993
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,940
South of the border,

994
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,020
we have the right as a nation.

995
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,440
How many people showed up on the mall in D.C.

996
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,700
to protest the war that you didn't hear about in the news?

997
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,460
Bob was there.

998
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:07,980
Bob was?

999
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,380
Somebody sent me a picture.

1000
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,700
A picture of Bob standing there with a couple of kids

1001
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,880
with their faces fuzzed out in the photograph

1002
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,140
because the kids didn't want to get caught.

1003
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:18,680
Oh, wow, yeah.

1004
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,820
But there was...

1005
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,320
Bob often shows up at protests

1006
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,620
and, in fact, has even been filmed by CNN and the like.

1007
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,400
But in this case,

1008
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,580
a friend of one of the kids

1009
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,180
saw Bob, photographed him,

1010
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,020
sent it in, got a rim job,

1011
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,620
and that was the...

1012
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:43,400
some totality of Bob's involvement in the...

1013
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,880
This is more appropriate than anything.

1014
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,360
Is this part of the success seminar thing

1015
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,920
that he's doing down there now, or...?

1016
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,720
No, he works for the CIA sometimes.

1017
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,120
He was just taking notes.

1018
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,320
So the success seminar is just like a pizza front

1019
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,100
for the... for Black Ops, for the CIA?

1020
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,620
No, that's Church of the Subgenius.

1021
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,840
Is the pizza front for...?

1022
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,060
More or less, yeah.

1023
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,960
Okay, but, okay, which is the core of the Black Ops?

1024
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,960
Is it the CIA or the church?

1025
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,900
The church, the Austin office that's the church.

1026
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,420
The Austin office or the church?

1027
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,620
Those guys are nuts.

1028
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,840
They get $10 for every address.

1029
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,200
For every address?

1030
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,340
So they can actually come around and say,

1031
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,480
we know where you live, right?

1032
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,740
Well, see, the thing is now,

1033
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,820
because of the new law,

1034
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,920
they can just get it off the internet for free.

1035
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,360
Your computer is part of the internet,

1036
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,460
my computer is,

1037
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,540
and if you touch your computer,

1038
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,480
your brain is part of the internet.

1039
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,160
We know what you say and what you do.

1040
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,380
And it's all recorded.

1041
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,820
Every bit of it is on the internet.

1042
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,580
Google.com,

1043
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,400
which will soon be called bigbrother.com

1044
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,140
or something like that.

1045
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,200
But it's all going to be one big website.

1046
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,000
I'll be able to look up your thoughts.

1047
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,940
You'll be able to look up my thoughts.

1048
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,980
It's a beautiful thing.

1049
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,200
It's, well, in some ways,

1050
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,700
it, the evildoers can no longer hide their evil,

1051
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,540
but by the same token, you know,

1052
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,140
it all just evens out.

1053
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,480
There's just such a flood of endless information

1054
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,340
about everybody's inner thoughts

1055
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,300
that finally it just becomes a sort of a slurry,

1056
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,840
a blank mush because it's just overload.

1057
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,720
It's just a white static.

1058
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,340
And when you see the sign that says,

1059
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,940
our back is maxed free,

1060
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,540
you'll know that you're going to finally get some work done around here.

1061
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,660
And look at those smokestacks crackling.

1062
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,520
Everybody gets to toggle in, man.

1063
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,620
Yeah, when it started going down this week,

1064
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,600
I started to,

1065
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,020
I started sweeping up my leaves in the yard.

1066
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:39,860
Did you?

1067
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,740
That's all that's left to do.

1068
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,100
They love shoes and,

1069
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,300
they love shoes and pajamas.

1070
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,760
God has gone before to,

1071
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,060
to, to, to, to,

1072
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,200
I'm persuaded.

1073
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,220
God, hallelujah.

1074
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:31,400
What we are engaged in is essentially a struggle for communication.

1075
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,580
The corporate industrial complex is a heavily under-

1076
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,180
armed fortress dictating the baloney propaganda

1077
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,480
we are fed daily via multimedia channels.

1078
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,220
We hear only what they want us to hear.

1079
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,480
So long as the man prevents the message from reaching the masses,

1080
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,340
justice is impeded.

1081
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:01,840
The Unabomber used terrorism to gain publicity as an end in itself.

1082
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,220
Notice how the press seeks to channel the public's interpretation

1083
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:11,300
of the Unabomber, covering it as a serial killer story of crime and insanity,

1084
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:16,700
while deliberately excluding consideration of the ideas themselves.

1085
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:23,060
Imagine, if you will, mass communications not subject to corporate control.

1086
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:29,260
Why, people might say anything, even things not fit to print.

1087
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,500
Exactly.

1088
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,560
When the ABC nightly news gets renamed Disney World,

1089
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:41,860
you'll cherish the memory of your Unabomber vote.

1090
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,140
Don't waste your vote, friends.

1091
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,740
Unabomber in 1996.

1092
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,300
Whoa!

1093
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,620
And, uh, yes, that was from www.paranoia.com,

1094
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,340
which is a fun little website.

1095
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,040
Uh, what else?

1096
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:06,560
According to my records, I've sent you 33 pages of information

1097
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,720
plus a postcard.

1098
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,300
Most of what I sent you proves beyond a shadow of a doubt

1099
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,140
that much of what you've sent me is crap.

1100
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,800
Only a person like you, with your almost total lack of...

1101
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:48,600
You've be quickly

1102
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,300
Hey, everybody!

1103
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,640
I think it's complicated.

1104
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,800
We can put a fool in things of this order.

1105
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,480
Gotcha!

1106
00:46:54,700 --> 00:47:00,460
Watch this, people!

1107
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,800
Lots of people venture, breast into things,

1108
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,080
all of the pieces In a plane, boil down.

1109
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,860
Let everybody say

1110
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,360
Six of urgency

1111
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,400
Let everybody say

1112
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,860
Six of urgency

1113
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,060
Like the play that they've got in May

1114
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,760
It's only little until the last card is played

1115
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,140
Six of one, half a dozen

1116
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,140
Of the under-replieds of the bench

1117
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,800
The bench is a fucker

1118
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,100
A monster moving forward

1119
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,480
You want to crack a heart

1120
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,960
One monster take over

1121
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,280
One monster pop

1122
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,620
Play the emergency

1123
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,540
Six of urgency

1124
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,220
Play the emergency

1125
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,900
Six of urgency

1126
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,140
Back to the start

1127
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,760
To the drawing board

1128
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,200
Shake them out of business

1129
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,520
Swing them by the side

1130
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,320
Hop on to the bandwagon

1131
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,340
When it's last to go

1132
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:13,840
Everybody's going

1133
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,080
Destination's at home

1134
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,500
Well, I don't know

1135
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,980
So don't ask me

1136
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,680
We'll follow in each other

1137
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,040
Like they went to the sea

1138
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,480
Six of urgency

1139
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,300
Six of urgency

1140
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,020
Six of emergency

1141
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,620
Six of urgency

1142
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,660
Six of urgency

1143
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:38,660


1144
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,480
Six of urgency

1145
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,260
Six of urgency

1146
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,660
Six of urgency

1147
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,320
Six of urgency

1148
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,320


1149
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,320


1150
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,320


1151
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,320


1152
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,320


1153
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,320


1154
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,320


1155
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,400
Six of emergency

1156
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:53,420
Wow!

1157
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:55,740
Wow!

1158
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,340
Wow!

1159
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:58,900
Wow!

1160
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,100
Wow!

1161
00:48:59,100 --> 00:48:59,660
Wow!

1162
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,420
Wow!

1163
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:00,480
Wow!

1164
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,000
Wow!

1165
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,000


1166
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,060
Wow!

1167
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:01,060


1168
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:01,140
Without me

1169
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:01,260
Without me

1170
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:01,260


1171
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,120
Without me

1172
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,120


1173
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,120

1201
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,920
himself and dishonored

1202
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,480
the platoon.

1203
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,880
I'm trying to help him.

1204
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,780
I have failed.

1205
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,540
I have failed because you

1206
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,500
have not helped me.

1207
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,620
You people

1208
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,560
have not given Private Pyle

1209
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,540
the whole of Asia.

1210
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,140
From now on,

1211
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,920
when your Private Pyle

1212
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,080
fucks up, I will not

1213
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:55,940
punish him.

1214
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,420
I will punish all of you.

1215
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,960
And the way I see it, ladies,

1216
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,940
you owe me for one

1217
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,140
jelly donut.

1218
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:06,080
Now get on your faces.

1219
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,920
So you get the abstract meaning of the ladies

1220
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,300
owing them a jelly donut.

1221
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,420
You know there have been problems with the church,

1222
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,700
and of course there have been many problems with the armies

1223
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,800
amongst these very stern DIs

1224
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,820
who like to take it up

1225
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,060
all the way up, all the way up

1226
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,520
to the top of Jack Hill.

1227
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,600
Well, you know, my kids are going to be learning

1228
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,220
this stuff. For you know what,

1229
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,300
the softer soldiers

1230
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,660
that aren't going to make it through boot,

1231
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,460
you know, they have to make regular

1232
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,980
trip shit to the John.

1233
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,500
And, well,

1234
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:37,800
with one swell foop, we

1235
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,820
laid one on our military.

1236
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,440
We hope our brave boys out there

1237
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,500
don't feel compelled to

1238
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,040
jump in the shack with the first drill instructor

1239
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:46,820
that she...

1240
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,480
You know, that would be...

1241
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,300
We hope that they carry a picture of W

1242
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,900
in their breast pocket.

1243
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,440
And they carry an orangutan's

1244
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,720
breast on the top of their feet.

1245
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,500
Because most of them won't come out.

1246
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,720
The road goes on forever

1247
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,100
and the party never ends.

1248
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,260
I think that's true.

1249
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,520
Finally the fans put

1250
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:35,520


1251
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:35,820
And made it work.

1252
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:35,820


1253
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,740

00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:42,740

1264
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:07,740
I did read a story that there are drone planes already flying the southern parts of Iraq, destroying anything they see.

1265
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,820
That's what they're selling.

1266
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,040
They've already started that.

1267
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,900
They've been doing that for ten years, haven't they?

1268
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,360
Have you seen the army commercials?

1269
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,340
Well, they unleashed like a fresh batch of them, like just go terrorize everything.

1270
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,900
Have you seen the new Air Force commercial where the kid is out with his little plane?

1271
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,260
Hey, what is drone a euphemism for?

1272
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,220
What?

1273
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:27,360
Are they really sending out little drone robots?

1274
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,540
Or are they dressing up little drone men as drone robots?

1275
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,600
It's the chimpanzee clone syndrome and those crazy right-wing evangelicals behind it.

1276
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:36,940
They're just drone planes.

1277
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,580
They're unmanned planes that just fly around looking for targets.

1278
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:46,300
But have you guys seriously seen those spots, those Air Force commercials that show the kid flying his little robot plane?

1279
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:52,520
And then in the last scene, he's like moving one of those joysticks and you see one of those random shots over Iraq.

1280
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:53,440
Really?

1281
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:54,000
Oh, yeah.

1282
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:54,700
This is for real.

1283
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,500
Oh.

1284
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:56,420
Yep.

1285
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:56,860
Wow.

1286
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,400
They're selling the remote robot clone planes pretty good nowadays.

1287
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,820
Gosh, with the sun setting on our show soon.

1288
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:05,300
And the sun setting on the American empire.

1289
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,340
Or shitting them.

1290
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:06,640
No, no, no.

1291
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,740
Yeah, yeah.

1292
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:10,920
I don't know.

1293
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,080
With Anna Nicole's new show, I think we have a chance.

1294
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:19,560
Well, and now that rim jobs have come back into popularity.

1295
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,360
Really?

1296
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,060
With Anna Nicole.

1297
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,860
Although I, frankly, to me, I think that that's just really weird.

1298
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,360
Specific rim jobs?

1299
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:30,140
Well, there's a big, there's a...

1300
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,040
Man, that's pretty wild.

1301
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:32,860
Specific rim jobs.

1302
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,060
Let me put it this way.

1303
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,000
That's pretty twisted.

1304
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,320
You can use your butt.

00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:41,100
You can use your butt for sitting or you can use it for shitting.

1306
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:45,720
And I say there is one H of a difference between sitting and shitting.

1307
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:46,860
Till next week.

1308
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,260
Till next week.

1309
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,640
Keep your head on tight.

1310
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,080
Back in the wind.

1311
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,860
Keep your eyes focused.

1312
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,880
Upon your solar plexus.

1313
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,500
As the electromagnetic waves go by.

1314
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:03,740
Bye-bye.

1315
