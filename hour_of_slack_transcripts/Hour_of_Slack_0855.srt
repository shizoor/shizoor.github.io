00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,400
The Hour of Slack.

2
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,460
The Hour of Slack.

3
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,360
This is all a copy.

4
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,200
It's a copy.

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,380
It's a copy.

6
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,520
Now follow me carefully here because here's where we're going to depart from ordinary church.

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,940
God's not dead.

8
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,660
He's still alive.

9
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,420
God's not dead.

10
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,320
He's still alive.

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,800
God's not dead.

12
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,560
He's still alive.

13
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,340
I feel him in my hands.

14
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,960
I feel him in my feet.

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,500
I feel him all over me.

16
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,960
No, no, no, no.

17
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,600
No, no, no, no.

18
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,780
Heaven help us all.

19
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,080
God's not dead.

20
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,860
He's still alive.

21
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,660
God's not dead.

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,460
He's still alive.

23
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,960
God's not dead.

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,620
He's still alive.

25
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,480
I feel him in my hands.

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,100
I feel him in my feet.

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,620
I feel him all over me.

28
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,960
No.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:26,180
I feel him in my feet.

30
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:45,420
Friends, this was going to be a love show, but we're all paranoid still, so I changed my mind, and it's a war show with Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave at ESO Swamp Radio WCSB Cleveland.

31
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,080
The war drums are so nice.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,380
President Bush certainly is looking presidential and busy lately, huh?

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,940
Now what happened?

34
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,460
They opened the satchel and we're still busy with the sexes?

35
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,680
Is that what happened?

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:10,180
I don't know. I haven't turned on the news in six months since they knocked those buildings down.

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,280
It's pretty much George Bush and Dick Cheney against everybody in the world.

38
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,780
Dave, we all turned down, tuned in, and we dropped out, man.

39
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,160
Oh, man, you guys have gone the hippie way.

40
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,540
Yeah, we quit voting.

41
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,760
That's our protest against voting.

42
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,780
I'm going to become a nihilistic type dude.

43
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,140
You know what I'm saying?

44
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,400
Forget this dog stuff.

45
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,580
How about a neopaleon?

46
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,120
I've got a silly tumor and I'm yucking it up, you know, and the world's burning down around our knees.

47
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,460
Right. Right.

48
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,460
No, your world is burning down around your knees.

49
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,640
The world will simply do what it does.

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,260
Burn around its own knees?

51
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,720
Long after your world has burned to its knees.

52
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,040
Stand up and run.

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,040


54
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
There's new music

55
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,980
and new guys

56
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,200
and there's a new voice

57
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,240
who try but are not afraid to try

58
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,960
and let the old world make believe

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,540
it's blinded death

60
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,160

There are changes lying ahead in every road

There are new thoughts ready and waiting to explode

When tomorrow is today, the bells may toll for a song

And now I'm gonna hold it back for long

There are new dreams, crowding out old realities

There's revolution, sweeping life oppression

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,780
There's new breeze, let the old world make believe

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,280
It's blinded death and dumb

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,240
But nothing can change the shape of things

Nothing can change the shape of things to come

76
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,120
In the future all will be happy

77
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,200
Happy

78
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,340
Happy

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,320
In the future all will sing with glee

83
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,380
In the future there will be much rejoicing

84
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,260
In the future all will bow to me

85
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,080
There never will be any problems

86
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,700
There never will be any choice

87
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,280
No dissent or discontent

88
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,860
And there will only be one voice

89
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,320
So bow to the cog

90
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,600
Bow to the cog

91
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
Bow to me

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,580
Bow to the cog

93
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,640
Bow to me

94
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,140
I'm bow right now for the C-O-G

95
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,960
Count down to the cog

96
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,320
Bow to the cog

97
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,060
Breathe to me

98
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,220
Bow to the cog

99
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,320
Breathe to me

100
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,060
On your knees if you please for the C-O-G

101
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,200
C-O-G

102
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,040
I've got a plan in mind for you

103
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,760
Quit your job don't go to school

104
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,340
Break your bones, build my dream

105
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,900
You're a tiny gear in a big machine

106
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,240
I've got what you want, I know what you need

107
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,120
I've got ideas between my ears that would make your brain bleed

108
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,240
So, bow to the cog, bow to me

109
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,300
Bow to the cog, bow to me, I'm bowing right now for the COG

110
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,040
Countdown to the cog, praise to me

111
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,320
Bow to the cog, praise to me

112
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,740
On your knees if you please for the C-O-G

113
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:07,200
I will give you my all

114
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,460
I will give you a higher purpose

115
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll control your very soul

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,760
My will is yours now, do your chores

117
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,780
Or be beaten by a mole

118
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,040
And how will your lives have any meaning

119
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,780
After I'm buried, dead and gone

120
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,380
I'll build an army of giant robots

121
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,020
My evil plans will carry on

122
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,260
So, bow to the cog, bow to me

123
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,000
Bow to the cog, bow to me

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,020
I'm bowing right now for the COG

125
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,520
Countdown to the cog, bow to me

126
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,400
Praise to me

127
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,760
Bow to the cog, praise to me

128
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,960
On your knees if you please for the C-O-G

129
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,900
Bow to me from the Consortium of Genius

130
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:15,120
More of that from www.consortiumofgenius.com if you want it

131
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,820
And before that, Shape of Things to Come by Max Frost and the Troopers

132
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,380
Friends, there have been some really strange subgeniuses

133
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,060
And also some mal-aligned normals pestering me lately

134
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,060
And man, you know what, I've about had enough

135
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,020
I've had enough of that

136
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,040
I think people are going nuts

137
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,860
Is there still, is, is, have there been sunspots?

138
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,100
Did the Russian CIA guys turn on some ray? Oh yes, there is a tremendous amount of...

139
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,160
Oh yeah, they did, that's happening too

140
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,360
The kook meter at Subgenius Central is spiking

141
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,260
I have never seen anything like it

142
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,260
Well, war fever, there is war madness going on

143
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,660
And sometimes when they use the big subliminal generators

144
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,200
Lots of people, you know, start spazzing out in their everyday lives

145
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:09,120
Yeah, I have, I think that it's, it's like, you know, teachers, loony bin custodians

146
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,840
And cops and so forth all know this around full moons

147
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,520
That there's a real palpable increase in just general craziness

148
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,700
And it seems like, I mean, we're between full moons right now, man

149
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,120
What is going on?

150
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,100
What do you think is happening? What do you think is happening, Dr. Frederick?

151
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,800
There's people in those cars next to you

152
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,500
Why are they looking at you like that?

153
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,720
Are they following you?

154
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,880
Do they know your name? Why is he riding, what is he riding now? Your license number?

155
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,200
Have you ever, have you been checking out the white SUVs?

156
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,120
Do you know about Alex Jones? Have you heard of Alex Jones?

157
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,240
The internet so-called kook from Texas?

158
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,360
Yeah, yeah

159
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,500
Who believes that George Bush is the Antichrist?

160
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,120
Or at least one of his friends?

161
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,040
Yes, I guess

162
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
Well, who is the real guy?

163
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,060
Isn't every president the Antichrist?

164
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,280
Yes

165
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,780
I think so, I mean, you know, after all these years, I think they, that's what they're essentially running for is Antichrist

166
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,760
Reagan was best, because he had the six letters in each of his things

167
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,740
See, Clinton was on David Letterman last night

168
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:05,980
Yeah

169
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,940
Yeah, I heard that, I wish I'd seen that

170
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,840
What I would have done, Chaz and Stang, I would have dropped a bomb on Ethiopia

171
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,160
and made up some excuse about something else

172
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:24,060
I don't know, man, just, the war fever, I'm trying to break the war fever with a cold compress and maybe put an ice cube in my butt

173
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,700
And it's not working, man, I still got it

174
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,140
I know what you mean, man

175
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,460
It's a hard fever to break

176
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,420
It's, uh, I've been trying to avoid all of that, didn't turn on the TV during the day

177
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,080
Me neither, actually

178
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:41,820
Or anything, but, but I could still kind of sense the psychic echoes reverberating in my head

179
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,000
You could hear all the madmen in Washington, ah, you know, huzzahing at one time

180
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,220
Also, they all showed up on alt.slack and on the internet, uh, very interactively

181
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,820
Senator Prox, Prox, Prox, Proxide?

182
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,420
I'm afraid I have some bad news

183
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,380
Yes?

184
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,140
There's been an accident

185
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,160
No

186
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:41,820


187
00:12:41,820 --> 00:13:11,820


188
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:41,820


189
00:13:41,820 --> 00:14:11,820


190
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:41,820


191
00:14:41,820 --> 00:15:11,820


192
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:41,820


193
00:15:41,820 --> 00:16:11,820


194
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,700
Oh, I'll get it.

195
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:40,940
Know what it is, Nohlad?

196
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,180
Well, don't tell anybody

197
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,520
Well, theほax TV

198
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:41,800
The enfin, heh, heh, heh, blahonymous

199
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:41,800

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,020
for i am the lord that creeps defile yourselves therefore and be holy for i am creepy

206
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,980
and the monitor lizard whoever touches the monitor lizard shall be broken into

207
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,180
wing creeping things which have four feet but doesn't have fins and scales in the waters

208
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,600
for i am the monitor lizard your god

209
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,300
for i am the monitor lizard your god

210
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:43,300


211
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,020
executive order 13013 strengthens the federal government through waste and federal acquisition

212
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,940
of products

213
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,100
why is the video so long?

214
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,280
so we'll all be marching off soon

215
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:06,720
Yep, they're gonna even do it regardless if anybody cares what they care about

216
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:06,760
Yep, they're gonna even do it regardless if anybody cares what they care about

217
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,440
or anything. They're just going to go.

218
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,700
You're going to get your sticker in the mail, you're going to get a notice,

219
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,980
and you're going to have to show up for a physical.

220
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,100
Even England's going to stay home.

221
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,760
I think, well, I don't know if Tony Blair gets his

222
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,880
little BP card, his special

223
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,520
embossed BP card.

224
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,560
All I know is I

225
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,800
unearthed my draft card with

226
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,860
the 4F stamped on it

227
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,720
not long ago. I bet that 4F

228
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,700
is still good. I doubt if my

229
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,000
feet have gotten...

230
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,400
4F is your top foot?

231
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,480
4F? Flat feet? Anything else you could have?

232
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,380
Well, that's psychosis,

233
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,000
homosexuality,

234
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,720
well, they didn't have AIDS back then.

235
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,180
Sarcomas from Greece. Believe it or not.

236
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:45,860
Bulimia,

237
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,640
expandable buttocks. I was number 30

238
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,420
in the lottery. They were going to ship

239
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,420
my ass off to Hamburger Hill

240
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,820
and turn me into hamburger.

241
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,060
But instead they shipped off the rest of your body

242
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,840
and left your ass back in dear old Tejas.

243
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,220
And was it a wonderful thing for the

244
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,360
population of... I don't know.

245
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,140
I have friends who had the

246
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,500
best time of their lives

247
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,020
serving in the armed forces

248
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,260
during the Vietnam War. Then I have other

249
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,080
friends who have to take Valium three

250
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,320
times a day because they had the

251
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,560
worst time of their lives.

252
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,220
Most people don't like it. But the ones who

253
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,340
do, it's not the war. It's just the idea that

254
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,240
maybe they might die, but maybe they

255
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,360
won't. You know, they just get goosed up on it.

256
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,300
Then the rest go, oh shit, what did

257
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,140
I get into here? This really sucks.

258
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,340
You know? Well,

259
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,200
the marijuana on Guam

260
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,920
had a lot to do with...

261
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,140
the good times that I've

262
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,080
heard about. Well, on Iwo Jima

263
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,080
in World War II, the pot was so good

264
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,220
that they had to keep raising the flag

265
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,140
and lowering it and razor it and get the right

266
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,900
and they could never get the right angles or anything.

267
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,980
That's why that was a four-day shoot.

268
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,260
But most of the opportunities took place

269
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,060
on the U.S.

270
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,260
Those guys had to pose there holding that flag

271
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,840
in place while they got sculpted and

272
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,000
carved that big rock

273
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,200
to match their... Instead of glorifying

274
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,880
it, though. Yeah, I mean, that was...

275
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,640
Many people would die.

276
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,860
Think about that. How many people will be dead?

277
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,460
Oh, hell, we don't care about that.

278
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,680
We'll be mutilated by the smart bomb.

279
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,140
Death is something that happens to other people in America

280
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,080
unless it happens to you. You know what I mean?

281
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,760
Especially violent death

282
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,800
when the sky's red and the water

283
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,720
tastes like poison and is poison

284
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,880
and you can't... Well, let's not

285
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,680
get into it because... Why can't we just

286
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,280
all get a bong?

287
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,980
I've believed that for so long.

288
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,840
That's my credo.

289
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,680
In Vietnam,

290
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,380
the media

291
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,760
didn't know anybody.

292
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,180
They went ahead and showed the dead stuff,

293
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,020
the dead things and people

294
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,000
on the television, but you see,

295
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,520
nowadays, during that Gulf War miniseries,

296
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,260
you didn't see anything too unpleasant.

297
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,200
It was kind of like Star Wars.

298
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,220
Flying over the Death Star,

299
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,960
shooting with their ray guns,

300
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,760
and you'd see these pretty explosions

301
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,160
down there.

302
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,040
It was all just...

303
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,680
Yeah, it was psychedelic.

304
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,160
the media

305
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,620
people have

306
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,780
learned that you keep your blood

307
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,900
in your guts with the scary monster

308
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,020
movies and the babysitter murder

309
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,540
movies. Rollercoaster style.

310
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,940
And you keep your

311
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,200
romance with those

312
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,980
and with the news, you just keep it

313
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,640
hard. Yeah.

314
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,080
Just slightful.

315
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,280
It's the end of the world.

316
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,520
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

317
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,380
It's the end of the world.

318
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,800
I've gotten so tired of carrying around

319
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,540
that placard that says the world.

320
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,860
The end is nigh.

321
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,600
At this point,

322
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,040
it's like,

323
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,460
how many times have I drilled for the

324
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,420
end of the world now?

325
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
Ever since I was a teenager, really.

326
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,380
Since I was a little kid.

327
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Might as well just hold up in the puffer dome.

328
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,360
Might as well hide under your school desk with the newspaper

329
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,500
over your head.

330
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,000
Duck and cover.

331
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,440
That's all you guys are doing.

332
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,560
It's still just a bunch of duck and cover.

333
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,240
Duck and cover.

334
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,360
Duck and cover.

335
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,180
That's all you guys are doing.

336
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,420
You are dumb and dumb.

337
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,520
Duck and cover.

338
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,420
And you'll feel just freaking fine.

339
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,000
Yay.

340
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,580
Hey, man.

341
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,880
I think you've got the wrong attitude

342
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,560
about this war thing.

343
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,340
I mean, like, blood must be shed.

344
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,060
Thank you.

345
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,860
Down through our histories

346
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,880
We have been told

347
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,020
That women hold mysteries men cannot know

348
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,400
But boys learn through secrecy

349
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,320
How to hide lies

350
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,120
And cracks in their souls

351
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
And behind shaded eyes

352
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,120
They'd filter all light

353
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,320
Through the sins of their fathers

354
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,160
Shining on down

355
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,340
On good sons and daughters

356
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,480
We were true believers

357
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,960
And at this song of gold

358
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,480
I was a high holy fever

359
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
That purified the soul

360
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,760
But days turned to piss off

361
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,340
All equality allowed

362
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,720
As girls danced the go-go

363
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,420
To our golden calf

364
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,560
We borrowed the tune

365
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,800
From the hymns of our fathers

366
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,680
We are not rebels

367
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,840
Just good sons and daughters

368
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,900
Good sons, good sons

369
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,460
And daughters

370
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,940
Good sons, good sons

371
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,820
Yeah, the revolution came

372
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,860
Oh, the revolution went

373
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,800
And I'd never all

374
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,840
Just that 50%

375
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Oh, the truth that comes from tennis

376
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,080
From porno to rape

377
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,120
And bought into Hollywood

378
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,660
And kept the slight

379
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,560
Millions of Marylanders

380
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,160
Who died for their lovers

381
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,180
Seducing the culture

382
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,320
Of good sons and daughters

383
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,580
Good sons, good sons

384
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,200
And daughters

385
00:24:49,200 --> 00:25:02,100
Good sons, good sons

386
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,620
And daughters

387
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,520
Good parents

388
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,580
Sur Books

389
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,720
And Sei Unions

390
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,500
Good Harlequin

391
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:21,560
A little daughter

392
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:21,560


393
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:21,560


394
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:21,560


395
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:21,560


396
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,420
And we're a family

397
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:22,420


398
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:22,420


399
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:22,420


400
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:22,420


401
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:22,420


402
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:22,420


403
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,680
Do not look down

404
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,540
On the ground

405
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,040
There's dwell

406
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,040


407
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,040


408
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,020
She's reading through the paper

409
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,100
In her little keep

410
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,480
And I happened to see

411
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,760
A police officer

412
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,560
That looked a whole lot like me

413
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,480
And so I started dodging questions

414
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,640
A-line on top of lies

415
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,380
And I thought what I thought

416
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,020
Was a good alibi

417
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,560
I never knew your mother

418
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,640
Your sister or daughter

419
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,540
I ain't no killer

420
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,200
I'm a good son

421
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,420
Yeah, I'm a good son

422
00:26:50,700 --> 00:27:00,540
Yeah, I'm a good son

423
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:12,780
Yeah, I'm a good son

424
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:12,780


425
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:12,880
Yeah, I'm a good son

426
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,600
The Rainmakers

427
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,140
And now, Lemur

428
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,080
This weekend on BookBand TV

429
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,540
BookBand starting at noon eastern

430
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,460
Democrats in the corner

431
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,180
Look at a book banding with Lemur

432
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,740
Author of

433
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,480
Let's Cry

434
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:30,700
War

435
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,420
Let's Cry

436
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:31,760
Peace

437
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,640
Let's Cry

438
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:32,860
Cry

439
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,120
Cry

440
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Life coverage begins at 3

441
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,060
Starting at noon

442
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,060
Only on BookBand TV

443
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,880
We're talking about space aliens

444
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,540
If you'd like to join our conversation

445
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,240
Numbers are on the screen

446
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,440
2-0-0 for Republicans

447
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,920
And 2-0-1 for Democrats

448
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,960
And 2-0-2

449
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,460
2-2 for space aliens

450
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,300
I noticed in your article

451
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,320
There are a lot of companies

452
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,100
That are working on aliens

453
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,360
If you want to fall in love

454
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:02,840
With an alien

455
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,040
That's basically impractical

456
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,540
What about worldwide space aliens?

457
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,380
They're based on reality

458
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,280
But they're imaginary

459
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,520
What other countries

460
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,680
Besides the U.S. and Russia

461
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,640
Are in the space aliens?

462
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,420
Brazil is certainly one

463
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,720
That might surprise an alien

464
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,180
India is another

465
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,980
But they're imaginary

466
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,220
Are there regulations

467
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:30,540
That are in place

468
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,100
Regarding private aliens?

469
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,860
Can anyone shoot up space aliens?

470
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,220
We'll be covering that

471
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,060
In some future issues

472
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,160
But there are some folks

473
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,620
Who are deep in the moon

474
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,440
Do the space aliens

475
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,480
Have to pay their full way themselves?

476
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,680
Yes, they do

477
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,660
Are these just imaginary

478
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,120
Or are these actual aliens?

479
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,460
It was a propaganda effort, certainly

480
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,500
But that's not

481
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,500
And

482
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,560
But

483
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,480
The Russians

484
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:00,940
That

485
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,780
So there'll be some corporate sponsors

486
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,980
And where are they finding the aliens?

487
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:09,960
That's hard

488
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,100
They're not finding it

489
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,500
Is NASA funding any of this?

490
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,360
Well, that's the conclusion they came to

491
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,400
Based on a market study

492
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,240
One of them asked me where my flag was

493
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,180
And I said it was home in a box

494
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,080
Where it should be

495
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,480
Well, but of course it was at home

496
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,880
Where else would it be?

497
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,300
It's the same place we go every day

498
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,000
Of course, of course

499
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,200
To our own little rooms in Winkyland

500
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,740
Yes

501
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,740
Where no one ever goes home

502
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,940
And there's never any war

503
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,740
Never

504
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,580
Ever

505
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,980
It's all soft and fuzzy

506
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,940
War is good

507
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,500
And pink

508
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,820
War is good

509
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,680
War is good

510
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,500
War is good

511
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,300
War is good

512
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,040
War is good

513
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,840
Makes Jesus laugh

514
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,460
Makes the Virgin cry

515
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
Makes the children sing

516
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,240
Blue the skies

517
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,080
War is good

518
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,940
War is good

519
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,820
War is good

520
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,580
War is good

521
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,780
And St. Attila raised the hand grenade up on high saying

522
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,180
O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade

523
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,640
That with it thou mayst blow thy enemies to tiny bits

524
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,860
In thy mercy

525
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,420
And the Lord did grin

526
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,000
And the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths

527
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,280
And carp and elderbees and orangutans

528
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,880
And breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large-

529
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,480
Give a bitch, brother

530
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,700
I communicate without wires or strings

531
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,440
I have the evil eye

532
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,880
I carried the module bag

533
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,880
I swam the Bermuda Triangle and didn't get wet

534
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,780
I circumcised dinosaurs with my teeth and make em leave a tip

535
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,300
I changed tires with my tongue and my tool

536
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,860
Every night I hock up a lunger and extinguish the sun

537
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,460
I'm the big fitted devil of level fourteen and I'm the king of the world

538
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,220
Who'll try to blow me down?

539
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,480
I've packed the brownies of the gods

540
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,800
I am a mole radio

541
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,300
I am a Kamado dragon

542
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,760
I am the killer whale bereft of its pup

543
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,500
I have a triple backbone

544
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,460
I was sired by the wolf man

545
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,800
Give me all your slack

546
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,800
I told Jesus I wouldn't go to church and he shook my hand

547
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,120
I have my own personal saviors

548
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,640
I change em every hour

549
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,320
I don't give a have sex with

550
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,860
If there's life after death

551
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,980
I want to know

552
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,740
If there's even any frigging slack after death

553
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,220
Bah!

554
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,760
Well there are those who fear the end

555
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,820
Fear the fatalistic trend

556
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,100
But I'm the one who won't follow the crowd

557
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,240
I'll say death be not proud

558
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,780
Well

559
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:05,580
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death

560
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:11,740
Death, death, death, death, death to the angel of

561
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,340
Opposers say death cannot be killed

562
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,400
Like the proper defensive skill

563
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,680
Yelling out with an angry sound

564
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,020
Saying death, you're going down

565
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,000
Death, death, death, death

566
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,160
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death

567
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:37,220
Death, death, death, death to the angel of

568
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,900
Death is coming, the end is near

569
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,060
Grab a gun, put away the fear

570
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,140
Pull the trigger and blow him away

571
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,460
Death, this is your dying day

572
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:56,800
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death

573
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,180
Death

574
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,600
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death

575
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,740
I have arrived from the other side to take you away

576
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,580
But can't you see I'm doing my hair?

577
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,200
Well, you're dead now, so shut up

578
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,180
Says you

579
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:22,460
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death

580
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,980
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death

581
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:34,820
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death

582
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,000
It's not just a couple of кусンドos

583
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,320
You couldn't keep chapters like I can

584
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,860
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death

585
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,300
But it doesn't matter

586
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,300


587
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,860
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death

588
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,880
Death, death, death and you're in your squat

589
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,260
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death

590
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,440
Death, death, death, death to the angel of ..

591
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:57,860
Death, death, death, death to the angel of death

592
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:57,960
I'm overlayed with all these uses

593
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:57,960


594
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:57,960


595
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:57,960


596
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,860
Death to the angel of death

597
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:10,020
Death to the angel of death

598
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,960
Death to the angel of death

599
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,960
Death to the angel of death

600
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,960
Death to the angel of death

601
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:27,960
Death to the angel of death

602
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,960
Death to the angel of death

603
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,660
Death to the angel of death

604
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,340
Death to the angel of death

605
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,960
Death to the angel of death

606
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:27,960
Death to the angel of death

607
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:57,960
Death to the angel of death

608
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:16,580
Death to the angel of death

609
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:31,980
Death, Death ay

610
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,380
Yeah, gullys be here

611
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,620
Ya' built him a mass

612
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,140
You're like Ricky to Black Maca

613
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:44,180
His evil kindly plot destruction

614
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,900
Fortune of death construction

615
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,380
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

616
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:56,840
很有

617
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,960
?!

618
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:57,940
Aaaaahhhh

619
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:57,980
Instead认

620
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,140
Bye-bye, Fernanda Nende.

621
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,640
What if the guys who brought over the slaves

622
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,020
would have just let the slaves have their drums

623
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,420
and turned it into a big party?

624
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,920
Well, they didn't let them do that.

625
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,500
If you had a drum, they kind of killed you, I think.

626
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,660
And instead of opening up a big cotton factory,

627
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,720
opened up the biggest tourist attraction on planet Earth.

628
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:33,320
Well, that's kind of what the U.S. is eventually going to turn into.

629
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,920
A tourist attraction that no one attends

630
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,160
because of threats of terrorism by the government itself

631
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,520
and because of rampant schizophrenia in the streets.

632
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,600
Well, now that's your problem, Dave.

633
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,980
No, I think 60% of the children in a certain level of school

634
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,420
are on some sort of like behavior-oriented...

635
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,360
Turn in, drop out, baby.

636
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,960
That's what I'd do if I had...

637
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,380
I don't know if I had a chance.

638
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,800
And I'm not talking about out in Ashtabula.

639
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,320
Just drop it there?

640
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,740
God, it might not come back.

641
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,220
I mean, we just like sink into the snow.

642
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,340
Living in Ashtabula is not dropping out.

643
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,040
Wow, man.

644
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,780
Well, you can drop out while still living in Ashtabula, can't you?

645
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,360
Of course you can even drop out from dropping out

646
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,060
because you didn't end the cycle.

647
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,180
Yeah, yeah.

648
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,480
When you repent and quit your job and slack off,

649
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,580
well, sooner or later,

650
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,960
that becomes a job.

651
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,460
Take it from me, kids.

652
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,060
Right.

653
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,820
I mean, if you were to walk down the street naked every day,

654
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,460
wouldn't that soon become a job

655
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,160
and have no slack whatsoever?

656
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,220
The first day, think of how much slack there'd be

657
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,940
just to be walking down the street bare naked

658
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,320
to have people go and get the hell out of here, you know?

659
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,860
Well, the point is, when you're in a bag,

660
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,000
you've got to get out.

661
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,460
A bag?

662
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,400
Yeah, if you find yourself caught up in a bag,

663
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,200
then move.

664
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,780
Cut your way out of the bag.

665
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,740
We're out of a box,

666
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,560
but we're being...

667
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,920
I'm born again into different shapes in a bag.

668
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,180
No, you might just end up in another bag,

669
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,520
but at least it's a change.

670
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:03,920
Huh?

671
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,920
It's a change.

672
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,360
You might still end up in yet a bigger bag.

673
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,540
You get out of one trap and you're in a bigger trap.

674
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,620
You pull the wool there, wool off of your eyes,

675
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,320
but your own wool over your eyes.

676
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,660
What's the difference, you know?

677
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,340
Finally, when you begin pulling the pubic hair

678
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,880
over your own eyes,

679
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,800
is the truth finally revealed?

680
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,040
A falsified fact.

681
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,500
Fried in deep fat and kissed gingerly

682
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,920
with three or four maraschino churros.

683
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,100
You're grossing me out, Danny.

684
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,160
Uh-huh.

685
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,560
Uh-huh.

686
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:48,120
No more free will.

687
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:19,960
No more free will.

688
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:27,560
No more free will.

689
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,400
No more free will.

690
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:46,680
No more free will.

691
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,300
That's the way to polka.

692
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,560
That's the way to polka.

693
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,520
No more free will.

694
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:49,220
No more free will.

695
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,560
That's the way to polka.

696
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,680
The Brand Flakes.

697
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,380
And now, more questions.

698
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,420
So are we officially at war now, or what?

699
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,620
All three of us?

700
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,720
Yeah, we're having a...

701
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,560
Are we there yet?

702
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,880
I don't think we were officially at war during Vietnam, Chaz.

703
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:18,320
Right.

704
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,320
No, I don't think we declare wars officially anymore.

705
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:21,860
Right.

706
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,540
We just send a whole lot of guys and they die and then...

707
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,420
Go on a police action.

708
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:30,500
Some politicians wave the flag and get some money suppository enemies.

709
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,700
I brought some speeches for you to read.

710
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,460
The first one is by Julius Caesar, and the second one is from Hermann Goering.

711
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:45,580
Because the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor,

712
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,580
for patriotism is indeed a double-edged sword.

713
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,200
It both emboldens the blood and boils the blood just as it narrows the mind.

714
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,520
And when the churns of war...

715
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,160
Drums, I'm sorry.

716
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:03,380
When the dorms of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind is closed,

717
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,860
the leader will have to need...

718
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,600
Wait.

719
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,500
Will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry.

720
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:15,200
Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded by patriotism,

721
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,800
will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and gladly so.

722
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:21,840
How do I know?

723
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Well, this is what I have done.

724
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,340
And I am Caesar.

725
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,700
And that was Julius Caesar.

726
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,680
Well, supposedly.

727
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,540
Oh, Julius Maximus, too, I think was involved in that one.

728
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,480
Yes, the Lemur posted found that wonderful quote.

729
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,480
See, it goes back a long ways, doesn't it, Stang?

730
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:45,960
The idea of the consummate Maximus, the dictator, as you were, as it was, as it is.

731
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,620
Well, here's a good one from Hermann Goering at the Nuremberg trials.

732
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,480
For of course the people don't want war.

733
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,440
But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy.

734
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,240
And it is always a simple matter to drag the people along.

735
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:07,580
Whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship.

736
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:14,000
Voice or no voice, the people can always be bought to the bidding of their leaders.

737
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,300
That is easy.

738
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,640
All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked

739
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:23,000
and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and expose the country to danger.

740
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,020
I care.

741
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,780
I care for a lozenge here, Goering.

742
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:32,680
Or as John Ashcroft said, to those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost liberty,

743
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,660
my message is this, your tactics only aid terrorists,

744
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:40,840
for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve.

745
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,400
That's right, Stang.

746
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,080
Any form of discarnate speech or any kind of enveloping or anything like that

747
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:53,220
causes a friction or a fractality in the nation's body politic.

748
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,060
We lose our unity as a mass.

749
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,760
What's the way our bowels lose their expression of will when the leader speaks?

750
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,700
His voice to us is like the voice of a huge proboscis,

751
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,480
ding-downing his quacking sound and his crying in the rain.

752
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,880
And you know what the horrible, horrible, horrible thing about all this

753
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:21,020
is at the same time that I get so, you know, like ticked off of the blatant power,

754
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,880
the blatant abuse.

755
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,800
The abuse of our powerlessness that we all kind of have to sit and watch.

756
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,040
At the same time, I find myself going,

757
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:34,920
gosh, I hope that our young soldiers can kill those soldiers before they kill our young soldiers.

758
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,400
I hope the sleepy orgasm guns put them all to sleep in a wanky humor.

759
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,180
The weird, you know, thoughts that you find yourself having.

760
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:47,360
Because I know a bunch of soldiers that, you know, they're not being sent out now,

761
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,400
but they're being trained to be sent out.

762
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,840
Young subgenius.

763
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,980
I know a bunch of rebels.

764
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:53,760
Soldiers.

765
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,880
I know rebel soldiers hiding in the mountains,

766
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,140
waiting for the day when they can pour out like ants onto your forehead.

767
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,020
And that's worrisome to me.

768
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,800
I know, it is worrisome.

769
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,280
That's the kind of thing that makes me think,

770
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,960
gosh, I hope we really do have super Death Star bombs

771
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,240
that our wise leaders haven't revealed yet

772
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,860
that we can suddenly just unsheathe and clobber everybody with.

773
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:16,780
I would like our...

774
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,560
Strike terror into the hearts of everybody

775
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,880
until terrorists, even in our own country,

776
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,500
destroy everything completely.

777
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,200
And then it's like Planet of the Apes, Road Warrior,

778
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,160
and it'd be cool, man.

779
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,880
It'd be totally cool.

780
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,280
You wouldn't have to know the word.

781
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,900
You'd just get up and either rape or pillage

782
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,320
or be raped or pillaged.

783
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,280
You know, it'd be simple.

784
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,600
You wouldn't have these...

785
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,160
Have you ever been raped and pillaged?

786
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,820
...worksheets you'd have to fill out.

787
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,220
No, they have workshops you have to attend,

788
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,920
and then you fill the worksheets out either.

789
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,820
It's got a data blank on it.

790
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,720
It's got a keep up...

791
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,380
It would be like in the movies, man.

792
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,480
...on the bottom of the margin.

793
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,740
They're trying to prepare us for it.

794
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,340
We are.

795
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,120
We are in the movie, Stag.

796
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,620
We are in the worst damn movie ever made.

797
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,720
A movie made by big oil petroleum consortiums

798
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,900
and strange people with lizard eyes.

799
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,700
Yes? Oh, yes.

800
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,800
You look so...

801
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,580
as if it's far-fetched.

802
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:06,920
No.

803
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,520
How far?

804
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,820
No, I was just thinking how...

805
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,720
Dick Gregory used to say that

806
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,820
Hollywood was always preparing you

807
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,140
for what's next.

808
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,020
Now, I don't think that Hollywood

809
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,360
necessarily does this in cahoots

810
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:22,480
with Hollywood.

811
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,020
Oh, they do.

812
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:23,960
Other than...

813
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,500
Yes, they do.

814
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,220
I don't know if they need to

815
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,180
because, you know,

816
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,880
they all have the same pollsters

817
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,220
and marketing experts.

818
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,500
They all share the same databases.

819
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,320
Since I was an old guy...

820
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,360
Well, it's not an old guy.

821
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,500
I remember reading it, actually.

822
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,160
I remember seeing it.

823
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:38,620
Years ago.

824
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,900
Remember Jack Valenti,

825
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,260
the motion picture industry guy?

826
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,660
I've met Jack Valenti, actually,

827
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,280
and shook his hand

828
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,180
when I was only 15 years old.

829
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,120
Did you shake his...

830
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,920
I was part of a CIA-sponsored

831
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,500
propaganda thing.

832
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,140
As a young filmmaker,

833
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,260
that's no baloney,

834
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:55,700
but as you're saying...

835
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,920
You just proved me your point right now.

836
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,540
Yes, Jack Valenti,

837
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,700
who is, in fact, yes,

838
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,500
one of what we would term them.

839
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,220
The mole.

840
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:02,760
Yeah.

841
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,580
The mole in the...

842
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,240
Well, I don't know.

843
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,500
Who's the mole with the CIA?

844
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,760
Hollywood is the mole.

845
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,720
The American motion picture

846
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,560
information agents.

847
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,460
Oh, wow.

848
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,720
What a wonderful title.

849
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:14,880
Information.

850
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:20,200
Would take my old stupid claymation film

851
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,380
I did when I was real young

852
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,480
and submitted it to the CIA.

853
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,280
to film festivals around the world.

854
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,220
I guess as...

855
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:27,340
It's about communism

856
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,900
and the evil it represents to mankind.

857
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,640
It was, you know,

858
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,960
only much later that I realized...

859
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,780
These are collective claymations.

860
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,760
There was something

861
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,180
completely else going on

862
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,620
that didn't have anything to do

863
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,600
with some stupid kid's claymation movies.

864
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,080
True.

865
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:44,600
True.

866
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,540
Yeah, yeah.

867
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,080
It was really funny.

868
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,160
You know, and of course,

869
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,760
that was far, far years,

870
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,240
thousands of years later.

871
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,280
Did you hear the new...

872
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,860
Layers of geological time.

873
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,140
Unimaginable.

874
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,100
Did you hear the new

875
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,540
in this geological era,

876
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,840
this Pleistocene magma,

877
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,880
magma minimum,

878
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,700
the new paranoia

879
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,840
about, like, say, Burning Man,

880
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,280
where you saw the, quote-unquote,

881
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,840
film crew come in there?

882
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,640
Remember the...

883
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,600
Yeah, let's play.

884
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,180
...very upscale film crew?

885
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,500
Yeah, yeah.

886
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,220
Now, I have heard...

887
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,500
The scary, the one that scared me.

888
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:13,940
The scary one.

889
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,460
I saw the devil.

890
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,180
Yes, I saw the devil.

891
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,780
Okay, I have heard other people

892
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,820
who have been to festivals

893
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,560
and have seen the same...

894
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,160
Well, they describe them

895
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,180
as much the same

896
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,660
and said they scared

897
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,020
the bejesus out home.

898
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,320
And they said they had

899
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,160
the strong feeling

900
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:28,980
that they were some kind

901
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,120
of government goons.

902
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:30,800
Really?

903
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,020
Well, that's what I heard.

904
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:32,940
I just got the impression

905
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,840
that these were some kind

906
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,040
of rich, decadent aristos

907
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,500
from some London, you know,

908
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,320
disco video world

909
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,640
that's beyond my realm

910
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,800
of showbiz, you know.

911
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:46,940
Yeah, that's what

912
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:47,900
they wanted you to think.

913
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,740
The idea was when they point

914
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,140
that camera at you,

915
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,140
you're being irrationally

916
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,840
irradiated at about

917
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,680
100 millisquads per squack.

918
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,040
I thought it was just the acid.

919
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,560
Well, the acid was squacking

920
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,140
at you too,

921
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,720
but that's from a different gene.

922
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,620
That's why I don't...

923
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,140
You know, when some rich guy

924
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,320
looks like the devil to me,

925
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,780
I don't take it real seriously.

926
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,600
I don't do anything about it,

927
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:06,960
you know.

928
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,400
It might creep me out

929
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:08,960
for a minute.

930
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,400
What have you done to his eyes?

931
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,340
There's people that think

932
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,140
I'm the rich devil guy.

933
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,760
When the bullet has

934
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,920
pierced your helmet.

935
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:16,400
What the...

936
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,120
You know, it's like...

937
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:17,720
Whoa!

938
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,700
This is the song you hear.

939
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:19,840
Here.

940
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,220
La, la, la, la, la.

941
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,380
Now, that depends

942
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,460
on what movie you're in.

943
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,820
Can you see Laura Bush

944
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,180
with the devil copulating

945
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,900
and George sitting by

946
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,140
waiting for the new spawn

947
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:31,620
to come out?

948
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,920
And Laura Bush walks up to you

949
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,400
in an angelic little outfit.

950
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,240
Two little slutty daughters

951
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:38,660
dressed.

952
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,860
Each one of them

953
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:40,540
is sucking on one of those

954
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,800
heart popsicles, you know.

955
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,320
And they have those

956
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,660
weird devil eyes.

957
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,520
Oh!

958
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,400
Texas is the spawning ground

959
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,720
of spate and...

960
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,920
Come sleep safe and warm with us.

961
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,860
Yes, Texas is heaven.

962
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,100
Crawl into the baby crib

963
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,400
with Grandma Bush

964
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,140
for a real treat.

965
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:04,940
Or a tweet.

966
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:05,980
Hi, hi, hi.

967
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,380
Your heart may belong to Jesus,

968
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,740
but your ass belongs to the core.

969
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,540
Your ass belongs to W.

970
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,260
I just heard somebody

971
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,600
on a Nostradamus program

972
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,840
say that either

973
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,160
Shaddam Hussein,

974
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:23,940
Osama bin Laden,

975
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,840
or somebody named W. Buss

976
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,640
was the antichrist.

977
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,580
They couldn't figure out

978
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,380
the last one.

979
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,020
You know, the other ones

980
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:31,940
it was so easy to get to

981
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,840
Osama bin Laden

982
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,140
and Shaddam Hussein,

983
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,180
but the one that said W. Buss,

984
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:36,700
they were like going,

985
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,720
who could that be?

986
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,480
What happened to that guy?

987
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,680
Yeah, what happened to

988
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,260
that bin Laden guy

989
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,660
and what was his name?

990
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,120
Goldstein, that other dude

991
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,120
we were supposed to hate.

992
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,180
It seems like they changed

993
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,000
the hate hour

994
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,680
every month or something.

995
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:49,980
So now.

996
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,240
Well, Goldstein started

997
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,460
another department store

998
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,640
and I guess Osama bin Laden

999
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,800
has a huge number of car lots

1000
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,160
throughout the Midwest now.

1001
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:57,920
Oh, really?

1002
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:58,360
Oh, yeah.

1003
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,100
Starting in Detroit,

1004
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,640
he started with his empire

1005
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,600
and worked his way

1006
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,760
through central Michigan

1007
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,860
and now he's everywhere.

1008
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,500
Is he in competition

1009
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,000
with the Noriega car lots?

1010
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,640
The Noriega car lots

1011
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,580
have not been panning out

1012
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,260
too well over the last

1013
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:10,920
three or four years.

1014
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,900
Oh, those come out of Bogota.

1015
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,140
Yeah, they're going under.

1016
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,460
Now, a lot of the worried

1017
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,300
subgeniuses have been saying,

1018
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,100
what country should I move to?

1019
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:19,560
Right.

1020
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,580
That's a good question.

1021
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,260
Coast Belize and Costa Rica

1022
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:23,780
come up a lot.

1023
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,040
I've been suggesting Russia.

1024
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,680
I've heard since...

1025
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,900
It's silly over there now.

1026
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:28,760
It's nuts over there.

1027
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,100
It's a complete free-for-all.

1028
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,720
If you've got any money...

1029
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,200
You can get anything you want.

1030
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:33,880
You can get anything.

1031
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:34,980
You can live like

1032
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:35,880
Roman Polanski and Jack Nicholson.

1033
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,280
That's really decadent

1034
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,520
and weird now there.

1035
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,760
Yes, that's...

1036
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,780
There's a great book

1037
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,740
called Exile

1038
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,940
about American expatriates

1039
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,340
in Russia.

1040
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,860
Making their own

1041
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,020
little communities

1042
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,640
along the river Don,

1043
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,600
the river Dnipro,

1044
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,620
and the river Volga.

1045
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,620
Resting quietly

1046
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,140
in the fading sunshine

1047
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,120
before the winter comes

1048
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,020
and they freeze

1049
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:57,740
their American...

1050
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,400
That's what you get

1051
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,080
to think about

1052
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,060
for another...

1053
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,640
Happy Americans in Russia?

1054
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,380
Weak.

1055
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:04,620
Depatriated?

1056
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,440
I thought...

1057
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,240
See, I first thought

1058
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,520
depatriation was something

1059
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,100
you had to do

1060
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,040
at a doctor's office.

1061
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,660
Like, they remove

1062
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,740
the folds from your butt.

1063
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,100
Right, and then you

1064
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,640
would never get

1065
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,960
the folds again.

1066
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:14,380
Right.

1067
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,520
So, like, if your ass

1068
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,280
was too big,

1069
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,940
you just go get depatriated

1070
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,960
and you're like

1071
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,680
a GQ guy.

1072
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,800
You know, next thing you know

1073
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,100
the women in a

1074
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,200
Beechwood mall

1075
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,300
are, like, sneering at you

1076
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:24,640
and stuff.

1077
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,860
The ones that have lips.

1078
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,360
That's for the others, Dave.

1079
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,880
That's not for those like us

1080
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,740
who wear the bracelet.

1081
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,540
The secret...

1082
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,560
The secret bracelet.

1083
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,180
Oh, I saw those

1084
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,420
advertised on TV

1085
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,220
late at night.

1086
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,040
The secret bracelet?

1087
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:36,540
Yeah.

1088
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,340
I noticed Bush was wearing

1089
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,000
one the other night

1090
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,220
along with a decoder ring

1091
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:40,980
and we don't even get

1092
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,560
one of those special

1093
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,340
decoder rings.

1094
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:42,880
He could just, like,

1095
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,480
whip it up there and go,

1096
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,500
General Franks.

1097
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,080
No, they're like

1098
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,160
some kind of healing thing

1099
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,060
or something, I guess.

1100
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,180
They say Kennedy

1101
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,200
was so horny

1102
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:49,520
he would

1103
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,480
run off and leave

1104
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,280
the football.

1105
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,300
You know, the briefcase

1106
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,200
with the go-codes

1107
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:53,700
and the box.

1108
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,160
Yeah.

1109
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,420
And be, you know,

1110
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,380
Mr. President,

1111
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,480
we've got to get you

1112
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:57,800
to the ball.

1113
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:57,960
Uh-huh.

1114
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:58,580
Mr. President.

1115
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,760
I'll be with you

1116
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,640
in just a moment, boys.

1117
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,360
Till next week.

1118
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:05,700
Yeah.

1119
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,120
I just, yeah,

1120
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:07,560
wanted to come out

1121
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,100
and give her a hat

1122
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:08,780
to ask what you do.

1123
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,700
Keep your sack

1124
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,340
in the saddle

1125
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,080
if you want to.

1126
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,200
Keep your hat

1127
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,420
untied if you want to.

1128
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,460
Throw it away.

1129
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,340
I don't give a damn.

1130
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,420
Keep your hat

1131
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:19,860
untied.

1132
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,220
Your back,

1133
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,080
your back to the wind.

1134
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:21,680
Oh, yeah, that was

1135
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,020
one of them.

1136
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:22,660
Yeah, it's important.

1137
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,700
What do I care?

1138
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:25,780
Was, was

1139
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,680
watch your ass

1140
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,420
one of those?

1141
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:27,740
Invert.

1142
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:28,640
Watch your ass.

1143
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,580
Watch your ass.

1144
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,080
Invert.

1145
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:30,980
Invert.

1146
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,800
Watch your ass.

1147
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:33,940
Wash your,

1148
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,060
and oil your saddle.

1149
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,540
And make sure

1150
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,620
those feet are oiled

1151
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,440
too, the way Jesus

1152
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,620
liked to oil his ass.

1153
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,060
Keep your back

1154
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:42,860
to the wind.

1155
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:43,660
Spit.

1156
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,380
And so the Christ

1157
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,600
was woven

1158
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,540
from memory

1159
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,160
of own

1160
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:48,940
testicles

1161
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,400
and the world

1162
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:49,400


1163
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,320
in the sad

1164
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,240
formal book

1165
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:51,880
that he could

1166
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,420
heal

1167
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:53,480
in a minute.

1168
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:54,200
Oh, God.

1169
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,320
What do we learn

1170
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,860
to get back

1171
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,340
as a guy?

1172
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,820
Take me home

1173
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,380
you silly boy

1174
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,380
cause I'm still

1175
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,480
in love

1176
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,960
with you.

1177
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,520
peace

1178
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:32,520


1179
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,740
peace

1180
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:33,740


1181
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:33,740


1182
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,820
you

1183
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,740
can

1184
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:44,140
you can

1185
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,360
know

1186
00:58:49,420 --> 00:59:05,320
write to Bob and request that information from post office box 204 206 Austin Texas 78720

1187
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:16,740
if however you have had a body in the house for more than five days and if it is safe to go

1188
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:22,240
outside then you should bury the body for the time being in a trench or cover it with earth

1189
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,420
and mark the spot of the burial
