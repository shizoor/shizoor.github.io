Somewhere in the forbidding tundra mountains of Lapland, high above the Arctic Circle,
a group of mining engineers were prospecting for copper.
But what they unearthed was a story. A story that was to terrorize the whole world.
I'm in there and have to dig life with father, and I mean Father Slack.
What is that red button over there, dear?
Go ahead, please.
Once upon a time, in a famous story, a girl named Alice got very curious about a little white rabbit who passed by.
She followed him and soon found herself falling down a very deep hole into a strange place called Wonderland.

The 1980s will be the most catastrophic decade in the history of man.
And yet no one who will accept what God has to say has to be afraid.
As a matter of fact, you can be so excited that every day can be a day where you are not only optimistic, but saying, this might be the day.
This may be it.

That hot winter, that cold summer, I broke a bottle of wine over her head.
Heh.
She was lying on her back playing with herself.
Skirts up over her head.
She reminded me of my mother, that cold winter, hot summer under the sea.

Spreading them gently and eating them in the raw.

Okay. Sign here. They did it.
Well, I couldn't wait. I just had to see you. Don't you understand, Bob? I'm not going with you.
What do you mean? I don't love you, Bob.
I'm not sure I ever did. Come on, come on. Let's hear the rest of it.
Sorry, Bob, but your dream has become my nightmare.
Well, Bob, you sure do have a high burn rate with women.
Maybe I ought to take a break from that high maintenance kind.
Maybe you ought to give me a try. I'm somewhere right between high key and low key.
Just a little bit hokey. Accent on the ho. How come you never took me for a tumble, eh, Bobbo?
Hmm. So, come here often.
Why?

is dedicated to our good friends and prayer partners,
Dr. Philo Drummond, Reverend Dr. Uncle Onan Canobite, and Azo,
whose birthday today is May 1st, when this show is being recorded.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, and Princess Wee is here,
and we're going to read a story to you in a second.
First, I should mention that last song,
Wings of a Bob, was by the great Lemur.
Susie the Flusie was heard before that,
and before that, the Firesign Theater from Radio Hour, Hour No. 1.
Before that, puzzling evidence with Dr. Philo Drummond.
Happy birthday, and Dr. Howe.
And later, we'll hear a song by Onan.
But first, friends, I have a manuscript here.
This was turned in by Reverend Teeters Laverge
of the church.
He's been, well, I'll just read it.
The title is The Agent and Mr. Dobbs.
And actually, the manuscript is from October 1962.
But these papers were found on the body of a transient party clown
in the city of Albany, New York, in 1989.
The papers had been meticulously taped back to the church,
and were put together after an apparent attempt at shredding them.
Some pages are missing.
The party clown was determined by the county coroner
to have been killed by being force-fed copious amounts of silly putty,
some of which still had a cartoon imprint
of a pleasant yet disturbing face
of a smiling man with a pipe clenched between his teeth.
Now, here is the manuscript.
As I said, this is from 1962,
so you'll have to forgive some of the dated terminology
used by the agent who wrote this.
I'm skipping over a part where he was dropped off
at the Dobbs house or mansion.
The knocker on the huge oaken front door
was a rather heavy, rusty iron piece
in the shape of a dollar sign.
I banged it down thrice and awaited an answer.
Soon, the door creaked open,
and in front of me stood the tallest colored man
I have ever seen,
even taller than Agent 541.
However, he had a very high, squeaky voice
that resembles a certain cartoon mouse.
He asked me my business,
and I replied that I had an urgent appointment
with Mr. Dobbs.
The man answered,
answering the door seemed fairly out of it too,
and replied back that the sky was pretty damn blue today.
Again, I had to wait a few minutes
until he asked me my business,
but before I could answer,
he was ushering me into the cavernous building.
Once inside, I noticed that it was rather well-appointed
with both new and antique furnishings,
which to my eyes seemed to come from all corners of the earth
and were set about in no discernible pattern.
There were piles,
piles of paper,
and stacks of money everywhere.
What caught my eye, though,
was the incredible amount of junk laying about the place.
This Mr. Dobbs, it would seem,
had a habit of collecting useless objects
found by the side of the road.
Finally, after walking through many hallways,
I was shown to a door and told to walk in,
but I was expected.
I did as told.
The room I entered was the most sane
that I had so far seen,
a typical den that any well-cultured man
may have in his home.
Mr. Dobbs was sitting in a large leather armchair
with his back to me,
a billow of smoke coming up from his front.
I slowly walked over to him.
He said nothing, but with his right hand,
he motioned me to sit on a folding metal chair
adjacent to him.
He seemed to be engrossed in a television program.
It was Leave It to Beaver,
a wholesome program.
Suddenly, he began to speak.
I do love this show.
That Ward Cleaver is one relaxed man.
Connie doesn't like me to watch this program.
She thinks it's pornographic,
but that's why I like it.
He fell into a deep silence,
intently watching a commercial
and nodding his head in time with the jingle.
When the commercial ended,
he turned to me and asked,
What can I do for you, young agent?
I noticed then,
that even though the upper half of his body
was clad in a dark suit with white shirt and dark tie,
the bottom half of his body
was clad only in wingtip shoes.
It was very disturbing
and put me off for a moment,
but I'd been warned by my handlers
that this Mr. Dobbs
had many tricks up his sleeve,
and I took this as his way
of making a person uncomfortable.
I regained my composure and told him,
Mr. Dobbs, the agency I work for
has a request for you.
When suddenly, Mr. Dobbs,
got up out of his chair
and walked over to a well-appointed wet bar
and poured a tumbler full of what he claimed
was the finest scotch,
saying it was from Malaysia or Canada or somewhere.
My memory begins to get hazy here.
It was not scotch at all.
It smelled like grape,
but tasted, for the life of me,
like gasoline.
He bade me to drink.
Knowing that he's an important partner,
I tried to force down a sip.
Then, Mr. Dobbs did the strange,
strangest thing.
He started to do what I believe
is called a hula dance,
yet he was humming some tango to himself.
Even though I was warned
about his eccentric behavior,
I can't abide a half-naked man
dancing in front of me.
Yet I was transfixed.
I know now that I must have been drugged.
He danced for a while,
too close to me for my waning comfort.
My heart beat faster,
and the rank smoke
from his pipe seemed to make my head swim
and my vision fade.
I thought I was about to faint
when my heart nearly burst
as I felt a pair of hands
starting to massage my shoulders.
I looked up to see
a beautiful blonde
with a perfect perm smiling down on me.
I took this to be his wife, Connie.
She said,
Don't fret.
Bob likes to dance on Fridays.
She continued,
Now, now, dearie,
we mustn't mess with our company.
Mr. Dobbs ignored her
and continued his lewd dance.
Connie bade me to ask Bob
what questions I may need to ask him.
I started out by getting straight to the point,
reminding him of the troubles with Cuba.
Mr. Dobbs then did the queerest thing
I'd seen him do yet.
He ran over to a big wooden box on the bar,
opened it,
and pulled out a huge novelty cigar.
He then proceeded to insert
said huge novelty cigar
up his
neither port.
The cigar spontaneously ignited
and Mr. Dobbs blew smoke rings
out of his ears.
Surely this was an illusion
or a hallucination from my drugged state.
I found myself mesmerized
by Mr. Dobbs' antics.
Connie's back rub and the scotch
I found myself taking a liking to.
Connie's hands reached down to my
left hand.
I was in a lap
as I watched Mr. Dobbs
preach about economics
and Cuba and war
and how it all tied together
all the while bent over
with a huge cigar puffing away
in his nether port.
That is the last I remember
of that evening.
The ensuing lie detector tests
and truth serums have borne that out.
I awoke the next morning
late, I believe,
with a cool breeze fluttering
through pastel pink curtains.
I had the worst hangover
I'd ever experienced.
I cannot fully describe the sensation.
It was somewhere between
getting a root canal
and the high of three martinis.
I was startled to notice
that Connie Dobbs was nude
lying next to me.
I tried getting up
but soon regretted it
by the dizziness it caused
and worst of all,
I saw what was laying next to Connie.
All I saw was its shoulders
and a cheap bouffant wig on its head.
Its skin was gray.
I don't mean sickly,
human gray.
I mean gray as gray can be.
Its body shape was all out of whack, too.
Then I had fleeting memories
of a wild sexual encounter
with Mrs. Dobbs
and something else.
I remember having intercourse
with orifices that were
not human.
I must have shuddered
for Connie rolled over
and picked up a glass
of some clear liquid
off the nightstand
and two tablets.
She demanded I take them
for they would make me feel better.
I inspected the tablets
and though they resembled
your basic aspirin,
they were had embossed on them
the word pills
spelled P-I-L-S.
Afraid of being drugged again,
I tried to hide them in my cheek
but when I drank the liquid
they just slid down my throat.
Within minutes,
reality started to fade
and some sort of orgy began.
The last thing I remember
was Mr. Dobbs dressed as a clown
with no pants on, of course,
attempting to take my virginity.
I still have nightmares about this
but as they say,
my country right or wrong.
Weeks passed
that I have little memory of.
I know this only because of the date
in which I was retrieved
by the agency.
The Dobbses and their minions
kept me pretty well
fropped up as they called it.
The next event
that I have any clear memory of
was of taking a ridiculously
long elevator ride
deep into the earth
at the Bobco Mining
and Soylent Green Consumption.
It was a very long ride


to get to the Mining Consortium
in Wyoming.
We must have been on that elevator
for three hours.
One of Dobbs' minions
took my watch during the orgy
and refused to give it back
saying Bob doesn't pay enough
and he had to get some stuff
for a weekend party
he and the Kennedys were having
with one Dr. Oswald.
When we finally alighted
from the elevator
to my surprise
we were not in some mine shaft
as I expected
but in a huge, vaulted warehouse
full of novelty goods
that were being sold







stacked and sorted
by strange, short men
shrouded in sack rags.
Bob claimed that they were
ex-Nazi scientists
working on some
quote,
super-duper extra-secret
unquote
project for the government.
I could clearly see that they were
not men at all
but slaves of some unknown species.
By this time
I had found it to my better judgment
not to doubt Mr. Dobbs
at least not out loud.
We took a golf cart type of vehicle
down a long, winding corridor.
Mr. Dobbs not once paid any attention
to where he was driving.
He decided to at that time
ramble on and on
about some mysterious substance
he called
slack
all the while puffing insanely
on his pipe
the bowl of which soon glowed
a bright red.
During this journey
we ran over three
of Bob's slave men
and nearly hit countless others.
Mr. Dobbs was oblivious to eating
and was hard to eat.
We finished our trick
and ran back to our homes
admit the danger
Dici,
I flew to the
as you all saw
I had picked up



words
I can barely describe it.
It was a total mess and stank of the tobacco that he constantly smoked.
In fact, I never saw Mr. Dobbs without that infernal pipe clenched between his teeth.
It was only after a few minutes of adjusting to the stench and the mess of the office
that I saw something that horrified me.
The place had several severed human heads strewn haphazardly all over.
Now, I've seen some terrible sights in my life,
and I suspect that if I'm on the Dobbs case, I will see worse.
But what made me gasp was that the heads were not of random humans,
but of public figures that we would all recognize.
I saw the heads of...
And this section was carefully cut out of the original report.
And one was actually singing.
It begged me in a tenor to please kill me.
Surprisingly, in the state I had been in, I did not faint.
Instead, with all the smoke from Bob's special tobacco mix, I started to laugh.
This got Bob...
Bob all worked up.
He started to jump around inanely and laugh.
He then proceeded to use one of the heads, not the singing one,
in a most foul manner.
Bob bade me sit down on a chair that was stacked high with papers.
I looked at the stack and back at Bob, wondering what he expected me to do.
By this time, I'd begun to get in the spirit of the situation
and laughingly knocked the stack of papers on the floor.
Mr. Dobbs didn't seem to mind.
In fact, he stared down at the mess I made,
and said,
Thanks!
Picked up a sheet of paper, saying he'd been looking for this contract for quite some time.
The glyphs on the sheet were of no known human alphabet that I have ever encountered.
For some reason, this worried me,
and reminded me of the slaves I saw working for Bob,
and that dreadful night with Mrs. Dobbs,
and that strange gray creature.
I did not have much time to consider the implications,
for Mr. Dobbs wadded up the paper,
tossed it in a corner,
and told me to follow him.
This time,
we did not take the vehicle,
but instead walked down dark and dank corridors,
which had a gradual downslope.
Being without a timepiece,
I cannot estimate the amount of time we walked,
but it seemed like hours.
Here, I must admit,
my perceptions of time had been warped by constant exposure to Bob's tobacco.
Mr. Dobbs finally guided me to our final destination.
What I saw in that final circle of hell,
I cannot,
I will not reveal.
Through all the pressure that the agency could bear against me,
a loyal, true blue agent and American,
I found it in our best interest to keep some things secret,
even from the boss,
the man in the dress.
I do this for the good of our nation,
and out of fear,
for what Mr. Dobbs revealed to me was so horrific,
so humorous,
so bizarre,
so unchristian,
so baffling and dangerous,
that I hyperventilated through the inane laughter
that was my only defense,
lest I totally lose my mind.
The last thing I remembered that day was Mr. Dobbs dancing around my prostrate body
he was prancing, really,
and mimicking my insane laughter with his own even crazier chortles.
He spoke no words,
he just laughed,
but his laughter seemed to speak volumes to my inner mind.
I laughed, I wept, I urinated in my undergarments
for Mr. Dobbs had somehow relieved me of my slacks,
when, I do not recall,
I awoke, I'm not sure when,
on a garbage-strewn beach in some tropical or subtropical location.
I recall the sound of ocean waves breaking on the shore
and that of a mambo band.
I almost choked when I was offered a daiquiri by the dictator
F blanked out C blanked out,
probably Fidel Castro,
who was sitting next to me on the beach towel.
I drank the beverage only out of a severe thirst.
It was tasty, however, you can't beat good Cuban rum.
Sitting on the other side of me was Dr. Oswald,
who was removing the cash from my wallet,
mumbling about,
that damn Bob never pays me on time.
I was so overwhelmed that I did nothing to counter his actions.
And friends, at this point,
I, Reverend Stang, must cease reading from the document
The Agent and Mr. Dobbs,
brought to us by Reverend Teeters LaVerge.
I've gotten a little ways with it,
but I'm going to switch it back to Part 2.
It goes all the way up to Part 6 so far.
However, I have a piece of music here that I think will be
extremely pertinent to the subject matter.
This is Reverend Angry Larry.
You know I live a life of danger for the FBI
Keeping tabs on our nation on the land on the sea in the sky
And every single night before I go to bed
I get down on my knees and say,
Bob, I'm a secret agent man
Secret agent man
Secret agent man
They give me a number
But they take away my name
I got one hell of a job to perform for the U.S. of A.
Got the responsibility of our nation's top security
But every night and day
I salute the flag and say
Thank you, Connie, cause I'm
I'm a secret agent man
Secret agent man
Secret agent man
They give me a number
But they take away my name
You know they got me doing this, doing that
A little bit of something else
Fighting cavities of evil
Safeguarding America's health
But I'm an afternoon paper
I don't get up off my ass
I don't get up off my ass
Thank you, Stan, cause I'm
I'm a secret agent man

is from the soundtrack of Kenneth Anger's movie Lucifer Rising,
rather a rare piece.
And now let's just see what we have here.
Let's see what we have.
Ah, it's just what I thought it might be, one of those singing heads.
A wafting from your third, towards your third nipple.
My third nipple, yes, my extra-numerary nipple.
Super-numerary nipple, sorry.
Extra-numerary means you can't be counted.
Right, super-numerary means it's from the planet Krypton.
Thank Dobbs for that.
Thank Dobbs, I'm a secret agent, man.
You guys are out of sync.
See, we were...
I remember the oomph-wah part.
I know the oomph-wah part.
She's good at the oomph-wah part.
That's her specialty, the oomph-wah part.
Your perverse-pective, your own individual perverse-pective.
So what were the agents really trying to confine themselves to
as they rode down the humble highway of driftage and of lies?
I don't think the agent really knew what...
why he had been assigned to the Dobbs case.
Although, boy, does it get complicated.
In the next installment, at one point,
he's at a party in a horrible, horrible dive
with President Kennedy, Nikita Khrushchev,
who he's in a drinking contest with.
Figula, figula.
Richard Nixon is chasing a little dog
around the...
The bar.
Well, he later ends up barbecuing him, the dog.
Well, that makes more sense.
And, of course, the aforementioned Dr. Oswald.
It's a really complex...
I mean, Teeters has not managed to translate the whole thing yet,
so we're up to a part six,
but we don't know how many parts there are going to be
because they're still trying to piece together
all the shredded remnants.
Well, what were the original artifacts?
Were they in Punic or Carthaginian or something like that?
No, it was...
Let's see, what did it say at the beginning?
No, it was in English.
It was a report from an agent from 1962.
He refers to the boss as the man in the dress,
so I'm assuming he's an FBI agent
and he's talking about Hoover.
Right.
Or he could be talking about those weird nights
when JFK would dress up in Jackies, really,
really fine Dior originals from France.
Now, come on, that's not so weird.
Well, it's not so weird.
Don't you...
Well, I mean, didn't you like to pull your cousin's underwear
out of the drawer and dress up in it?
Well, I like to...
I have sniffed some panties in my days.
And they were clean, too, and they were in a drawer,
but I don't know, the allure, the thrill, it was...
I don't know, when you were 13
and you could smell a grown girl's panties
without getting caught in it.
Well, I was waiting on the onion just to see if I could...
This morning...
No, they didn't smell like onion.
That has been declared perfectly masturbatable now
in the book of Standards and Practices.
So it's, like, now considered okay
to abuse one's...
touch oneself while going through
one's female cousin's clothing.
So it's funny you should mention that.
It had already been part of a survey,
a government survey.
It is, however, not okay to break into one's home
and take the panties and smell them.
That cat burglary is illegal.
That's stealing.
And that's panty-raiding,
and it's also a crime punishable
by years of self-inflicted misery and confusion
and sometimes a vaster malaise
that purports to the society at large.
Now, Dave, this is starting to sound like a confession, man.
Oh, I...
Hey, man.
It's okay.
What's with that, man?
You may confess to your priest,
your sacred scribe, which is me in this case,
but I'll just go and tell everybody.
I'll just put it all over the Internet
as soon as you tell me.
Well, I think you should,
and that way I can face up to it in a manly way
because if not, it's just more hiding under the pillows,
thumb-sucking, fuzz-snatching
from the nearest yellow blanket,
crying in the rain, cursing the stars.
It's painful.
I mean, it isn't painful right now,
but, I mean, the experience is painful.
The Buddha said life is pain.
Well, they all say that, don't they?
Except for Dobbs.
Dobbs kind of says it too, doesn't he?
Kind of?
Yes, he would say life is pain
for those who have yet to...
Pay.
...become subgenius ministers in that one way
that we don't talk about
on this public-supported stage.
And Frank Zappa says don't eat this yellow snow,
but don't suck the yellow blanket either.
Jawohl.
So you know Professor Zerhatz of Vienna,
you're associated with his work.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

your jaw feeling?
Dave, the last time we saw you,
which was about four years ago,
you had a bandage on your forehead all the time
because of the weeping third eye problem.
I think it hadn't quite grown into an eye yet.
So all it could do was wink and weep,
but it wasn't seeing, and you had it covered up.
It was kind of like a...
How did that turn out?
It's kind of like an elephant's trunk is what it reminded me of.
It was very small, but as it got bigger,
it started to drift forward with that peculiar roll,
like an elephant's trunk.
I got very nervous because, as you know, I'm a poor refugee,
and we can't afford help from various relief agencies
that don't want to fork out.
So what I did was I tried soaking it daily, as I was told,
a good way to get out of seeing the doctor.
But I didn't know you had to do it three times a day.
And, of course, I didn't know you could, like, maybe skip three days
if you weren't in the mood or too lazy or out of it.
And you had to soak it in Genkom on top of that, right?
Yeah. It draws it out. The Genkom draws it out.
Yes, it's a Genkom compress.
And actually puts it on a canvas afterwards and frames it.
But...
I kept on, you know, worrying about it, but not doing nothing.
And it got bigger and bigger, and it was alarming people
because it would stick out of the bands. It was so big.
And one night I had a bunch of other problems.
Like, there were people that were contacting me,
claiming to be secret agents and all this other stuff
that I couldn't quite comprehend, and I got real scared.
So I was in one of these real fretful moods,
and I just started pushing on this thing as hard as I could.
And it did hurt.
It hurt quite a great deal, but an enormous amount of flotsam
came billowing out in a very humorous way,
as anybody who's popped a cyst will remember.
An ill-humour, yes.
Yeah, I mean, you can hit photographs that are across the room.
Yeah, the humours actually come squirting out,
and they smell like death itself.
Now, this only... That's what alarmed me.
This one part smelled like death, and I...
Oh, this is out of me now.
But the other part was pristine.
It was clean and clear, and almost smelled like baby's saliva.
It was very, very, very clean-smelling.
And there were, like, pieces of stuff that didn't make sense.
They were, like, flat.
Like some sort of vertebrae or something.
Platelets.
Platelets.
Perhaps.
Could they have been very large, single-celled animalcules?
Could have been.
Did they move?
Did they wriggle?
Yes, they did.
Is it good?
Yes.
The alien implant part?
That's what I was thinking.
It was some kind of microbial alien implant.
Yes.
A thing unto itself.
That's the first thing that would occur to some people.
That's what it sounds like to me.
Well, you're the expert, Princess We Are Doe,
queen of all the UFOs.
Oh, she has a favourite movie now.
We saw the 1957 movie Queen of Outer Space recently,
which was filled with space.
Princesses.
And tonight we're going to, we'll probably watch the end of
Frankenstein vs. the Space Monster.
Hold that further away from the microphone.
I love that.
Princess We was waggling her tail right next to the mic.
I associated the sound with those outer space princesses' hats
that went boing, boing, boing over their heads.
Now, Dave, so you had this illness,
but you were too poor to go to the doctor, right?
I was told that I could go to the doctor and say,
I demand assurance of care,
which means they technically won't let people die on the street,
that they have to do something.
And many people do do that.
They say that and they sign the forms.
But I was also afraid of those things that look like palette knives,
only they're real sharp.
And those other things that have like, they're real long on one end
and they have a compression thing on the other end and they stick it in you.
Well, and then...
And plus, anytime you go into a hospital,
you're risking exposure to the mutant antibiotics,
which are worse than the infection you came in with.
Definitely.
It is a true, true fact that hospital infections are...
There are more of them than there are ones outside of the hospitals.
So you're actually safer outside.
You could just be in the parking lot and get treated out there.
Absolutely.
That would probably be better.
Just pour some whiskey on that wound.
Give him a...
A shovel handle to bite down on and start cutting.
Saw that third eye elephant trunk off of his forehead.
Slap a bandage on it.
Pour some more whiskey on it.
Okay, now put all that hot poker on there.
You cauterize that wound.
That feels good.
Well, it does seem like it's getting harder for a poor man to get a break.
Even a moderately in-between man.
No, there are none of those left.
There's only the rich man...
Or, well, the...
What?
About 400 or 500 rich men.
And then the rest of us.
And we're all poor.
On this day...
I told you I was going to read another thing.
Here it is.
On this day, it behooves us to remember the words of Martin Niemöller.
First, they came for the communists.
And I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist.
Then they came for the trade unionists.
I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews.
And I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew.
Then they came for me.
And there was no one.
No one left to speak out for me.
And I added.
Then they came for the mutes.
But, um...
Mr. Niemöller wrote his poem decades ago.
It might read like this today.
And this is something our friend Zaphod sent us.
But I...
He doesn't know who wrote it.
And I don't either.
But get this.
First, they declared corporations were people.
And I didn't complain because I'm already a person.
Then they made unlimited money.
Speak!
And I didn't complain because the American dream says I'll be rich someday too.
Then they commandeered the means of production by shipping our greatest strength, manufacturing, overseas.
Because they don't have bothersome unions over there.
And I didn't complain because Walmart has cheap stuff.
Then they bought Congress so they could write the laws.
And I didn't complain because I can't be bothered to vote.
Then they bought the Supreme Court so they could cement their rule.
And I didn't complain because I don't have time to pay attention.
Then they bought the news so that they could convince everyone it's always been this way.
And I didn't complain because it's always been this way.
Then they manhandled an election.
And I didn't complain because I'm not from Florida.
Then they lied us into wars.
And I didn't complain because I'm not a soldier or an Iraqi or an Afghani.
Then millions died for profit.
And I didn't complain because the graphics on the news were totally awesome!
And I didn't complain because the graphics on the news were totally awesome!
Then they started locking people up because they said they could.
And I didn't complain because nobody locked me up.
Then they started spying on everyone because they said they could.
And I didn't complain because I'm a real American.
Then they came for the worker.
But thanks to supply-side trickle-down economics, I don't have a job.
This truth is self-evident.
This truth is self-evident.
This truth is self-evident.
And they watch until there's nothing left.
And I sit in silence and watch.
Shallow mixed with black, as a deterrent.
Everything in this room isffeness, as indecision, and tie, but still xi'un has appeared.
Everything in this room isffeness, as indecision, and tie, but still xi'un has appeared.
Nothing in this room isöffen sounds.
Nothing in this room isoffen sounds.

I don't understand why this star is coming in and out of everywhere a professor
the professor that knows who the��� wahtc and those that would know who themile
You know, I didn't get thatSwitch ran.
I just saw an idea, of a linesend tinkering with the administrat Miche.
I normally listen all the time of something that the inf bers a way be butterfly class
any little animal.
I wish I could say everything would be better,
but it never will be better.
Because when they
come for you, they actually
come for you.
Yes.
Yes.
Tell me
about it. No, wait. Don't tell me about it.
We're on the radio.
I do believe...
Obscenity is...
We can't start being obscene
until 11 o'clock, and we'll be
in beddy-bye by then.
Being obscene at home,
I hope.
Feeding your feet, putting little Cheetos between your
toes, and watching your favorite
filicum.
Yes.
I do concur
that that piece that you
read was quite astute.
I mean,
quite astute.
And I had even fantasized
about encapsulating my feelings
recently, and now I feel
as if my
rags have been thundered,
or my nose has been closed,
or whatever the phrase is.
My thunder's been stolen,
and therefore, I can't reign.
I can just watch it and enjoy it.
Well, if you can enjoy it,
that's great.
No, I can't really enjoy it.
See, that's the thing.
We don't know what to do about it.
What are you going to do, run for president?
Heh.
Heh.
Just think of the...
abject...
abject...
feelings of...
feelings of abject...
failure in all of us when we hear that.
We realize that there's nothing we can do
with a capital N.
Our leaders are stupid,
so I'm going to run for president.
Yeah.
Donald Trump,
2011.
He actually said that, Princess Lee.
Yes, I know.
If they still had Monty Pythons,
fa-tang, fa-tang, wing-wing-wing,
he didn't say this,
so I'm going to run for president part.
Princess Lee has a fa-tang, fa-tang, fa-tang part thing.
I do have that.
On the end of her tail.
But, but, but you've stolen my thunder,
Reverend Stan!
You've stolen my thunder again!
Give it back or Thor will demand it
from you at a later time
in a place where you won't like it,
like over the commode.
Please.
I don't want your thunder to be stolen.
Please don't let that story feel...
like your th-
th- your thunder's been stolen.
It's not.
And thanks to many, many of those
who could not be here tonight
because they, uh,
were somewhere else,
we can only relay the message
that we've come here to relay,
and, and it is
that your thunder is one of your most
precious bodily fluids.
Not only number one and two
are involved in this tacit pact
with the devil,
but three and four and other numbers,
these are super narrow,
narrow, narrow,
numerary numbers.
It's funny you should mention that.
Because later on in that,
in that agent's report,
the, I think in part four,
Bob, Mr. Dobbs is described as
suddenly saying,
I have to go do number three.
And he puts his head inside
some kind of a device and makes horrible,
horrible noises for a long time.
And whatever number three is,
it makes him feel a lot better
after he's done it.
Well, it's the evacuation of the angst,
nausea of this existence.
That's what Bob is releasing as much
as we would do mid-defic,
you know, things and bodily fluids.
Some people misunderstand what Church
of the Subgenius is all about.
They hear that word,
and of course, since they're pinks,
all they hear is the word genius.
They can't put together what we're really saying,
subgenius.
And one of them on the internet,
one of the, one of the silliest said,
and I think he meant this,
I hate people who think they're better than everybody else.
And one of the subgeniuses pointed out,
said, what you're saying is you're better than us.
And that kind of sums up the standard kook worldview
in just two sentences.
I hate people who think
they're better than everybody else.
And that's why I'm better than all of you.
Well, that's the, that's what,
I guess that's what it's all about.
Neatly done, number one.
When you hear that, I mean,
you realize that everyone is a victim to this ploy of the,
oh, whatever they are, whoever they might be
and wherever they might really,
really come from their origination is not our concern
at this moment, but we all know what it does
to us subconsciously.
How it takes, doesn't give,
how it pees where it frees,
it feels like,
it how it.
Yeah.
Yet the big it.
It.
The combine, the machine, the conspiracy, the man.
Something.
The man's man.
You know.
The you know takes this, you know and sticks it in the you
know,
and then.
I think we all know what happens then.
That's another one.
It doesn't take much to know beyond that, does it?
What's the next step, Commander?
The next step is to learn more of the word of Bob at every chance you get.
Because you never know when it's all going to be snatched away from you.
All of it. The whole internet. The whole system of communication.
All of it could go down instantly.
Innocently. Overnight. One special internet bomb could put everything out of whack.
And then where would you be?
Why, you'd be out on the street getting exercise.
You'd be off your butt.
You'd be forced to think for yourself instead of copying this extremist that you're reading on the internet
who'd tell you exactly what you most wanted to hear over and over and over again
until it becomes, why, true.
And what do you think we're doing now, my friend?
Telling you that you are better than everyone else just because you're a subgenius.
Of course, we're only talking to the subgeniuses when we say that.
Many listeners may not have joined the church.
Those who are listening at this moment.
And those who did join the church were not all subgeniuses.
But we're not saying we're better because we're smart.
Or more moral or more ethical or handsomer.
Certainly not.
No, we're just better.
That's all.
And why?
Because we've got Bob and they don't.
Or rather, Bob has us and Bob doesn't have them.
Doesn't want them.
Doesn't want their paltry cabbage and gravel.
He doesn't need pink money.
He wants green money.
Yeah.
He takes a look around.
He sees green.
He says, that's the color of money.
I can hear it in the back of my skull.
It's like somebody's been tapping me with a blue foreskin.
Some angel's been looming over my head, barking strange commands.
But I don't care.
I don't listen.
I pay attention.
Sure, yeah.
I know they're telling me to do the right thing.
Sometimes it's not always the right thing.
But yeah, yeah, I listen.
Close enough.
Certainly close enough to the right thing.
Close enough for subgenius work.
That's what she said.
Well, I was surprised they didn't poison everybody and the whole crew the way things were going.
The whole group was out of wine, so to speak.
They refused to call in.
They didn't visit the safe houses regularly.
And when it came to following around this Dobbs character, which you'll notice is on page 300 of the memorandum.
I already sent you the back page.
Yeah, that's the one.
There he is there with the pipe and the whole routine.
There's a couple of photographs.
Already been memorized and shredded.
It's all taken care of.
That's been pre-planned, you see.
The overture was the epilogue.
The prologue was prolonged so that we'd have it our way.
You understand what I'm saying?
Our way.
The way of Bob, my friends.
Yes.
And, uh...
Uh, yes.
Dear friends, if you want to know more about J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,
why, all you have to do...
This is only if you want to know more.
You can look at a website called subgenius.com.
Not to be confused with subgeniaus.com, which is a silly one.
Uh...
This is Doctors for Bob.
This is Doctors for Bob in the background, by the way.
What we were hearing earlier was instrumental music from the Twilight Zone.
It actually was music from the show, the Twilight Zone, not music composed in the literal Twilight Zone.
What we're listening to now in the background was composed in the literal Twilight Zone,
but was not used on the television show.
It's one of my favorite bands, also, I might add.
Me too.
One of the original band that wouldn't die.
You know, I have...
Songs?
Well, this is the...
The title is Can't Hide.
You can't hide from Bob.
You can't hide.
But I don't want to quote the lyrics because the person who wrote half some of the lyrics has been unpersoned.
The other half, I could do the part that Sterno wrote, but I don't know which ones are which.
That's Sterno on the bass.
And, uh...
Gordon X on guitar.
And Martin and Linda on keyboards.
So...
I don't think they let Snavely in the band, even though he started the band.
Oh, well.
But that's all for the Subgenius History course.
And we're running out of time here.
It's about five minutes for the hour.
And I wanted to play a birthday for...
It's Onan's birthday, Dave.
Onan Canabite's birthday.
It's also Philo's birthday.
But I've already played a little Philo.
Happy birthday to those fellows.
And it's...
It's Azo the Friendly God's birthday.
Yes, our rival...
The rival cult, the cult of the living bull, was born on this day.
May 1st.
But I don't know when, what year that bull was born.
I think it was born 5,000 years ago.
In the temples of Sumer.
The year zero.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, man.
That's right.
P.O. Box 181.
417.
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
44118.
That's where you will find the big O between the two blessed Bs.
Be not egregious.
Send now or reply soon, please.
But of course.
And now we shall, as I said, we're going to play the song by the great Reverend Uncle Dr. Onan Canabite.
This is his remix.
Actually, this is...

This is part two of the remix of his masterpiece known as B.O.B.
Thank you, Dave, and goodbye.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

Okay.


Okay.

Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.




Okay.
Okay.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
