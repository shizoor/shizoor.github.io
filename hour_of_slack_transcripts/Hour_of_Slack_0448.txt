Whoa, okay, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna get the equipment working this time.
It's gonna work fine.
Okay.
Easy.
I'm, uh...
Right!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hey!
What's happening?
Most people are gonna think they've got the plain old non-lethal flu right up to the very end.
And that's the biggest break we've had so far.
Who cares?
Bob.
What?
Bob, save some for me.
Don't worry.
Pathetic.
You don't feel so cocky now, do you, Bob?
Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it right now.
You know what the tragedy is here, Bob?
We could have been friends.
But you weren't.
We wouldn't go through public channels.
My dog barks some.
Mentally, you picture my dog.
But I have not told you the title.
Dog which I have.
Perhaps you might even picture Toto from The Wizard of Oz.
But I can tell you my dog is always with me.
I can tell you my dog is always with me.
I can tell you how simple life is for married men.
I tell you my boy is that much superior than you.
I'm sorry.





You mean you said got that guy below ten years of age who can't be heard from a woman.


So you guys find yourself a little while longer off to dinner and pint, buy a truck and a давай the police car.
Alright, happy party.

We'll see you again, Next Good Day.
Aw.
See ya.

towards that thing called life
certainly can change over the years, you know.
As a kid, little kid,
you have no philosophy, really,
except that you are God and deserve all slack.
You had the right idea back then.
But then as a teenager,
you start to get the idea,
a fairly practical idea,
that you aren't going to get all that slack,
and you start to turn hate positive.
Yet you still suffer from the sad delusion
that future generations might get the slack,
if only everybody else would wise up like you have.
And then in your twenties,
if you're anything like me,
well, you're on the job,
but there's a certain determined idealism on the job,
and,
and as you get better in the job,
it turns into almost very slightly triumphant idealism.
But then that quickly turns to, uh,
totally limited idealism
because of the very reality of the jobs,
which you increasingly learn
until you finally hit a dead end,
which is where a lot of people end up.
If you're lucky, through your thirties,
you'll, like,
like I did,
build to an orgy,
an orgy of utter cynicism.
But, you know, that's a dead end to,
I'm afraid,
I mean, I wish I didn't have to,
uh, tell you that.
But you get into your,
your forties,
and you get kind of resigned to,
well, you, you,
you end up with the philosophy that,
although it's pretty bad,
you can,
you can at least try to make the best of it.
Now, I'm in my early forties,
and I have to assume, because of that,
that there's a next stage
that I just don't know about,
and which I cannot be explained to me,
even by my older, uh,
slightly older friends,
like, uh, G. Gordon Gordon,
or, uh, Dr. Snavely Eklund.
Uh, I would hope
that it would be a more inspired,
uh, make the best of it sort of philosophy.
But how can I know that,
since it's not perceivable to me
at this present step?
And in that respect,
I must admit that I am indeed an ageist,
my friends.
Not that I think that age brings wisdom,
but it does bring a certain resignedness
that can lead either to clearer thinking,
more rational and scientific,
as it has with me,
or it can lead to stultified fossilization
of the brain pan and swift,
uh, degeneration into senility,
which I think is what usually happens
in most cases, uh, to most human beings.
But then in most cases,
the average human being never had much real awareness
to work from in the first place,
so it's a, a moot point.
Now, I'll, I'll be the first to admit
that I'm, uh, an elitist, yes,
uh, one who thinks that most people are dumber than me,
but the most hideous aspect
of that, my friends, is
I know I'm not very smart at all.
Think how dumb that makes them look.
And most of the time,
I can't even comprehend how dumb and lazy people can be,
and so they continue to surprise me because of that.
I can't imagine how dumb they could be,
and yet, oh, oh,
every day they come up with something new.
And again, it's, it's, uh,
not because I'm so smart.
Oh, no, no, horribly, most horribly of all,
it's because they're even more lazy and stupid than I.
And, my friend, that's saying a lot.
That's saying a hell of a lot.
A lot of bad stuff about my fellow bipeds.
What it says?
Oh, it's a shame, dear friends.
It's a, it's a crying, crying shame.
Don't you ever wonder why
Nothing ever seems to change
If it does, it's for the worse
Seems it's just a modern curse
Sometimes when I take a peek
Outside of my little cage
Everyone looks so asleep
Will they die before they wake?
And, hey, don't you know
We're just products of our time
And, hey, what do you say?
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
Better dumb and happy than
Smart and without any friends
Better cute and better loud
Better join up with the crowd
Keep a fork and let me hide
There's a dust storm in the air
In my mind
Seems I can't see straight these days
Doesn't matter anyway
And, hey, don't you know
We're just products of our time
And, hey, what do you say?
Show me yours, I'll show you mine
Hey, what do you say?
Hey, what do you say?
Please don't ever
Oh, God, here's that question now
The one that makes me go insane
I'd gladly tear my heart out
If you never, never, never, never change
Do you want to change?
Do you want to change?
Do you want to change right now?
Do you want to change?
Do you want to change right now?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Do you want to change?


Oh, yeah
Hey, dear friends
Oink-oh-boink-oh
Yodeling away there in the background
And, you know, some people don't ever want to change
Bob Dobbs gets a lot of mail which we intercept
and we very recently got a mailing about how the Conservative talk show host is in danger
So we should send them more money
Dear friends, let's see, here's this letter here.
It says, they're meeting into the night, late into the night, to silence us.
Don't let Congress silence Rush Limbaugh, Pat Buchanan, Gordon Liddy, and other conservatives.
The so-called fairness doctrine will silence Rush Limbaugh, Pat Buchanan, Gordon Liddy, Marlon Maddox, and other conservatives.
They repeat that line about four times in the same two-page letter.
Yes, friends, it seems that liberals in Congress are hardly hiding the purpose of their so-called fairness doctrine bill.
This bill would muzzle Rush Limbaugh, Gordon Liddy, Pat Buchanan, and conservative radio talk shows across the country.
Bill Clinton and the liberals in Congress can't compete with Rush Limbaugh, Gordon Liddy, Pat Buchanan on the radio.
They know it. That's why the so-called fairness doctrine covers only radio.
If the liberals were really concerned about fairness, their bill would also cover...
Oh, here, let's, uh, that's a lovely boingo song, but I want to put on something else here because we want to play a rest of that boingo song.
He was talking over that.
Anyway, to continue with this letter here, as Dr. Bob plays in the background,
uh, if the liberals were really concerned about fairness,
they would also cover TV and newspapers.
But liberals dominated TV, and most major newspapers are clearly controlled by liberals.
And, uh, it says here, uh, yeah, the liberals can't stand the heat, so their plan is to force conservative talk show hosts off the air.
Uh, if you can send $1,000 or $500, it would be greatly appreciated.
Our campaign is cost-free.
We're wasting a lot of money.
We need to reach at least 5 million grassroots voters over the next couple of months.
This is the only way to stop Clinton and his liberal buddies in Congress from muzzling our conservative radio show hosts,
Rush Limbaugh, Pat Buchanan, Gordon, Lady Markman, and the other members.
Whoa!
And there's a lot of these conservative money-making machines out there.
Uh, or far right.
Money-making machines, uh, rather.
They call far right conservative and middle-of-the-road liberal.
Uh, anyway, all these folks are begging and getting donations from paranoids in order to fight the threat,
the terrible threat to conservative talk show hosts from that, uh, demonic liberal-controlled media.
And I hear about this threat.
All day long.
Morning, noon, and night on far right talk shows and, and newspapers.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Rush Limbaugh, Gordon, Lydia, Gordon, Tony, etc., etc., plus all the local ones, you know, in your local town there, friends.
And you don't come to think of it, I haven't heard any liberal biased talk show hosts on any of the liberal biased conspiracy media.
Uh.
Uh.
Now, I understand, uh, that Jim Hightower has such a show, but like this show, uh, no station here in, uh, mighty Dallas, Texas is inclined to run such a thing.
You know, it might upset the fundamentalists and run the creationist science school board or something.
Hey, you might say, oh, come on, Reverend Stang, look at these bleeding-heart-drippy shows like, uh, Nightline and McNeil-Larer.
And I'd have, I'd have to say I'm sorry.



I'm afraid I've looked a mile closer than you have, my friend.
Uh, for all that PBSNPR crap is funded by the government, and the most frequent single guest on those shows is Henry Kissinger.
And 75% of their guests are government or government-associated spokesmen.
You know, there ain't nothing to the left of Al Gore that even exists on the national media.
Now, man, you know, how often?
How often do you hear about libertarians or greens on pink media?
Only on comedy shows.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Liberal biased media.
Hmph.
Yeah, well, yeah, sure, if you call Westinghouse stockholders, uh, liberals.
If you call, uh, Reaganites liberals.
If you call, uh, Whitewater Silverado.
If you call, uh, cheating on your wife.
Uh, conducting secret meetings.
If you call, uh, wars and massive drug smuggling operations.
I'll tell you, dear friends, in hell, commies aren't scary enough anymore.
Now there's an anti-family, pro-abortion, eco-nut, Jew, hippie, queer, negro, Arab, liberal under every bed.
Oh, thank God the far right doesn't even know the subgeniuses exist, or they'd have had us secretly killed by now.
Uh, for that matter, if the so-called liberals knew about the church, they'd have us killed, too.
As well they should, seeing as how we are the only true enemies of both.
I'm telling you, friend, we're in bad trouble and we'll continue to be robbed of slack as long as, as any, uh, politicians, uh, voters, or for that matter, any politics at all, remain on this benighted planet.
The humans are just too stupid. Just too easily self-corrupted.
The only government of any kind should be only the dictatorship of J.R. Bob Don Salone.
For only he cannot be any more corrupt than he already is.
I hope this works.
How do we...?
Go.
I never had the keys to put them to use.
The name of the patron saint, the father, the son, do not believe in it. I command you back.
Go!
Go!
The knights will assume you.
United to the devil.
Return, your master.
Leave us.
Gaze.
Gaze on the fiery cross and return to the darkness of your cold tombs.
Away.
Away with you.
Back.
Back to the darkness.
Back to the dimension of the damned.
I command you back.
In the name of the trinity, to hell, from once you came.
Leave me.
They would know how we solved our problems.
They would know how we solved them.
And whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years.
Or whether it hurt them.
They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons.
Nuclear weapons.
Terrible destructive power.
Aimed at each other.
Capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes.
And destroying civilization as we knew it.
In the name of the trinity.


If youÕve changed, you would want us to agree to it, until that alas this below and

Stick up there, and be more careful about what you say.






If you kill me you have to mush out half of my life here.

when we take on but you know dear friends there are far far worse things even than that i don't

uncomfortably much like uh yours truly trying to explain to the subgeniuses just
uh why this stark fist uh church newsletter is so

tell you what kind of talk show host is actually endangered it's the church of the sub genius

Explanations for whatever happened to the mighty Stark Fist on, uh, Side 2 of Eve's show.
Because we like you, new friends.
And we want you to hear it all, you know, every tiny bit of it.
I like my stupid life just the way it is.
And I wouldn't even change it for a thousand flying pigs.
And I like you just the way you are.
I like your face just the way it is.
And I wouldn't even trade it for a heart.
I'm bored of screaming kids.
And I like you just the way you are.
I like you.
I know you may not like me back.
I would.
I'd dazzle you with brilliance if I only had the neck.
Because I like you just the way you are.
I like you.
I like you.









Yes, we're back here, friends.
And with some more explanations, perhaps, that you so desperately need to know.
You know, some geniuses can come to know the Church in many different ways.
Some have only seen our video arise and think that the church books that that video shows are all fictitious props.
Some have only read the book of the subgenius and the other books but don't know about the radio shows.
Some can't read at all and are just utter skinflints and so just tune in to this show.
All of course are exhorted to join up and become ordained and subscribe to the Stark Fist church newsletter.
And every one of those is wondering just why they haven't seen a new one in two years.
Well it's two problems friends.
Time and money.
Time because it took a year.
Longer than we thought to finish our new huge 210 page bible.
Revelation X the Bob Apocryphon for Simon and Schuster out in October.
The greatest story ever told.
However just the runoff from that effort provides us with literally enough material to fill 20 Stark Fist magazines.
So where are those magazines?
Well friends and here's the problem.
We don't have a thin thin dime to print anything with.
There's only about 4,000 subgenii in the whole world who subscribe to that thing.
Only 4,000 who will ride the escape vessels of the sex goddesses come X day 1998.
And uh.
Yeah well let me put it this way.
Friends that last Stark Fist was a 130 page deluxe book size monster that put us $7,000 in debt.
The plan was you know people would see all the new sacred goods.
The Bob t-shirts and boxer shorts and sacred coffee mugs and the videos and hour of slack tapes.
And actually order some of that.
And that would.
Pay for the next Stark Fist.
Well I'm afraid we were just a tad optimistic on that score friend.
And plus the fact that we've never had the capital to advertise.
It's a humiliating situation for what's supposed to be a juggernaut of raw capitalism.
Unleashed by the very gods.
And the very god of sales himself.
But I guess Bob's busy with other things.
With his mysterious ways friends.
And we're stuck with trying to fill his shoes.
And we fall short my friend.
We fall short because we're not Bob.
We're great subgeniuses yes.
But the church has no smarty pants business mind.
We're not Bob.


We're in a business case.
We have to surrender.
This Poet ess theme's not amused by any chance either.
It will.
But over time we'll figure out.
emmm...
Yeah.
I'm pushing you out, Bob.
And besides, we're not talking about human beings here.
It's never been proven their intelligence is in any way...
Oh, come on, Bob.
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.
Joseph, Joseph, your amazing Technicolor cards are in the barn.

Shoot you in the head and make you dead.
Shoot you in the head and don' make you dead.

That is correct, my fellow gnomos.
I will not be happy.
You be very sad.
That is correct, my fellow gnomos.

For more subgenius
Must look in new book
And read from
Subgenius Affirmation
Yes
Dear friends
We can fill
What?
The lab
Yeah
Yes
We'll just relax and lean back and recite to ourselves the subgenius affirmation by
J.N.R. Hypercleves as it appears in the forthcoming subgenius Bible, Revelation X.
In the course of exploiting my abnormality potential, I will let no one stifle my inner
spoiled child. If my deep sensitivity must be expressed in a way that causes injury to others
with, for instance, chainsaws and blowtorches, the delicate genius of my artistic soul must be
protected at all costs.
So that I might achieve my greatest masterpieces, even if the price be the maiming of a few inconsequentials,
I demand others to aid the healing process of my delicate psyche and help build my self-esteem
and nurture my free expression.
A 40-hour work week would be too stressful for one.
So I will let no one stifle my inner spoiled child.
If my deep sensitivity must be expressed in a way that causes injury to others with, for instance,
chainsaws and blowtorches, the delicate genius of my artistic soul must be protected at all costs.


If my productivity lies in producing apathy, lethargy, and billowing clouds of marijuana smoke,
then I must follow my slack.
If everything I want is not handed to me on a silver platter, I'm in danger of hurting myself.
If I'm not able to do anything, I'm in danger of being a victim of my own self or others.
If to exploit, injure, or rob others would help me grow, under no circumstances should they deny me my needs,
as this too could damage my yeti self.
When crude, insensitive people try to inhibit my free expression, it only fills me with a greater sense of self-loathing,
justifying any further actions I might take.
Countless long nights while I stare at the wall, I ask myself over again,
How did I end up in this little hell? How did it ever begin?
How did I ever begin?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, helpless, helpless to turn back the clock that ticks on with its cruel shining face.
It laughs while it watches my every disgrace.
I was born a sap all the nurses laughed when they saw me the first time.
They giggled and said, this poor little monster be better off dead.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, helpless, helplessly trapped in a body,
I'm sure should have never been mine, I'll let that my real one's doing just fine.
And I don't belong here, I don't belong here, I should be quite rich,
with a big shiny car.
A house and twelve rooms, I deserve to go far.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, helpless, helplessly falling in love,
but does love really last through the night?
To love and to honor, to kick and to bite, and I don't belong here, I don't belong here.
And it's all a mistake.
I was destined for greatness.
A leader.
A prophet.
But I'm just too blind to notice.
Where did this whole silly story begin?
It seems that my mind is gone.
Blank.
I think that I've messed up a chapter or two.
Perhaps it is best if I break.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, helpless. Helplessly lost like that poor chap who came for an innocent dance. He left with his brain smeared all over his pants.
Because he didn't belong here. He didn't belong here. He never should have left that warm cage in a zoo. His face was so ugly. What else could I do? Can you really blame me? I had to smash it. He left me no choice. He was just like the others. I just had to kill him like my poor dear old mother.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, helpless. Helplessly lost by a legion of 40 ex-cons. That's what it feels like when you walk all over me. Don't belong here, I don't belong here. Your eyes burn right through me. They fill me with fear. I could have been home watching football and drinking beer.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, helpless. Helplessly lost like that poor chap who came for an innocent dance. He left with his brain smeared all over his pants. He never should have left that warm cage in a zoo. He never should have left that warm cage in a zoo. He never should have left that warm cage in a zoo.
Helpless. So helpless.
Helpless fans being miserly wretches unwilling to part with even a thin, thin, thin dime for their own short-duration personal saver J.R. Bob Dobbs. And mail order fraud laws being what they are. Why, why I, as a sacred scribe of the subgenius foundation, have found myself actually having to start looking for a job.
Why, why I, as a sacred scribe of the subgenius foundation, have found myself actually having to start looking for a job.
Yep, looking for a job, friends, just in order to print this damn newsletter devoted to the hate of jobs and the love of Dobbs.
Who dealt this mess, man? Who dealt it?
But do you see why a laid-back subgenius minister is able to hate?
To hate the conspiracy with such a pure and refined hate?
To hate the conspiracy with such a pure and refined hate?
A veritable Jane-Orient hate. A hate squared.
But that's how serious it is.
I know it would be laughable were it not so sad.
The very idea of Reverend Ivan Stang, almost the next guy under Dobbs himself in this church, actually working.
But it's not as ridiculous as you might think.
It's happening to other subgenius ministers even as I speak.
It happened to no less a bucksotic.
It's a far more ridiculous thing to do than to be a beacon of slack than the Reverend Susie the Floozy,
former skin-shedding stripper for Bob and uber-dominatrix of the Slack Matrix.
And, like me, she used her subgenius soapbox on the public airwaves of the mighty WREK in Atlanta, Georgia,
to complain, bitch and gripe bitterly about the hideous unfairness of any subgenius ever having to do anything.
It doesn't work.

It doesn't work.
Ooh, boy, that was from the Leonard Nimoy album.
Is it, uh, the one where he is Spock on the cover before he got into intense Spock denial?
Let's see if I can get something going here.
I'm real miscued.
Oh, I've had a busy, busy weekend and no sleep and God, work.
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.

when you're spying on the spymasters.
They told me I'd have to take a drug test for this job,
so I stayed up the night before and phoned up really hard.
I felt confident I could identify anything they'd give me.
I could handle anything they'd slip me.
I'd even ace those essay questions.
Oh, but when the first day of the end of my slack life
came screeching up, they didn't even give me the test.
On my first day infiltrating the rabbit worns of corporate existence,
they showed me around my part of the habit trail.
The highlight of the orientation tour was the break room
where the supervisors did this Carol Merrill number
showing me this bank of four coffee makers.
Oh, it was just an arsenal of caffeine.
She grinned as she said,
Oh, you can have as much coffee?
We always have coffee here.
Lots and lots and lots of coffee.
Oh, I guess their definition of drugs is a little different from mine
because everyone in the place is wired.
Oh, yeah, I try to get the shake so bad
I have a challenge hitting the right keys
on the user-hostile computer I diddle all day.
But it's okay, it's their drug,
so I'll do it if it'll alter my consciousness enough
to dissociate myself from what I'm doing there.

Well, that, that was the iguanas
from the Godsmell comp doing Coffee O.D.
and before I send this one on to staying in Dallas
I'm gonna have to do a lot of post-op work, but
Oooh, I'm sure all of you people who have to suffer
in the workplace understand what's happening
It's killing my brain cells
Ahh
Ohah.
Ahh. früher victory everlasting

Oh, I'm having a battle of conscience here about this job.
My friend, sweet little Janie, wants to get a job in this hell pit I'm in.
Should I stop her?
I feel like the girl in that stupid PSA where a friend is playing stone chicken with a freight train.
But it's her decision.
Oh, right.
Well, screw that predestination crap.
We can make our own luck by the grace of Bob.
At least my job is totally meaningless.
I'm involved in the manufacture of endless reams of paper.
This company doesn't make anything but mounds of paper and sends the paper somewhere else.
It's like peristaltic contractions of information.
Oh.
At least they recycle a lot of the paper.
The pointlessness of it all has some allure for me.
It's a bizarre concept.
It's a coincidence.
This self-same place chewed up and spat out the soul of our very own beloved Reverend Mike Rophone.
My tag team running mate.
The tipper to my Hillary, so to speak.
Oh, I'm not so whacked out as to think it won't suck and suck fast.
Because he's let me in on what this particular clutch of pink boys is capable of.
Oh, it's a festering stew pot of swamp contagion.
Besides working me to the bone.
I already feel that scratchy aura in the bit of my throat.
That queasy seismic flux in my body that means my immune system has been reamed.
Huh.
For a living, they call it?
Ha!
Oh, I'd like to say I'm sweating like a whore in church.
But oh, what a whore I am now.
I'm a real prostitute.
A genuine, low-born, common gutter slut whore dog now.
But what the hell?
If I've been playing my cards.
Right so far, you don't respect me.
So what's to lose by limboing under the limits of seeming intelligence and getting a job?
So heads up, corporate America.
The Reverend Susie the floozy is infiltrating your very bowels.
I'll teach him the true meaning of slacking off.
Ha!
Besides, anything that makes me a little schizophrenic can't be all bad.
I always wanted to be a top secret agent.
Codename Mozart.
Mozart.
You know, make it through Checkpoint Charlie by the skin of my teeth.
I like this life just the way it is.
And the castle is all around me.
I've been melting down for years.
And it kills my brain to think of all the time I wasted here.
All the efforts.
Sweat and broken hearts.
The screaming and the tears.
The dream.
The dream.
Dream.
Dream.
Dream.
Dream.

Dream.
Yes, dear friends, you're dreaming if you think you can escape the hell.
The hell of work for any subgenius.
Of course, on the other hand, you know, if you've got it, you can't really follow Bob's directives and repent.
Repent? Quit your job at Slack Off unless you have a job to quit from.
The great Nenslow recently performed that very ritual, and I'd like to read from his update,
New Report Newsletter Number 3, about that.
As Nenslow said,
We can't even afford to, since we quit,
our job at Slack Off.
Our evil conspiracy torture job two months ago,
and the thousand bucks we thought would provide some slack
got slurped up by, of all things, a goblang student loan
we thought had mysteriously vanished five years ago.
And why, you may ask?
Well, I'll tell you why.
Because good citizen Nenslow decided he'd spite
the juvenile moron anarchists, or drunks on welfare,
next door, and do his dash-blinking civic duty and register to vote.
Well, ha, ha, ha.
Boy, does that, quote,
unmask the alienation behind society's lies, unquote.
We guess we should have smashed the state when we had a chance, huh?
Except we've never been able to conquer the urge to go.
The fall when we run into someone so naive
they have to demonstrate that their behavior is justifiable
by using some sort of political ideology.
Politics is the stupidest thing there is.
It was invented by boring nitwits
to make each other think they have some sort of control
over their lives and circumstances.
An utterly idiotic idea
that only a total boob could ever swallow.
And anarchism is absolutely the dopiest, trippiest, lamest
type of politics in defense of which state
we need only remind you that it was invented by the French.
No anarchist will ever get the grudging respect of Nenslow
without first acknowledging us king.
So just shut up.
Shut up.
All of you.
And send that last damn dollar
or this is the last show you'll ever see.
Most of this is coming out of our own pocket anyway
and if it had come down to a choice between doing this show
and reading this Nenslow rant
and nabbing those two dozen Charlton romance comics
and a couple of issues of Space War and Mars Patrol
you can bet there would have been not the slightest hesitation on our part
but leave you us.
We've got our priorities.
And your priority dear friend is
to just write for free information.
Oh yes, because that's what you need is
information.
And it has to be free, don't it?
Well you can get you some.
Get you some off of Bob.
Why not?
You got that?
You got that?
You got that pencil ready?
I'm going to give that address.
Just drop us a self-addressed stamped envelope
and send that to Bob
at Post Office Box 140306.
That's Box 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas.
That's it.
It's
seven
two
one
four
go ahead.
Three voices from the dead
come from underneath my bed
and I
don't even care
I like my stupid life
just the way it is
I like my stupid life just the way it is
and the chaos that surrounds me
like a flock of screaming pigs
and it hurts my brain to think of all
the stupid things I've said
and if I could change the future
I would change the past instead
and I'm dreaming again
and I'm dreaming again
so that I have a friend
and more
plus
there is an undercurrent
I don't care
there is an impixel
I just need to stop
this
for i wanna w genuine
my spirit
Thank you.
