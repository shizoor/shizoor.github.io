00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:15,940
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:27,280
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,020
and only in the city of...

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,080


5
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh yes, dear friends, this is an internet-only special hour of Slack not to be mailed to the broadcast stations

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,720
because it's solid instrumental jams from 18X Day.

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,120
But non-stop six-fisted...

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,040
Tales of Connie, which is what this ever-changing once-a-year band is called,

9
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,220
that isn't what the station's signed up for.

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:15,140
Plus, Subgenius jam music can be an acquired taste that melts the tongues and ears of the unworthy

11
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,420
or those with so-called good taste.

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,680
But I figure the musicians themselves, the other X-Day attendees, and masochists will want a chance to hear it.

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,880
Reverend Suds Pasha and I both recorded all the music, and sometimes his board recordings sounded better,

14
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,720
other times my ambient mic caught it better.

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,100
Sometimes both versions sounded awful.

16
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:47,720
I've been whittling away at this stash for weeks on and off, and I've got it edited down to the point where I like all of it.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,260
None of this music was rehearsed. It's all improvisational jams, some rocking and some jazzing, but all spastic.

18
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,260


19
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,260


20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:05,440
But it's not organized in any special order, and I have no idea which specific musicians are on any given cut.

21
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,700
Besides, they kept switching instruments.

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,420
However, there is a sort of generic credits-giving at the end by Priestess Pisces.

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,220
There were jams pretty much every night for five nights at X-Day, so there was a lot to choose from.

24
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,260
The one musician who is probably on damn near every track is Reverend Angry Luke.

25
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,260


26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:35,160
Oh, pardon me, Lord Angry Larry, who is playing generally the most prominent guitar most of the time.

27
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:44,120
Other musicians who were involved most nights include Bishop Stick, Reverend Rock God, Reverend Hazel of the Windmills,

28
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:55,160
Reverend Fid Chooley, Trademark Gunderson from Evolution Control Committee, Lord Ferg, Reverend Suds Pasha, Dr. Philo Drummond,

29
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:05,680
Reverend Symphaltimus Ex Mortis, Reverend Shover, Reverend 80, Reverend Dildonics, Reverend Oriccio, and DJ Gravity.

30
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:13,700
So, we'll start with an untitled tune I titled, Pipe Rockin' Jam Number One.

31
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,640
On my Band Swing 6 it didn't femt

32
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,360
Thank you.

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,820

Friends, you've been

01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:43,420
learning,

278
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:50,480
listening to an hour of six-fisted Tales of Connie, the X-Day jam band. And it's

279
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:55,280
not a typical hour of slack, but if you want to know more about X-Day or the

280
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:04,560
hour of slack or where to get CDs of this stuff, try subgenius.com. Praise Bob.
