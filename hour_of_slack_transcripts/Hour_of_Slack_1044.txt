Let's begin with the Great Divine Director's call.
We'll give the preamble,
and then we'll make invocations before the altar, before the decree.
Great Divine Director's call together.
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.
In the name of the Father, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.
Oh, my God.
This is for weak people in the audience.
Oh, my God.
It's not even my hand.
It's weak.
This is for you.
This is for you.
This is for you.
This is for you.
This is for you.
This is for you.
This is for you.
This is for you.
This is for you.
This is for you.
This is for you.
This is for you.
Yo, I said I'm calling you, heh.
So where's my frump, Stang?
Let's go with it.
Stang, where's my frump, man?
You're on that award again, don't you?
The Hey Stang Award.
Hey Stang.
Hey Stang.
See my butt plug, Stang?
See my butt plug, Stang?
See my butt plug, Stang?
So Bob took some of us along to that giant sex toy store in Oklahoma
intent on buying some naughty birthday apparel for Connie,
but in usual Dobbsian fashion,
he started giggling like a demented 12-year-old,
dry-humping the rubber butts,
putting butt plugs on his head like devil horns,
and laughing like some mental case,
running around the place with crotchless panties over his suit,
spitting pasties at everyone,
and he finally drank half a bottle of Hotsey McGonigal's lavender love lube
and shot the rest on the floor behind him like James Bond's old Aston Martin,
making the staff who were chasing him slide all over the place.
But as we made our way,
he gave us all zebra pattern vibrators,
so it turned out okay,
or at least as okay as it gets when Bob is at the wheel.
My God.
Experienced or not,
you won't want to miss Gay Rap on Wednesday, March 23rd at 9 p.m.
when we'll discuss connecting sex,
love, friendship, and how to get some.
It's just a matter of inserting yourself into the situation.
Men cruise men,
and an active element of cruising is eye contact.
So, if you haven't been getting what you want,
then maybe you haven't been going to the right place.
After all, you can't get cherry pie at the hardware store.
So, clue in to some down-to-earth strategies
for finding out what you want and getting it.
On Gay Rap, this Wednesday at 9 p.m. on...
The Self Genius Hour of...
I don't mean to insult you, but you know, as a medical doctor,
I am trained to think skeptically.
While you're teaching your colon to work right on its own,
while you're not using it,
clean out your colon.
Science-minded researchers all over the world, like myself,
are just beginning to uncover the treasure trove
your colon has to offer,
training your colon to work properly on its own.
You see, your colon has muscles
that need to be stimulated to stay healthy.
Stimulate those muscles.
They start working right on their own,
the way a snake moves.
Now, my program teaches your colon
that stuff gets scrunched up and compressed in there,
sort of like an accordion.
Some people are carrying around an accordion in their colon.
Do you have dry mouth?
I sure do!
It protects your teeth, bites infection,
and lubricates your food.
But what happens when you run out of saliva?
Help me, I can't talk!
For personal dryness upstairs,
it's Salavex.
Wow, I can spit again!
Salavex is more than saliva in a can.
Salavex improves consumption efficiency by 50%.
No more halfway cures,
like coating your throat with cooking oil
to have that extra piece of cake,
or bowl of kitty litter.
After a night out, my tongue tasted like carpet.
It was embarrassing.
Now with Salavex, I can eat a whole box of crackers
or lick my life partners.
I'm a salvex.








I'm a salvex.






All night.
It's like having a salivation army in my mouth.
Now I can suck a
lollipop
for as long as I want.
Salavex tastes like your own saliva.
That's because at Salavex's state-of-the-art production facilities,
we use salivation philanthropists
who make Salavex all day.
Salavex.
When it comes to personal dryness upstairs,
we're deadly serious.
Salvex.
We Christ.
We're deadly serious.
No water.
That's why we should stop using tobacco.
People get sick from health problems,

More health, 절대.

Time pictures.





If you wanted to know how to stop running,
their parents know the details.





So, I had a problem with the truth,
at a number of times.
So, again,
everyone's cringing and giggling.


The thing is that
Turn out the lights.
Shut the doors.
But we don't love them, boys.
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.
Aye.
Aye.
What was it?
Where are we?
Uh.
Eh.
Eh, friends.
That was G. Gordon Gordon there at the very end of that thing from X-Day.
Remixed by Asko, a.k.a. So-So Dada.
So-So Dada put together that whole first ten minutes of the show.
That's really horrible.
And it's a great help, though, because yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,
I'm working on this book, this new book.
I like putting in very long.
So this show, Hour of Slack number 1044, is not a rerun, but it is truly thrown up.
Thrown together.
Before Bob's throne.
And we will borrow, therefore, some radio synesthesia from WCSB in Cleveland, for instance.
And we'll barrage you with...
That there now is no yoritarian orality.
And
Norrellian
preferences
And there will be some live revival recordings from
Winterstar of 2006.
But first, the worldwide message,
tribe.
Praise Bob!
Looked up in the house, trippin' in the house with God
Long gone, what if we're three in the same?
You promised when we're meeting your name
You will be with us, you will be here as well
To sing your praise, perhaps compelled
Righteousness, the truth of your soul
Love and faithfulness, yours to own
Those who praise your name gain blessings
We're walking in the light of your presence
Stick up your hands, stick them up, get them up in the air
Raise them up, up in prayer
Stick up your hands, stick them up, get them up in the air
Raise them up, up in prayer
You getting busy?
You getting busy?
Who's in the house?
God's in the house
I heard you talking about Devo
Yeah, Mark Mothers ład
Yeah, Mark Mothers ład actually
I was thinking of Devo
I was thinking of Devo
earlier because it turns out Disney has
bastardized them. Oh yeah,
Deve 2.0. What
on earth is that? Do you know anything about that?
Well, it's, you know,
the Devo Corporation is a
subsidiary of Dobbs Co. and
they'll do anything for a buck.
So when Disney came to them and said
how about
this? Devo, only
it's kids. It's like
little kids doing all your great hits.
It'll be a whole new audience. And I'll
take 15% just for
discoverer's feet.
How on earth did Disney come up with that idea?
The important thing
is the message of Devo
resonates with some of
these kids because what
Devo's basically saying is that
everything's full of crap, folks.
It's time to De-evolve.
But
it's kind of like Church of the Subgenius.
You're getting screwed every day
but you can learn to enjoy it because some
ways are fun. And now
...

Finish college. Get all the education
possible. This isn't such a smart
idea as it may seem. Drop out
from college. Don't go back.
It's a plain and simple fact. Earn
more now. Learn more later.

She sent her son to Orleans County for Christmas break and she never got him back.
News 8's Ty Chandler reports on one mother's fight to reunite with her child.
This is my son Cole, and this is my-
close as Rachel bevel aquia can get to the two men in her life these days I
can't call him on the phone no I can't write him a letter no I can't send him a
present no I can't have any personal contact with him at all except during
these supervised visits and it's just it's just so hard to to have that wall
between us means my baby her baby is actually 10 and he lived with her and
her husband in Columbus Georgia her son's father stays in Orleans County and
last December Rachel put her son on a plane to see him something she's done
many times before but this time she wouldn't get him back this is the
longest we've ever been apart Rachel says her ex filed for full custody she
thought that would be an easy fight since she cared for her son Cole his
entire life but Rachel walked out of court stripped of just about all her
parental rights when Orleans County Judge James punch learned of her
involvement in the
statute of limitations


performance group called the Church of the subgenius that pokes fun at
religious and political groups court transcripts support her claims I read
through the transcript a million times and he just says it's obvious that I
shouldn't have my son obvious ACLU director Barbara de leo didn't want to
comment on this case directly but she says there is no getting around the
freedom of speech it's a very challenging issue to think that that
because somebody engaged us in constitutionally protected activity that
there are personal ramifications for it Rachel thinks judge punch used her to
make a political statement I'm a good mother and you can't play games with
people's lives like this now Rachel says she's been allowed to see her son three
times this year all brief supervised visits we tried to reach judge punch
previous times and he refused to comment on this case and we learned today he is
out of town so what's next for the mom Rachel well her life in Georgia is on
hold she says she's not leaving New York
without her son
she'll be back in court next month and in front of a new judge since judge punch
recuse himself last week
she's
child
she is
child

yeah

she's gonna say

Mary had a baby which apparently was against the rules
since she was smarter than the rabbit men they threw at her.
And Miss Magdalene had her baby taken away from her
by a man too crazy to see past his own lies.
To my surprise, she just smiled
said it was just a conspiracy
and she was much bigger than they could ever be.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
She's gonna take back her baby
She's gonna take back her child
She's gonna take back her child
She's gonna take back the child
Crow Winters did that song, and that's about all I know about it.
Isn't that strange?
I don't know whether that was which.
Well, anyway, friends, we thank you.
And now back to Radio Synesthesia.
If you want, you can drop me a line.
I now have an email address open for all of you out there.
You can write to me at sinister at WCSB.org.
So don't spam me, though.
If you do, I will find who you are.
I'll find out where you live.
I'll find out where your family lives.
I'm not saying anything.
I'm not saying anything's going to happen.
Anyways, before I get myself into trouble, here's somebody who has taken the bait.
Hello, you're on the air.
Hi, Dr. Sinister.
Oh, hello, Reverend Stang.
Yeah.
I wanted to warn you that I think that the cowboy will be calling about 11 o'clock.
Uh-oh.
This could get interesting.
I guess so.
God, that would be great.
You know, it depends on what you mean by interesting, but I don't know.
I always find...
I always find it interesting.
You know, we like to keep it surreal up here.
I was just copying over the show in which Reverend Magdalene called in and described her custody problems.
Any news on that?
No, nothing really new.
I believe that the judge did let her visit with the child, despite her affiliations with Church of the Subgenius.
Do we know when her next court date will be?
No.
Have we?
No, it's funny, though.
I've done sort of other radio talk shows four nights last week in a row, four different radio outlets and podcasts talking about it.
A lot of people are really interested in that.
You know, I can't blame them.
It's serious stuff.
I mean, you know, this is when the big ugly side of civilization can intrude upon the worlds of those of us who like to think we are kind of...
You know, we've been in the world for a long time.




We've managed to dodge the uglier sides of the system.
Right.
We haven't been caught up in the wheels of the giant machine yet.
Right.
But then, you know, just like that, it can happen to anybody.
Yeah.
So, you know, let this be a lesson to everybody.
You know, don't get too comfortable.
Have your experience ready.
Yeah, don't get comfortable.
I mean, you know, anything could happen to you at any time.
We've got another caller here on the line.
6873515.
Hello.
You are with us on the air.
Oh, boy.
Just ignore me and just go right to another caller.
Oh, yeah.
Well, there's nobody here.
Oh.
How humble.
Yeah, really.
I mean, like, what's the point of calling if you're not gonna...
Just to tie up a line so that Bernie doesn't use it.
Oh, that's okay.
Hey, you know what?
It's been a while since I heard from Bernie.
Yeah.
If...
You know, there are certain...
I mean, he can get away with a lot on this program that he couldn't get away with anywhere else.
Yeah, you give him a lot of leeway.
I do.
There are just certain places where I'm just not gonna let him go anymore, though, because
he's already said everything he had to say about them.
And he just repeats himself.
Yeah, I'm really surprised that you haven't heard from him.

I mean, this has been the...
Shall we say the more eccentric people have really been active this week.
I think that the government rays have increased in power or something, because the...
Yeah.
You might say it's been a kook holiday lately.
Anyway, you found...
If you look at all.slack, it takes about two seconds before you go, good lord, there's
more...
Way more inmates than doctors now.
Yeah.
Hey, can I ask you guys to hold on for a second?
Sure.
Hold on for just a little bit, and I'll be right back.
Thank you.

bunch of lemur, friends.
All those sounds
from a doctor
or mister. He's not a doctor or a reverend. He's just mister.
Fernand and Andy Lemur. All of those sounds
are in our new book, The Bobliagraphon.
To give you more
enjoyment
pay more
yes
see how much more
millions of dollars more
millions of dollars more
and that's
not all
yes, pay more.
I think I'll take the pill.
Anyway, what was I supposed to talk about?
Sex.
Okay.
I don't remember what I put in that program book,
but it doesn't matter because you've already read it in the program book.
Something about the tantric temper tantrums and so forth.
Well, okay, you heard the concept. We don't need to elaborate on it.
Take the ball and run.
Actually, I did have some things to say.
The Church of the Subgenius is all...
It's a sexy cult.
The Raelians don't have anything on us.
But my real topic was, as far as sex goes,
what I wanted to talk about was bragging.
Is it more important than the sex?
I sometimes think it may be.
You want more sex?
Because I certainly, you know, you...
Well, you know, just because Bob said it,
just because it happened to you doesn't make it interesting.
Now, whereas some can hurt other people's feelings by bragging about who they have done,
others can only hurt people's feelings by bragging about who they've declined to do.
And so I'm not going to go into any of that.
I've heard anybody's feelings.
But I've actually had people who seem surprised going,
Sex in the church?
The Church of the Subgenius?
I thought y'all were a bunch of nerd boys.
And...
No, that was the 1980s Church of the Subgenius.
We build it and they will come, you might say.
And we started talking about what a sex cult this was,
and how if you came to our yearly celebration at Brushwood called X-Day,
no matter how ugly or stupid or lonesome you were,
you'd find somebody even uglier and stupider.
And you can find your true Yeti mate.
And in the realm of sex, we...
Somebody said, we stand on the shoulders of giants.
But that's not really the way it is.
It's more like we're on piggyback on giants.
We're humping furiously against the backs of the neck of giants, my friends.
We were in San Francisco recently, and there's a pretty strong subgenius thing going there.
There's a radio show that's been on for 20 years.
But the PC subgeniuses in San Francisco were amazed to hear that out in this part of the country,
and in Texas, we were having subgenius get-togethers where there were matings!
And little Getty children were being bred.
Breeding true, friends!
At the right times, according to the Bob and Connie almanac.
You know, you have to do these things exactly on a timetable.
And...
And some...
Like I say, they're in San Francisco, so they're kind of PC, and it is all...
The girls got completely bored with them.
But they were kind of upset because we've been...
We preached that you should recruit people from other religions by using sex.
That was...
The Children of God used to do that. Remember them?
I think they've changed their name and moved from country to country.
We haven't done that yet, because we haven't gotten to that point.
But we're getting close.
And we'll tell you more about that later.
You see, friends, one of the many, many scientific beliefs in the Church of the Subgenius is that
the true subgeniuses are descended from the Yeti of the Himalaya, the Sasquatch, the Bigfoot,
and so forth.
And we've fallen very far from our pure-blood Yeti ancestors, as we call them.
Watered down from the one true family of the Yeti, because they were...
There weren't that many of them.
They were a group of subgeniuses.


They were all related.
That's why we say, ancestors.
Their names were Smith, by the way.
That's why there's so many Smiths around.
So we tell our minions...
That's it, minions.
I like that word.
The believers and the disbelievers and mockers that fill our pews.
The pew packers.
We basically go, look, okay, as far as sex goes, go ahead and use the humans.
Use them.
But don't miscegenate!
Don't get one pregnant.
And don't get impregnated by one, boys.
You don't want to produce a half-subgenius, half-human thing.
The half-breed is such a lonely creature.
I feel so sorry for the one-penis.
My heart goes out to you.
Especially the female.
But Bob taught that...
You know, some of our rival cults and our beloved fellow new-wage religions talk about...
They talk about...
They talk about a laid-back, own-chanting universe.
According to Bob, it's a squirting universe, friends.
An oozing and squirting universe that's always trying to procreate.
Even if it's just trying to procreate trouble.
It must squirt!
And Bob is the squirt essence, you might say.
A balance of unbalanced forces.
It's the exact science of random chaos.
That's very popular these days.
You don't have to know much math to do that.
And other cults talk about...
Oh, what was it? Wilhelm Reich and his orgone accumulators.
Where, you know, you could sit in a box and it would sharpen you up or something like that.
Well, that's based...
That's a silly superstition based on orgosmonic radiation.
Which is created whenever mutants such as ourselves have sex.
Not for procreation, but just for fun!
In fact, it kind of...
It can mess up the orgosmonic radiation if somebody's getting pregnant.
So natural and unnatural do not even enter into the question of subgenius sex.
We do not care if it's boy, girl, human...
Well, subgenius...
As long as you're not making little babies, we don't care what species it is, friends.
Yeah, the only thing that enters into it is fun.
And regardless of what's being entered into.
Bob, I'm not going to do any demonstrations so you can relax.
Bob prophesied the third sex.
That there would be a third sex.
In all of our ads, if you look through the little pamphlet, it says,
Have intercourse with a beautiful live girl or damn near anything else!
Bob didn't say it had to be an earth woman.
If you can show me somewhere in Book of the Subgenius where Bob said it had to be anything from this planet.
That's why we await the Alien Kama Sutra.
On X Day, July 5th, 1998, which is yet to come, by the way.
We don't really know what year this is.
We don't even know what planet this is.
I know which one it's not.
But...
Maybe we shouldn't get into that.
Yeah.
Yeah, on July 5th, 1998, Bob prophesied the aliens will come and rupture up the dues-paying believing subgeniuses
and smite all the normals and disbelievers, which at this point is most of the earth.
So we've got all the elements that you expect in a major world religion.
Punishment of disbelievers, that's number one.
It's not that...
Look, we don't love Bob so much.
The whole thing is we love the idea of him.
We love the idea of everybody else burning in hell.
It's just like any religion.
But it's not all sex, friends.
Sometimes it's love.
And as the great subgenius Nenslow said,
in every relationship, there's one mean person and one nice person.
If you want them to be the nice person, you have to be the mean person.
That may explain the behavior of some of your friends.
Anyway, it's not enough of the sex.
That's boring.
Nobody cares about that.
Oh, that's tedious.

And now and then
time continues.
Troll.
I think probably what they'll do is just lay down
a kind of a gas that'll put everybody to sleep
in a state of suspended
inanimation for a long enough period
of time to do what they want to do
and then they'll figure out what to
do or not with us.
As if they hadn't already done that
since World War II, Dave.
Do you realize that time could stop?
I know. I've been breathing the same air.
For the equivalent of, you know,
for the equivalent of thousands of years.
I mean, of course, that would have no meaning.
Whatsoever.
We're just saying that there's a time
Nobody would ever know the difference.
that might be more explosive
if we don't keep our, you know,
feet down there where they're supposed to be.
How many times have the aliens stopped time on us?
Right. If they stop it just for
what we would call a fraction of a second at a time,
we hardly notice.
No, I mean, if they stop time
for like, you know, a million years
at a time, or what would be the
what would feel like a million years at a time to us?
We'd never know the difference because everything would stop
and it would just come right back on just like that.
That's happened every time.
Every time I took the other half.
That's what will happen.
Anyway.
I got a question for Reverend Stang.
Is the Bob Newhart show part of the conspiracy
or part of the subgenie
because they use the word Bob so much?
Well, you know,
Bob is the most common name
in the English language.
And every single time you hear it,
it doesn't necessarily mean something cosmic.
I mean, we even have a Bob here.
In the case of the Bob Newhart show,
every time you heard
the word Bob on that show,
you're supposed to take a big slug
of your beer.
Can I tell you something
that just happened to me?
I had to do an interview with a person
in a normal job environment
and she kept referring to me as Bob.
And I was getting paranoid thinking that maybe
she'd been cruising the internet
and confusing me with this person
somehow or something.
I don't know how I thought that
or something.
And I said, no, my name is...
I was Dave for the 15th time.
And she said, but you look like a Bob.
And I said, well, what's wrong
with looking like a Dave?
And she went into this long description
about Bobs and how they look so wonderful
and how they're so trusting looking
and nice and friendly and Dave's aren't.
Boy, is she all mixed up.
No kidding.
I was going to say.
What's her name now?
She's a lady.
Yeah, I'll go.
I'll tell her my name is Bob
and she'll say,
oh, you look like a Bob.
You're so trustworthy looking.
No, she'd say you look like a Doug.
Twiddling that mustache and so forth
and I can sell her something.
I think she was a willful person
who couldn't get names straight
and so she invented this lie of,
well, Bobs are wonderful.
Right, she heard you.
You know how a one-syllable name...
I mean, she just got mixed up
between Bob and your real name, Dan.
She can't help it.
She just gets confused.
Some people are that way, Dan.
Beautiful.
PR here.

We just break the news.
That sounds great.
So, don't learn why it happened.
