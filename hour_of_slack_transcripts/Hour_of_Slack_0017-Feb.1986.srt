1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
This is the subject of radio ministry.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,600
Hour of slack on KNON 90.9 in the left excess.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,820
Praise Bob.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,820
To be a good...

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,900
To turn on the machine.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,800
This is Radio Yerevan.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,760
My name is Hans Ivanovich Hagen.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,900
And this is the news.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,820
We got puppet boy.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,780
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,180
I have a bucket!

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,140
No trouble.

13
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,680
Just get set and get going.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,280
Hey, hear me.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:51,880
Recording.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,140
Everything's going fine.

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,100
No trouble.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,960
Welcome potential initiates.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,020
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,880
Bob?

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,220
Bob?

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,740
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

23
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,520
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,960
What about slack?

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,180
That's your key phrase.

26
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,460
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:39,740
And now, the subgenius hour of slack.

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,720
Slack.

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,120
Slack.

30
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,300


31
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,180
Slack.

32
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,120
Slack.

33
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,180
Slack.

34
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,180


35
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,180


36
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,180


37
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,180


38
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,180


39
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,180


40
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,180


41
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,180


42
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,180


43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,440
Slack.

44
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,020
Slack.

45
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


46
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


47
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


48
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


49
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


50
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


51
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


52
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


53
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


54
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


55
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,020


56
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:02,820
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only

57
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,440
to be played on radio station KNON.

58
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,340
And only in the city of Dallas, Texas.

59
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,240
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show, the listener is

60
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,160
advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials in the event of any material

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,420
contact.

62
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,420


63
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,420


64
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,420


65
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,420


66
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,420


67
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,420


68
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,420


69
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,420


70
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,840
Do not interrupt the broadcast of this program.

71
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:20,840


72
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,560
This audio is not intended to be used to demonstrate the importance of the radio or other listening

73
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,620
device being inhaled during broadcast.

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,580
Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra high or ultra low shocks and

75
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,820
brain frequencies constantly scanned throughout our program should seek shelter in an approved

76
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,860
safety unit only.

77
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,300
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases,

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,680
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

79
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,380
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

80
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,720
Here is your host.

81
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,400
Reverend Ivan Stavros.

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,400


83
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,400


84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:03:04,040
And, uh, yes, dear friends, it's so good to be back in power on KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

85
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,060
If I can get these sound effects off the script for a second.

86
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,840
Now, friends, don't start calling in yet.

87
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:18,320
We do have phone-in capabilities here at 823-7490, but don't start calling yet.

88
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,300
Let us establish a little bit of tape, uh, roundup.

89
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,320
Let's nail some sound into your head first.

90
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,660
In the meantime, watch out.

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,640
If you're in your car, uh, the streets are starting to get a-mike-slick, friends.

92
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,780
And, you know, the driver next to you would just love to drive by a car wreck, so be careful.

93
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,160
Uh, Reverend, uh, Stewart?

94
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,200
Uh, you might pass me another puff of that puffer fish here.

95
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:04,100
Yes, we subgenius ministers, uh, even while we're working, um, smoke these, uh, just kind of powdered puffer fish things.

96
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,040
It's the same thing they use in Haiti to create zombies.

97
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:14,620
Uh, a little bit more puffer fish, and I'll be able to see Bob, and he'll tell me how to get hold of some more puffer fish.

98
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,140
But, friends?

99
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:26,120
They say, you know, they say that Bob is dead, Bob Dobbs is dead, and even Oboe, the anti-Bob, is sick.

100
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,500
Friends, I don't believe it.

101
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,620
Bob.

102
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,040
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

103
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,820
Bob is a rock, and Bob is a tree.

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,220
Bob, Bob is a bear, and Bob is a bee.

105
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,600
Bob, Bob is truth, and Bob is lies.

106
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,940
Bob, Bob is cakes and fruits and pies.

107
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,040
Bob, Bob.

108
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,780
Bob's a hassle.

109
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,260
Bob's my watch.

110
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,080
Bob's my sandwich.

111
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,740
Bob's my crotch.

112
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,580
Bob's my toothpick.

113
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,920
Bob's my brain.

114
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,140
Bob's an ugly yellow stain.

115
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,040
Bob's a cactus.

116
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,840
Bob's an itch.

117
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,320
Bob is take off every stitch.

118
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,760
Bob's my master.

119
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,300
Bob's my slave.

120
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,240
Bob will rob me.

121
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,640
Bob will save.

122
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,480
Bob's my toaster.

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,980
Bob's my fridge.

124
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,460
Bob's my little sister and niche.

125
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,340
Bob will cost you.

126
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,580
Bob is free.

127
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,900
Bob's a rock, and Bob's a key.

128
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,080
In short, that Bob does is the man

129
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,440
who used your leg as a frying pan.

130
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,140
If you're not in the jar, you can pour down a sink.

131
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,200
And the subgenius church is a missing link.

132
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,580
Like.

133
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,640
Yeah, pills.

134
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,080
Pills.

135
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,380
Pills to the left of me.

136
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,880
Pills to my right.

137
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,040
Pills in the day and pills in the night.

138
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,200
Pills.

139
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,920
Pills.

140
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,400
This is K-N-O-N.

141
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,300
This is the hour of slack.

142
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,160
Dear friend, hello.

143
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,220
Are you on the air?

144
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,180
Hello, are you on the air?

145
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,180


146
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,060
Hello, are you on the air?

147
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,680
Oh, friends.

148
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,620
Oops, just lost a listener.

149
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,700
Now I know why.

150
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,960
I'm afraid this song may explain everything.

151
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:20,800
Pills.

152
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,980
Well, pills in my hamper.

153
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,620
Pills in my socks.

154
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,700
Pills in the woods and pills on the rocks.

155
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,640
Yeah, pills.

156
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:32,900
Pills.

157
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,780
Talking about pills.

158
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:36,940
Pills.

159
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,080
Pills.

160
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,780
Only things to do.

161
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,420
Pills are there.

162
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,100
Hello, this is K-N-O-N.

163
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,080
And, and.

164
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,540
Friend, you're on the air.

165
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,480
How's it going, Bob?

166
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,340
Stang?

167
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,860
Yes, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

168
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,980
I'm afraid Bob ain't here.

169
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,200
Oh, man.

170
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,080
You're not gonna believe it.

171
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,120
Uh, try me.

172
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,020
Oh, man, last night.

173
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,920
See, I was, I got up to go to the bathroom

174
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,000
in the middle of the night, right?

175
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,420
You know, as I'm walking down the hall,

176
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,040
all of a sudden I see this flash.

177
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,200
Yes, yes.

178
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,540
You know, this flash, like orange-blue flame.

179
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,520
Uh-huh.

180
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,520
And so, and it's like right in my face,

181
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,360
and like totally singes my eyebrows.

182
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,860
This is by your bathroom?

183
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,260
Right by my bathroom.

184
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:25,920
Uh-huh.

185
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,560
And so, you know, I was going, well, what the hell is this?

186
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,460
So I click on the hall light, right?

187
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,140
And it's Bob.

188
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,360
And he's power-flagellating on me.

189
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,520
You actually saw Bob Dobbs?

190
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,440
I saw Bob.

191
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,180
Now, are you the same guy that called last week

192
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,060
and claimed to have seen our

193
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,840
slain guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,740
Wait a minute.

195
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,340
Wait a minute!

196
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,740
Was that Bob?

197
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,740
I don't know. Something's going...

198
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,760
Good Lord, these are other shows!

199
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,000
Other subgenius shows are flying

200
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,260
through the room here in the radio station.

201
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
Uh, look,

202
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,880
I'm sorry. We're gonna have to

203
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,080
cut out of this and go to something else.

204
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,340
Uh, can you call back later?

205
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,300
I sure can, man.

206
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,700
Thanks.

207
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,460
I'll be right back.

208
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,940
I'll be right back.

209
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
Ooh!

210
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,460
Ooh!

211
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,000
Ooh!

212
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,400
Ooh!

213
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,500
Ooh!

214
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,420
Ooh!

215
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,360
Ooh!

216
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,420
Ooh!

217
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,200
You know, uh,

218
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,560
I was walking...

219
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,740
I was walking down the beach

220
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,780
trying to get to my woody

221
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,720
where I had my

222
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,360
suds cold and my buds was gold.

223
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,320
I was gonna get high

224
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,300
and get real drunk.

225
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,280
Lay in the sand.

226
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:07,600


227
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,140
With my beach bunny.

228
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,020
With my beach bunny.

229
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,480
But...

230
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,600
Out to the side...

231
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
Out of the side of my eye,

232
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,180
I saw

233
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,460
the ultimate wave.

234
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,040
The super wave.

235
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,040
It was the most stoked out stud wave

236
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,820
in all reality.

237
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,040
It was 900 feet tall.

238
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,100
And on the

239
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,540
backside of reality, too.

240
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,000
I saw a black hole

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,180
right in the middle of it.

242
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,580
A vortex.

243
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,400
I was ready to

244
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,620
shoot through that black hole.

245
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,840
Had my molecules

246
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:48,900
rearranged.

247
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,460
I'm gonna hang five as I shoot through the black hole

248
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,840
of the vortex of the super

249
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,960
wave.

250
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,600
The most god awful wave

251
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,280
in reality.

252
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,660
On the backside of reality.

253
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,260
The front side and

254
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,640
the left and right side.

255
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:09,840
Huh.

256
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,680
I was tubing.

257
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,160
I was fixing to cut out.

258
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,940
And then...

259
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,080
And then...

260
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,480
The giant...

261
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,760
It was Wunsch McColloch.

262
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,320
It was one of those Wunsch McColloch's that just opened up right out of the sea.

263
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,360
And then he came out of the sea, and he started sucking me down.

264
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,280
It was like a vortex funnel sucking me down to the bottom of the ocean.

265
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,480
I was getting sucked down.

266
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,560
And you know, as much as I hate to admit it, it felt pretty good.

267
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,300
It felt pretty good getting sucked down in that vortex with the giant.

268
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,300


269
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,660
I was getting sucked down, all the way down to the bottom of the ocean.

270
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,880
For god, I hate to admit it!

271
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,140
For god, I hate to admit it!

272
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,960
It felt pretty good!

273
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,920
But I hate to admit it!

274
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,100
Moving on down, on the backside of reality, in my bad lord by my side,

275
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,800
riding the wave and stoking on my fine day.

276
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,300
Moving on down to the bottom of the ocean!

277
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,140
Backside of reality

278
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,600
Riding on my back

279
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,840
We're stuck in a map

280
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,500
I say

281
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,120
Huh

282
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,560
Huh

283
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,900
Oh, daughter

284
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,140
All on the BG

285
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,720
It's another six-pack

286
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,420
Gonna make sure I have some

287
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,920
Cocoa, yeah

288
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,280
I wanna have some

289
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,380
Cocoa buns

290
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,240
Yeah

291
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,540
And sons

292
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:14,120
Friends, this is

293
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,260
The Swinging Love Corpses

294
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,480
This is a band

295
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,300
That's

296
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,740
Started

297
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,720
It used to be called

298
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,680
One Thousand Doctors

299
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,980
This is Dr. Philo Drummond's band

300
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,320
With Dr. Ray Hay

301
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,880
And Sphinx Drummond

302
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,440
His brother

303
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,080
And they're a funky

304
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,660
A subgenius band

305
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,240
And in fact

306
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,360
Tonight

307
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,140
I've

308
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,460
You might

309
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,980
Lay off the phone calls

310
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,680
Because once again

311
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,620
I'm having trouble

312
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,460
Dealing with these

313
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,800
I have to have

314
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,960
Forty assistants here

315
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,200
To handle the phone calls

316
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,120
So we're gonna stick with music

317
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,880
And in fact

318
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,600
I'm just gonna play

319
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,880
The tapes that came in

320
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,300
The mail box

321
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,380
To the Subgenius Foundation

322
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,520
This week

323
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,720
These

324
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
What you'll be hearing

325
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,200
Is just

326
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,820
The cream off the

327
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,080
Scraping the crud

328
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,640
Off the top

329
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,360
Of what came in

330
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,580
The Subgenius mail this week

331
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,020
We get a lot of cassettes

332
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,980
Oh yes dear friend

333
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
So on and on and on

334
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,060
It goes

335
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,080
Regardless of what the news

336
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,660
Media around the world says

337
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,420
We know who's in charge

338
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,380
And praise God

339
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,200
We know exactly

340
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,840
How everything is going to come out

341
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,620
Praise God

342
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,220
In revelation

343
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,540
A clockwise manner

344
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,300
Well this next week

345
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,100
We'll be right back

346
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,920
I'm gonna crack that wing

347
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,620
I'm gonna get back

348
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,520
And uh

349
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,080
I seen one of them flying

350
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,020
Right by

351
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,040
Over my car

352
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,380
And they stopped my car

353
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,640
And they took me in

354
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,380
And they said

355
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:28,660

And we're gonna stop

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,460
The evil that's going on in the world

00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,660
We're gonna come down

369
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,100
And we're gonna help

370
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,860
Those evil people find themselves

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,140
So you can help us Jimmy

372
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,300
We're gonna help those evil people find themselves

You're gonna help us

376
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,080
You're gonna tell us

377
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,440
Which ones are the evil people

378
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,560
That we need to correct

379
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,260
Now you're gonna help us Jimmy

380
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,480
Okay

381
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,900
And then they got back in their spaceship

382
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,680
And they flew off

383
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,880
And I just found myself in my car again

384
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,140
And I drove on down to that 7-Eleven

385
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,040
And uh

386
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,780
My father of course

387
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,300
He's dead

388
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,960
But they're keeping the water on him

389
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,400
He's okay

390
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,500
They're keeping him cool

391
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,260
People say I'm crazy

392
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,620
I don't mind

393
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,620
He told me

394
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,860
He said I see little men

395
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,480
And he held his fingers like this

396
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,440
It's illusions

397
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,980
It's illusions

398
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,300
It's illusions

399
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,420
He said I see little men

400
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,200
About 3 inches high

401
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,840
He said I'm over in

402
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,520
In Spain

403
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,760
Or somewhere like that

404
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,140
He said I even go over into a place like that

405
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,860
And he said I see these little objects

406
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,640
And these little men

407
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,280
And all these little things

408
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,980
And if your heart doesn't go out for something like that

409
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,780
I want you to know

410
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,340
My heart goes out for people like that

411
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,860
And I want you to know something else

412
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,360
Those people are actually

413
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,300
You know what they're doing

414
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,260
Those people are really reaching out

415
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,320
Trying to find something

416
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,640
And if they can just

417
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,200
If they can just realize it

418
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,280
You know what they're doing

419
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,260
Jesus has the answer

420
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,560
That Christ has everything that they're looking for

421
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,720
And Christ can get

422
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,780
Let them get

423
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,740
Get on high

424
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,040
And lift them up

425
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,080
And put them on the high way

426
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,100
And give them joy

427
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,820
And speak up

428
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,080
Give them peace in the life

429
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,600
You'll not want any more dope

430
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,040
You'll not want any more alcohol

431
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,020
You'll not

432
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,840
No, no, don't let me take those pills

433
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,200
No

434
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,800
Bring out the pills, baby

435
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,060
I don't want to take those pills

436
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,000
From outer space

437
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,380
No

438
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,820
Give them the pills

439
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,740
Give them the pills

440
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,560
Give them the pills

441
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:14,940
Come on, now

442
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,380
Bring out the pills

443
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,380


444
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,260
Just because you're alone

445
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:46,260


446
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:46,260


447
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:46,260

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:46,260

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:46,260


450
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:46,260


451
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:46,620
with me

452
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,280
Only testimonies

453
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,900
or a detector and a vacation home in the rockies

454
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,880
with a coyote's drone minutes it took to get to the bank

455
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:04,780
where the pet caused by a shish kebab steak he went in the aquarium of the skeleton fish

456
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,680
the styrofoam packed him up to the top of a building

457
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:21,980
it's no fun living like we do here cause there's no good tv and no cold beer

458
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:32,940
the clothes hamper of the wilderness filters are red and the dryer is jammed

459
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,560
the books that you bought last week i'm seeing

460
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,020
genie is glad that the kiln was put in

461
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,520
tonight

462
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,640
it's a big test that we see the lives of many

463
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,080
a mile and a half will kill every guy

464
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,560
a mile and three quarters up in the sky

465
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,600
it's a great big banner

466
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,940
give up tree there's no gray matter

467
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,740

468
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,780
oh come on give just a little and take even less

469
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,200
kangaroo soldiers aren't making a mess

470
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,080
and that kiln he admits of glamorous

471
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,660
makes the world go on

472
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:11,660

00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,280
it doesn't seem like my favorite books but why should it

475
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,000
forbidden fruit and forbidden drugs

full name

510
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,460
this wasviewer

511
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,300
old man

512
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,620
that was the wallman

513
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:49,500
are Bob Dobbs is dead. Now, honestly, for years, for the last two years, I subscribed

514
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,520
to the commonly held theory, the official theory of the church, that Bob Dobbs had been

515
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,240
killed. I now, and I can't explain why, I no longer believe that. I just know for some

516
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:10,920
reason in my heart that Bob is not dead and that he's probably listening, you know, if

517
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:19,320
not to this show, to your show, friends. So, in the meantime, the anti-Dallas, the anti-Dallas,

518
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:27,480
friends, from which Oboe, the anti-Bob, gets his power, its power is wavering. The power

519
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,240
of the anti-Dallas is wavering, but at the same time, if it comes in contact with the

520
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:40,560
true Dallas, which is okay, there may be a conjunction, friends, a conjunction of the

521
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:40,900
anti-Dallas.

522
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:52,200
Now, Oboe wants this. Bob does not want this. Dr. Stu here from More Drunk Cowboys actually

523
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,100
has done the research that led to this theory here. He's here in the station with us. Dr.

524
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,340
Stu?

525
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,180
Yes.

526
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,520
Can you add anything to what I'm saying? As you were telling me, all of the police will

527
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,060
turn evil if there is a conjunction with the anti-Dallas, even the Krishna policemen.

528
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,900
Yes, even the Krishna policemen will turn evil.

529
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:20,980
In fact, see, the anti-Dallas is composed mainly of slack vampires. We know of slack

530
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:29,320
vampires. They depend on us for their survival. Actually, this ties in very clearly with the

531
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,600
Omicron-Epsilon theory of time.

532
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,960
Yes, the time intersection, when the backwards universe intersects with our universe.

533
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,840
See, in effect, since the anti-Dallas is a close...

534
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:47,360
It's in fact a closed universe into and of itself. It just happens to be a cheap satanic

535
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:56,820
replica of our true Dallas. They do tend to intersect sort of like a partial eclipse of

536
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:04,260
the true Dallas and the anti-Dallas. Also, the anti-Dallas has no time control whatsoever.

537
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,400
In effect, they're trying to keep themselves together. Backwards, forwards, time. That

538
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:10,820
doesn't mean...

539
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,180
That doesn't mean nothing. There's nothing but time vortexes there.

540
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,120
No, no, no.

541
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,440
It's kind of like random static on your television set, you see. They're trying to get to us.

542
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,960
But do we have time control? Do we ourselves have what Bob calls true time control?

543
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:30,700
We don't have control, but at least Wotan keeps all the Bobions going in the same direction

544
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:37,320
at the same time. In the anti-Dallas, actions do not have consequences. Consequences do

545
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,760
not have actions. It's much closer to Negius.

546
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

547
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,940
You know, I've been thinking about it. It's much closer to the cosmic universe than ours.

548
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,360
You see.

549
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,140
Good Lord.

550
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:44,880
Indeed.

551
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,860
I had no idea.

552
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,660
Indeed. And Negi is so much closer to them than he is to us.

553
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,040
This is a chilling, chilling thought, friends.

554
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,560
Indeed.

555
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,260
It's getting colder and colder in the station.

556
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,340
I've heard our powers dropping.

557
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,520
Yes, as I understand, I heard those raps again, those mysterious sounds.

558
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,540
Oh, God.

559
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,140
The rapping in the walls, the pops and bangs.

560
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,640
Snap.

561
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,800
Can you hear them, friends, out there?

562
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,820
So, anyway...

563
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:10,820


564
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:10,820


565
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:10,820


566
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:10,820


567
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:10,820


568
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:10,820


569
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:10,820


570
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,640
As I understand it, the anti-Dallas is somehow cut off from our reality, all alone in its

571
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,180
own hollow, curved interior universe. There is no anti-Chicago, no anti-Miami.

572
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,060
No anti-Phil.

573
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,840
And the only way they can get out is through Dallas.

574
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,180
Not even an anti-Ivan Stang, no anti-Philo Drummond.

575
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,960
There is...

576
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,220
Nothing but Oboe and nothing but Bob.

577
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,260
Oboe, the anti-Bob.

578
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,820
And as long as Bob's in heaven, Oboe's in heaven.

579
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:40,820


580
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:40,820


581
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,680
Oboe will get sicker and sicker and weaker and weaker.

582
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,600
That is why Bob is staying in heaven or hell or Asgard, as he is.

583
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:55,740
He is, in effect, not unable to come back, but merely choosing not to while Oboe gets

584
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,500
sicker and is dying out.

585
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,140
Here, have some of this puffer fish.

586
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,480
Let's blow off that church.

587
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,000
Oh, I'll get that.

588
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,880
Are you abnormal?

589
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,820
Then you are probably not.

590
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:10,820


591
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:10,820


592
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:10,820


593
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:10,820


594
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:10,820


595
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:10,820


596
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:10,820


597
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,060
You are better than most people.

598
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,160
Yes, your time shall triumph through Bob and Slack.

599
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,920
Slack is the free car wash that comes with the Phil of Bob.

600
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,040
He's the ultimate good guy, the terrorist for peace.

601
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,160
Bob is the pool of the universe and thus the only place of all knowledge.

602
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,960
Bob is the phoenix rising from the ashes of the cleansing fire.

603
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,820
Bob is the phoenix rising from the ashes of the cleansing fire.

604
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:40,820


605
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,460
Bob is the teaching for those who need not be taught.

606
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:50,980
The more stupid something looks, the more important it probably is.

607
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,060
Bob is heaven's one true policeman.

608
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,880
Bob is the bullet and you, you are the gun.

609
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,500
Bob is companionship and there's no one there, no one there.

610
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,660
Bob is really the ultimate sex god.

611
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,400
These are facts you must take into account.

612
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,780
7 a.m. July 5th, 1998.

613
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,000
What will it be like?

614
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,700
It is X Day here in Cleveland.

615
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,780
Gather round, one and all.

616
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,040
It is X Day in Cleveland.

617
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,020
And he gave me some rock.

618
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,180
I can handle reality.

619
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,280
Now that Bob made a man out of me.

620
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:10,520
We now know that LSD is the most mysterious and powerful substance ever invented.

621
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,620
Oh, yes, dear friend.

622
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,880
And so, you see, that tape was actually brought to the studio last week.

623
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,280
I've edited it down a little bit.

624
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,900
Sorry there, Reverend Patterson.

625
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:28,280
The young and strange Reverend Patterson brought that, actually dropped that by the studio.

626
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,820
And the mailman dropped by all these other cassettes.

627
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,700
And the thunder and the lightning continued.

628
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,600
And there was no hope anywhere.

629
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,320
We know that LSD will fly.

630
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,300
It's the most mysterious and powerful.

631
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,200
Welcome.

632
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,020
I think.

633
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,620
Welcome.

634
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,660
Oh.

635
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,740
Oh.

636
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,460
Okay.

637
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,420
Good Lord, friends.

638
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,100
I'm actually, there's something hideously wrong with my number two tape deck here.

639
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,040
But don't worry.

640
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:57,980
Oh, no.

641
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,000
We know exactly what could.

642
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,120
90.90.

643
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:02,980
FM.

644
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,300
And now it's sexy.

645
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,040
This is the sub-channel radio ministry.

646
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,040
We threw the poster.

647
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,420
Our reflect on KNO.

648
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,380
And 90.9 in the left excess.

649
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,520
Praise Bob.

650
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,280
This is KNO and 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

651
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,300
Alice, welcome, dear friends, to the church of the sub-channel radio ministry.

652
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,640
This is the channel.

653
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,980
It's the Bob show.

654
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,600
Okay.

655
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,280
Okay.

656
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,940
Okay.

657
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,440
Then, we'll look out for you.

658
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,460
Here.

659
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,880
We believe that you'll be grateful for that.

660
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,640
I already.

661
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,240


662
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,500
You, too.

663
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,680
There'll be no punishment for you.

664
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:04,680


665
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:04,680


666
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:04,680


667
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:04,680


668
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:04,680


669
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:04,680


670
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,840
Oh.

671
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,120
det셔.'saw'ed.

672
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:21,180
against the right to the max so to speak and all that is around us those are your instructions

673
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:29,960
enjoy the crud the very crud of the conspiracy and fling it back in their faces

674
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:40,800
in this way we may hope to overcome until next time or 1998 whichever comes first

675
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,880
we bid you a very good week

676
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:50,720

685
00:30:59,940 --> 00:30:59,940


686
00:30:59,940 --> 00:30:59,940


687
00:30:59,940 --> 00:30:59,940


688
00:30:59,940 --> 00:30:59,940


689
00:30:59,940 --> 00:30:59,940


690
00:30:59,940 --> 00:30:59,940


691
00:30:59,940 --> 00:30:59,940


692
00:30:59,940 --> 00:30:59,940


693
00:30:59,940 --> 00:30:59,940


694
00:30:59,940 --> 00:30:59,940


695
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,740
sexual

696
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:17,580
think about this man oh all right i think it's a wonderful idea which is joined to the radius

697
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,960
vector that directs ah yes that radiation we've been having that that accounts for it that accounts

698
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,780
for those giant slugs and snails which i your champion dr howell have been battling on the

699
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:35,320
rims of consciousness yes they palpate their subluxations as i tell you it's a massage

700
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:44,080
they have no internal skeletons as we know only a cartilaginous mass of pulsating tubercles

701
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,020
undulating swiftly through the sluggish streams that rush through the secret places in the center

702
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:57,520
of the earth now let's uh take euclid let's take a euclidean demonstration of this geometric uh

703
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,840
apophage more procedure and suddenly here we are out in outer space planets comets things rushing

704
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,140
by

705
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,680
faster than trains faster than steamships or locomotives are faster than those mutant speedy

706
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,260
snails we've been having samples and i tell you it's a mysterious sight enough to make

707

you throw back your shoulders suck in that gut and trust in the infinite

708
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,180

is

717
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:14,140
is taking place the birth of an heir to mobius the mobius rex of the future not the mobius rex

718
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,520
of the present or the mobius who has already wrecked the past but the mobius rex which is

719
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:26,740
yet to come the wreck of all our hopes the new mobius rex the geometric drone this creature

720
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,860

737
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:09,940
we know a normal time manifestation normal time oh it's more like advanced i think it's like

738
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:16,860
heliopters in a in a space-time warp when you're surfing through the black hole of time

it is a beautiful thing like a beautiful thing like nothing else like orgasm pause

I think we need to hit that button before we put it down.

757
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,380
No, I don't think so.

758
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,180
Oh.

759
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,020
This is ridiculous.

760
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,140
Somebody must be cutting him off.

761
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,500
Somebody is trying to prevent this.

762
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,500
See, this caller called with an emergency.

763
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,160
He said that someone's been following him.

764
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,140
Okay.

765
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,340
Someone is following him.

766
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
Okay, now, is that a button?

767
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,480
Dear friend, hello, you're on the air.

768
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,860
I can't hear you.

769
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,840
If anyone can help us, please do.

770
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,140
In the meantime, this beautiful hymn of pyroflatulation should keep you informed.

771
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,080
Oh.

772
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,300
Oh.

773
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:55,520
Oh.

774
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:56,880
Oh.

775
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:58,540
Oh.

776
00:37:59,300 --> 00:37:59,860
Oh.

777
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,920
Hello, this is Ann McKinney.

778
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,640
14 years ago, legalized birth control became a reality in America.

779
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,240
13 years ago, abortion was made legal.

780
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,340
Now in 1986, these fundamental rights are being threatened.

781
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,720
But you can do something.

782
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:21,180
March 9th in Washington, D.C., the National Organization for Women is planning the first nationwide pro-choice march since 1973.

783
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,980
Your reproductive freedoms have never been more threatened than they are today.

784
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,200
If you don't want Jerry Falwell or Ronald Reagan deciding what birth control method you choose,

785
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,960
you can do something about it.

786
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,680
Join us in this struggle now, or your future decisions may be in someone else's hands.

787
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,840
Show your legislators and President Reagan that you do care.

788
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,200
March with your sisters and brothers in Washington, D.C. on March 9th.

789
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,440
Call National Organization for Women at 424-5474 for more details.

790
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,140
¶¶

791
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,260
Ah, yes, dear friends.

792
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,940
Yes, we've got one on the line. We hooked him.

793
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,880
Is this the man? Is this the man?

794
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,060
Uh, how may we help you, sir?

795
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,980
Uh, hello?

796
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:44,680


797
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,540
How may we help you, ma'am, sir, ma'am, thing?

798
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,180
God.

799
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,040
¶¶

800
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,840
No, no, no.

801
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,320
Here.

802
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,200
Oh, oh, oh.

803
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,000
Have another one.

804
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:05,960
No.

805
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,860
Have another one.

806
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,140
No.

807
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,380
Have three more.

808
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,180
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow.

809
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,120
That was fine.

810
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,500
Hey.

811
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,200
I feel, I feel, I feel great.

812
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,340
Hey.

813
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,780
Hey, where's Bob?

814
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,020
I want to go see Bob now.

815
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,880
I want to go see Bob.

816
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,400
No.

817
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:43,580
And I need to talk directly to you, Bob.

818
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:55,280
And I don't write real, real so good, real good words.

819
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:09,740
But, uh, at least I can, uh, uh, talk, talk, talk, Bob.

820
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:23,840
So, please, um, um, send me some more, uh, those, you know,

821
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,460
uh, uh, uh.

822
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,760
We'll all meet you on the Cztronbe.

823
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:27,780


824
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:27,780


825
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,420
Uh, uh, uh...

826
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,740
You hear that?

827
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,720
What is that?

828
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,880
Uh-huh.

829
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:36,940


830
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,700
Uh-huh.

831
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,520
Uh, uh-huh.

832
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,420
Uh-huh.

833
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,000
Uh-huh.

834
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,560
Uh-huh.

835
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,100
Uh-huh.

836
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,560
Uh-huh.

837
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:01,940
Let's go!

838
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,680
Hello! Hello! Hello!

839
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,380
You've got to go!

840
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,580
You've got to go!

841
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,780
Now that's what I mean!

842
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:54,840
You've got to go!

843
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,680
You've got to go!

844
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,960
Bob's going to flatten your parade with his church.

845
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,980
If that doesn't work, he'll shove it up your ass.

846
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,280
Yes, sir.

847
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,740
That bob is everywhere.

848
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,960
Small sample of what's going to happen.

849
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,540
How you feel, pink boys?

850
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,620
Look at him run.

851
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,800
Shut up, pink boy.

852
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,500
Yeah.

853
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:57,940
Less than 13 years to go.

854
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,760
Hardly wait.

855
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:31,340
If you wanna stay 재래 Aunty Junkies

856
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:31,500

857
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,560

858
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,500
skulle

859
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:51,480
거봅

860
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:37,580
Yes, Bob will be taking orders here in just a few minutes, so please have your menu ready.

861
00:46:55,420 --> 00:47:00,240
A little Dobbs intermission here, a little traveling music for the Dobbs Highway.

862
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,440
Ah, there we go, let's get up a little bit here.

863
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,400
Ah, it sure is fun sitting here having dinner with Bob.

864
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,860
Would you like some more, Bob?

865
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,820
He's looking pretty full over there.

866
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,740
I think he's put a little false slack on since the meal started.

867
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,660
How much can you pinch there?

868
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,380
Oh, look at that.

869
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,360
Bob's putting on a little fad.

870
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:38,300
And we now take you to our program, already in the Rock Rocks.

871
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,680
Oh, yes.

872
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,500
I'm so an asshole like the rest of my guests so that I can't possibly be outdone in any conversation.

873
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,060
I like having the last word.

874
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,660
It's my show, and I'll do what I want with it.

875
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,460
Thank you.

876
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:51,460


877
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,680
Oh, gee, thanks, Reverend Oscar of the Rat Cave.

878
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,540
Ugh!

879
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:06,460
Yes, that was Reverend, uh, Reverend Oscar of the Evil Rat Cave from the album The Rat Cave Squeak.

880
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,400
See, it's just endless.

881
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,940
I've got the blues

882
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,100
That damn pickup

883
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:18,320
Talked and run over my wife

884
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,620
My first love

885
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,500
I've got the blues

886
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,180
Everything

887
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,340
He just appropriates no sense.

888
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,380
He's only talking to himself.

889
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,620
Let's see what the person is like.

890
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,820
Let's see what the person is like.

891
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,380
I think we should be careful, uh, getting religion involved in this show.

892
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,140
He calls himself the Reverend Ray Dodge.

893
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,980
Let's see if he's home, because we tried to call him yesterday and he wasn't home.

894
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,920
Hello, this is, uh, Reverend Ray Dodge.

895
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,380
Reverend Dodge?

896
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,360
Yes, it is.

897
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,200
Hi, Bill...

898
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:47,920
This is Charlie Rattin.

899
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,700
Wait, excuse me.

900
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,220
This is Bill Baker calling from XCI.

901
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:51,460
You got a call from the XCI?

902
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:51,460


903
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,360
You guys entered our contest?

904
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:53,540
Yes.

905
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:54,120
Yes.

906
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,880
We have the Reverend Ray Dodge and Dolly Rotten.

907
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,960
Dolly Rotten, yeah.

908
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,440
Now, I'll tell you something.

909
00:48:59,500 --> 00:48:59,880
I don't...

910
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,220
I didn't understand, you know...

911
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:07,240
My...my...my sense of humor is a little bit, uh...is a little bit childish, if you will.

912
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,500
So I wasn't quite...I didn't understand your entry.

913
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,840
You know, what is exactly the Reverend Ray Dodge do?

914
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,240
Reverend Ray Dodge is Danbury's chief architect at the Planet Bob.

915
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:21,880
At the what?

916
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,120
We're, uh...

917
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,480
At the what?

918
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,220
We're at the subgenius in the Fairfield County area.

919
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,280
The word of what?

920
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,420
The planet what?

921
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,800
The word of Bob.

922
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,040
The word of Bob.

923
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:31,600
Right.

924
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,180
Now...now, who is Bob?

925
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,920
Is this anyone I know?

926
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:35,480
Bob.

927
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,800
What do you mean, who is Bob?

928
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:37,640
Bob...

929
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,880
And just remember, Bob spelled backwards is still Bob.

930
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:41,240


931
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,960
Who is...who is Bob Knott?

932
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,620
Who is Bob Knott?

933
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,360
We have some questions for you.

934
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:48,300
Now, wait a minute.

935
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,720
Who's doing the auditioning here?

936
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:56,780
Oh, we...well, if we...if we get Dean to come on your show, can we ask questions about

937
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,240
the flying saucers that are invading our country?

938
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,700
Uh, I wasn't familiar with any flying saucers invading our country.

939
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:04,780
No...

940
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,380
You're not aware that flying saucers are sleeping with your wives?

941
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,180
Well, none of us are married yet.

942
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,720
That's the reason.

943
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,000
This guy is really out to lunch.

944
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,780
We have to be careful.

945
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:23,740
I'm afraid...

946
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,400
...saint seems anomalous.

947
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:33,780
Yet, in his lifetime, he had something of a reputation for prophetic dreams and miraculous

948
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,520
cures of the sick and blind.

949
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,880
More miracles were recorded years after his death when his canonization was in question.

950
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:47,760
It must be said for him that he never went out of his way to claim miraculous powers.

951
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,900
though he was not displeased when he heard of a cure that worked.

952
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,800
All right, now we have the Reverend Ray Dodge.

953
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,500
Preaching, wait, let's clarify this.

954
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,940
He preaches the word of Bob.

955
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,380
He preaches the word of Bob.

956
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,120
Maybe you could clarify that for the listeners.

957
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,100
I'll tell you about Bob.

958
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,640
Go ahead.

959
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:09,580
Bob went among the Negroes and became a voodoo priest

960
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:12,140
after he returned from the Mexican War.

961
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:18,060
I was much less disturbed by the vaguer tales of wails and howlings

962
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,140
in the barren windswept valley beneath the limestone cliff,

963
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,860
of the graveyard stenches after the spring rains,

964
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,080
of the floundering, squealing white thing

965
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,940
on which Sir John Clave's horse had trod one night in a lonely field,

966
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,500
and of the servant who had gone mad

967
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,980
at what he saw in the priory in the full light of day.

968
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:42,120
A few of the tales were exceedingly peculiar.

969
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,360
They were very picturesque and made me wish I had learned more

970
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,460
of the comparative mythology in my youth.

971
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:53,940
Bob is our chief prophet and the avatar of the 80s.

972
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:57,200
He will bring about the end times and show humanity the way

973
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,980
to financial riches and free sex.

974
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,040
Bob is the true living slack master,

975
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,340
and I think he's answered all the problems of our present times.

976
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,800
Oh, really?

977
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:11,740
Oh, really.

978
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:15,440
Also, he is helping us to build the Slack Accelerator Project.

979
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,500
A Slack Accelerator Project?

980
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,660
Where is this located?

981
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,380
You guys think that the construction out on the highway

982
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,420
is repairs to the highway.

983
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,500
It's a little-known fact,

984
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,040
and we're prepared to reveal this information now,

985
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:31,120
that we are building a giant Slack Accelerator.

986
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,560
I'm not quite sure what.

987
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,540
Slack? S-L-A-G-G?

988
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,700
No, S-L-A-C-K.

989
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,640
Now, what is exactly...

990
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,920
We feel that in the...

991
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:42,660
in the Danbury area,

992
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,300
there's an insufficiently high level of slacking off.

993
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,120
Uh-huh.

994
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,840
So we are trying to accelerate that process

995
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,200
by tightening this noose slowly around the outskirts of Danbury.

996
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,540
What about the high level of mental illness in the Danbury area?

997
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,100
Yeah, yeah, we're working with that.

998
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,860
We feel that there's some potential there.

999
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,220
Potential for what?

1000
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:03,620
People.

1001
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,340
You guys are... these guys are nuts!

1002
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,020
He was a vindictive, irrational man.

1003
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,360
He was a vindictive, irrational man.

1004
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:19,360


1005
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:19,760
He was a vindictive, irrational man.

1006
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:19,760


1007
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:19,760


1008
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,660
Uh, yes, friends.

1009
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,480
We'll see when...

1010
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:26,220
I think that suitably got us off the hook with Bob.

1011
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,480
Obviously, Bob does not want us to take call-ins on our own show,

1012
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:36,780
so I had to steal another show that had call-ins from other subgeniuses.

1013
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,040
That was sent by Reverend Ray Dodge in Connecticut.

1014
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,720
So, you see, that's what you can do.

1015
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,300
Call in over there.

1016
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,640
For that old damn Bob.

1017
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,160
Yeah, oh, that's right.

1018
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,680
Yeah, try to call in to all those other shows.

1019
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,380
Listen to those subgeniuses screaming in the background.

1020
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,460
Ah!

1021
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,400
Ah!

1022
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,480
Ah!

1023
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:58,880
Ah!

1024
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,160
Ah!

1025
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:00,940
Ah!

1026
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:01,800
Ah!

1027
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:03,500
Ah!

1028
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:03,660
Ah!

1029
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,400
Ah!

1030
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,140
Ah!

1031
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:09,900
Ah!

1032
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,860
Oh, yee...

1033
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:13,400
Leah...

1034
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,060
Leah...

1035
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,040
Leah get me.

1036
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,180
Hai!

1037
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,020
sharks!

1038

¶¶

1045
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,840
Friends, the church of the subgenius,

1046
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,700
this incredible new faith

1047
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,780
in which orthodoxy is the only heresy,

1048
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:08,880
is authorized to blaspheme by the gods themselves.

1049
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,540
This is, in fact, the first all-purpose belief system

1050
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:18,400
compatible with most major world religions and many weird cults

1051
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,500
without expensive interfaces.

1052
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:27,580
Friends, the quest of the Church of the Subgenius is something for nothing.

1053
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,860
Our immediate goal? World slack. World takeover.

1054
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:44,680
Our sub-purposes, friends, are to end death, taxes, hunger, war, disease, aging, and work.

1055
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:51,560
Because as Bob said, friends, as long as we must work, we are not free.

1056
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:57,000
Our weapons in this battle, friends, are the power of abnormality,

1057
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:02,480
the power of unpredictability, and the word of Bob Dobbs.

1058
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,340
Living out the word of Bob Dobbs.

1059
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:03,840
Living out the word of Bob Dobbs.

1060
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,200
The avatar of slack on planet Earth.

1061
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,340
Now, friends, we're going to have to be signing off pretty soon.

1062
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:12,940
I want you to have your pencils ready at the end of this broadcast

1063
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,220
where you can write for information and find out just what is going on.

1064
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:19,040
What is this so-called church?

1065
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,000
Who is Bob Dobbs?

1066
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,980
Who is this man, Bob? Who is this man?

1067
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:28,000
Friend, friend, you can't hide from Bob.

1068
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:32,440
You can hide from this show for a little while.

1069
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,980
You can hide from Charlie Manson.

1070
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,480
You can hide from Reverend Ivan Stank, but you can't hide from Bob, friend,

1071
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,840
because he's stupider than you.

1072
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,440
He's got more dots on his face than you do.

1073
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:49,320
His face has been mimeographed and put up in more places in yours.

1074
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:54,600
You can't hide from Bob.

1075
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,720
You can't hide from Bob.

1076
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,360
You can't hide from Bob.

1077
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:58,820
You can't hide from Bob.

1078
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:02,180
You can't hide from Bob.

1079
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:40,160
You can't hide from Bob.

1080
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:26,120
You can't hide from Bob.

1081
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,280
You can't hide from Bob.

1082
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,900
You can't keep track of Bob.

1083
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,580
You can't hide from Bob.

1084
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,600
You can't hide from Bob.

1085
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,700
You can't hide from Bob.

1086
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,520
You can't hide from Bob.

1087
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,760
You can't hide from Bob.

1088
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:43,760


1089
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:43,760


1090
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,620
You can't hide from Bob.

1091
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,620
You can't hide from Bob.

1092
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:47,620


1093
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:47,960
You can't hide from Bob.

1094
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:48,020


1095
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:48,020


1096
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:49,560
You can't hide from Bob.

1097
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,500
You can't hide from Bob.

1098
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,680
You can't hide from Bob.

1099
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,720
You can't hide from Bob.

1100
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:07,800
break hotel. Ooh, it's getting scary in here again, folks, as the hour slowly comes to

1101
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:18,580
an end. And as I said before, you can write to Bob. If you actually address a letter to

1102
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:25,580
Bob, he may receive it. It may be intercepted in the mail at some point. Yes, I hear that

1103
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:32,260
beautiful sign-off music coming up. Friends, we need your love offerings, your donations

1104
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:37,600
here at K&ON to keep this station on the air, to keep slack flowing out or whatever it is

1105
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:45,580
that we're peddling. And it is slack, friends, and Bob does love you. So send that pound,

1106
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:55,340
that hundred pounds of dollar bills to my lap. Address that to Bob at P.O. Box 14 or

1107
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:55,560
over.

1108
01:00:55,580 --> 01:01:09,280
P.O. Box 14306, Dallas, Texas 75214. That's right. That's Bob at P.O. Box 14306 in Dallas,

1109
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:16,880
Texas. Ah, yes, the real Dallas, not the anti-Dallas where Oboe the Anti-Bob's going to try to get

1110
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:22,540
you from, friends. This is Reverend Ivan Stang with the Hour of Slack. Sorry we couldn't

1111
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:25,420
put your phone calls on the air this time. Apparently it was not.

1112
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,280
The will of that man, Bob.

1113
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:41,600
So, good night and hang in there for the Monday morning replacement show. The entire rest

1114
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:50,120
of this week is nothing but a replacement for the subgenius hour of slack for the next

1115
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:50,480
week.

1116
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,800
Wood has been cast.

1117
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,620
Ah, yes.

1118
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,440
With ordinary men who invalidate programs.

1119
01:01:55,580 --> 01:02:00,740
Yeah, what's up

1120
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,080
again?

1121
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:14,880
Oh, no.

1122
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,900
No, Bob.

1123
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,580
What?

1124
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,020
Here's Illa.

1125
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:20,540
Yeah.

1126
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,560
You're kicking my ass.

1127
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:25,560


1128
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:25,560


1129
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:25,560


1130
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:25,560


1131
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:25,560


1132
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,980
Drinking Budweiser
