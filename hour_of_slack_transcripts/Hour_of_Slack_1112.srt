1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:09,060
With 1951 model cars beginning to make their appearance, this is the season when a lot of drivers get new car fever.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,000
But if a look at your bank book tells you that a new car isn't for you, then why not enjoy the next best thing?

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,940
And what is the next best thing to a new car?

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,600
The next best thing to a new car is...

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,660
The Self Genius Power of Swag.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,600
Making your weekends brighter with celebrities, music, news, and sports.

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,840
Is he still on the line, Gary?

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,760
I think we do have a guy still there.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,960
Is he really? Listen, since we've got him holding on the line, why don't we just find out what this pessimist club is all about.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,040
How long has the pessimist club been around?

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,740
Oh, about ten years. But I'm pretty sure we're going to fold any day now.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,440
I mean, assuming we're not all killed by the earthquake first.

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,360
Oh, boy, you really are a pessimist.

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,540
Thank you. I try, but of course it never really does any good.

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,260
Oh, of course.

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,640
So, Gary...

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,680
Just what do you do at a pessimist's club meeting?

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,180
We make our predictions for the next six months.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,320
Oh, and what are they?

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,620
Well, we feel pretty sure that there will be complete and total peace throughout the entire world.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,840
Gee, that doesn't sound very pessimistic.

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,120
Well, no, not for those who will survive the Earth's collision with the sun.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,580
Goodbye, Mr. Negative!

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,500
I've been hearing something on the streets the last couple of weeks.

25
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,380
Weird stuff. Some sort of epidemic of violence, what they've been saying.

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,800
I was talking to one old boy. He told me they got some sort of cult up there.

27
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,660
End of the world kind of stuff.

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,280
Well, let's not bore these folks. Come on, let's have another question.

29
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:49,500
Uh, I always seem to encounter and experience a sensation much like a fit of epilepsy while contemplating the Dobbs head.

30
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,080
What can I do to prevent this?

31
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,160
Well, do you have a history of this?

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,860
In your family?

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,960
I guess that's what I would ask if this person wanted to consult with me on a one-to-one basis.

34
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:08,080
But let's make sure that this is something that you want to get rid of.

35
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,080
After all, contemplating the Dobbs head is an adventure in itself.

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,240
What seems to be epilepsy might simply be a shortcut through unused neural pathways to the proper enlightenment.

37
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,880
There might be a little raving, biting.

38
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,700
Or a little bit of a tongue-mashing of teeth and so forth.

39
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,320
That is a byproduct.

40
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,980
Drumming of heels on the floor.

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,200
Or just drumming.

42
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,220
Thanks, Hal.

43
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,460
We have another one, too.

44
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,180
Oh, good.

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,320
Well, here's one that's similar to the standard atheist question.

46
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,380
I expect those. We usually get a couple of them. Let's have it.

47
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,120
Can Bob create a sales pitch even he could not resist?

48
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,820
And, of course,

49
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,580
the answer is, to Bob, nothing is impossible.

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,920
He has created this sales pitch.

51
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,860
It is what we celebrate every day in the Church of the Subgenius.

52
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,120
We all have bought Bob's pitch.

53
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,040
Yes, we are buying into it.

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:23,360
Buying into this ever-expanding pyramid scheme, outer telescoping plan of universal domination that Bob sells.

55
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,380
His remedy of slack for us.

56
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,500
That's why Bob doesn't care about sinners.

57
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,180
Bob doesn't really want souls as much as he wants customers.

58
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,860
And by George, there's one born every minute.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,220
Here's a good question. I don't think this is addressed in any of the books.

60
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,200
Does Bob have a sacred atomic element or molecule?

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,020
Or even a top ten?

62
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,260
Well, it is probable.

63
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:02,500
And yet, if one attempts to investigate this, assuming Bob would even allow such a probing of his inner nature,

64
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,160
the uncertainty principle would make it almost impossible to identify.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,560
What about, I would think that the FROP molecule has been identified with Bob.

66
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,980
Well, that is true. And that's a byproduct.

67
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,000
And there is a...

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,840
There is a radioactivity there. A slight radioactivity.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,500
Of course, there's radioactivity in all plants to a certain degree.

70
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,980
But FROP is a different matter.

71
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:39,780
FROP receives more unbroken solar radiation in its growth stage.

72
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,000
It's a crapshoot. It's difficult to say.

73
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,260
Partly because of this uncertainty principle that I mentioned.

74
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,800
But speaking of molecules, Dr. Howell,

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,720
have you heard about the deadly molecule or element that's been getting into our ecosystem called dihydrogen monoxide?

76
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,080
Yes, that's a particularly nasty one.

77
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,420
Many hideous chickens are coming home to roost in these, the latter days.

78
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,380
Yeah, friends, watch out for dihydrogen monoxide.

79
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,500
It gets into everything.

80
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,360
Cancer cells, for instance, cannot live without it.

81
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,700
And yet, it's in our city's water supplies.

82
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,560
It's in every bottle of soda pop manufactured with very few exceptions.

83
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,140
DHMO.

84
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:35,120
So watch out. Look at ingredients and see if it says anything about DHMO.

85
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,180
An incredibly powerful carcinogen brought to you by human industrial supremacy.

86
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,340
As little as a tablespoon of it in your lungs can kill you.

87
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,340
If you get it in, like, a gallon.

88
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,720
It's in a gaseous or liquid form.

89
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,120
But if in a pinch, you can use a teaspoon.

90
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,920
Really? Only a teaspoon can...

91
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,380
No, you use several teaspoons.

92
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,080
Well, friends, if you have more questions about dihydrogen monoxide,

93
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,760
there's a website about it, and you can ask us about it.

94
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,900
Visit it on the web at dihydrogenmonoxide.com.

95
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,740
We don't want to make you paranoid or anything.

96
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,760
Here's an, I guess this is the last question.

97
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,320
Well, that's it.

98
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,720
That was mercifully brief.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,020
Let's check this last question.

100
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,080
Well, this one could go on and on.

101
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,740
How come all dreams I have with Dobbs in them

102
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,640
always have Bob killing people with his grin

103
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,180
or pepper spraying unruly crowds?

104
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,380
Do you know what purpose your dreams serve?

105
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,700
They may entertain you or they may distress you,

106
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,880
but they are a necessary part of your mental makeup.

107
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,640
Your brain creates these scenarios to help you figure things out.

108
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,140
And believe me, a lot needs to be figured out.

109
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,000
Bob is and always should be a dynamic figure in your dreams.

110
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,240
If you were to dream of floating Dobbs heads and peaceful pastoral images

111
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,060
like those generated by saintly Ivan Stang in all his subgenius films,

112
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,500
then that would be a time to worry.

113
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,480
But in your dreams, Bob should be an active figure,

114
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,760
wielding a flaming sword, destroying pinks with the sheer force of his grin

115
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,780
as flaming Jupiter destroyed hapless Semele.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,440
And as for pepper spraying unruly crowds,

117
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:43,240
that simply stands as symbolic mention of Bob's incredible power of peppery pacification,

118
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,480
that by agitating, he can still do it.

119
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,660
And that will cause the crowds to sit up and listen,

120
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,800
even as you, my friends, are doing now.

121
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,520
Oh, we just got another one, so I guess we're not through yet.

122
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,240
Oh, this is another one I bet you've gotten some variation on before.

123
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,880
Oh, it's always some wag has to ask something like this.

124
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,440
God bless those wags.

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,480
Are you going to say no to this question?

126
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,480


127
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,240
Are you going to say no to this question?

128
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,760
Mm-mm, Dr. Howell?

129
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,980
Well, I shall say no to the question,

130
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:33,980
but only in a fashion divorced of the meaning of the word no as written here.

131
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,800
Instead, I would spell it a different way and say no.

132
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,060
Actively attempt to know.

133
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,940
As I actively attempt to know this question,

134
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,080
even in the snarkiest, snippiest, wise guy question,

135
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,200
there is usually, for one thing, as there is clearly here,

136
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,580
the answer, not hardly concealed.

137
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,100
Thus, my job really isn't very hard at all.

138
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,380
You simply look in the second line, and there's the answer to this question.

139
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,240
And so I say, this question, now that I have attempted to know it,

140
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,580
I have essentially said no to.

141
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,920
So the answer, of course, is yes.

142
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,540
Praise Bob.

143
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,240
Nyes!

144
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,280
Answer nyes!

145
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,400
Nyes to all the problems of life.

146
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,640
And to the questions you have, such as what happens for the rest of this festival

147
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,800
since we don't appear to be on board the escape vessels.

148
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,660
Well, there's plenty of great fun coming up, isn't there?

149
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,020
Yes, we can drown our fun at the beer tasting,

150
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,900
which I love.

151
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,420
I suppose if you aren't contributing, you could probably beg.

152
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,440
You can beg from Princess Wee and me.

153
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,260
You can beg for beer at X Day.

154
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,800
Yeah, you better beg good though, boy.

155
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,180
What else?

156
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,960
Well, we've got, and I'm not, where is the beer tasting?

157
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,520
And frock beating?

158
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,500
I think it's mostly liquid.

159
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,220
Oh, I see.

160
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,220


161
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,160
I'm not sure what materials we're talking about.

162
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,780
Traditionally, it's been at the Cui-Gi-Bo camp.

163
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,300
I think that's where it is again.

164
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,500
I haven't been there yet myself.

165
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,700
It is.

166
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,180
But it's down that away.

167
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,200
Gaudy, well-illuminated camp that can be seen from a great distance away.

168
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,620
Wisely placed near the four flushers.

169
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,620
Yes, every ease can be taken.

170
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,380
And also near the round house, which is that big structure made of mastodon ribs in the

171
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,800
middle of the campground down the road there.

172
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:53,680
I hope that some professional pagans show up for the weekend and do their drumming and

173
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,140
fire starting and stuff.

174
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,200
Those are things subgeniuses have not mastered.

175
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,260
This morning I was asked about the date of the baptism.

176
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,540
That is listed in the schedule for one o'clock on Saturday.

177
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
That's morning for a subgenius.

178
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,220
Everything starts at one o'clock.

179
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,560
It's listed as the water baptism.

180
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:14,780
Oh, that's right.

181
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:14,780


182
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:22,340
And also I had heard tell of slip and slide and other dangerous water sport oriented things.

183
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,420
You can throw your hip out.

184
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:24,960
Yeah.

185
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,140
People with unthrowable hips and so forth should definitely.

186
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,260
You could poke your eye out.

187
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,900
Yeah.

188
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,180
I've actually had my eye poked out and my hip thrown out.

189
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,580
You think it couldn't happen.

190
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,440
Yeah.

191
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,740
Man, my brother shot me with a BB gun.

192
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:40,880
Yeah.

193
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,080
Yeah.

194
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,400
So friends.

195
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,560
But the greatest thing on the schedule is completely unknown.

196
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,860
The fact that it's a mystery.

197
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,400
In fact, there were two bands that were supposed to play tonight and I think Bonobo Convergence

198
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:01,320
will be landing here, but possibly not in time to do much, but sort of jam.

199
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,980
So I think it's going to be a jam up here tonight.

200
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:11,280
When it gets dark, I can project something I've been wanting to show for a while.

201
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,580
I accidentally.

202
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,240
Videotape.

203
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,480
Yes.

204
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,880
A UFO flying over this campground last year.

205
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,920
That's about seven 20 on July 5th.

206
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,860
We didn't see it at the time and I didn't look at the footage until two weeks ago, but

207
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,460
I can't wait to show it to everybody.

208
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,940
It's not real, real clear, but it's definitely weird.

209
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,040
It's it's a, I don't want to build your hips.

210
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:40,200
You're not going to see like a flying saucer, but it's like a weird light that zips past

211
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,840
some trees.

212
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,300
While Susan.

213
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:42,560
I don't know.

214
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,560


215
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,560


216
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,560


217
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,560


218
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,560


219
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,560


220
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,560


221
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,560


222
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,560


223
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,560


224
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,560


225
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,080
She is bitching about there not being any.

226
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,160
UFOs and it's right behind her head.

227
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,600
Yeah.

228
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,760
So we'll show when it gets dark enough for the, for it to show up properly.

229
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:00,720
This artwork, by the way, is all from all stuff that was posted to all dot binary slack

230
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,920
over the last year and most of it is by Fernanda.

231
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,580
Nanday.

232
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,140
Lee.

233
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,560
Murr, the only subgenius cool enough to call himself Mister instead of Reverend or post.

234
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:12,560


235
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,480
or saint or anything.

236
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,140
Mr. Fernando Nanny Lemur,

237
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,660
the great invager,

238
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,440
and the great heart ignition.

239
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,560
And there's a whole bunch of other people's work

240
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,440
thrown in there too,

241
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,300
but those guys way outnumber everybody else.

242
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,400
And compulsive,

243
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,900
the obsessive compulsive disorder

244
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,280
of Dobbsheadism.

245
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,780
So friends,

246
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,040
we forge on ahead

247
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,620
through the X day,

248
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,560
which is just beginning.

249
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,500
Yes, Bob has once again

250
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,920
taught us the lesson

251
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,860
that we don't know shit.

252
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,660
And he could show up

253
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,760
at any minute, the X's.

254
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,000
The rupture could be in the next 30 seconds.

255
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,080
Are you ready?

256
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,880
You have that membership card in your pocket.

257
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,440
You have that Dobbshead

258
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,080
ingrained in your mind.

259
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,980
Is your heart

260
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,920
focused on J.R. Bob Dobbs,

261
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,260
my friends? Yes!

262
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,960
That is all that counts!

263
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,500
Bob is the one!

264
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,720
Praise Bob!

265
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,880
Praise Bob!

266
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,920
Praise Bob!

267
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,920
Oh lordy, lordy, lordy.

268
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,940
It's all too wonderful.

269
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,740
And praise the great movie composers.

270
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,300
Praise them, dear friends.

271
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,980
And praise Dr. Howell.

272
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,520
And ask Dr. Howell

273
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,560
from live on Hour of Slack

274
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,420
from the stage at 10X day.

275
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,340
And to see that video

276
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,420
of the UFO over Brushwood

277
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,880
in 2006 on Google Video,

278
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,700
go to video.com.

279
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,560
video.google.com

280
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,440
and search for

281
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,100
UFO sighting

282
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,580
at subgeniusxday.

283
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,300
Friends, this is

284
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,920
subgenius hour of Slack

285
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,200
number 1112.

286
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,600
This particular injection

287
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,960
is for Reverend Magdalene

288
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,700
and her child custody case

289
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,160
which was discussed

290
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,880
at Starwood 27 and at 10X day.

291
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,020
In fact, one of the decisions

292
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,960
was handed down by the court

293
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,700
during a live X day.

294
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,860
Hour of Slack.

295
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
And you'll hear that.

296
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,500
You'll also hear

297
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,040
Dr. Leemur

298
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,880
and Reverend Susan Flusy

299
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,720
who brought us this show's openings

300
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,360
and Bonobo's Convergence

301
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,980
who did the background music

302
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
heard right now live at X day.

303
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,760
But now, the news.

304
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,440
This is PR.

305
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,820
PR comes from select theaters.

306
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,580
PR now.

307
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,340
PR news.

308
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:37,820
PR news.

309
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,260
PR.

310
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:38,560
PR.

311
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,520
From PR.

312
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,260
PR news in Washington,

313
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,040
I'm quickly wrestled to the ground

314
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,140
by security officers.

315
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,820
Can proceed as if nothing had happened.

316
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,560
Defense Secretary Robert Gates

317
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,880
said he could disrupt shipping

318
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,040
through the Arabian Gulf

319
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,400
despite an alert issued by health officials

320
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,340
on Wall Street 755-253.

321
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,320
The Labor Department

322
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,340
reported today that this is PR news.

323
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,180
New French Prime Minister

324
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,960
Tony Blair tried to jump

325
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,760
into Pope Benedict's Popemobile

326
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,680
to commemorate the 63rd

327
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,240
anniversary of PR news in Washington.

328
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,760
And suddenly I'm getting really serious here.

329
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,060
My employee, Jesus,

330
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,040
also known as Steve Bevilacqua,

331
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,020
he used to run the teen activities here.

332
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,040
It's like a fox watching my hen house.

333
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,060
He met a beautiful young lady at X day,

334
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,460
our festival that's a couple of weeks before Starwood.

335
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,080
In 1997, he met this girl, Rachel.

336
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,440
And in 1998, he married her right on this stage.

337
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
She already had a child though.

338
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,980
At that point, she became known as Magdalene.

339
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,760
Now, many of you have heard about Rachel Bevilacqua

340
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,120
or Magdalene having lost her custody of her child

341
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,220
to a guy, should I talk out of school or what?

342
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,460
This guy, nothing wrong with being an unemployed person

343
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,820
living in a trailer court because you've got,

344
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,160
what is it, chronic fatigue syndrome.

345
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,720
Man, I wish I had that.

346
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,700
This guy's been a lot of fun.

347
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:10,700


348
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:10,700


349
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,580
He's been a this whole life.

350
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,280
He's had pulled a on a .

351
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,880
He's just a jerk.

352
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:22,780
And yet, the mom, Rachel, is married to a guy with a good job.

353
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,240
She works as a legal something.

354
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,220
She's got a degree in English literature and so forth.

355
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,280
But she wasn't a fit mother because in her house,

356
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,840
they have pictures of Bob Dobbs.

357
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,620
And this New York judge, Judge Punt,

358
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:47,340
decided that between that guy and the woman who

359
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,300
works for Church of the Subgenius,

360
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,960
she's an unfit mother.

361
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,120
And this case was dragged out for well over a year.

362
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,980
And most of the time, this guy had the kid.

363
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,540
Finally, it made the news to such an extent.

364
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,120
And the judge, finally, after reading numerous newspapers

365
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,680
and websites about what the incredible, dumbass,

366
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:10,680


367
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,920
he was, to think Church of the Subgenius was a devil cult.

368
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,300
That's like arresting somebody for having

369
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,200
a picture of Alfred E. Newman.

370
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,220
If you're a mad fan or if you've ever

371
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,420
taken your shirt off in front of anybody,

372
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,360
including your own kids, then this judge in New York State

373
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,540
will take your child away from you.

374
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,520
Because you might have had fun at some point.

375
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,400
I guess strippers should all have their kids taken away,

376
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,660
too.

377
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,400
I don't know.

378
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,600
The whole thing was ridiculous.

379
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,060
And yet, by 10x day, Magdalene ended up

380
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,120
waiting for a four-judge appellate court panel

381
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,080
to decide her son's fate.

382
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,300
By that time, of course, she wasn't

383
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,660
the only one waiting to hear.

384
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,000
The whole x-day audience was awaiting the decision

385
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,600
during Ask Dr. Howell.

386
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,980
Now, there's also some serious suspenseful stuff going on.

387
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:15,200
I wish I didn't have, I wish it wasn't, but Magdalene's decision was supposed to happen

388
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,000
half an hour ago, according to my human clock.

389
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,420
And we don't know.

390
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,760
It was, and get this, I mean, this is just somebody finding out the fate of her child

391
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,700
for the next several weeks.

392
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,900
It could be delayed.

393
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,640
But you don't go to the court and the courthouse and have the judge tell you.

394
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,760
You look it up.

395
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,880
You look it up online, the fate of your child.

396
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,320
That's progress.

397
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:50,180
So I trust that at this point, she's probably checking the website and hitting refresh,

398
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:57,780
trying not to be terrified, you know, and have her stomach in knots, although I'm sure

399
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,980
it must be tough.

400
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,560
So our thoughts are with her.

401
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,480
They are.

402
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:06,900
Yeah.

403
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,980
And our suspense.

404
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,520
I wish I could say that was a big subgenius put on, but it ain't.

405
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,340
I used to worry about that happening to me and my family.

406
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,160
My wife was a schoolteacher, elementary schoolteacher.

407
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,760
That could have looked bad.

408
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,160
Yes, and you were far more culpable.

409
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,860
Yeah, way more.

410
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,780
She, Magdalene and Jesus really were just employees of Subgenius Foundation.

411
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,180
Yes, but in your case.

412
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,380
And the Son of God also.

413
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,740
But that's just.

414
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,880
It's just a coincidence that they went .

415
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,960
The Son of Man also.

416
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:40,920
Yeah.

417
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,600
Yeah, I know his dad too.

418
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,700
Joe, believe it or not.

419
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,520
So, anyway.

420
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,800
As in the book of Joe.

421
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,520
Yeah.

422
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,660
I've read some great books lately.

423
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,840
Oh, you have?

424
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,140
Yeah, there was a book about lost socks.

425
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,340
What happens to your other sock.

426
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,800
Oh, well, thank you.

427
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,200
By some mad scientist.

428
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,400
I forget his name.

429
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,320
Dr. Perditas Pedal, MD.

430
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,300
Yeah.

431
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:06,820
Yeah.

432
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:06,840
Yeah.

433
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,020
You can actually find this scientific book.

434
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,540
It's the kookiest kook book I've ever seen in my life.

435
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,840
This guy totally seriously goes into the mystery of what happens to lost socks.

436
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,860
That single other sock.

437
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,700
He's not concerned with pairs of socks.

438
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,060
Well, mismatched.

439
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,320
That's what I'm wondering.

440
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,620
Mismatched, right.

441
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,340
The full title is The Meaning of Lost and Mismatched Socks.

442
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:36,240
Friends, you know, as it's said somewhere in the scriptures.

443
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,800
Yeah.

444
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,100
Yeah.

445
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,040
The true visionary can see the future in the bottoms of wine bottles and in comic books.

446
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,940
It's just like reading tea leaves, only it's actually a lot easier to read than that.

447
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,660
Yeah.

448
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,340
We go for the easy reading version.

449
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,260
Yeah.

450
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:56,100
Actually, we were going to do a normal version of the pamphlet.

451
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,020
It was going to be the pamphlet in normal.

452
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:04,880
It would basically be pictures and very short sentences in big print.

453
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,540
This is Bob.

454
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:06,800
Bob.

455
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,960
But do you want money, a fast car, pretty girls?

456
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,560
Bob can help you.

457
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,940
Don't you hate your boss?

458
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,520
Picture of a devil boss kind of hitting a guy.

459
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:22,960
Yeah.

460
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,940
And so forth.

461
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,000
It would be about eight pages long and at the end it would tell him to send $40 to Bob.

462
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,480
People have been asking when we're going to raise the price.

463
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,140
I think that would be the way to do it on the normal pamphlet.

464
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:42,180
Well, you missed the opportunity to raise it to $33 by 10X day.

465
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,400
Well, we have intelligence from Modemac now.

466
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,620
Oh, my God.

467
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,620
Oh, Magdalene says they awarded custody to the father.

468
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,340
Did you talk to her?

469
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,560
Okay.

470
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,960
Okay.

471
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,340
Okay.

472
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,660
So, the decision came out online on the website for the Appellate Court.

473
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,920
That's the appeals court.

474
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,340
And the panel has decided that custody should be awarded to the father.

475
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:29,980
They are sending this case back to family court to determine a visitation schedule for Magdalene.

476
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,320
And, well, beyond that, I think it's a good time to say that we're going to be making a decision.

477
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,320


478
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,400
I don't think she's even had a chance to speak with her lawyer yet.

479
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,220
So, this is all we know at this point.

480
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:49,000
We cannot even say what the final decision is until the lawyer approves it.

481
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,140
But this is definitely what it sounds like.

482
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,360
I'm sorry.

483
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,720
It says humor on the back of that book.

484
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,980
Yeah, I know.

485
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,860
Judge Punch claimed there was nothing funny in the book.

486
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,520
Okay.

487
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,240
I'm sorry.

488
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,240


489
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,120
Not now there isn't.

490
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,920
I'm shocked, actually.

491
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,720
I'm amazed that they would do that.

492
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:23,540
We haven't, we've heard of something like this happened to another young mom about ten years ago,

493
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,320
and we didn't hear about it until very recently.

494
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,380
Not another subgenius related thing?

495
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:29,680
Yeah.

496
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,040
Yeah.

497
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,500
It was a situation where a subgenius was brought up in court and made to look like some really bad,

498
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,000
bad thing.

499
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,340
Ten years ago?

500
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,460
It is a bad thing, but not that way.

501
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,580
It's just bad jokes.

502
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:43,840
Damn.

503
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:54,800
I guess those people on the other side of the world aren't the only religious nuts you have to worry about, huh?

504
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,240
Yes, you have to worry about all religions.

505
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,820
Yeah, the war on terror just came home.

506
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:11,520
Well, wherever you have religion, you have a lack of education about important topics.

507
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,200
Now we're going to need money.

508
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:23,440
Magdalene's lawyer, by the way, as far as I knew, he brags that he's never lost a case,

509
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
and he specializes in this kind of thing.

510
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:34,200
In fact, this law firm defended Marilyn Manson in some sort of freedom of speech type issue,

511
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,340
and won, and they've had a history of that kind of thing.

512
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,860
They're getting paid, though.

513
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,280
They aren't doing it for free.

514
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,080
And the last I heard, her legal bill was 75 grand.

515
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:54,440
They don't have to have that all at once, but a few months ago, the lawyer said,

516
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,400
I really need 10 grand now, and they were tapped.

517
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:04,180
Jesus works a 9 to 5 job in England, which is why he's not here.

518
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:09,240
And hasn't been able to see this kid in all this time, hardly at all.

519
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,940
And her parents were strapped out.

520
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,920
They'd maxed out their credit cards, and they're not a rich family.

521
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:21,500
But we managed to raise 4,000 bucks for her during the last emergency like that,

522
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,220
just on the online thing.

523
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,760
God, I hate to have to keep doing that.

524
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,880
It's so ironic, because when I get home,

525
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,160
if the law firm says, I'm going to pay you, I'm going to pay you, I'm going to pay you,

526
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,300
this news will go to a boing, boing website, which a lot of people read.

527
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:45,600
And I'll probably have a booming amount of orders for subgenius memberships.

528
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,860
Whenever something terrible happens to Magdalene's family, it makes the news.

529
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,260
And a bunch of people go, oh, yeah, Bob.

530
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,100
Well, yeah, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

531
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,920
I didn't have $30 10 years ago, but now I do.

532
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,100
It's over life.

533
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,460
I wish there was a better way for us to get PR

534
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,060
than have somebody's life just put on totally on hold.

535
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,560
That's what it's like.

536
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,760
It's like they don't know anything,

537
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,440
because there's always these endless expensive appeals you can do.

538
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:26,420
But in the meantime, the only people who are getting anything out of it are lawyers.

539
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,740
Yes, they're bleeding them dry, the lawyers are.

540
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,080
But it's just the way it is.

541
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,180
And they're just dragged out so long.

542
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,880
And this kid is, you know, he was 10 years old or nine when it started.

543
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,780
Seriously, they got along for nine years.

544
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,860
The kid was traded back and forth, and it was not a problem.

545
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,440
But then as far as we can tell, what happened was the father's family got vengeful

546
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,260
and just wanted to screw the Bevilacquas, which it was easy for them to do,

547
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,120
because they get free.

548
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,440
They're destitute.

549
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,140
So they get free legal.

550
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:09,200
The Bevilacquas, meanwhile, because they're working three jobs between the two of them,

551
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,560
have to pay for lawyers, expensive lawyers.

552
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,800
And they'll be paying for years, too.

553
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,220
And they're such nice folks.

554
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,840
A nightmare being mocked in the court, too, by the judge.

555
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,520
This little kid is such a sweet kid.

556
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,920
She said to him something like, you know that there's no devil stuff,

557
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,420
and we don't even believe in the devil.

558
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,620
That's all, you know, just, it's all silly joking, play acting.

559
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:40,180
And the kid goes, well, some people, this is after staying with his dad for a long time,

560
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,260
well, some people don't feel that way.

561
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,840
Yeah, that's for sure.

562
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,440
Unfortunately, there are people in power.

563
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,020
I thought the mom was always automatically, they always biased it for the mom.

564
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:00,420
That's another curious thing about this case, that why do they continue giving it to the kids?

565
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,460
Because they're not giving it to a child, to an unemployed person who lives in a trailer.

566
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,700
Right, doesn't make any sense.

567
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:12,240
And not to a couple who are, you know, both making money and provide a stable home.

568
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,620
Yeah, they've got degrees.

569
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,440
Maybe it's anti-intellectualism.

570
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,500
Maybe they're trying to show the fancy folk up or something like that.

571
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,880
Well, you know, I think there's some of that.

572
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,740
It's not so much the Bob thing.

573
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,420
It's almost like a class thing.

574
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:36,060
And plus, you know, broken homes, it can be unbelievably nasty.

575
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,960
Tear you up more than anything in the world.

576
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,860
That's why we...

577
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,280
It's rough being a primate.

578
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,240
That's true.

579
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,240
We know the joys as well as the sorrows of our simian birthright.

580
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,300
Damn.

581
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:56,900
.

582
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:03,060
Two weeks later, not only were we getting calls from the likes of the Dr. Phil show,

583
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,900
but the case had again changed, this time in her favor,

584
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,180
as is somewhat explained at the Starwood Festival.

585
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,840
Two weeks ago, you know, they never really believed in a conspiracy of fundamentalist Christians

586
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,600
because they're not paranoid people.

587
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,660
They're nice people.

588
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,940
But when four judges unanimously decided that the

589
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,720
should get the kids,

590
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,420
who is he's a good Christian, understand.

591
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,000
He was a church-going person.

592
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,520
He'd .

593
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,620
But, you know, you know how it is.

594
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,300
You've heard the old, the jokes, I'm sure.

595
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,520
Anyway, all four of these judges decided to give him full custody.

596
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,840
And we were shocked.

597
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,940
Everybody was shocked.

598
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,200
I can't say too much about it, though.

599
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,060
But just since then, everything sort of turned around

600
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,640
because it turned out the dad, unbeknownst to those four judges,

601
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,820
had just done his third .

602
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,460
And it was on a school day.

603
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,000
So, I don't know how it's all going to end up,

604
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,500
but there's another hearing in August.

605
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,460
And three days ago, the whole family,

606
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,380
or all three of the Bevilacquas were together

607
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,020
for at least until this hearing happens.

608
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,660
And it sounds like, as disgusted as the judges are,

609
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,940
with old pipe-faced Bob Dobbs and those evil subgeniuses

610
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,420
with their takeoffs on Mel Gibson,

611
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:27,720
and the

612
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:27,840
Gibson movies,

613
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,020
that it may be even as evil as we are,

614
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,980
that the kid might end up getting to stay with his mom.

615
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,480
So, good news.

616
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,200
Subgeniuses try not to pray

617
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,740
because, you know, we never know who also might be listening in.

618
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,780
Then they know what scares you.

619
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,720
But any good vibes you might want to send that way.

620
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,160
You know, that kind of crap is supposed to happen in redneck Texas,

621
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
not sophisticated New York.

622
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:04,620
And yet, I raised two kids while running this evil devil cult,

623
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,400
and my ex-wife was a schoolteacher the whole time.

624
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,760
Well, this is what you say.

625
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,980
Officer, Your Honor, have you ever heard of Mad Magazine?

626
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,840
That's the only way they can understand it, friends.

627
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,420
Hello, you're on the air.

628
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,500
Good evening, Stan.

629
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,580
Just in time, I heard you say you had another caller,

630
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,620
and I forgot that I was even calling in.

631
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,100
The phone was sitting next to me.

632
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,760
Yeah.

633
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,020
So...

634
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,080
Turn my radio off.

635
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,120
Turn my radio off.

636
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,620
Turn my radio off.

637
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,900
Oh, and here, now we do have a fourth caller.

638
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,660
Hello, you're on the air.

639
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:43,900
Dick.

640
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,380
Yeah, you're an idiot.

641
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,060
It's an OBS 3545.

642
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,780
What, an idiot called your show?

643
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,700
Go figure.

644
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,220
Who'd have thunk it?

645
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,700
Who'd have thunk it?

646
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,020
That was probably one of the judges from Magdalene's trial.

647
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,220
You know, honestly, so what kind of appellate court was this

648
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,220
that handed down this decision that permanently took away the child from Mags?

649
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,840
Like, what was the...

650
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,060
It was the New York Fourth Appellate Court.

651
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,700
New York Fourth Appellate Court.

652
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,440
Did these judges actually go to law school?

653
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,740
I don't know. Presumably.

654
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,320
Because I don't know if Judge punched it or not,

655
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,000
but I know in New York State, like, you know, you usually have, like,

656
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,200
justices who are in charge of the court.

657
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,260
You don't have to be a justice of the peace handling everyday court matters.

658
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,740
Like, I think Judge Punch is technically a justice of the peace.

659
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,060
You don't have to be a lawyer to do that job.

660
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,580
You know, even...

661
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,300
And, you know, they often...

662
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,540
They often ignore conflicts of interest and go ahead and, you know,

663
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,880
preside over cases that involve neighbors and friends and family members.

664
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,140
And, you know, there's been complaints about that in New York State for a long time.

665
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,180
And, you know, frankly, I'm wondering when the test case is going to happen

666
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,220
where somebody tries to sue the State of New York

667
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,120
for violating their civil rights, basically, by not giving them due process.

668
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,540
Wow, that would certainly bring attention to the Church of the Subgenius

669
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,300
if that were done in this particular case.

670
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,240
I mean...

671
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,260
I don't know if this would be a good one to try that with.

672
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,340
Yeah, I don't know any of the details about this ruling,

673
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,000
what their rationale was,

674
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,380
and I don't know what the qualifications of the judges were either in this case.

675
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,940
But, I mean, you know, if...

676
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,160
You know, when people's lives get ruined by us,

677
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,220
underqualified judges hearing cases like this...

678
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,700
Well, in any case, let's take another caller here.

679
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,560
Hello, you're on the air.

680
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,920
Hello, you're on the air.

681
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,200
It's Dr. Drummond!

682
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,740
I'd recognize that cough anywhere!

683
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,520
You okay?

684
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,380
Alright.

685
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:44,740
No.

686
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,440
And that was another one of the judges from Magdalene's trial.

687
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,080
Yeah.

688
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,800
No.

689
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,600
Their denial of service attacks.

690
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,120
Oh my God.

691
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:52,360
Great job working.

692
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,980
The Judge says he wants to REP...

693
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,700
The Judge says he wants to REP...

694
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,900
He wants to REP...

695
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,580
He wants to REP...

696
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,320
The Judge says he wants to REP...

697
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,700
He wants to REP...

698
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,760
He wants to REP...

699
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,440
The Judge says he wants to REP...

700
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,200
He wants to REP...

701
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,320
the judge says he wants to rap

702
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,060
the judge says he wants to rap

703
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,120

00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:56,540
Up by Norrell Preff of Norrellpreff.com

705
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,280
at now five-fisted Tales of Connie

706
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,000
with the Reverend Carter LeBlanc on the bullhorn at 10x day.

707
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,780
When they came from the turkeys

708
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,480
When they came from the star wars geeks

709
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,020
I did not stand up

710
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,220
for that not a star wars geek

711
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,800
When they came

712
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,860
for the dungeons and dragons players

713
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,900
I did not stand up

714
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,420
for I was not a dungeons and dragons player

715
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,760
When they came

716
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,400
for World at Warcraft

717
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,000
I did not stand up

718
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,980
because I do not play World at Warcraft

719
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,780
When they came

720
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,500
for the aliens

721
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,280
I did not stand up

722
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,400
for I am not a alien

723
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,200
When they came

724
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,740
for the scientologists

725
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,040
I did not stand up

726
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,000
for I am not a scientist

727
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,180
when they came for the alien

728
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,280
When they came for the alien

729
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,120
I did not stand up

730
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,040
for I am not a alien

731
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,600
when they came for A Syn platform

732
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,560
I did not stand up

733
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,280
when they came for e a

734
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,320
conscious

735
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,840
I did not stand up

736
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,560
when they came for used car dealers

737
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:54,100
I did not stand up when they came for air conditioning repairmen.

738
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,240
I did not stand up when they came for corners.

739
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,340
I did not stand up when they came for pizza delivery boys.

740
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:13,180
I did not stand up when they came for coal heaters.

741
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,280
When they came for Ivan's steak.

742
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:23,540
I did not stand up when they came for George Bush.

743
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,480
I did not stand up when they came for Dick Cheney.

744
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:35,200
I did not stand up when they came for Arthur C. Clarke.

745
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:41,480
I did not stand up when they came for David H.

746
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,200
Who were they coming for?

747
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,860
I wasn't going to stand up. It doesn't matter.

748
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,320
But when they came for the subgeniuses, I stood up.

749
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,380
Because fuck everybody else.

750
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,860
And my friend, if you would like to help Reverend Magdalene financially with her legal bills,

751
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:11,740
you can do so if you go to subgenius.com and click on the link for news.

752
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,720
You'll find what you need.

753
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,720
Thank you.

754
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:27,100
Oh, I noticed somebody told me that they had studied under some kind of school of something.

755
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,900
Some fancy name school of something.

756
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,540
And they could raise their body temperature and make their body...

757
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:39,860
Oh, he's talking about yogis that could sit in the snow and you just see the steam rise off of them.

758
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,600
They could melt ice by putting their hand on it.

759
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,240
Friends, I know how to do that too.

760
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,140
And I didn't study.

761
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,500
Well, I flunked a lot of those mystery schools.

762
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,280
And I read the Cliff Notes.

763
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,480
I skipped through Manly P. Hall's Secret Teachings of All Ages.

764
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,080
That's all you need to start your own cult, by the way, is that one book.

765
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,620
But here's my secret.

766
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,380
You can really make yourself hot.

767
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,760
Just think of all the stupid things you ever did.

768
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,640
Think of every time you were a jerk.

769
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,260
Think of every time you were a jerk.

770
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,260


771
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,480
Think of every time you said something you didn't really mean.

772
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,960
Or bullied somebody just because you could.

773
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:26,120
Every time that you've said something snotty about somebody and then they happen to be right behind you.

774
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,180
Man, your body will heat up to 180 degrees.

775
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:37,020
And those of you young people who think it won't catch up with you, it will.

776
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,760
All your crimes that you forget now will come back to you when you're laying in bed at night when you're 50

777
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
and really need to get up in the morning.

778
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,600
That's my mystic wisdom for you.

779
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,780
Same thing Kurt Vonnegut used to say.

780
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,900
Be nice.

781
00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:00,140
The problem with that, of course, is, well, yeah, first we must destroy all the un-nicers.

782
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,540
You know, there just seems to be no answer to it.

783
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:14,140
We're always looking for people who can, you know, it's like there's all these gurus running around going,

784
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,980
you're programmed.

785
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,320
You're a robot.

786
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,240
Break free of your programming.

787
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:27,500
I figured out not too long ago that I was one of the robots that I was programmed to stand in front of the other robots

788
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,000
and go, you're a robot.

789
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,760
You're programmed.

790
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,480
Break free of your programming.

791
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,920
This is a recording.

792
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,880
Break free of the matrix after this important message.

793
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,120
Aye yi yi.

794
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,300
Stand by for Bob.

795
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,420
I'm Joe.

796
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,700
Hi.

797
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,020
You're in Los Angeles.

798
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,080
Expect me to do it at least once a week.

799
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:57,480
Jack.

800
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,020
Sounds like one of those crackpots to me.

801
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,760
Let's hope so.

802
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,900
It makes the trip more interesting.

803
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,080
Do close, close, close, close, close for comfort.

804
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,280
He was the ugliest man I'd ever seen.

805
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,140
Besides normally twisted features,

806
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,640
He had a ragged scar running from the corner of his mouth to his right ear.

807
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,180
What's it all about? What's it all about?

808
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,540
So I better begin at the beginning.

809
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,660
I'm a very ugly man.

810
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,520
Oh, this is exciting.

811
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,200
Oh, come in, Bob.

812
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:34,960
Oh, come in, Bob.

813
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,120
This is my brother, Bob.

814
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,180
Oh, how do you do, Bob? How do you do?

815
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,660
Is this the man you've been telling me about?

816
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,460
Yes. I've been urging him to come and see me for a week.

817
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,660
And Bob didn't intend to be rude.

818
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,240
Well, Bob has been taking care of me.

819
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,360
How about a little kiss?

820
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,140
Nuts.

821
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,660
Bob! Hey, Bob!

822
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,020
Why are you pointing that gun at me, Bob?

823
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,740
Hey, who's that?

824
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,060
How should I know? I know.

825
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,180
That's what fits you.

826
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,080
I was so confused and disillusioned.

827
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,000
My name ain't Ray. It's Bob.

828
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,060
Before that was Joe. Before that was Charlie.

829
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,140
Stop it, Ray. Stop it.

830
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,180
Shut up, you little tramp. Tramp.

831
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,820
Well, listen to that, will you?

832
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,780
I'm not altogether a fool, Bob.

833
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,080
Coming in the rear. Coming in the rear. Coming in the rear.

834
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,260
Let him have it. Let him have it. Let him have it. Let him have it.

835
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,080
What? What? What? What?

836
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,500
What? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.

837
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,660
Bob's bullet caught a squirreler between the eyes, killing her instantly.

838
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,380
It's probably just as well.

839
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,800
Her fate would have been the gas chamber.

840
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,060
As it will be the fate of Bob.

841
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:45,940
Her alleged brother.

842
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,080
Fate of Bob.

843
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,200
Bill Meggs was on Bob like a leech the second after he pulled the trigger.

844
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,240
Fate of Bob.

845
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,960
Ha ha ha ha ha!

846
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,320
Fate of Bob by Norel Preff.

847
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,500
And friends, this is hour of slack number 1112.

humans

854
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,340

855
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,380
if i was smarter i would be

quicker to drive them down into the ground into the dirt into the sky like my mother taught me

857
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,000

00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,260
and they look like humans to me

866
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:57,820

While they sell our souls for us
