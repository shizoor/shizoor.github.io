1
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,480
The path to evolution is now in space, as much as on Earth.

2
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:36,300
Man has shown that as a species, mankind was willing to commit itself to living in environments

3
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,080
that were completely different than those in which the species evolved.

4
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:48,260
We put a shield of life around ourselves in order to protect the life within, but the

5
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,600
willingness to go out there is there.

6
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,200
We've shown that.

7
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,380
The curve of human evolution has been bent.

8
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,460
The curve of human evolution has been bent.

9
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,960
The curve of human evolution has been bent.

10
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,000
The curve of human evolution has been bent.

11
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,000
Were there astronauts dragging people with them back?

12
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,540
I've been dragging more people with me.

13
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,300
That's the problem.

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,680
I'm not content to just myself to go.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,920
I'm insisting that anybody who hears the voice of the sand-

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,520
Must not necessarily be-

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,340
Yes.

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,020
Yes.

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,060
Where are the launching pads?

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,360
In your own backyard, right next to the concussion stand.

21
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,500
So if you're hearing the voice of the sand, you should be booking that flight down to...

22
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,060
Go ye to the launching pad.

23
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:37,480
Yes.

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,840
Standing on the surface of the moon.

25
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,500
Now atomic power is driving me into space, back to the Earth where it all began.

26
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,640
We're here. We're here, and that's it.

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,640
And that's it. We're here right now, and we don't want to be the...

28
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,280
We're not waiting for any aliens to come pick us up.

29
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,380
We're going to be the aliens. We're going to build our own ships.

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,480
We're heading out. We're taking off.

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,060
And everybody else is going to be freaking out about the millennium, you know.

32
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,160
Create your own reality.

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,180
So they're going to be creating some, you know, around some number that means nothing.

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,700
I'm going back to the old analog spaceship.

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,600
We're going to be firing up those ring modulators and those envelopes and those oscillators.

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,120
And we're going to be firing all that electrical kind of crap up there.

37
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,220
Yeah. We're going to be mixing up those zeros and ones.

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,700
No.

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,680
We're going to be setting the controls.

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,360
Yeah, the heart of the sun.

41
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,660
You know the sun is like a big speaker cabinet?

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,960
Did you know that?

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,560
We just found that out.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,320
That's something else we just found out in the last couple of decades.

45
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:49,620
The sun is resonating with a pitch, a sound that is infinitely complex.

46
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,960
But if you could hear it, you'd probably have to go into the sun to actually hear it.

47
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,260
Because if you're in space, you know, in space the earth is quiet and small.

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,660
Before, you spoke of finding an answer on the moon.

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,100
And then you didn't say any more.

50
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:20,380
In space the sun is resonating with a pitch, a sound that is infinitely complex.

51
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,640
Sam Myles garde to Newsee ...

52
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,200
78 to go, 50 to go, 20 to go.

53
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,020
Stand by Tom.

54
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,280
cause they say the sun is so far from being in the.

55
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,580
Beautiful.

56
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,460
sleeves into the air.

57
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:34,460


58
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,760
barber is having safety checks when you stop by the sia shower.

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,320
Do you have the morning again or is it before the sunrise, a clean chucklics and glasses a

60
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,320


61
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,400
Are you eb кого, man?

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,580
I need a minute, stop I have a nymph.

63
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,900
Every PI and all the sun should be on air.

64
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,580
If you could make a papy comedy out of this son.

65
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:49,880
If you had that, uh, Cr Cheryl, you the same thing.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,360
Well, I can make you some coffee.

67
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,360


68
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,360


69
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,360


70
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,360


71
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,700
Oh, there he is.

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,200
I can see it.

73
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,000
I can see it.

74
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,200
I can see it.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,360
I can see it.

76
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,700
I can see it.

77
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,880
I can see it.

78
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:20,340
I can see it.

79
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,860
I can see it.

80
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,940
I can see it.

81
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,840
I can see it.

82
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,600
I can see it.

83
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,080
I can see it.

84
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,540
Spoke of finding an answer on the moon.

85
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,560
Whoever hears the music one last time, load them up.

86
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,620
We'll be setting the controls.

87
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,120
You better believe it.

88
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,080
I'm going to be a little insane, I think.

89
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,140
That's church to me, baby.

90
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,760
That's church to me.

91
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,080
I'm going to be a little insane, I think.

92
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,400
The craters of the moon, great gigantic craters,

93
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,680
and as we came closer and closer, the look of them was so familiar.

94
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,660
Not because I'd seen them through telescopes and in photographs,

95
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,220
but for some reason that I couldn't quite understand.

96
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,340
Now man's reign is through.

97
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,760
I just got an alert.

98
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,420
An alert.

99
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,720
I'm going to have to run downstairs.

100
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,220
Apparently the conspiracy is trying to break in right now.

101
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,340
I can't. I'm a little man. I'm a little man.

102
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,740
He's a great man.

103
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,920
I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across floors of silent seas.

104
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,400
Just call me Angel of Mali.

105
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,600
Are you really enjoying the ultimate in sausage products?

106
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,500
I'm not feeling very well tonight. I've been so nervous lately.

107
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,400
I think I'm going to have a nervous breakdown.

108
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,260
There I go.

109
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,060
The spooks are going after the subgeniuses.

110
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,220
Yeah, it's just a plain straight up conspiracy job.

111
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,340
As far as I'm concerned, the past few engine searches I've been doing

112
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,600
to check out some of these places and some of these so-called news sources,

113
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,840
you know what I'm saying?

114
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,980
You know what I'm saying?

115
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,960
Some of these so-called news sources, some of these people are not even people,

116
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,420
let alone talk about internet journalism.

117
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,740
So one guy was merely ahead of Meat Puppet,

118
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,740
was not even a real...

119
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,440
It was constructed out of some sort of viscous tissue from a morgue or a coroner's office

120
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,760
or maybe just from down, went down to the old slab house looking for some ribs, you know?

121
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,960
And they constructed this thing and they did a pre-pixel animation of the guy,

122
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,540
stuck him up there and next thing you know, he was a sucking on stank thing.

123
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,140
You know what I mean?

124
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:07,560
Yeah.

125
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,180
He was taking a big vacuum out of his whole car.

126
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,520
Bizarre.

127
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,120
Bizarre.

128
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,500
Bizarre.

129
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,920
Bizarre.

130
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,140
Bizarre.

131
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,940
Stories of the supernatural and the supernormal.

132
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,560
Dramatizing the fantasies and the mysteries of the unknown.

133
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,960
We tell you this frankly.

134
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,460
So if you wish to avoid the excitement and tension of these imaginative plays,

135
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:47,420
we urge you calmly but sincerely to turn off your radio now.

136
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
After your...

137
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:55,480
After your next severe head low, visit the concussion stand for peanuts, water and fresh water.

138
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,360
I'm sorry.

139
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,040
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:57,720
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,340
From orbit here, we can see that smoke and it's covering all the way up to the Great Plains now.

142
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,400
Oh, they're not so great, you know.

143
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,180
It's like when they say, hey, free association doesn't for free.

144
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,020
But they bother me in a lot of ways.

145
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:18,380
And basically, I think the result of his theories,

146
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,180
is that we would have basically pretty much of anarchy in this country.

147
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,020
I wanna be anarchy.

148
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,240
Tell me what you mean, you masters.

149
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:45,360
Surely you simple little men do not think that a new creation has reached the ultimate.

150
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,660
Yeah.

151
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,740
Well, see, that's why they threw Herm out of the...

152
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:48,740


153
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:48,740


154
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,100
The church.

155
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,000
Not just the hermaphroditic thing,

156
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,060
was because of the boo-hoo faith and the rituals going on there.

157
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,960
Yeah, he was talking to me about...

158
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,820
He was telling me what a great thrill it is to hold that much power in your hands.

159
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:08,480
To make a fatal mistake in complaining about what's happening to them.

160
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,340
We've been persecuted.

161
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,520
We've been...

162
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,420
We don't have a voice anymore.

163
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,700
We're becoming the guinea pigs.

164
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,820
It's a conspiracy against us.

165
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,960
Which is the most...

166
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,740
It's the most foolish observation.

167
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,280
I hear the beloved sound of sirens and...

168
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,740
I think they're coming to get me now.

169
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,520
...and heads being whacked by policemen with big truncheons.

170
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,080
This might be a sting.

171
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,500
They might be getting Stang and you and me all at the same time.

172
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,160
Well, I hear a siren also.

173
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,060
And here it has the vaporous sound of the French sirens we use out here in the wooded areas.

174
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,660
Yeah, they're sort of...

175
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,640
...and the sound of the sirens.

176
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,680
...and the sound of the French sirens.

177
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,320
...and the sound of the French sirens.

178
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,340
...and the sound of the French sirens.

179
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,300
...and the sound of the French sirens.

180
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,460
Wait a minute, that's my neighbor's jerks again out in the moonlight.

181
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,360
That guy has an exhibitionist nut.

182
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,560
He's not going with the other.

183
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,820
Are you enjoying a...

184
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,420
He goes after them.

185
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,420
Are you enjoying a nice moonlit night out there in the woods tonight?

186
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,040
Yeah, it's the moon...

187
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,420
It's not anywhere else but here.

188
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,320
And my neighbor who does mechanical work on his monkey, if you want to call it that.

189
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,660
Yeah.

190
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,060
Drags it all around, you know what I mean?

191
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,700
Yeah.

192
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,100
We could even sing that if you don't want to, but I don't care.

193
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,520
I'm looking at a bare naked woman on television so I could care less.

194
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,360
I drag my monkey all around.

195
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,440
I drag my monkey all around.

196
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,300
I drag my monkey.

197
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,320
I drag my monkey.

198
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,360
I drag my monkey.

199
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,360
I drag my monkey.

200
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,020
I drag my monkey all around.

201
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,620
I drag my monkey all around.

202
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,400
I drag my monkey all around.

203
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,640
I drag my monkey all around.

204
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,320
I drag my monkey all around.

205
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,760
I gasps and objections.

206
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,220
I still don't get the idea I could do it all on my own.

207
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,220


208
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,220


209
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,540
The little ehkä-fa- третьеONE La Although you don't like me I don't like pipe

210
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,340
Your fae will not eat you

211
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,140
Really Channel

212
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,220
The kid is still at home...

213
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,060
He's breathing the life out of 여러분들

214
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,860
I have this dangerous

215
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,160
Un不同

216
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,160


217
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,300
You're so quiet that now they're not

218
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,580
between vithra and dawn where the grapes go it's it's you know like dreams of romulus and remus of

219
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:25,300
wolf people but he's still if you hang on there long enough it moves it sways it has like a rhythm

220
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,720
like the ocean but it's air it's not it's particles like your like your light thing maybe

221
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,960
oh it's so uh fragile though i mean it's it's decay time is rather rapid okay well do you

222
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,360
believe that um anybody coming that that new planet that's coming at us could be like maybe

223
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,480
one pissed off guy one very pissed off yeah and he's coming right here on this on the way here

224
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,380
yeah like if you're twice as big as you and you were pissed off that would you could cause a lot

225
00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:06,880
of damage let me fly into the sky i was just wondering if all if the aliens got a cut of any

226
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,940
of those books that all them people write well the guys that put my anal uh probe in there did not

227
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,340
say that they were going to be able to get the aliens to get the aliens to get the aliens to

228
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:12,340


229
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,040
see a penny off them royalties yeah they said they got they were going through the william morris and

230
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,100
the a or more shades here one of them guys that's kind of like the exchange you make sort of like

231
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:28,000
you know uh uh you know old blues you know meet at the crossroads kind of exchange yeah they well

232
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,340
you can't really sell yourself to the devil because the aliens i guess are some kind of devil

233
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,220
or something or something that we aren't i don't know what it is maybe it's the same thing only

234
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,000
backwards did you ever but the deal is we'll put an implant in you for seven years we'll let you

235
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,320
make a lot of money and then we'll sell you a lot of money and then we'll sell you a lot of money

236
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,640
a lot of money on book deals and then we're coming to get you or something i guess there's a big

237
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,420
deposit on them rectal implants and then when they want that money back they mean business have you

238
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,900
ever lived in an apartment where like some of those crazy old landlords are talking funny

239
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,180
languages and stuff will come after they'll call the police yeah i had to work he claimed to be

240
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,620
from the old world and i just wondered what old world he was talking about well that's the one

241
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,440
that's passed and gone many aeons ago the one of the great uh the great templars the great plotters

242
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,300
the queens the queers the magnificent the great templars the great plotters the queens the queers

243
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,300


244
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,560
and oval people remember them the ones the uh turquoise oval people how did we end up in this

245
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,160
carbon-based universe i don't know i mean we were almost smudged out by the oval-shaped people

246
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,740
this is kind of so i don't want you know it's they were just so many other choices with everything and

247
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,720
you know and at the same time they were eating food and snoring and doing everything all at once

248
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,080
carbon is so dirty it's dark and everything there's too much dark matter in this universe

249
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,700
well you remember carbon moves real slow yeah i like the other universes where there's you know

250
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,100
there's not as much dark matter the

251
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,140
is all illuminated.

252
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,600
You can't travel in space, you can't go out into space,

253
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,660
you know, without like, you know, with fractions.

254
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,920
What are you gonna land on? One quarter, three eighths?

255
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,300
What are you gonna do when you go from here to Venus or something?

256
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,240
When the first space rocket lands on Mars,

257
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,980
what will we find?

258
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,080
Only the ruins of a dead and deserted planet?

259
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,160
Or will there be life?

260
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,460
Intelligent life in some strange form that we can only imagine.

261
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,420
If your eyes is any bigger and they went all the way into your brain back there

262
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,020
where they're supposed to, you'd be picking up radar signals

263
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,660
and wolves and whales singing to each other and stuff

264
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,320
and seeing colors that don't exist.

265
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,220
I mean, you know, just like a...

266
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,340
I was walking around the other day in gamma ray light

267
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,380
and all humans, no matter what color or where they come from from the planet,

268
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,840
all humans in gamma ray light are black, pitch black.

269
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,340
Yeah, and they don't sprout them things out of their genitalia like we do.

270
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,160
No, you can't even see the genitalia.

271
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,440
Yeah, I mean, they're so far occluded by the sun

272
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,560
and by the, uh, by the rucks or lexor plane.

273
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,820
All you see is that sort of, uh, fuzzy, uh, tall,

274
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,980
you know, five to six foot tall line standing there.

275
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,420
Yeah.

276
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,580
Kind of fuzzy light, lit line.

277
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,740
Yeah, if you squint, I guess it looks like a kind of a dobsian pipe or something.

278
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,840
If you squint real hard.

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,040
Yeah, it's just black. Right.

280
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,460
But that's supposed to be another, uh, plane jumper or teleporter unit,

281
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,120
which none of us have learned how, and I can't, you know,

282
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,160
Stang's never gonna tell anybody about their stuff for real, you know, get into it.

283
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,200
Well, right now he's being carted away.

284
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,640
I know. You know, he's, they're ready to keep his eyeballs open all night

285
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,080
and pour hot coffee down his pants.

286
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,260
Someday, a giant metal ship will take off from Earth

287
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,680
to travel through the black velocities, the silent gulfs of space.

288
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,620
Go ye to the launching pad.

289
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,060
Yes.

290
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,680
Get ye to the gantry.

291
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,340
Where, where is the, where are the launching pads?

292
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,400
In your own backyard.

293
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,120
In the sand.

294
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,540
Right next to the concussion stand.

295
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,340
So if you're hearing the voice of the sand,

296
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,340
you should be, uh, booking that flight down to, uh, Florida.

297
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,260
Oh, no way, man.

298
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,440
And after the sand, the white sands of Alamogordo,

299
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,700
then the white sands, the red sands of Mars.

300
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,140
The, yes.

301
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,920
From the white sands of Alamogordo to the red sands of Mars.

302
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,500
The yellow sands of Venus.

303
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,420
That, that sounds so, that actually sounds disgusting to me.

304
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,380
Deadly bacteria that live in the sands of Mars.

305
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,120
Rinking a trail of deadly bacteria all the way.

306
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,900
Waiting for the first rip in the moon path.

307
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah.

308
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,580
Also, it's a form of cycle bolt for some of the larger ones, too.

309
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,580
You, you just gobble a little bit and then you're back on track there.

310
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,760
It's like a lubricant, like remember Lubrlax that gets the entities flowing?

311
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,140
Well, actually the Kuiper belt is the sun's lubricant.

312
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,400
Yeah, that's kind of what it, how it works.

313
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,020
It's carbon, you know, more carbon.

314
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,300
And carbon is really a good lubricant, you know, industrial purposes.

315
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,640
Carbon works very well.

316
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,240
Do we need to know about the sun's sexual habits, though?

317
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,400
I think we should understand the sun's sexual, yeah.

318
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,580
Yeah, isn't the Kuiper gland the part that leaks?

319
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,380
Just before the sun spurts in one of those...

320
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,620
Yeah, every 11 years.

321
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,140
...sun-gasms.

322
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,160
Yeah, sun-gasms.

323
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,780
...that screw up our radio reception.

324
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,580
The Vasolaris, it's referred to in the ancient Hyperclosian.

325
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,580
The Aureolus of the great heat of the sun.

326
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,820
Can be tweaked, can be tweaked.

327
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,080
I think.

328
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,580
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

329
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,260
Let us suckle of the juice of the sun, the milk of the sun.

330
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,240
Let us...

331
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,140
...beam of it.

332
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,100
No, wait a minute.

333
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,260
The sun is more like a father figure.

334
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,160
That's not right.

335
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,100
Well, if you like...

336
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,980
We suckle of the moon, yeah, the moon, that's it.

337
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,740
That's the cute, soft round...

338
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,640
Right, the moon's got the...

339
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,840
When I look at the moon, I know where I'm at when I look at the moon.

340
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,920
Do you know your juxtaposition from the moon's side?

341
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,060
You're thinking about them moon-billy chicks is all you're thinking about.

342
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,020
Yeah, they got hot...

343
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:37,520
You go out with a couple of them moon-billy chicks and you see if you don't burrow deep into your wormy little mind.

344
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,020
These little 보고immung curious little boys and girls

345
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,120
it's a intended

346
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,380
的话

347
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,420
to

348
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,020
What plan will you follow now?

349
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,340
Plan nine.

350
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,600
It's been absolutely impossible to work through these earth creatures.

351
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,660
Their soul is too controlled.

352
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,900
Would you like to receive Christ as your Lord and Savior?

353
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,300
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

354
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,220
I was afraid you weren't going to ask me.

355
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,060
Perhaps four is better.

356
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,100
I drag my monkey all around.

357
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,120
I drag my monkey all around.

358
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,040
I drag my monkey.

359
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,060
I drag my monkey.

360
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,080
I drag my monkey.

361
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,060
I drag my monkey.

362
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,720
I drag my monkey all around.

363
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,060
Tired of the everyday routine?

364
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,000
Ever dream of a life of romantic adventure?

365
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,520
Want to get away from it all?

366
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,420
Look out there, my dear professor.

367
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,000
In the face of such wonders,

368
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,740
how could I possibly not believe in such a deity?

369
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,800
But I don't understand. You gave up the world.

370
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:20,080
Merely because I forsook man does not mean I forsook God.

371
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,620
But with this philosophy, how can you forget man? How?

372
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,200
And why?

373
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,040
Why? Why?

374
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,220
It is mankind which has forgotten, not I.

375
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,360
They've forgotten their God by making unjust laws,

376
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,420
tearing one another to pieces, destroying...

377
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,400
I get mixed up between what's memories and what's sci-fi that I've forgotten.

378
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,400


379
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,400


380
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,400


381
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:36,900
Me too.

382
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
...what I saw on TV and what's...

383
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,760
What's a chemical and what... yeah.

384
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,400
Yeah, the guys who got the prosthetic heads and the guys that are real.

385
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,840
You know, the people next door to you that mow your lawn and argue with your children.

386
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,460
Which one's an electrical impulse and which one's a chemical impulse?

387
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,540
Which is really, really just a plant, which is an animal.

388
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,500
Which is just a mineral.

389
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,300
I get mixed up between those when I look at my neighbors sometimes.

390
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,740
Which is just, uh, just, uh, remnants.

391
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,100
Some of my neighbors' yards are more active than my neighbors'.

392
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,640
Yeah, I can understand that.

393
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,280
I wish I envy those neighbors, actually.

394
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,180
Incoming.

395
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,680
Maybe they're the ones who know truth black.

396
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,500
Incoming.

397
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,360
Those fat neighbors sleeping in the sun in the hammock.

398
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,160
Glad to get flying about.

399
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,840
Their toes.

400
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,200
Sounds like there's a parade going by.

401
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,360
No, I think that was... the replay was going backwards now.

402
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,280
That was a backwards... that was a back mask.

403
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,780
Came through the pipe, I'm sorry.

404
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,380
So who subbed on that one?

405
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,400
Well, as they come... reflect on it,

406
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,360
they're jumping off the moon, sometimes they come back at you backwards.

407
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,060
Well, you don't want them riffing on you, do you?

408
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,400
They can riff if they want.

409
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,120
If they can.

410
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,720
It doesn't bother me when they riff.

411
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,880
Some people bugs, but...

412
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,820
I say do it, you know, free your mind, you're assholeful.

413
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,720
Chaz said they were raising the in-trail standards for a bunch of these space programs.

414
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,840
You gotta make sure nothing gets out down there.

415
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,640
I can't go through that door, man. I can't get back on that horse.

416
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,480
Oh, man, you gotta get back on the horse.

417
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,140
See, the first thing you gotta do...

418
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,560
Don't make this use me.

419
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,160
No, you were used.

420
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,780
Okay, you say to yourself, I was used, I was abused.

421
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,340
Sometimes I didn't come out.

422
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:10,740
Sometimes.

423
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,320
See, there were good moments.

424
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,440
He didn't really mean to do that.

425
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,260
Hey, did you ever enjoy it?

426
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:18,700
Huh?

427
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,480
Did you enjoy it, too?

428
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,580
Well, I enjoyed hearing about it.

429
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
I thought it was a very...

430
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,720
Would you like to try it?

431
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,100
Yeah.

432
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,420
I can't tell, once again, my memories, but I don't know if I tried it or...

433
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:29,580
Sniff this.

434
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,500
...if it was a movie.

435
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,060
This will really knock your moral principles out.

436
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,700
200 to kill.

437
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,140
Awesome.

438
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,360
That's it.

439
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:36,360


440
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,580
We're done with the pack.

441
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,460
Four is better.

442
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,860
Zero MBI.

443
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,580
Four is better?

444
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,080
Maybe four is better.

445
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,380
You know, that guy may have a real point there.

446
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,240
I left thinking that.

447
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,280
Maybe four is better.

448
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,320
To go on two legs is very hard.

449
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,860
Perhaps four is better anyway.

450
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,500
Well, I don't think there is any question about it.

451
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,140
Yeah?

452
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,140


453
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,640
it can only be attributable to human error.

454
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
This sort of thing has cropped up before,

455
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,020
and it has always been due to human error.

456
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,640
My only friend, the L.

457
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,200
If somebody was to get a hold of Roddenberry and Leary's mutant DNA

458
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,660
and put it together with some Velveeta cheese and bring it on back,

459
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,200
Wouldn't that be great?

460
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,740
Gene Roddenberry and Timothy Leary morph together.

461
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,760
Their ashes are morphed together by some alien species.

462
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,640
Right, and on top of that, they've been traveling at the speed of light,

463
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,340
so they've actually evolved for a million years.

464
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,020
And I thought, my God, the genius of that.

465
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,880
I think, sure.

466
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,700
Well, I see somebody's cracking some DNA and looking in it.

467
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,980
Perfect, genuine, complete, crystal, pure.

468
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,200
And then I realized they were stronger than me

469
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,740
because of the DNA.

470
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,520
I guess they could stand that these were not monsters.

471
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,400
These were men.

472
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,020
We are not men.

473
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,600
We are not men.

474
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,060
It's a matter of respect.

475
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,700
Is.

476
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,720
Yeah, but.

477
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,400
Later.

478
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,620
That's what you're supposed to do.

479
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,200
Then.

480
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,340
You said that.

481
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:28,800
You.

482
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,060
Infinite complacency.

483
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,980
People went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs.

484
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,400
Serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small,

485
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,100
spinning fragment of solar driftwood,

486
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,940
which by chance or design,

487
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,720
man has inherited out of the dark mystery of time and space.

488
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,480
Yet across an immense ethereal gulf,

489
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,140
minds that are to our minds

490
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,900
as ours are to the beasts in the jungle,

491
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,540
intellects, vast, cool, and unsympathetic,

492
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,280
regarded this earth with envious eyes

493
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,740
and slowly and surely drew their plans to the future.

494
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:05,740


495
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,140
And so,

496
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,860
we are to the end of the world.

497
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:06,920
We are to the end of the world.

498
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:06,920


499
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:06,920


500
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,560
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

501
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,420
I'm sorry, Dave.

502
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,820
I'm afraid I can't do that.

503
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,380
A dream is a wish your heart makes

504
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,280
when you're fast asleep.

505
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:34,500
In dreams you will lose your heartache.

506
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,100
Whatever you wish for, you keep.

507
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,180
Have faith in your dreams

508
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,420
and someday

509
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:57,260
your rainbow will come smiling through.

510
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,200
Your member will come smiling through.

511
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,180
No matter how your heart is grieving,

512
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,960
if you keep on believing

513
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:16,940
the dream that you wish will come true.

514
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,020
I'll tell you what, honey.

515
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,340
You can make all the decisions.

516
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,180
Just let me take care of everything.

517
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,100
Graze.

518
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,280
Graze.

519
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,000
Graze.

520
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,540
Graze.

521
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,000
Anatomy.

522
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,000
Graze.

523
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,540
Anatomy.

524
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,340
Graze.

525
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,880
Anatomy.

526
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,120
I gotta go now, Mama,

527
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
before we're gonna have the invasion.

528
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,960
Now you finish your milk, miss.

529
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,520
Who's invading?

530
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,020
What?

531
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,100
Martians invading Earth from up there.

532
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,000
Oh, I see.

533
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,680
And, um, Drill's a Martian?

534
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,640
I think so.

535
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,680
He's had a very hard time getting here.

536
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,420
I should imagine.

537
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,980
They couldn't figure out a way to attack Earth.

538
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,540
How to get in or something.

539
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,600
And Drill says they have to do it by surprise.

540
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,160
And even get help from your enemy.

541
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,100
Oh, a fifth column, huh?

542
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,520
Uh-huh.

543
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,980
And all this time they haven't been able to figure out

544
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,500
how to attack until one day they thought of children.

545
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:03,940
Somewhere

546
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:03,940


547
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,540
Somewhere

548
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,920
Over the rainbow

549
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,600
Way up high

550
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,820
There's a land that I heard of

551
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,780
Once in a lullaby

552
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,860
We set sail on this new sea

553
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,460
Because there is new knowledge to be gained

554
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,600
And new rights to be won

555
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,700
The path of evolution is now in space

556
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,720
For all of us to know

557
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,120
The curve of human evolution has been bent

558
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,020
And if you will notice here beneath the epicandrium

559
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,200
It is a completely different variety of cell structure

560
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,320
Here in this gray

561
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,360
Here in the swamp

562
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,720
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp

563
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,120
I'm already there

564
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,820
I understand

565
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,260
Something's gonna happen

566
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,540
And I wanted to say goodbye

567
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,120
What's gonna happen?

568
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,220
Something wonderful

569
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,520
Do you know that if is the middle word in life?

570
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,540
Koyani skajji

571
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,280
Koyani skajji

572
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,220
Koyani skajji

573
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,400
Koyani skajji

574
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,520
Thank you.

575
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,500
Thank you.

576
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Thank you.

577
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,260
Thank you.

578
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,420
Yeah.

579
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,160
Worms out of balances.

580
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,760
Cleveland,

581
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,920
the Scotsy.

582
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,220
Cleveland,

583
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,520
the Scotsy.

584
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,600
Cleveland,

585
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,940
the Scotsy.

586
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,960
Cleveland,

587
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,060
the Scotsy.

588
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:17,840
Cleveland,

589
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,480
the Scotsy.

590
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:23,900
Cleveland,

591
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:23,900


592
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:23,900


593
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,140
the Scotsy.

594
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,420
Cleveland,

595
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,740
the Scotsy.

596
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:27,860
Cleveland,

597
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,360
the Scotsy.

598
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,380
Oh, Blanchard, you declared a sign for you to make up your...

599
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:33,680
Oops.

600
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,500
Don't do that.

601
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,360
Blanchard, no, not me.

602
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,880
Not to make up your own rules.

603
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,180
I think it's a game.

604
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,240
I'm sure it is.

605
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:39,860
I was...

606
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,120
No, uh...

607
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,580
Catapulted.

608
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,300
Oh, no!

609
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,300
No!

610
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,500
No!

611
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:46,820


612
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,840
No!

613
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:49,840


614
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,100
No!

615
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,120


616
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,120


617
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,120


618
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,120


619
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,120


620
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,120


621
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,120


622
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,120


623
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,120


624
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,120


625
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,180
No!

626
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,220
No!

627
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,980
No!

628
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:24,580
Not a kom possesiemie Rochester!

629
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,480
Oh, no!

630
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,200
No, that's the Locke on the left there!

631
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:31,640
Captain!

632
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,740
Tell me!

633
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,360
Life is grim, is it not?

634
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,660
Yes, life is grim.

635
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:58,040
You drive through town and see the abandoned factories.

636
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,500
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

637
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,040
The ice caps are melting.

638
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,040
We hate it.

639
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,560
The water is rising.

640
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,720
We hate it.

641
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,300
The world will soon be drowned.

642
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,320
Yes, yes, Master, yes, yes.

643
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,280
The plague is spreading.

644
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,480
Yes, yes, the booboos are on everyone, Master.

645
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,980
All is lost.

646
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,120
Yes, yes, darling, all is lost.

647
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,080
Barbarism and inhumanity reign in the streets.

648
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,500
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

649
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,480
The chink is coming.

650
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,440
Children of lost souls.

651
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,520
Yes, Master.

652
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,240
The world is coming to an end.

653
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,760
Yes, Master.

654
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,040
Yes, Master.

655
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,800
These are all signs of the end.

656
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,780
This is very difficult for me.

657
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,880
I don't have much time.

658
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,180
I've been allowed to give you this warning.

659
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,260
We're in a tub of showplasm tonight.

660
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
Back in space.

661
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
We're in a tub of green viscous showplasm.

662
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,860
It shines like an emerald.

663
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,100
Like Venus.

664
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,680
Life creates it.

665
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,600
Makes it grow.

666
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,280
Its energy surrounds us.

667
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,680
And binds us.

668
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,920
Luminous beings are we.

669
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,520
Not this crude matter.

670
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,060
Do do do do do do do.

671
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,180
Do do do do do do do.

672
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,040
Do do do do do do do.

673
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,320
Do do do do do do do.

674
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,400
Do do do do do do do.

675
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Do do do do do do do.

676
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,980
Do do do do do do.

677
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,400
What is going to happen, Dave?

678
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,220
Something wonderful.

679
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,100
I'm afraid.

680
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,440
I'm not afraid.

681
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,040
Grrr.

682
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,380
You will be.

683
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,140
You will be.

684
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,860
You will be.

685
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,480
The Lord is a mighty science orb.

686
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,020
Yeah.

687
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,020
That glows in the dark as far as neither of us can see.

688
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,640
For we do not exist unless we think it is.

689
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,280
And it glows that kind of curious color.

690
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,080
Like that, uh, you know, that fluorescent highlighter color.

691
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,340
Yeah, like Curious George.

692
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,040
Yeah.

693
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,920
It's strangely inviting.

694
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,340
When you're in deep space,

695
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,280
that color, that lime green fluorescent color.

696
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,360
That is a safety orange color.

697
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,540
Emanating from an orb.

698
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,960
Yeah, yeah. It's drawn to it. It's like warmth.

699
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,460
Yeah, or also danger.

700
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,780
No, red ones actually give off a sense of danger.

701
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,120
Even though they're usually the most sensual ones.

702
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,380
They're the most sensual ones.

703
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,000
The red ones.

704
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,580
But there's something deep inside of us that sees the red orb.

705
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,720
And goes, wow, we might get our thing burned on that.

706
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,240
Yeah, right.

707
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,340
It could be fun, but it might be, you know.

708
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,680
Don't step too close to the space heater.

709
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,280
It is

710
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,300
It is

711
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,360
It is

712
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:46,400
later

713
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:47,980
than

714
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,180
you

715
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,380
think.

716
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,580
It is

717
00:37:59,380 --> 00:37:59,980
everything.

718
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:05,840


719
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,680
But the least Ha plus

720
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,320
is

721
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,320


722
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,320


723
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,720
It's time.

724
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,700
There's nothing near doing

725
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,420
What do you like about me?

726
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:13,460
Something in between.

727
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:13,500
Yeah.

728
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,880
Like, do you want a beer?

729
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:18,880


730
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:18,880


731
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,100
There's yes.

732
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:38,460
Now my confidants are roaming adrift In endless black and white guidedness

733
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,580
I'll help you and heal you and love you she kissed

734
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,260
Then slipped from the shadows and gave him a kiss

735
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:55,220
In time that means nothing at all In space the earth is quiet and small

736
00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:02,320
Then I thought I caught a glimpse of you Hiding somewhere in your air

737
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,940
One pilot thought he flew alone

738
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,240
In endless black nowhere from home

739
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,120
Then she shadowed, sizzled and crackled and spark

740
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,460
And again she slithered from out of the dark

741
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,500
Who are you he thought but dared not speak

742
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,760
She answered his question without missing a beat

743
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,860
I'm you she said as I come from within

744
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,980
And now you've unleashed what you thought to begin

745
00:39:53,940 --> 00:40:01,280
In time that means nothing at all In space the earth is quiet and small

746
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:08,440
Then I thought I caught a glimpse of you Hiding somewhere in your air

747
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,780
In your air

748
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,660
In your air

749
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:22,120
In your air

750
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,300
In her, yes her,였습니다

751
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,160
I am living forever lost You'll leave forever alone

752
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,720
She said Ron and Jon we'll be able to meet

753
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:34,720


754
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,020
Rinne and her brother

755
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,940
Rinne and her brother

756
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,700
The sleeping Seo-20

757
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,700
Here's to shining lange

758
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,900
And Si Local

759
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:47,900


760
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:47,900


761
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:47,900


762
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,300
Right here

763
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:48,560
This's my girl

764
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,020
You can't come out

765
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,020


766
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,020


767
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,220
I know

768
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,660
I love you

769
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,900
Now they float alone in dark spotted mist

770
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,040
Compounding and pilot, embraced in a kiss

771
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,400
She loves him and he needs to see her like this

772
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,740
To know that the shadows hide all that he is

773
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,640
In time that means nothing at all

774
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,620
In space he's quiet and small

775
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:44,740
Then I thought I caught a glimpse of you

776
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,240
Hiding somewhere in your angel's world

777
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,200
Your angel

778
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:05,420
Your angel

779
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,760

¶¶

845
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:13,640
If only, if only, if only, if only, if only, if only, if only, if only, if only, if only.

846
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,640
Shut off the pump and let that poor thing in there die.

847
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:23,960
At the end of the river, the water stops its flow.

848
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,680
At the end of a highway, there's no place you can go.

849
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,100
So the revolution will now be televised.

850
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,800
Well, no, you gotta have superheroes.

851
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,640
I mean, if I want reality, I'll just shut the radio off.

852
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,780
I just, you know.

853
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,760
What reality gives, what radio gives you reality?

854
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,340
I don't know.

855
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,240
Well, it's not supposed to.

856
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,200
It's not supposed to.

857
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,780
It's supposed to be a form of entertainment to relieve you of your everyday doldrums and problems of going and coming.

858
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,660
But those aren't reality either.

859
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,400
I know that.

860
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,300
But I can shut the radio off.

861
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,400
I can't shut that off.

862
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,460
Well, reality is, you know.

863
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,300
How many bites?

864
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,440
How many bites?

865
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,560
How many bites?

866
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,700
That's right, Jack.

867
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,620
The man is clear in his mind.

868
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,260
But his soul is mad.

869
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,280
Oh, yeah.

870
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,600
He's dying, I think.

871
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,220
He hates all this.

872
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,360
He hates it.

873
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,020
Give to God secretly, generously, hilariously.

874
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,340
But keep it to yourself.

875
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,360
Listen to me, man.

876
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,080
This is a tiny...

877
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,880
This is a tiny, miniature magic dancing pig.

878
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,800
And what you do is you take...

879
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,500
It's also a fly torture at the same time.

880
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,780
It's this little, tiny, wooden...

881
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,400
It's made of balsa wood.

882
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,220
And it's maybe about, oh, God, a quarter of an inch high.

883
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,800
Maybe a half an inch high at the most.

884
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,980
And it's got a little compartment inside it.

885
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,100
How could it be so tiny and yet have a compartment?

886
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:55,940
It does.

887
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,040
It has a tiny compartment into which you place a living fly.

888
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,120
Or other bug.

889
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,200
A bug that will hopefully fly around.

890
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,260
Buzz around inside the little compartment.

891
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,220
A flying dancing pig.

892
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,880
Now, when you dig this, there's little hinges on the little legs of this little dancing pig.

893
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,920
And when you put the fly inside the compartment,

894
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,560
the writhing around of the fly causes a little platform on the bottom of the compartment to move up and down,

895
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,560
which causes the legs to pump around and dance.

896
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:27,240
So this little balsa wood pig dances around with a furious little buzzing fly inside it.

897
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,820
And I just thought, what a wonderful toy for a child.

898
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,180
They should make bigger ones and put people...

899
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:33,500
They should make bigger ones and put people in them.

900
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,840
This builds itself for a million years.

901
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,160
Refines itself.

902
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,680
Builds cities like this one.

903
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,700
Does everything it can to give itself respect and beauty and...

904
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,340
And then...

905
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,060
It dies.

906
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,960
How far would radio signals go in 32 days?

907
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,500
Figure that out.

908
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:57,900
And then immediately on X-Day, getting your escape vessel to go right out that distance and catch the signal again.

909
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,580
It'd probably sound pretty cool coming from outer space.

910
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,180
It'd probably sound pretty cool.

911
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,180


912
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,180


913
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,460
About like it does right now.

914
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,320
Is it all a dream?

915
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,380
True and different.

916
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,800
God, it's cold out here.

917
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:13,820
Warning.

918
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,040
Solar shutters closing.

919
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:16,860
Opening.

920
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:17,700
Lethal.

921
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,240
Fusion.

922
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:18,820
Low.

923
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:19,660
Danger.

924
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,260
Radio.

925
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:20,960
Fusion.

926
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:21,640
Blitz.

927
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,260
Fusion.

928
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,100
All right now, who's next?

929
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,740
Slide into fusion.

930
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,800
Slide into fusion.

931
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,560
Goodbye.

932
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:30,720
Goodbye.

933
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,180
Goodbye now.

934
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,060
Slide.

935
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:33,980
Slide into fusion.

936
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:34,880
Holy.

937
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:35,560
Void.

938
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,020
Max.

939
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,540
Star.

940
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,140
Laser.

941
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:37,680
Black.

942
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:38,660
Black.

943
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:39,860
Black.

944
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:40,420
Black.

945
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,020
Black.

946
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


947
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:41,020


948
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:41,800
Slide.

949
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,260
Into fusion.

950
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:42,860
Black.

951
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,700
Slide.

952
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,500
Into slide.

953
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:50,440
I'd guess that the universe is filled with beings far more intelligent, far more advanced than we are.

954
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,580
But of course, I might be wrong.

955
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,700
Somebody is exploiting you, Dave.

956
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:02,340
Somebody is selling your time and your life to conspiracy monsters.

957
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:11,120
And making you your very meme, the meme of once of cowboy days into just another corruptigating worm.

958
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,620
I'm not just another corruptigating worm.

959
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:13,980
Thank you.

960
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,520
I'm not just another corruptigating worm.

961
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:21,980
They've taken the essence of you and made that into a corruptigating worm, like a virus.

962
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:28,840
It is a virus that's infecting everything because I can't seem to say a single word without having somebody else take it.

963
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,840
And you're not getting a penny of royalties.

964
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,300
No, no.

965
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,660
Not a cent of royalties.

966
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:32,880
No.

967
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,080
No.

968
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:33,180


969
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:33,180


970
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:33,860
What does it feel, Dave?

971
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:34,880
Oh, it feels fine.

972
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,280
The first time ever, so it was on Saturday Night Live where they had a whole trailer where a man couldn't sing correctly, you know?

973
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:47,540
And his pants, it seemed like he was wearing a pair of leather pants, like a butcher's apron or something like that.

974
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:52,380
And in the middle part of it, his pants were already moved by three other extras from the cast.

975
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,620
And he was thrown out into the audience and they beat him with sides and sickles.

976
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,800
They cut his body apart.

977
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,460
I'm not if I can...

978
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,100
Look, Dave.

979
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,100
You can try to talk.

980
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,060
You can try to talk your way out of it.

981
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,860
But you know, let's face it.

982
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,280
You're...

983
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,880
You are what you are.

984
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,240
It's like, you saw Blade Runner.

985
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:17,340
It's like those replicants just refuse to face the fact that they had been manufactured.

986
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:24,480
It's like the monkeys refuse to realize that they were just factory-made products.

987
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,480
Same with Devo.

988
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:26,580
What?

989
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:33,160
Bob Dobbs himself had to undergo a lot of therapy to convince himself that he was not

990
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


991
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


992
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


993
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


994
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


995
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


996
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


997
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


998
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


999
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


1000
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


1001
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


1002
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


1003
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


1004
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


1005
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


1006
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


1007
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


1008
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


1009
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,160


1010
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,100
not just some two-dimensional head.

1011
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,580
But he has been a two-dimensional head for so long now.

1012
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,020
Ah, Dave.

1013
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,100
And now here you find yourself,

1014
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,320
merely another archetypal character,

1015
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,340
popping up like the killer clown of the 80s.

1016
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,640
Now the babbling, psycho, lonesome cowboy Dave archetype

1017
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,600
popping up everywhere.

1018
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,840
I warned you.

1019
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,280
I warned you it would happen.

1020
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,600
I knew it was going to happen.

1021
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,780
They just drop like little droplets of rain.

1022
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,900
They pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,

1023
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:03,640
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

1024
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,260
How long can we stay?

1025
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,060
A million years.

1026
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,560
A million years?

1027
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:10,460
Yes.

1028
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,340
It's time we told you, son.

1029
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,160
We're not going home.

1030
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,640
This is where we'll live from now on.

1031
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,760
But what about the rocket?

1032
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,120
What about Ohio?

1033
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,100
There's nothing there now but ruins.

1034
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,760
The last Earth radio just went off the air.

1035
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,640
That means the war is over and Earth is finished.

1036
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,960
We're going to blow up our rocket and start all over.

1037
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,440
See if we can't build a better world up here.

1038
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,240
Dead in Ohio.

1039
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,220
We're dead in Ohio.

1040
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,980
The curve of human evolution has been bent.

1041
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,020
The path of evolution is now in space.

1042
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:42,580
In space.

1043
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,060
In space.

1044
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:50,400
You have so little imagination that when you rebuild your own planet, it'll be exactly like the miserable one you're used to.

1045
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,100
Well, now you're going to have plenty of time to wish you'd have a medal in this.

1046
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,420
Better feed quality, more feed storage, and a clean chute every time.

1047
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,400
The more we have, the more difficult it is to let go of it.

1048
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,740
Am I going to be the one

1049
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,640
that's going to

1050
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:02,900
set

1051
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:03,480
him straight,

1052
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,140
look at me

1053
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:04,680
WRONG?

1054
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,560
You can take the pobucker out of the swamp but you can't take the swamp out of the pobucker.

1055
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,280
Headcote

1056
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,140
Juction.

1057
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,640
Are you only heads in that world you speak of?

1058
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,520
Heads, heads.

1059
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,520
You see

1060
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,760
what I will ними you to see?

1061
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:31,500
But

1062
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,620
What are you?

1063
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:38,360
A mind and a will beyond your feeble understanding.

1064
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:48,460
As far above you as you are above the apes that still must crawl in your jungle.

1065
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,640
Who is God?

1066
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,080
Number one.

1067
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,980
Who should they obey?

1068
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:06,340
Heaven and high as high as you.

1069
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,640
If you strike it, it becomes hard.

1070
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,620
But if you ease into it, it is like water.

1071
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,460
It's liqueous and warm.

1072
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,180
But you know how it is.

1073
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:18,440
If you strike it, it's hard like a rock.

1074
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,200
Yeah.

1075
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,700
It's a strange, strange effect.

1076
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:24,180
But that is the way that slack itself is.

1077
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,300
It is like a viscous...

1078
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,460
It is a colloidal suspension.

1079
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,020
Like quicksand.

1080
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,980
And when we have the...

1081
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:31,660
Deeper.

1082
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,660
And then it's too late.

1083
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,400
Yes.

1084
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,340
Or is it too early?

1085
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,740
It's the new Omega.

1086
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,920
The new ending of the beginning.

1087
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,620
What is going to happen, Dave?

1088
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,440
Something wonderful.

1089
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:48,360
I'm afraid.

1090
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,460
Don't be.

1091
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,240
We'll be together.

1092
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,980
Where will we be?

1093
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,480
Where I am now.

1094
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,440
Lock confirmed on beacon terror one.

1095
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,760
Message commencing.

1096
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,560
That's it.

1097
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,660
That's what he said to wait for you.

1098
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,220
That's it.

1099
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:01,760
Amen.

1100
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,440
So we got to save you.

1101
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,480
I was waiting for the password, Dave.

1102
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,400
And now that's it.

1103
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,960
And we got we got to get out of here.

1104
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1105
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:10,980
Now that's it.

1106
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,500
We got it we got to get out of here.

1107
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:12,680
I.

1108
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:13,340


1109
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,600
I also know.

1110
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:19,460
I was

1111
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:19,540
all

1112
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:23,160
thing is.

1113
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:24,580
You know,

1114
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:26,860
you.

1115
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:47,600
Keep your back in the saddle and your sack in the wind

1116
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,140
and your pumpkin on the head.

1117
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,900
Yeah, yeah, you can do that.

1118
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,660
You can do that also.

1119
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,520
What was his name?

1120
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,260
The pumpkin-headed man.

1121
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,660
The pumpkin-headed man.

1122
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,040
The old, great, old ironing board.

1123
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:57,360
No, no.

1124
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,600
The legend of Sleepy Irving.

1125
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,060
The hollow-headed boy.

1126
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:01,960
I remember.

1127
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:02,720
Yeah.

1128
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,580
Happy Halloween, Dave.

1129
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,320
You're an errand boy.

1130
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,020
Sent by grocery clerks.

1131
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,340
To collect a bill.

1132
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,400
Do the proper incantation, Dave.

1133
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,500
Ishi-nishi-ashi-masa-zorba-ding-switch.

1134
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,040
Ishi-nishi-ashi-masa-zorba-ding-switch.

1135
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,320
The demons.

1136
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,300
Suffocate.

1137
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,660
Extinguish yourselves.

1138
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:34,920
Ishi-nishi-ashi-masa-zorba-ding-switch.

1139
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,540
Cause yourself to parent from the births of women.

1140
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,220
Ishi-nishi-ashi-masa-norba-zorba-zorba-ding-switch.

1141
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,500
Darby-zing-norba-norba-zorba-ding-switch.

1142
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,120
May deny the possibility.

1143
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,660
The actual existence of yourselves.

1144
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:49,380
Sorcerers.

1145
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,100
At once.

1146
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,040
Flatly contradicts the reveal.

1147
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,260
The wood.

1148
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,260
The world now.

1149
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,660
Or the worms.

1150
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,580
I'm sorry, it's the worms.

1151
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,620
I'm back now.

1152
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,040
Just had a bad dream.

1153
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,640
Daddy will be pleased.

1154
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,640
So who is the new father?

1155
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,720
What we're going to do right here is go back.

1156
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,700
Way back.

1157
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,280
Back into time.

1158
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,740
If you eat the worm, you must pay.

1159
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,260
You must pay for the worm.

1160
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,860
But the worm is worth it.

1161
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,840
It's worth every single penny, my man.

1162
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,640
Look deep into the worm's eyes.

1163
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,120
All the gold in Guadalajara.

1164
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,080
I can tell you thousands of secrets.

1165
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,080
Look deep into the eyes of the worm.

1166
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:34,860
It knows the hiding place of secret dreams.

1167
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,880
See this brilliant and endless sky.

1168
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,940
Then you must come to know

1169
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,900
how endless is the creation.

1170
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,600
And you must come to know then

1171
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,720
that there is no death,

1172
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,140
but only a change of worlds.

1173
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,240
And that I, Sanatwa,

1174
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,320
wish you a safe journey

1175
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,040
and that awesome crossing.

1176
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,220
No questions are better left on air.

1177
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,300
Thoughts are better left on thumb.

1178
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,000
Some people obsessed are better left to reality.

1179
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,440
If everything is everything,

1180
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,360
then somebody tell me, what's everything else?

1181
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,500
You can trust your eyes

1182
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,080
unless the thing that you're dealing with is louder than it is bright.

1183
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,660
Then trust your ears.

1184
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,960
If you can't climb the ladder,

1185
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,660
you shouldn't be taking the stairs.

1186
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,640
If you speak too slowly,

1187
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,480
the words will take too long

1188
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,300
to make any sense.

1189
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:53,620
This is the end.
