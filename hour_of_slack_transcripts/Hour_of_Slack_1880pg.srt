1
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,300
Hey!

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,980
The Self Genius Power of Squash!

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,160
Oh no!

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:17,800
Good?

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,600
Oh, the poor dying.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,500
You make me sick.

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,780
All of you.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,120
What are you trying to do?

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,940
I like the frax calls.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,840
Oh no.

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,220
Anyone else want his head bashed in?

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,180
Oh no!

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm Sch...

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,460
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met with French leaders in Paris today where she spread avian influenza.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,900
We believe firmly that the world should be caught by a very dangerous avian flu.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,660
Sch...

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:00:59,940
Sch...

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:00:59,980
Sch...

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
European Union experts held a turkey.

21
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,500
Socials.

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,080
Socials.

23
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,160
Socials.

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,640
PR's banned.

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,180
PR's bad.

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,880
PR's bad.

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,900
On Wall Street, 110-247-926.

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,880
You're listening to PR News.

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,120
Today, the Federal Reserve was the largest in more than 23 years.

30
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,740
U.S. consumer prices jumped by soaring slightly.

31
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:35,960
There are few people in the streets as a massive security presence deploys ahead of tomorrow's PR News in Washington.

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,440
We have two completely different things for you tonight, friends.

33
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,600
One is mostly me talking.

34
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:54,580
In a recent interview on a video podcast called My Family Thinks I'm Crazy, it was a lot of fun.

35
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,640
It's just the first half hour.

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,180
Of a very recent two-hour interview show, but mostly talking about the old days.

37
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:24,400
The other thing has none of me talking, but it has Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence, Rusty Rebar, Bubba Free, M. Ho Pep, Michael Pepe, the late Peter Goldie, Dr. Philodruman, and the good Bishop Joey from the First Church of the Last Laugh, also known as Ed Holmes.

38
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,500
And callers.

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,160
And that half hour is from an Ask Dr. Howell show on Radio Valencia, I think from around 2013 or before.

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:44,760
Because it was the pre-recorded first half of the Puzzling Evidence show of October 2013, of which I played the last half just with Philo last week.

41
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,320
Is that clear?

42
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,020
So even though it's old, it's not about the old days like the newer show with me is.

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,400
So anyway, thanks to Time Control Techniques.

44
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,040
It's all new to Hour of Slack, and I didn't have to spend too much time editing.

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,780
I'm busy with other archival projects.

46
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:15,360
In fact, I got a gizmo called The Wolverine that copies one's old 8mm and Super 8 films to digital at two frames a second.

47
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:26,520
And I can finally see all those unlabeled reels of film from 1965 to 1971, or 81.

48
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,160
It includes the one shot that Sandy Boone would have killed for for her documentary.

49
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,160
But more on that once us morons are done yapping, yakking, and yattering.

50
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,500
I'm the director, and because in those days, the conspiracy wasn't in the church.

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,400
And that's what I'm talking about tonight, the conspiracy in the church.

52
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,160
I'm in a lot of experience with the conspiracy.

53
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,520
I'm a preacher, I don't make my living at this, I make my living doing other things.

54
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,320
See, horrible things.

55
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,380
The church is filling up with pink boys.

56
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,560
God saying it's false.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,700
Rapper on the left approximately says his boss is a disciple of a cultist that own it.

58
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,540
Gosh Dane Anne, still not understanding the game that uncle Barry was playing with,

59
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,520
says mommy revolution never was her service when she made the resolution.

60
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,900
I am pleased all the judges of this lecture syndrome,

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:54,980
are perhaps the most delicious mammalsâ€¦

62
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:01,820
Let's get started. I don't know if you've been on a podcast before, but you're certainly a veteran in the broadcasting game.

63
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,800
You have over 19,000 radio episodes, according to you.

64
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,280
You also told me that you're going to mix it up, so who knows if that's the truth or not.

65
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:24,980
But welcome to Illuminati Confirmed, where everything you say can and will be used for humorous and satirical purposes by the court of we three unruly degenerates.

66
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,700
I'm your host, Mystic Mark. Tuning in, our audience of thoughtful wingnuts.

67
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,520
Joining me is my co-host, Juan.

68
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,420
From the Juan on Juan podcast. How you doing, Ivan?

69
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,600
So far, so good.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,040
And Chris?

71
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,260
What up? Mensa podcast. How are you? Nice to meet you. Love the hat.

72
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,280
That guy's smoking a frop stick.

73
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,180
It's a vape. Oh, he's smoking a...

74
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:01,860
We'll definitely be smoking on this episode because I think we're in for an interesting conversation.

75
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:09,660
You've been in the realms of alternative culture for much longer than I've been alive.

76
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,040
Juan and I have been...

77
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,980
We've been studying as much as we can about the church of the subgenius, but we are...

78
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:23,060
I was hoping you didn't know. You said you didn't know anything about it and didn't need to know the jargon.

79
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:35,300
We're trying. We don't want to get blindsided, but I'd love to learn a little bit more about who you are, sir, and where this all started for you.

80
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,040
Can you take us back to maybe what first woke you up to the fact that our world, our society...

81
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,820
our reality is consistently lying to us?

82
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,000
Is this something that we like to talk about on the show?

83
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:57,420
Often, you know, the reality is stranger than fiction, and I think the church of the subgenius exemplifies that.

84
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,780
But when did this weirdness really start for you, sir?

85
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:09,920
Well, it's hard to say because the last thing I remember, I was trying weed for the first time in seventh grade.

86
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,740
Right.

87
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,200
And it's all been...

88
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,460
And I just sort of woke up here.

89
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,400
So I was hoping you guys could explain it to me.

90
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,960
Where are you in time?

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,220
Well, actually, some of it has come back to me.

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:36,940
In around 1975, I was struggling to support a family with my job of doing offensive animated underground cartoons that didn't make any money.

93
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,020
And this Yellow Pages salesman showed up, Philo Drummond.

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,020
And he was trying to sell me a Yellow Page ad.

95
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,220
And I said, well, I can't buy an ad because I'm not...

96
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,740
My business doesn't make any money.

97
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:03,220
And he said, well, if you like working for nothing, maybe I have a job for you.

98
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,720
But then he said, but first, do you want to get high?

99
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,480
And I was real surprised because I didn't look at that time.

100
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,680
I didn't look like somebody.

101
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,420
It would smoke pot.

102
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,680
I was real, real.

103
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,200
I kind of looked like Elvis Costello, if you remember him.

104
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:28,280
So now when people offer me pot, I can say, do I look like somebody who'd smoke pot?

105
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,460
Well, yeah, that's kid stuff for me.

106
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,920
Subgeniuses smoke have a frock.

107
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,020
Wait, wait, wait.

108
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,160
Can we go into the words, though?

109
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,520
Sometimes you keep using these.

110
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,240
Have a frock.

111
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,880
Sip your lot.

112
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,380
We just say frock for short, but it's a Tibetan word.

113
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,560
A lot of this stuff is Tibetan.

114
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,340
Okay.

115
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,520
That's what's in the pipe, right?

116
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,200
I don't know why.

117
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,720
I'm not sure why.

118
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,880
But nonetheless.

119
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,220
At one point, there was some stuff going on in Tibet.

120
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,040
Shortly after Philo got me high, and this was right at my house.

121
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,680
Luckily, the kids were gone.

122
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,220
The next thing I knew.

123
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:19,500
I was in a cave somewhere, and I was being pounded and abused from behind.

124
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,220
Just being sodomized savagely.

125
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:29,980
And I couldn't really turn around to see, but I could just hear this horrible low chuckling that scared me.

126
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,480
And there was this monster with a huge swollen head in front of me kind of holding me down.

127
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,760
And he was also laughing.

128
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,500
You look like you're about to laugh, Ivan.

129
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:41,880
Yeah.

130
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,360
Then I kind of passed out again.

131
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:51,580
And when I woke up, there was the creature with the giant head.

132
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,340
Like the head was there.

133
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,100
He was there, but the head deflated slowly.

134
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,400
And it was Philo.

135
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,840
And he said, say, now that you're here in Tibet.

136
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,840
I'm like, what?

137
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,940
He goes, I'd like you to meet Bob.

138
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,520
My friend, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

139
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,100
Yeah, we know Bob.

140
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,100
Hail Bob.

141
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,580
I turned around, and there was Bob standing there.

142
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,760
And he stuck his hand out and said, hey, would you like a job?

143
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,360
And I was going, no, I need a painkiller for my butt.

144
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,960
And he goes, I hear you like to work for nothing.

145
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,780
How much do you pay me for a job?

146
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,560
And I just went, for some reason, this guy, I would do anything.

147
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,260
I wanted to give him money.

148
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,780
And so I did.

149
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,680
I gave him all the money I had on me, which was only about $0.35.

150
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,100
But he was real impressed by that.

151
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,400
He said, you're hired.

152
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:54,460
And the next thing I knew, I was back in Dallas again in my little hovel.

153
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,120
And Philo started telling me about Bob's teachings.

154
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:06,460
It turns out this guy had been a salesman like Philo, but he was like the saint of sales.

155
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,500
He was the greatest.

156
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,920
He had supernatural sales power.

157
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,500
And he could sell.

158
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:18,440
For instance, religion to an atheist, which I guess I wasn't then.

159
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
I believed in almost everything.

160
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,660
I was really gullible.

161
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,440
But I believed in Bob more than anything.

162
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:37,860
And Philo basically said, Bob wants us to start a little publishing company and sell pornography and drugs and his teachings as a religion.

163
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,520
I was like, I don't know anything about religion.

164
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,760
He goes, oh, sure.

165
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,100
Sure you do.

166
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,360
Let's get, you know, oh, we just we need an enemy.

167
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,300
That's the conspiracy.

168
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,760
We need a special name to make us be different from everybody else.

169
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,820
That's subgenius.

170
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,460
Because, you know, if you were a genius, Stan, you'd be rich by now.

171
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,860
But you're just a subgenius.

172
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,920
Oh, that explains it.

173
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:10,340
And he, long story short, he ended up getting me to do all the work and put together these little pamphlets.

174
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,340
I got some.

175
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:11,860
Here.

176
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,920
Pamphlet.

177
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,260
Pamphlet number one.

178
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,460
This thing was published in January 1980.

179
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,360
So it's really easy to date.

180
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,580
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

181
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,800
You won't die if you join the Church of the Subgenius.

182
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,460
At that time, it was only 10 bucks.

183
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,700
And we didn't know what we were going to send people for 10 bucks.

184
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,120
So we studied the Masons.

185
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,560
We said the direct mail ads of all the cults that were very.

186
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,360
Success.

187
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,360
The Masons, the Scientologists and a lot of obscure ones.

188
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,680
Like the Church of Beaver Cleaver and stuff like that.

189
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:58,380
I didn't even know who the Discordians were, except that I had read Illuminatus by Bob Wilson and Bob Shea.

190
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,880
And that mentioned the Discordian.

191
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,060
They had a bunch of funny stuff in this Discordian religion.

192
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,080
But I thought it was something Shea and Wilson had made up.

193
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,940
It turned out.

194
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,260
It had been.

195
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,360
It had been made up by a completely different bunch of weirdos.

196
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,200
Greg Hill and Kerry Thornley.

197
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,320
I'm going to I'm going to pause for a second.

198
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,760
This is our next book.

199
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:31,780
It's it's Kerry Thornley's autobiography of how he got sucked into the JFK assassination.

200
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,220
Oh, wow.

201
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,700
What does that come out?

202
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:34,960
Yeah.

203
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,560
He ended up being sort of a friend of ours.

204
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,740
He's been dead for a long time now.

205
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,200
When's that book come in?

206
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:41,640
When's that book come out, sir?

207
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,080
As soon as I finish the foreword, I think.

208
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,700
OK.

209
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,520
My friend, O'Nan Canobite, really assembled it.

210
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,820
I didn't I didn't really know that much about Thornley, except that he was crazy and paranoid.

211
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,820
But now his book is quite clearly written and he doesn't.

212
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,140
His main concern is that he sounds crazy and paranoid.

213
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,640
He was really worried about becoming crazy and paranoid.

214
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,120
And he really did.

215
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,240
He actually did become crazy and truly paranoid.

216
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,500
Which is kind of sad.

217
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,180
But but he did.

218
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,460
He did write that.

219
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,800
But anyway, the next thing I knew, we did this little pamphlets.

220
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:28,780
We were just going to leave them in laundromats, you know, like shit comics or Jehovah's Witness watchtower magazines.

221
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,140
That was kind of what we were aspiring to.

222
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,320
We were going.

223
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,020
We hope to someday do.

224
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,240
Pamphlets as richly illustrated as the Jehovah's Witness.

225
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:48,200
And we had all we had was clip art that came from the Yellow Pages, Yellow Page clip art.

226
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,540
Remember, Philo was a Yellow Page salesman.

227
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,640
That's where we found the picture of Bob.

228
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:02,220
Bob had been posing for ads in magazines and TV for decades already, just to sort of plant hints of his presence.

229
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,660
And we had found all these pictures of him in old magazines.

230
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,640
You know, he'd be selling Dobbs hats.

231
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:18,840
Or pipes or he'd always be in a hammock and his wife or somebody would be mowing the lawn or he'd be fishing.

232
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,760
He obviously had slack in all these ads.

233
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,580
That was the other element of the religion.

234
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,120
What do you have to offer the believers?

235
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,520
And that was slack.

236
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:35,080
The conspiracy, which is all people who are not subgeniuses are are trying to rob away your slack.

237
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,200
That's obvious.

238
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,820
You know, you can't argue with that.

239
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,760
The duh.

240
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,720
It just that explains everything.

241
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,180
So.

242
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,280
But there was a kind of a time limit on all this.

243
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:51,320
Bob said the world was going to end July 5th, 1998 at seven o'clock in the morning.

244
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,240
It would end for everybody who wasn't a dues paying subgenius.

245
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,660
Like I said back then, it only cost 10 bucks.

246
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,600
Now it's forty four ninety nine.

247
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,660
Price just went up for the first time after 10 years.

248
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,820
And you get a lot of stuff for that, by the way.

249
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,320
It's a big package.

250
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,780
Sign me up.

251
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,080
The listeners can't see this huge package full of eight by ten.

252
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,780
Bob Bennett bursting at the seams.

253
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,600
Wow.

254
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,580
It's got a little decoder pin, a minister's card.

255
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,320
You'll be a real minister.

256
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,800
You actually can perform weddings and I perform.

257
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,040
I perform more than I can count.

258
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,320
I mean, really, what dozens of weddings?

259
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,920
The money is in divorces, though, guys.

260
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,700
Of course.

261
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,120
You know.

262
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,040
Lawyers do a lot better than preachers.

263
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,280
What's the website so I can buy one right now?

264
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:45,860
Yes.

265
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,360
So genius dot com.

266
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,560
So genius dot com.

267
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,520
And if you can spell subgenius, you may just be one.

268
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,720
Well, well, even if you spell it wrong, you'll probably get there.

269
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,560
So genius doesn't have an O in it, but dot and calm.

270
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,580
So genius is right.

271
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,160
Dot com.

272
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,100
Or is that is that fake?

273
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,560
So genius dot com.

274
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,380
I've been can I do a recap?

275
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,000
The story.

276
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,700
Here real quick.

277
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,140
Sure.

278
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,280
OK, so you go smoke weed.

279
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,700
Next thing, you know, in Tibet.

280
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,400
Being sodomized by the spirit of Bob.

281
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,720
Well, we're not sure, but but that's a guess.

282
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,480
OK, so you smoke weed.

283
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,880
Bada bing, bada boom.

284
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,280
You're in a cave in Tibet getting by a spirit.

285
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,860
Bada bing, bada boom.

286
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,500
That spirit tells you to start a religion.

287
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,940
Bada bing, bada boom.

288
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,640
You got pamphlets and we are where we are today.

289
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,100
And in the.

290
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,380
In this time.

291
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,220
Right.

292
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,680
And wow, man, what a story, bro.

293
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,440
That's incredible.

294
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,440
So that was just the beginning.

295
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,420
So give me.

296
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,060
Give me Chris.

297
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,200
Four people started believing it.

298
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,620
Chris, we haven't even people started joining up and clamoring.

299
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,740
We haven't even hit our stride yet.

300
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,600
Chris, respectfully, Reverend Stang, please continue.

301
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,140
My wife was really ticked off about this whole non paying job thing.

302
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,120
I was working my ass off.

303
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,320
Understandably so.

304
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:09,820
Right.

305
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:17,480
And she said, you need to send that stupid pamphlet to publishers and see if they'll pay you to make a book.

306
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,640
And I went, what?

307
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,600
It never occurred to us.

308
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:26,440
Well, at that time in the United States alone, there were like 150 publishers.

309
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,500
There's now about three.

310
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:38,940
We sent the pamphlet and like a fake agent letter as if Phyla was my agent or the agent for subgenius foundation.

311
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,620
Is Phyla a real human being or is this?

312
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,060
Yes.

313
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,840
Huh?

314
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,340
Is Phyla an actual human being like flesh and blood?

315
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,960
Like you have a photograph of this person?

316
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,460
Well.

317
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,160
Well, not that I need it.

318
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,580
I'm just, you know, it was, but I just want to see.

319
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,420
That's his counterpart.

320
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,560
The only one, you know, nobody worships me or Phyla.

321
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,680
They worship Bob.

322
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,560
They just got pictures.

323
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,340
Bob and masks.

324
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,800
See the masks behind me.

325
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,760
Reverend Stang, don't.

326
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:08,920
Don't.

327
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:08,920


328
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:08,920


329
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:08,920


330
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:08,920


331
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,480
Don't mind our resident skeptic here.

332
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,660
He's a little bit behind.

333
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,640
No, no, no, no.

334
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,300
Not skeptic.

335
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,900
Not skeptic.

336
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,880
I want to understand the story correctly.

337
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,600
Understandably so.

338
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,860
My wife made me send the pamphlet to all these publishers, all of whom either rejected it

339
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,260
or just threw it in the trash.

340
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:26,980
Cool.

341
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,640
But the first place we'd send them were the underground comics publishers.

342
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,940
Cause Phyla and I were both big comic book fans, especially undergrounds like Robert

343
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,600
Crumb's things.

344
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,760
The sap comics.

345
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,340
The comics, fabulous furry freak brothers.

346
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,640
Those guys were our heroes.

347
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,300
Those artists were.

348
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,420
And so we send them to those publishers and all three of the main publishers just threw

349
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,900
them in the trash and said, why do these kooks send us this crap?

350
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,040
But the artists in each, in each of those places, rip off press and last gasp.

351
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,980
They the art, an artist or two would fish it out of the trash and go, this stuff's great.

352
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,720
They're they're using clip art just like we are.

353
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,620
Cause everybody'd suddenly start doing it.

354
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,160
All punk posters were all made of clip art.

355
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,440
All of a sudden it was like, cool.

356
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,720
We were just doing it because we were cheap.

357
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,580
Well, next thing we knew we had these famous underground artists helping us, you know,

358
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,860
descendant to each other and they reviewed it.

359
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,600
They Robert Crumb printed our pamphlet in his first issue of weirdo magazine.

360
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Paul Mavridis at ripoff press ended up being our partner and doing a whole lot of the best

361
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,520
art and his roommate, Hal Robbins started.

362
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,320
Yeah.

363
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,280
And those guys could draw like clip art.

364
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:47,440
So at that point, philo and I would give them like stick figure drawings and that we designed

365
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,020
and then they were turning them into really nice drawings.

366
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,020
One drawing cause the secret service to show up at my door.

367
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,500
They didn't even have my name, right?

368
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,260
They, they, they, they, they, they only had my first and middle name or Sutter.

369
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,280
I could have said, no, I'm not here.

370
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,620
But they.

371
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:14,040
Basically, somebody in the airport had been waving our pamphlets around to people going, have you heard the good news?

372
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,780
Bob is dead or something, you know, whatever.

373
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,880
And it freaked somebody out.

374
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:29,840
And especially this picture right here, it shows Bob and Jesus and Elvis and JFK and Buddha.

375
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,940
That's incredible.

376
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,260
Fighting a Hydra.

377
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:41,220
And one, the Hydra is like the arms are labeled anti-Bob, rival cults, pink boys and normals.

378
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,960
And one was labeled Reagan or any president.

379
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,700
And that's what the Secret Service didn't find funny.

380
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,920
They said, please don't publish that again.

381
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,680
Well, it was already in our book.

382
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,640
I said, OK, we won't publish it again.

383
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,280
People magazine published it.

384
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,580
Millions of people saw it.

385
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,240
And believe it or not, a glowing review of books.

386
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:10,500
Look at this subgenius, which ended up being published by one of the publishers who'd thrown it in the trash first.

387
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,040
But or secretary thrown it in the trash.

388
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:24,520
But this guy was on a picnic in New York with my sister-in-law and found a pamphlet crumpled up on the backseat of her car and went, where did this come from?

389
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,240
This is hilarious.

390
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,520
They thought he they thought it was a joke.

391
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,960
See, I mean, a lot of people think Bob's not real.

392
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,240
But my my butt will tell you.

393
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,280
Yeah, Bob's real.

394
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,300
All too real.

395
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,820
Large, too.

396
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,780
Large and in charge.

397
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,080
Big old Bob.

398
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,820
Big Bob.

399
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,580
What's up, Bob?

400
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,460
He doesn't he doesn't he doesn't show off how many inches he has.

401
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,500
Is he circumcised?

402
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,720
He writes about numbers of.

403
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,280
So Bob's got that thing on him, son.

404
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,920
He's got a bunch of things.

405
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,180
He's got more than one.

406
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,660
That's that's Bob.

407
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,440
The next thing we know, we were partying with rock stars.

408
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,840
And we, of course, immediately got got hooked on drugs.

409
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,440
We couldn't afford and went off the deep end and had to go to rehab.

410
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:19,520
And then we switched to just to just frop alone and frop derivatives, you know, from all and from.

411
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,460
That's what's in his pipe, right?

412
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,560
Ivan and Bob.

413
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:32,780
Well, actually, Bob's pipe, what he usually smokes from what we can tell is this cheap Borkham riff cherry blend.

414
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,060
It's just some crap.

415
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:34,540
You get it.

416
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,900
It's the cheapest crap at the pipe store.

417
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,400
Yeah.

418
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:46,120
But the thing is, he never no one has ever seen him either refill it or light it or for that matter, remove it from his mouth.

419
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,960
In fact, if you look at the picture, it's almost like the pipe is glued up against his teeth.

420
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,480
He didn't have his mouth open to hold the pipe.

421
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,580
It's up against these clothes.

422
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,680
It's the weirdest thing.

423
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,040
Great teeth, though.

424
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,460
Honey.

425
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:11,740
Well, he's he's the perfect Caucasian in a way, you know, bottled after.

426
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:20,540
I wore a Bob T-shirt around Beijing, China in the 80s, working on a documentary film on my side job.

427
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,080
And Chinese just would look at that picture and crack up.

428
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,020
They thought it was hilarious.

429
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,140
I guess to them, it was an exaggerated white man, you know, like a caricature.

430
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,660
And they thought, oh, little white man knows how ugly they are.

431
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:52,100
Something, you know, that was I actually handed I gave a copy of Book of the Subgenius to the the only Chinese subgenius, a guy named Li Li Jing at Tiananmen Square.

432
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,400
Because it's the day before we were going to leave and they wanted us to see Tiananmen Square.

433
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,240
And it was I swear to God, three years to the day before the Tiananmen Square.

434
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,460
Massacre.

435
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,220
Wow.

436
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,940
A book of the subgenius was left in China there.

437
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:20,400
And exactly three years later, they sent a bunch of army guys from the boonies hopped up on meth to go kill those bad students, kids.

438
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,820
So, Ivan, real quick, Bob's message.

439
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,420
Can you give him a synopsis of the message?

440
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,180
Yes.

441
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,680
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

442
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,260
The subgenius must have slack.

443
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:32,620
Yeah.

444
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:39,380
You can gain slack by pulling the wool over your own eyes, relaxing the safety of your own delusions.

445
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,600
Too much, he said, is always better than not enough.

446
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,680
Which are actually words more like words to die by than to live by.

447
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,260
But it sounds good.

448
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,080
That's the thing about all Bob's aphorisms and sayings and quotes and quips.

449
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,400
They all sound really good.

450
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,460
But the main thing is the subgenius must have slack.

451
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:11,780
And what that also means is that if a person is a subgenius, it has slack.

452
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,540
That you're born with original slack.

453
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,000
But the conspiracy starts trying to take it away from you.

454
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,260
They whack you behind and make you cry as soon as you're born.

455
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,700
Start taking away your slack right then.

456
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,220
You're just fine sitting there suffocating.

457
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,120
But they whack your butt and suddenly you have to breathe.

458
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,000
And that's it all begins.

459
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,240
It's where all the.

460
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,380
Eventually.

461
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,740
You end up with a job.

462
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,000
In fact, even.

463
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,180
I'm still stuck with this job.

464
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,180
I should be retired by now.

465
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,600
I'm 68 years old.

466
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,120
Why am I still working for Bob?

467
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,400
You need a little slack.

468
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,980
Bob needs to give you a little slack.

469
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,440
He owed.

470
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,440
Actually, he did finally pay off.

471
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,040
I went for.

472
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,860
The 80s were really, really fun.

473
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,780
We met all of our heroes and they slapped us on the back and said,

474
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,240
we were.

475
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,460
Cool.

476
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,040
And so my whole life goal was achieved by the time I was about 30 years old.

477
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,840
And then, then, then we just, it never got big.

478
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:19,500
I, we, we got sort of famous among weirdos.

479
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,900
But it never got big.

480
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,780
I, I.

481
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,080
Finally around 2000.

482
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,420
I realized if I did all the work myself.

483
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,960
I could, and didn't do anything else.

484
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,160
I could actually.

485
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,940
Afford half of the house and half the utilities.

486
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,420
And so I got remarried.

487
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,920
And now everything's fine.

488
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,460
I haven't had to work for anybody else for 22 years or something now.

489
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:48,780
So.

490
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,300
Blessings, Bob's blessings.

491
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,880
So I, I, I use, I mean, one for a couple hours a day, I have to sit here.

492
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,560
And fill orders.

493
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,720
I mean, you'd think that I'd have minions, what this being a cult and everything.

494
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,920
There should be minions everywhere.

495
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,500
But none of us can stand minion types.

496
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,860
In fact, when, when we've gotten people who were.

497
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,820
Volunteers that really wanted to help.

498
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,780
The reason they had so much spare time to volunteer was that they were incompetent.

499
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,680
At everything.

500
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,820
Now you can be a sub genius and be completely incompetent.

501
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,020
That.

502
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,960
At all, but one thing that's that, that describes a lot of sub geniuses.

503
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,580
And then there's, there's the kind who.

504
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,820
Can do a little bit of everything, but nothing quite well enough to make a buck.

505
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,860
That's the other kind of set team.

506
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,100
Anyway, we, we.

507
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,860
Heck somebody made a really good movie about us a couple of years ago.

508
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:52,400
2019 Bob Dobson, the church of the sub genius directed by Sandy Boone.

509
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:59,760
Who, who actually was, uh, she was a widow of a, of an early contributor who, uh, film

510
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,600
another filmmaker guy in Texas, uh, David Boone.

511
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,620
And he, he died young.

512
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,980
And she ended up becoming a filmmaker herself and she wanted to kind of, she

513
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,600
wanted to finish his movie, but first to get her director's chops, she decided to

514
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,380
do a documentary about sub genius.

515
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,680
She figured that'd be easy.

516
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,540
Well, two years.

517
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:26,920
And half a million bucks later, she actually got the movie done and it was

518
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,360
showing in film festivals and getting the loss of good attention because it's real

519
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:30,700
funny.

520
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,840
It's very good movie.

521
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,180
It moves fast.

522
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,360
And, but then COVID hit no theater sales, no distribution to speak of.

523
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,200
So

524
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,820
sounds very reminiscent of that TNM in square nonsense.

525
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,620
Sounds like the three years.

526
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,100
Yeah.

527
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,860
You guys maybe are tapping into the collective consciousness, like an

528
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,800
acupuncture needle with this type of work.

529
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,880
But I wanted to ask a question that comes to mind because it's a little bit relevant

530
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,820
to how I feel.

531
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,380
I mean, I first came across the church of the sub genius being a cannabis smoker since

532
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,540
the age of 16.

533
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:13,580
I found the church of the sub genius on the internet looking at various alternative

534
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,820
religions that I could maybe try on like a hat.

535
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:23,140
And I never quite understood fully maybe until today what the church of the sub genius

536
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:31,560
really comprised of, but it definitely mystified me and gave me a sort of a look into a fringe

537
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,120
alternative culture that sadly I was too young to participate in.

538
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:41,280
But can you tell us more about how the internet played a role in the earlier days of the church

539
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,140
of the sub genius after the eighties?

540
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,780
Well, that, yeah, that, that, that wasn't the earlier days anymore.

541
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,380
We were about to, I was about to throw in the towel, really.

542
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,500
We were, we were doing everything by mail order and checks.

543
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,660
We didn't even run credit cards.

544
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,360
It was very.

545
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:01,940
Primitive.

546
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,680
And, and yet I was busting ass.

547
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:11,480
We did a lot of live shows then we hooked up with different bands and we do these

548
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,020
devivals in bars.

549
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,940
I know I've never actually set foot in a comedy club, believe it or not.

550
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,180
But we, but yeah, I would, I found myself.

551
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:26,700
No, or at least every month, it's some town standing up on a stage in between bands,

552
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,300
ranting my ass off and not, and never making quite.

553
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,560
Enough money breaking my back, calling stuff to sell.

554
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:43,900
And, but, and then Philo knew he knew what the internet was before most people did because of his,

555
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,680
by that time he was, it was like a systems analysis for the phone company.

556
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,540
It's like 80 people working under him.

557
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,600
He was the conspiracy.

558
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,300
And, but he said, look, you've got, you've got to do this internet thing.

559
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,800
He goes, do you have one of those, those, America online coasters?

560
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,180
Land?

561
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,280


562
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,060
Hang around the house.

563
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,060
It's about back in around 1993.

564
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:12,080
America online would mail you a new disc every day in a little can trying to get people to sign up.

565
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:20,220
But of course they were charging $3 a minute and he, he, he, he put it in my little computer.

566
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,160
Got hooked of computer up a phone.

567
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,620
And finally I saw what the internet was and I saw how much America online was charging.

568
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,060
So I immediately learned how to.

569
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,980
work under the hood and join the Cleveland free net,

570
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,420
even though I was in Dallas, those people already knew who we were at MIT.

571
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,080
There was a big news group,

572
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,680
but a use net or what they used to call bulletin boards.

573
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,080
There's been a subgenius bulletin board there since 1983.

574
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,060
So they welcome the internet welcomed us with open arms.

575
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,880
And about that time I got a young partner, Jesus, not Jesus from the Bible,

576
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,920
but he looks like.

577
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,960
And that was part one of the podcast.

578
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,880
My family thinks I'm crazy with me being interviewed.

579
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,940
Now the ask Dr.

580
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,160
Howell show from radio Valencia sometime before October, 2013.

581
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,760
.

582
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,440
.

583
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,620
Okay, I turned it down for real.

584
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,700
Wait, let me...

585
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:35,900
What?

586
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,260
Well, I think now we have matters...

587
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,380
We're starting to get off now.

588
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,700
Ladies and germs, this is the Ask Dr. Howell Show,

589
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,660
live on Puzzling Evidence Radio,

590
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,200
and I'm your boastful host, Dr. Howell and all.

591
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,160
He's actually the living embodiment of humility.

592
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,460
In the cruel, gray city of love,

593
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,140
high above the pulsating heart of San Francisco's mission district.

594
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,240
You might notice the pope himself has named himself after us.

595
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:20,400
Well, that's just because someone must follow where bold innovation leads.

596
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,680
Well, we are both named after the same man,

597
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,320
so I would expect a pope to visit San Francisco.

598
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,220
That may happen.

599
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,860
I remember...

600
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,360
I remember when the previous pope arrived,

601
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,000
I saw his pope-mobile going down Gary Street

602
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,900
at a high rate of speed,

603
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,080
with him standing up inside the bulletproof square.

604
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,700
But at least I got to see that.

605
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,560
Why was he speeding?

606
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,680
That's the question.

607
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,800
You'd think he'd go slow, but he's really zipping along,

608
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,380
and yet he's standing up.

609
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,460
Well, it's all part of the...

610
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,980
It must have been kind of scary to be pope,

611
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,760
to have to go riding around like that.

612
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,220
I'd love to have...

613
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,860
Surely, if you were a favorite of God,

614
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,180
no mere auto accident could...

615
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,420
Well, no, he got shot riding around in that thing.

616
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,080
Well, the bulletproof glass is to prevent that from happening.

617
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,460
Of course, today, the Republicans have made it legal

618
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,240
to own bullets as large as bananas.

619
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,980
And you can fire those...

620
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,680
That's what you're going to need.

621
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,140
...through the papal enclosure.

622
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,620
We're not recommending this, though.

623
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,340
Not at all.

624
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,160
The show does not...

625
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,600
We've got a saintly pontiff in the Vatican now,

626
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,280
and so it would be pointless to remove him, doesn't it?

627
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,260
These days.

628
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,140
Oh, wow. There we go.

629
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:31,540
Yes.

630
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,120
No, I thought it just takes gravity

631
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,080
and a horrible mistake in space.

632
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:36,960
And comedy.

633
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,360
And 3-D glasses.

634
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,420
What's the deal with gravity?

635
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,720
Everyone loves gravity.

636
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,380
I offer them a ride home, and they...

637
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,100
In 3-D.

638
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,860
In 3-D.

639
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:50,200
We have quite a quorum here on the Ask Dr. Hal show at this point.

640
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,760
We've got puzzling evidence.

641
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,640
We've got Michael Pepe.

642
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,440
Yes, yes.

643
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,800
Bubba Free Imho Pep.

644
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,620
We have Rusty...

645
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,480
Rebar.

646
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,740
And we have astronomer royal to the Ask Dr. Hal show, Pete Goldie.

647
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,120
Let's give ourselves a big hand.

648
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,380
Five fingers of fate.

649
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,560
Let's give each other half of a reach around.

650
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,940
That's the sound of one hand clapping.

651
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,680
Then I'd rather not...

652
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,220
I'm trying to think of...

653
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,160
Five things that I could...

654
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,220
Well, there's no point in that.

655
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,560
Obviously.

656
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,680
Nothing could be more fascinating than the conversation which we are capable of having.

657
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,320
So, thinking of something is a pointless exercise.

658
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,020
In fact, so frighteningly interesting that we better not even attempt it.

659
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:46,220
Also, there's the problem of whatever we mention on the radio comes into being, which has caused us trouble in the past.

660
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,240
That's right.

661
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,400
That's a problem.

662
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,120
What, like Lathe of Heaven?

663
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,940
Yes, or nuclear holocaust.

664
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,380
Or everything ever opined by Glenn Beck.

665
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,860
Is that where all the Glenn Beck...

666
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,260
That's what he talks about.

667
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,240
That's what we're talking about.

668
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,680
No, the...

669
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,600
We talk about...

670
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,740
It's money that causes...

671
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,220
It causes Glenn Beck to come into being.

672
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:00,700
...an earthquake.

673
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,040
However, we can cause an earthquake into...

674
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,600
Yeah, but let's not...

675
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,220
...it's primarily disgusting.

676
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,520
...do that or use the E word in any context, lest we be blamed should one occur.

677
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,500
...as we approach October 17th.

678
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,220
And what's so all-fired significant about...

679
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:17,480
...the day of the earthquake.

680
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,220
Oh.

681
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,580
Let me get out of your way.

682
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,640
Oh, God, hello.

683
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,640
Uh, well, um...

684
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,060
What, what?

685
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,680
Do radio?

686
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,300
Play...

687
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,980
Perform on radio?

688
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,240
I'm missing an important...

689
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,220
What's on your mind?

690
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,980
You're letting everything fall by the wayside.

691
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,940
Check the program, stay on the line.

692
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,960
Pay the alphabet.

693
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,800
Back...

694
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,420
Back...

695
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:57,420


696
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:57,420


697
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:57,420


698
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:57,420


699
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:57,720
No time.

700
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,480
Got your problems, well I've got mine

701
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,780
Lost trends you shut inside your mind

702
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,740
What's on your radio?

703
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,560
What's on your radio?

704
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,320
What's on your radio?

705
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,900
Where do you wanna go?

706
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,720
What do you wanna know?

707
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,420
What's on your radio?

708
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,080
Radio

709
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,760
What's on your radio?

710
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,200
And you get as a souvenir

711
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,760
A specially crafted Ask Dr. Howe question slip and envelope

712
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,060
Thank you very much everyone, thank you

713
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,880
The show will be scintillant

714
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,160
And we will raise our eyes to the stars

715
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,520
Yes, and now everyone

716
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,740
I wish to present our

717
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,900
What has been awarded

718
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,940
Open this up please

719
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,380
I'm questioning what's in there

720
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,920
Yes, easy

721
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,160
The Nobel Prize

722
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,520
And we put out a piece of Nobel

723
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,860
2013 has been awarded to

724
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,160
I can do it

725
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Are you ready for that?

726
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,720
Dr. Howe

727
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,360
Harold

728
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,100
Harry Robbins

729
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,380
Oh that's not

730
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,280
BSQ

731
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,900
It's sort of like breaking an ampule

732
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,580
No

733
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,560
What is this?

734
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,360
Mike carefully constructed all that work

735
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,400
For nothing

736
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,740
Grown

737
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,360
Grown air quotes

738
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,960
And now I've grown

739
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,740
Seeing my careful handiwork

740
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,000
All shared

741
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,860
I'll tell you what

742
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,440
I'll save half

743
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,020
Look, you can have that back

744
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,360
Wait

745
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,100
All right

746
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,900
Very nice

747
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,740
I'm gonna be like Emmett Kelly

748
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,560
There's a lot in here

749
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:32,560


750
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,040
Yeah, I'll just put this away

751
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,900
Well, anyway

752
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,620
It's necessity

753
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,640
The mother of invention

754
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,200
Don't worry

755
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,000
You will before long

756
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,280
So there's no point in whining and nagging

757
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,160
Under this intense level of bombardment

758
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,760
It's difficult to keep the show going

759
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,320
Volcanoes, the earthquakes

760
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,940
The government shutdown

761
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,820
Thank you very much

762
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,820
We're going to soldier through this crisis

763
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,620
Did you see the program?

764
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,580
The ten different

765
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,580
The ten most important ways humanity will extinct itself

766
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,320
All at the same time

767
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,260
Wonderful, entertaining PBS

768
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,900
Sounds hilarious

769
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,920
Using radio?

770
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,680
Using computer CGI and so on

771
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,760
Yes, CGI is how humanity will exterminate itself

772
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,320
I destroyed myself years ago with computers

773
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:21,860
So over that

774
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,680
Now, nuclear

775
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,840
The Holocaust was third, I think, in the world

776
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:25,840


777
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:25,840


778
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,400
I think, you know, global warming was one

779
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,260
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen

780
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,040
Yes, nuclear holocausts can be habit forming

781
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,600
This is why we don't want to have them

782
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,200
Man-made old policies

783
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,300
You know, and now, of course, our

784
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:44,980
The fact that Pakistan is developing its long-range rockets

785
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,540
Yes

786
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,640
Should certainly be an ember in every thoughtful, personalized pipe

787
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,020
And this year will be great

788
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,760
And try that

789
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,000
The number five

790
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,340
Five

791
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,060
The most dangerous threat of mass extinction

792
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,120
Is physics experiments

793
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,300
Really?

794
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,900
Which are, they declare to be

795
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,480
You know, accelerating particles

796
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,240
They might get the wrong two particles to click

797
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,300
Well, it's this idea that small black holes

798
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,540
I don't think that happens every day

799
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,480
Small black holes are created

800
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:20,200
And they create tremendous thousands of these high energy experiments every day

801
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,440
And they may create these microscopic black holes

802
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,360
Not every day

803
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,400
They have downtime during the winter

804
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,880
Because they get to use the electricity

805
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,460
You know, sometimes twice on Sunday

806
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,500
Obnoxious

807
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,960
I was surprised they made number five, though

808
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,800
They were ahead of global warming, I think

809
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,000
And the killer whales

810
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,140
I think someone's downstairs

811
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,160
Did anyone ever close the gates?

812
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,900
I think we left them wide open

813
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,540
What? No

814
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,400
To the shambling crowds of the impact down there

815
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,920
Zombies walking in

816
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,540
Yeah, they can come bumbling and stumbling up

817
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,880
But there's nothing to stop them

818
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,580
The gates are wide open

819
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,760
They're slow moving

820
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,780
But would they do good radio?

821
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,680
Avoid them for a while

822
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,440
They just always get you in the end

823
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,560
All right, enough time's gone by

824
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,160
I'm going to share a little wine with Hal

825
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,960
No one else

826
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,380
Careful

827
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,900
We might need that thing to fight for our lives

828
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,960
You don't need to lift it

829
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,280
Just move the hose around

830
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,180
Hoser, there you go

831
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,320
This is some wine, I must say

832
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,400
Very strongly flavored

833
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:19,940
Delicious

834
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,420
Yeah, it's from Safeway

835
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,140
Oh, that's

836
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,760
I thought you were talking about

837
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,580
Hey, speaking of meat, since Rusty's here

838
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,920
We bought some fried, some

839
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,340
Wow, wine is a muck

840
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,040
Air Strong's ink is raging

841
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,660
None for anyone else, none

842
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,660
Busted moose

843
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,040
Some signature cafe deli, hot deli

844
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,100
Fried chicken wings from last Friday

845
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,040
Psycho deli

846
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,180
And we cut into it before, like, biting into it

847
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:51,380
Right

848
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,820
Like bloody raw chicken

849
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,740
Oh, we, we, we

850
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:00,180
Inside the beautifully browned deep fried skin

851
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,260
That's a famous burnt raw recipe

852
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,300
Just cut them up like regular chicken

853
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,040
That's right

854
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,900
You know, these chickens

855
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,460
That's poisonous

856
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,880
They're probably not all frozen

857
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,480
Let's throw them in the fryer, you know

858
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,480
That's a serious crime

859
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,400
You've frozen in the Arctic ice caps

860
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,240
That's how people die

861
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,700
For millions of years

862
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,080
I reported them to their ethics department

863
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,940
These Archaeopteryxes found themselves

864
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,820
Through a bizarre chain of circumstances

865
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,280
To a local grocery store

866
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,140
Were you thanked for your good citizenhood

867
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,060
Of pointing out that they were selling

868
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,180
Oh no, I didn't put it on Facebook or anything

869
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,200
I'm only spreading the word now

870
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,020
That poison is chicken

871
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,740
Was it Foster Farms?

872
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,060
You should put it on Facecrack

873
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,840
Because they're the ones in trouble, you know

874
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,040
For the salmonella thing

875
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,980
Good question, don't know

876
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,900
But the, but the, but the, um

877
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,580
It was scary in the sense of

878
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,040
Salmonella's mom and pop market

879
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,160
Bloody chicken

880
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,440
Well, if you'd ever been anywhere near

881
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,900
While chickens are raised

882
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,320
Bloody chicken flourished over us

883
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,040
Have you ever done that?

884
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,560
Yeah, I worked at a chicken ranch

885
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,760
You done them chickens wrong

886
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,840
Were they mistreated?

887
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,200
Yes, mistreated

888
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,660
So were the workers

889
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,300
Ah

890
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,820
So, chicken workers of the world

891
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,780
It was a typical job

892
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,420
You know this chicken ranch in Novato

893
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,000
It was a, it was a holocaust

894
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,840
That's not the Mustang ranch, folks

895
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,440
No

896
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,100
No, that's different

897
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,080
They were very well treated, I'm sure

898
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,660
No, this was, this was a chicken ranch

899
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,240
They probably have a lot

900
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,580
They have a lot of, uh, well

901
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,780
Buterin, uh, oxycontin

902
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,920
Yes, they have all that

903
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,260
And a pension

904
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,540
Here we are only reflecting

905
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,520
The face of life

906
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,420
And the universe itself

907
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,660
By ensuring unfairness

908
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,940
To all those chickens

909
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,620
But why look at it

910
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:40,820
Entirely negatively

911
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,580
Because, uh, you may be aware

912
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,700
Of a recent news story

913
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,360
Where philanthropists allowed

914
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,260
Aging chickens to be flown

915
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,760
Out of California

916
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,600
To a chicken paradise

917
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,180
In the east coast

918
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:53,420
Oh, yes

919
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,580
Near Albany, New York

920
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,300
On earth

921
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,660
Right about there, New York

922
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,540
So there are some chickens

923
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,900
That actually managed to gain the system

924
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,560
And retire in comfort

925
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,260
Many people wrote in outrage

926
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:04,780
You know

927
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,160
How dare they not broil all those chickens

928
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,520
And feed them to the homeless

929
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,000
No, but, you know

930
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,600
Those chickens are probably on the Today Show

931
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,280
Uh

932
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,480
Celebrity, celebrity

933
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:14,740
I thought that was funny

934
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,060
Retired chickens

935
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:16,340
They've been

936
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:16,340


937
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:16,340


938
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:16,340


939
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:16,340


940
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:16,340


941
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:16,860
Settled in

942
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,620
In, uh

943
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,340
Chicken Elysium

944
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,840
Near Albany, New York

945
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,880
In the New York State Capital Region

946
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,480
Too old to be

947
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,380
Well, at some point

948
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,800
They must become too old

949
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,360
And rot

950
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:28,900
To be

951
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:29,720
Each chicken

952
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,100
Is given a daily massage

953
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,540
And a choice of

954
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,260
Special

955
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:33,800
No, that's indicative

956
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,560
Nutritive meals

957
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,820
Prepared by an avian chef

958
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,780
No, that's only

959
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,000
If they're going to kill them

960
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:39,280
Breakfast

961
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,740
Then they give them the massage

962
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,060
Corned beef

963
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,360
Hash

964
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,340
No, they're too old

965
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,780
They're too scraggly

966
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,540
That's why they were going to be destroyed

967
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:45,900
Originally

968
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,320
They're just going to be

969
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:46,320


970
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:46,320


971
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:46,520
Cougars

972
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,200
Before the philanthropists saved them

973
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,480
They were scraggly

974
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,140
Scrawny

975
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,660
And their feathers were falling out

976
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:51,780
Like Joan Rivers

977
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,240
They're cougars

978
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,160
They were

979
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,380
They were non-commercial

980
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,400
Laid many eggs

981
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,480
Many, many eggs

982
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,560
And it does something to you

983
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:57,860
You know

984
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,780
Laying all those eggs

985
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,440
Over the years

986
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,060
It does

987
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,560
I love eggs so much

988
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:01,860
Well

989
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,840
I'm sure they appreciate that

990
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,140
But

991
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,820
These chickens were taken off the assembly line

992
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,180
And allowed to

993
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,560
Do their egg laying

994
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,600
In their own way

995
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,680
For their own purposes

996
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,380
Although their eggs aren't that big

997
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,220
Or good anymore

998
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,360
After all these years

999
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:15,920
Still

1000
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,320
It's a good thing

1001
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,680
It's the principle of the thing

1002
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:17,940
And

1003
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,040
What do they make out of

1004
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,280
A really little omelet?

1005
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,540
This is where

1006
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,980
Chickens get to live

1007
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,700
The end of their days

1008
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,440
In happiness

1009
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,820
And pure delight

1010
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,440
I've been nice

1011
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,380
Does Chicken John know

1012
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,740
He has that ahead for him?

1013
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,100
And

1014
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,540
And when they die

1015
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,640
Can we eat them then?

1016
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,080
Not saying

1017
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,160
Not every chicken

1018
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,340
Gets into chicken paradise

1019
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:41,120
Oh, I'm not sure that eggs would fit

1020
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,300
Have you ever had really good deviled eggs?

1021
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:44,780
No

1022
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,360
And I

1023
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,200
Don't think I've ever had such a thing

1024
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:47,500
You're here with

1025
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,640
One of the biggest fans of deviled eggs

1026
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,460
That would be puzzling evidence

1027
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,280
Quite fond of you

1028
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:53,720
Well

1029
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,520
When I say

1030
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,300
Gnome saying

1031
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,080
You say

1032
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,220
Note your saying

1033
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:57,820
Yeah

1034
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,520
I know what you're saying too

1035
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,300
But I'm trying to transliterate it

1036
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:02,580
Gnome saying?

1037
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,900
Into an appreciation of a vanished series of bargains

1038
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,500
It's like

1039
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,340
I won't go

1040
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,700
I remember the gnome king

1041
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,580
Gnome saying?

1042
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,080
I remember his many sayings

1043
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,660
The thing about him was

1044
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,480
And somebody else says

1045
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,320
Note your saying

1046
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:16,320


1047
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:16,320


1048
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:16,320


1049
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:16,320


1050
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:16,320


1051
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:16,320


1052
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,480
He was terrified of eggs

1053
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,700
The gnome king

1054
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:21,700
Note your saying

1055
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,420
I never used to like

1056
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,200
I've been translated into Japanese

1057
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,440
I like the deviled egg society of Japan

1058
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,760
I never used to like corned beef hash

1059
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,500
But

1060
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,440
Daniel Mee

1061
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:32,460
Really?

1062
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,460
Doug turned me on to them

1063
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,800
That was a comfort

1064
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,460
Corned beef hash

1065
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,460
That's a good thing

1066
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,460
Like boiled cabbage

1067
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,500
You can't get enough of

1068
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:39,840
But they all

1069
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,500
Problem is

1070
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,780
Your mom didn't make that?

1071
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,380
I don't know

1072
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,080
You should give them a technical advisor fee

1073
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,240
Well, I see

1074
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,300
I'll give you a little bit of advice

1075
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:46,300


1076
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:46,300


1077
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:46,300


1078
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,180
You know what I think

1079
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:48,860
Let's give them deviled eggs

1080
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,060
Many are called

1081
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,460
But few are chosen

1082
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,580
It must have been very disconcerting for them

1083
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,680
To cross millions of miles of space

1084
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,860
And the trick of picking chicken

1085
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,600
Is picking what chicken to pick

1086
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,160
Only to be hit on the head with rotten orange

1087
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,120
Somebody

1088
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:01,120


1089
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,200
Hauser took his last extended trip in August

1090
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,940
His destination was the Grand Canyon

1091
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:05,260
President Hauser

1092
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,960
One of the few places he had yet to visit

1093
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,300
Really?

1094
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,100
He was late getting to the Grand Canyon

1095
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,880
He got as far as the Hoover Dam

1096
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,820
Oh

1097
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,880
And he was overcome with emotion

1098
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,420
Did he even make it?

1099
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:14,960
Obama you mean?

1100
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,300
No

1101
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:15,420
No

1102
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,060
Hill Hauser

1103
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:16,260
No

1104
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:16,280
No

1105
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:16,280


1106
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:16,280


1107
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:16,280


1108
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,480
He never went to the Grand Canyon

1109
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,480
He only went to the

1110
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,500
He drew his last breath at the dam

1111
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,340
Oh, on the show

1112
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,460
But I'm sure he got to be visited at the Grand Canyon

1113
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:23,460


1114
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:23,580
He wasn't

1115
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,520
The work of man

1116
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,440
No, he'd never been to the Grand Canyon

1117
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:25,740
Stymied him

1118
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,780
He never made that

1119
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,720
It's not in California

1120
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,360
His show is all about California

1121
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,340
The work of God

1122
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,040
California

1123
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,060
I want the Grand Canyon

1124
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,620
It's the greatest thing in the world

1125
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,580
I didn't see him doing shows outside of California

1126
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,120
Back to the starting gun

1127
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,440
The Grand Canyon is the most beautiful place in the world

1128
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,920
With flowers and child worship

1129
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,640
And the holiest

1130
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,000
And the holiest

1131
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,160
Most sacred place

1132
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,280
The most sacred place

1133
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,280


1134
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,280


1135
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,280


1136
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,280


1137
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,280


1138
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,640
Why, are you from Arizona or something?

1139
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:47,900
No

1140
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,220
I just know that

1141
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,020
Arizona, here I come

1142
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,420
What's their song?

1143
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,820
We would give you all the facts

1144
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,400
But we're just recalling what we know

1145
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:54,820
But you know what?

1146
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,780
Suddenly I have this

1147
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,120
Common history

1148
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,540
This horrible desire to ask a question

1149
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,260
Why isn't there a K-Rob moment on the Ask Dr. Hal show anymore?

1150
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:02,580
Yeah

1151
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,380
Well, you know, that's up to K-Rob

1152
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,400
And we might have to do it

1153
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,480
I think K-Rob is the only one that owns crack

1154
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,580
He doesn't want to share it

1155
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:09,760
Yeah

1156
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,340
Well, I love crack

1157
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,340
Something basic like that

1158
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,420
So he should bring it in and we'll do it

1159
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:13,800
Yep

1160
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,400
There's no

1161
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,260
Do you have a dollar for that?

1162
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:16,280


1163
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:16,280


1164
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:16,280


1165
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:16,280


1166
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:16,280


1167
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,000
Someone has to pay for it

1168
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,680
Oh, yeah, yeah

1169
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,540
Five dollars

1170
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,820
No, someone has to pay if we want crack

1171
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,740
Oh, I see

1172
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,820
Somebody has to buy it

1173
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,680
Oh, dear

1174
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,380
Forget it

1175
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,200
And also, you're right

1176
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,520
Let's charge five dollars for the show

1177
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,640
For our crack, okay?

1178
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:28,860
Yeah

1179
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,960
I thought they'd pay us

1180
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,220
So the break is on

1181
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,960
It'll be four or five seconds

1182
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,020
So it's just a great

1183
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,820
Prepare for subliminal puzzling evidence

1184
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,100
Information bursts

1185
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:39,640
Squirt

1186
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,480
Thank you

1187
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,680
Now return to your scheduled program

1188
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,120
Uh, I'm sorry

1189
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:46,260
I'm sorry

1190
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:46,260


1191
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:46,260


1192
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:46,260


1193
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:46,260


1194
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:46,260


1195
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:46,440
I'm sorry

1196
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,560
And there's a brief sign that's too fast to even read

1197
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,200
Horrible

1198
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:50,280
Horrible

1199
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,760
Most horrible

1200
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:58,200
Aside from which all the German shows are always either about either technological things

1201
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,360
or just cars

1202
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,840
And now we return you to our afternoon snoozer movie

1203
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,900
Face of the Screaming Werewolf

1204
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,920
Usually delivered by people with American accents who don't

1205
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,120
That's one I used to watch in Tucson, Arizona

1206
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,260
Seems like they know what they know

1207
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:22,540
They used to show packages of Mexican monster movies in Tucson, Arizona, back in the 60s.

1208
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:27,780
And the thing about them is not that they have the greatest production values,

1209
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:36,700
but they seem permeated by a sense that the people who made the movies actually believe that these monsters do exist.

1210
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:45,760
An air of superstitious dread hangs over their poorly made sets, costumes, and acting.

1211
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,280
I wonder if...

1212
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,260
And you also, at that time, you'd watch it in the middle of the night at 2 a.m.

1213
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,860
So that would add to...

1214
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,100
It's really scary. Oh, yeah.

1215
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,440
Well, it's nothing like late-night movies would be scary.

1216
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,920
Let me mention just one of these to you, which you probably remember, called Bubba Free Imho Pep.

1217
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,980
Perhaps greatest of all.

1218
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,960
Yeah, it's the only one they haven't done yet.

1219
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,000
Well, where are you getting your information?

1220
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:12,780
Except for Sgt. Fury.

1221
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,620
Is there a Michael Pepe movie?

1222
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:16,920
Not that I know of.

1223
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,260
Okay, I think they aren't going to do that.

1224
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,720
Yeah, no, well, but...

1225
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,680
Bubba Free Imho Pep.

1226
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,580
Is the most amazing and mysterious...

1227
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,540
Yes, and that's why they're not going to do it.

1228
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:27,780
...of all.

1229
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,020
Is he a bad guy?

1230
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:36,380
He's a magician. He's a wizard who is like a stoner, actually, who travels through other dimensions and...

1231
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,280
It's ecumenical, he said.

1232
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:43,140
He's a great guy, but they're never going to make a movie about him.

1233
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,880
He's a magician, a sorcerer who can cast spells.

1234
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,140
He's burlesqued in the puzzling evidence.

1235
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,060
Shows they have a hilarious caricature of him.

1236
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,920
I think he might be the last one to appear.

1237
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,520
Unless you appear, otherwise, there's gold to be made from mining these characters.

1238
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,440
We're done with the Burning Man music, right?

1239
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,100
We're done with it?

1240
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:01,840
Yes, absolutely.

1241
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,500
No more Burning Man.

1242
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,440
I was already done with it.

1243
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:03,700
It's the Throb.

1244
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,160
But I don't know why they wouldn't, because this is a very mystical era.

1245
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,040
It is after the New Age.

1246
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,140
There's plenty and plenty of people who will go in for spells.

1247
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,200
Channeling witchcraft.

1248
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,920
Yes, having their palm read.

1249
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,460
Aleister Crowley, etc., etc.

1250
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,360
And they would...

1251
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,300
And Edward Casey at the bat.

1252
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,900
Yes, and they would believe in Dr.

1253
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,780
Brayley Harbour.

1254
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,460
Live on puzzling evidence.

1255
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:36,500
Yes, they would, because they are too feeble-minded to exercise the power of imagination.

1256
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,160
That's right.

1257
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,700
But, you know, they believe in Spider-Man and Avengers and everything else.

1258
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,860
A certain portion of the credulous public...

1259
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:52,280
The public do and always have, like the owl hoots who used to fire their revolvers at the villain on the movie screen.

1260
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:58,520
But this is by no means what everybody thinks or the way everybody reacts.

1261
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,600
Most people are able to make the distinction there.

1262
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,100
Yes, it was a terrible thing.

1263
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:06,780
Frightful.

1264
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,320
Right.

1265
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:12,120
I wept for my country when I recollected that God is just.

1266
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,000
Yes.

1267
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,060
Male and female created he them.

1268
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:30,120
For are we anything more than dust motes floating in the cosmic beam?

1269
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,460
No, I'll tell you what we are.

1270
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,780
We are water to water.

1271
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,600
Because if...

1272
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,140
How?

1273
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:44,380
If we could attach an isotope to that one molecule of water, so is to follow.

1274
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,860
Through any...

1275
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:51,480
Possible corner from cloud to river to ice and back.

1276
00:54:52,460 --> 00:55:00,360
We might recognize in each turning how all lives, but most clearly are...

1277
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,480
Exist only in cycles.

1278
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,820
Like every other phase from...

1279
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,480
Wow.

1280
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,680
Long, long, long, long before.

1281
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:15,860
Until just...

1282
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,320
Shortly...

1283
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,200
After.

1284
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,480
It's not like those other radio stations you listen to.

1285
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,600
Other radio stations have delayed.

1286
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:38,080
Here, for the time being, we do not.

1287
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:38,680
Get it straight.

1288
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:45,500
And so you're actually listening, if you're listening at the present time, in a...

1289
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,240
A congruent time frame.

1290
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,720
So rare for radio listeners.

1291
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:57,860
But a special privilege that our etherettes and rocket rookies have, who are fervent fans of the Ask Dr. Hal radio program.

1292
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:04,980
It's taken years for us to develop the technology just to get to you directly, live.

1293
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,160
Let's go into the dark room and see what develops.

1294
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:08,360
Spontaneously.

1295
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,840
The air is electric with possibilities.

1296
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,560
Wow.

1297
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,020
And think of the other people who might be listening and writing reports.

1298
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,380
It really charms my heart.

1299
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,660
Many reports will be written about this.

1300
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,120
Oh, please don't write me up.

1301
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,780
I couldn't even find the logbook the last time.

1302
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,740
There's going to be so many reports written about just what's happening.

1303
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,000
Yes, I had another report.

1304
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,460
Moment of liveness.

1305
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,720
A loud report.

1306
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:33,960
Now they're saying...

1307
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,560
Well, you know, it's all being stored.

1308
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,300
So if they want to play it back and listen to it, they can at any time.

1309
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,120
Everything is stored.

1310
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:40,800
A holy playback.

1311
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,200
Everything is stored.

1312
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:42,840
Everything is stored.

1313
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,220
Most of it is at Wellman's house.

1314
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,220
In his computer.

1315
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,960
Yes, you've seen all those.

1316
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,480
He has stored almost everything in the universe.

1317
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,860
There's a little bit left.

1318
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,600
One electromagnetic pulse ought to take care of that.

1319
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:58,880
Such as...

1320
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,980
At least diversifying.

1321
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,460
Anyway, someone has to keep the threads in hand.

1322
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,800
The threads of life.

1323
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,120
Yes, you mean the seven sisters.

1324
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,480
Well, you just...

1325
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,960
You just don't want to snarl them all up.

1326
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:17,700
That's what I'm saying.

1327
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,540
Yeah, but what do they call?

1328
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:18,940
Keep the...

1329
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,180
Seven sisters.

1330
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,840
I know of three sisters.

1331
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:24,880
I'm sorry, the three.

1332
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,400
The three sisters known as the Norns.

1333
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,280
We weave the fate of humanity.

1334
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,400
Seven sisters is a series of peaks in Colorado.

1335
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,240
But the fate...

1336
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,960
How about this?

1337
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,480
A John Le Carre character called Memory.

1338
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,880
It's like, well, Memory heard about that.

1339
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,660
Johnny Mabnonic.

1340
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,340
Yes.

1341
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,080
Memory.

1342
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,400
That's what I'm talking about.

1343
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,360
The abusive thing.

1344
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,900
A character called Memory.

1345
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,040
No, it's a person.

1346
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:48,480
A character.

1347
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,840
A read me Dr. Memory.

1348
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,760
Dr. Memory.

1349
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,700
I don't know.

1350
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,660
Are you Dr. Memory?

1351
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,640
He forgets.

1352
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,020
Dr. Magnetic.

1353
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,340
Well, there's so many doctors.

1354
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,320
Yeah, I'm getting sick of that, too.

1355
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:11,000
Only real doctors can use it from now on.

1356
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:11,560
The rule.

1357
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,280
At least you have to have some sort of doctorate.

1358
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:14,680
Right.

1359
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:14,980
Tesla.

1360
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,500
The guy that did the Tesla coil.

1361
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,620
What did he call himself?

1362
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,280
Tesla.

1363
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,280
No.

1364
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,840
Then there's someone else called the idea.

1365
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,720
Thank you, Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence, Rusty Rebar, Bubba Free, Imho Pep, Michael Pepe,

1366
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:36,160
the late Peter Goldie, Dr. Philo Drummond, and Bishop Joey, founder of the St. Stupid's Day Parade,

1367
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,480
and the callers.

1368
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:42,900
And it's www.subgenius.com.

1369
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,960
That leads to...

1370
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:45,800
Thank you, everything.

1371
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,360
Thank y'all.

1372
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,480
And praise the dogs.
