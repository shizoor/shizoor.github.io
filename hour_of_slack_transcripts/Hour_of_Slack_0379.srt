00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt this program to bring you a live extemporaneous interview with the Reverend Jim Baker.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,900
There is no exemption from copyright for home taping, period, without the consent of the owner.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,700
But obviously there is no prosecution in this area going on.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,460
Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob!

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:23,880
Anytime there is a fixation, which means anytime that a performance of a work is committed to a medium,

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,540
the person who created that medium owns it.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,060
But I question whether a spontaneous radio show is the subject of copyright.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,160
We're getting into some fairly technical areas of copyright law here.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,480
I'd very seriously question whether this is a work as such and whether it can be copyrighted.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,080
Now this is not FTC approved.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,000
This is not for your children.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,940
This is not for your mother.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,780
We want people to make up their own minds.

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,480
FTC approved.

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,180
We are responsible for brain damage and loss of purposes.

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,280
We've got reverence.

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,600
We are responsible for paranormal effects.

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,660
No effects.

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,400
No effects.

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,280
No effects.

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,680
No effects.

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,600
No effects.

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:24,660


24
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,140
No effects.

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,420
No effects.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:25,840
No effects.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,640
No effects.

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:27,640


29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,520
No effects.

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,180
No effects.

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:29,980
No effects.

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


33
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


34
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


35
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


36
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


37
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


38
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


39
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


40
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


41
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


42
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


43
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:37,760
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

44
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,840
What?

45
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,660
I say the word start.

46
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,160
The test will begin.

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,340
Are you ready?

48
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,540
Start.

49
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,380
When was the last time you had your hearing checked?

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,140
I would advise him to learn to lip read.

51
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,660
Insert earplugs now.

52
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,640
What the hell?

53
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,100
Can't give up, dude.

54
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,760
It's not what I'd like to listen to,

55
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,700
but I don't think I should be able to tell the other people what they can or can't listen to.

56
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,440
Deafness is not only uncool, it's endurable.

57
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,640
When I die, I'll show my hearing.

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
Call now and receive a coupon for a free hearing test.

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,440
Guaranteed, you won't hear any of this music on elevator.

60
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,140
It's rock and roll!

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,800
Please, can I do a lap?

62
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,160
If you suspect a hearing loss or thought nothing could be done about it,

63
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,360
ask your family doctor.

64
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,840
Feel your eardrums explode!

65
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,780
This concludes this hearing test.

66
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,620
Thank you!

67
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,320
But this does not conclude this...

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,740
pledge drive, no.

69
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,920
Actually, that was, uh,

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,220
the piece you just heard was

71
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:18,340
from the new album by Out of Band Experience, or OBE,

72
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,880
whose t-shirt you can see me wearing here tonight.

73
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,860
Uh, and I will be giving you a phone number you can call

74
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,460
to, uh, speak to OBE, Out of Band Experience,

75
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,980
because, uh, they sent a wonderful album,

76
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,240
very Dobbs approved,

77
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,880
but, uh, you can't hear it unless you call the station and pledge.

78
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,700
This is Plunderphonics, man.

79
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,480
This is total Plunderphonics in the background.

80
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,600
And you're plundering our phonics if, uh, if you can't help out just a bit.

81
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,840
I mean, I know you're playing.

82
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,340
Broke.

83
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
Geez, man, I've been paying bills all day!

84
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,180
I'm bro- I'm- I started out with some money.

85
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,480
I paid bills in the morning.

86
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,300
By afternoon, I was dead broke.

87
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,420
So I know, I know exactly how you feel about-

88
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,400
Show start now.

89
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,640
Come on, let's-

90
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,720
No, no.

91
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,200
Oh.

92
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,940
Oh, well.

93
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,980
This is American Top 40.

94
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,880
I have climbed the highest mountains...

95
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,140
And guess what?

96
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,340
I've run through the fields...

97
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,960
Only to be with you.

98
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,260
Yep, with you.

99
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,820
No one else, just you.

100
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,920
Here's the first Top 40 hidden...

101
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,400
Guess what?

102
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,580
...for the Irish band from Dublin, who call themselves U2.

103
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,820
I have run, I have crawled, I have scaled these city walls!

104
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,500
Yeah! That's really great.

105
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,280
I can't believe I did it, but...

106
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,220
Nevertheless, I have done that for you.

107
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
That's the letter U and the numeral 2.

108
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,340
Only to be with you, I've done all these things.

109
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,980
Yeah, with you.

110
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,860
The fat one, that's it.

111
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,140
You're the fat one, and I want to be with you.

112
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,740
What's the matter?

113
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,800
I say, why was it changed, you?

114
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,220
But, on the other hand, I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

115
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,600
That's the letter U and the numeral 2.

116
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,800
Maybe they'll make it as a-

117
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,260
But, on the other hand, I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

118
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,260


119
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,580
That's the letter U and the numeral-

120
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,320
Nope, definitely not.

121
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:28,720
...2.

122
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,860
I haven't found it.

123
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,080
I just can't seem to find it.

124
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,140
That's the letter U and the numeral 2.

125
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,960
Nope, definitely not.

126
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
I haven't found it.

127
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,920
That's the letter U and the numeral 2.

128
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,320
Come on.

129
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,520
And here's what else I've done.

130
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,040
Come on, let's see what we can find.

131
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,000
I have kissed honey lips, felt a healing in her fingertips.

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,700
I've even done that.

133
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,720
That's the letter U and the numeral 2.

134
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,840
While I was doing that, you know, all the kissing on the honey lips?

135
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,060
It burned like fire, and it reminded me of cheap melting plastic,

136
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,580
the kind that makes little clouds of white vapor gas,

137
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,580
and then when it catches on fire,

138
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,540
makes those little, little strings of black smoke with little ashes attached to them.

139
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,900
That's how it was kissing honey lips.

140
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,020
Why are we doing it?

141
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,200
Why have we changed something?

142
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,240
I still haven't found it!

143
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,520
But...

144
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,500
What I'm looking for in that is, I just don't know...

145
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,000
The last thing we want to do is sound like nobody else.

146
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,260
That's the letter U and the numeral 2.

147
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,520
You've got to challenge it, you know, musically speaking.

148
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,080
You know, you've got to find new sounds on the guitar.

149
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,360
You've got to find a new way of approaching the 4th floor beat.

150
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,100
Yeah, you gotta find new ways, friend.

151
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:04,940
And that mix by Negative Land has become legendary and banned, extremely banned,

152
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:13,100
because of the nightmare of big corpo music's view of copyrights and money.

153
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:22,640
Negative Land, for those who weren't aware, is a pretty tiny budget art band,

154
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,660
very critically respected by me and many other people.

155
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,760
A band of geniuses who basically invented a new genre,

156
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:39,580
but they did a takeoff on the normals, dear friends, and they paid.

157
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,020
They really paid.

158
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,100
They got smashed.

159
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,660
Slashed, clobbered by the stark fist of first the legal department of Island Records,

160
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:55,000
and then by the backstabbing, thieving so-called alternative record distributor, SST.

161
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,740
And Negative Land is now consigned to brokenness,

162
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,600
much like we here in the Church of the Subgenius.

163
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,360
Negative Land is also consigned to this eternal legal nightmare

164
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,080
because of dubiousness.

165
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,860
They're doing their takeoff on a normal, very rich band.

166
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,780
But also, at the same time, they become heroes.

167
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,180
Heroes, dear friends, to all real artists.

168
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,200
The martyrs to artful freedom.

169
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,680
To tweak the cheeks of the mega-biz giants, such as the band U2.

170
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:38,180
Now, U2 wouldn't be such bad guys, except that they didn't lift a finger

171
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,020
to stop the corporate giant that they were in bed with.

172
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,080
U2.

173
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,080


174
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,620
U2.

175
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


176
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


177
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


178
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


179
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


180
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


181
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


182
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


183
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


184
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


185
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


186
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


187
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,700


188
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,700
Wrecking the lives of these innocent, if, and concerned, very concerned,

189
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,700
if mischievous fellows, Negative Land.

190
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,400
I should be saying American Top 40 is her.

191
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,620
Are you too married for a great idea?

192
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,180
It was every week American Top 40 is heard.

193
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,680
Everything is topsy-turvy.

194
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,700
Topsy it is.

195
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,240
Is it to just screw up things?

196
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,880
Marriage is not you too living for each other.

197
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,320
Because I can't say this.

198
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,680
You know.

199
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,600
Let's see what we can find.

200
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,740
Everything.

201
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,620
Such a mess.

202
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,980
That's how we're almost finished.

203
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,460
It is you two uniting to live as a team for this great purpose.

204
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,300
What are you talking about?

205
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,580
Half that's not a mess!

206
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,480
Could you respond?

207
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:23,960
Art.

208
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,760
Obscenity.

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,560
Reality.

210
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,680
I don't care.

211
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,640
I, I don't listen.

212
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,080
I don't buy it.

213
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,800
And theft and collaboration and obscenity and money!

214
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,640
Mainly money because this is a pledge drive and we are not kidding.

215
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:24,580
Uh, if, if you don't care, I don't know, maybe one of these days we won't care either.

216
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,780
And then the world will end.

217
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,300
Money, money.

218
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,300
What we're trying to do, friends, is pull your strings of sympathy and guilt and hate tonight.

219
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,580
Because it's me.

220
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,940
Money, money, money.

221
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,000
Money, money, money, money.

222
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,580
Money.

223
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:55,680
It does indeed make the world go around a nasty situation, but that's the way it is.

224
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:05,420
And, uh, uh, we don't mind, uh, those of you who literally have nothing from freeloading off the slack of this show.

225
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,660
But for those of you who have a little bit of something.

226
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,740
Man.

227
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,800
A bunch of nothingness for that something unless you put it in the right place.

228
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,300
Which is this radio station.

229
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,740
And this radio ministry.

230
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,780
My God.

231
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,500
Ugh.

232
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,460
I'm, I'm serious.

233
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,320
I was, I was paying bills this morning and I was dead broke by this afternoon.

234
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,920
So I'm in the mood to do this show.

235
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,000
Uh, this particular show, which actually is going to star the commercially available albums.

236
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,260
Featuring Bob Dobbs on the cover, but which are not subgenius foundation tape.

237
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,340
Uh, but, uh, albums, tapes, CDs distributed by others.

238
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,420
And unlike our tapes, most of them are available in stores.

239
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,900
And, uh, and what, but these all are authorized releases by friends.

240
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,740
Yes.

241
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:08,180
And members of the honest and true church of the subgenius and not the Canadian.

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,760
Anti-Semitic right wing LaRouche and false church of the subgenius.

243
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:21,100
And I'm going to have to pause in my pledge drive money begging tonight, friends.

244
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,980
And once again, mention the problem.

245
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:35,560
It seems these pin Canucks, uh, pink Canucks, uh, uh, so-called producers for Bob in Canada, Toronto.

246
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,260
Sent out a press release full of lies.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,680
Lies indeed.

248
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,800
Really.

249
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,940
To, uh, every music magazine and college radio station in the country.

250
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,000
Claiming that they were the real Bob Dobbs.

251
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,780
And trying to paint a picture of me.

252
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:57,960
Me, your poor old overworked host and, and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

253
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,900
Trying to make me look like a crazy crackpot.

254
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,840
Now, can you imagine that?

255
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,980
Who had just come out of the woodwork to harass them and their wonderful new invention.

256
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,840
The church.

257
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,160
Of the subgenius.

258
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:20,240
Now, fortunately, dear friends, uh, they seem to have taken real careful aim and shot themselves right straight in the foot.

259
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:27,180
Because, uh, you'll be pleased to know that we've been getting calls from magazines and radio stations saying,

260
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:37,340
Well, we never heard of your church before, but, and we, we really don't care that much about it, but these, these people are obviously ripping you off.

261
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,300
That is crime.

262
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,880
And crime must be dealt with forcefully.

263
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,140
Stop!

264
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,120
Law and order.

265
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,780
Your attention, please.

266
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:59,940
At the recommendation of the International Time Bureau, commencing at 23 hours, 59 minutes, 60 seconds UTC, an extra second will be inserted into the NBS timescale.

of the copyright and is subject to civil and criminal proceedings.

306
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,220
This way I can personally see that you are persecuted to the full extent of the law.

318
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:04,620
If you manufacture or import sound carriers which reproduce copyrighted songs attributes

319
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,800
without obtaining a mechanical license for each song, then you have infringed the copyright of the copyrighted versions.

320
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:07,800


321
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,780
Copyrights in question.

322
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,360
That is crime.

323
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:15,400
Canada's copyright legislation provides for civil penalties and criminal prosecution

324
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,580
with a maximum fine of $1 million for copyright infringement.

325
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,040
If a CD, a cassette, or LP contains unlicensed music,

326
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,500
it can be removed from the market by way of injunction.

327
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:37,400
As well, anyone handling infringing merchandise is likewise guilty of infringement.

328
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,660
Including distribution, wholesale, and retailers.

329
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,900
That is crime.

330
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,480
And crime must be dealt with forcefully.

331
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,020
Remember, copyright is the basis of the music industry.

332
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:02,360
Someone has said, get a great ideal, a great purpose, marry it, and raise a family.

333
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,140
What the hell's going on here, Bono?

334
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,520
I should be saying American Top 40 has heard...

335
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,740
Are you too married to a great idea?

336
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,460
It was every week American Top 40...

337
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,680
Uh, yes, I...

338
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,660
Am I married to a great idea?

339
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,080
I sure as hell am, and I like to think some of you all are too.

340
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,540
And you need to support your husband, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

341
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:33,080
That piece you just heard was by FU235.

342
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,560
That's right.

343
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,960
FU235, a piece called Copyright Time,

344
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,760
from his FU2 project in defense of negative land.

345
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,500
Ironically enough, this Urania 235, as he's also known,

346
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,400
is from Toronto, Canada,

347
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,320
and is also the editor of the wonderful FOD maggot zine.

348
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,160
He tried to do a project in defense of negative land

349
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,460
and found himself subject to and threatened by

350
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,800
the same sort of lawsuits that negative land faced

351
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,080
because you just can't badmouth a conspiracy

352
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,100
without them coming down on your heart.

353
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,260
They're paying those lawyers already.

354
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,480
And neither you or me or negative land

355
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,920
can afford to pay those lawyers for five or ten minutes,

356
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,020
much less what's required to get justice.

357
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,860
I spent two hours on the phone last night

358
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,800
with Mark Hosler of negative land.

359
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,260
It has turned into such a...

360
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,720
He's real sorry.

361
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,600
He got tricked, so to speak.

362
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,000
The whole band kind of got tricked

363
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,180
into contributing a mix.

364
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,900
They remixed a cut on the second of the Canadian

365
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,160
counterfeit subgenius albums.

366
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,020
He had asked the Canadians if this project

367
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,280
was approved by Dobbs and us in Dallas,

368
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,180
and they lied and said it was.

369
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,320
Otherwise, negative land wouldn't have helped

370
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,280
them out on the thing.

371
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,860
And now they feel ripped off by these guys, too.

372
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,060
And it's all turned into the most embarrassing thing

373
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,980
because these plagiarists try to make it look like

374
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,560
we're fascists.

375
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,340
We're some kind of fascists who are going to sue

376
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,800
anybody who uses the subgenius concept.

377
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,520
Now, quite the opposite is actually true.

378
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,280
These Canadians aren't using many of the subgenius concepts at all.

379
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,560
They're using our entire name and identity

380
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,040
because it means something in the fringe world.

381
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,040
They're claiming they're us and then cranking out

382
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,580
some pretty lame gobbledygook.

383
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,560
And what's worse, they have this weird conservative agenda.

384
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,100
I mean, really intense conservative agenda.

385
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,260
They brag about how they're in good with people

386
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,440
like Lyndon LaRouche and even Henry Kissinger.

387
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,600
I think actually they just interviewed him once

388
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,140
and they somehow think that makes them real cool.

389
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,620
Anyway, friends, the fact is we've never had

390
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,900
any problem at all with various individual

391
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,300
organizations.

392
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:04,300


393
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,720
We've never had any problem with artists doing albums

394
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,000
or whatever, comics, that incorporated subgenius materials.

395
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,300
We're happy that they want to.

396
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,340
We're happy that you taped this show.

397
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,260
And all we ask is mutual backscratching.

398
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,000
Well, that's not all we ask.

399
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,680
In the case of this show, the station needs

400
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,240
a few pennies out of you to stay on the air.

401
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,880
That's 823-7490.

402
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,280
They give us credit and they publicize it.

403
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,340
They publicize Bob's message and we help to publicize

404
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,420
their band or whatever.

405
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,460
And the subject of money usually doesn't even come up

406
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,280
because all the parties are probably barely breaking

407
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,960
even anyway.

408
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,080
It's done for fun, for slack, dear friends.

409
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:56,560
And these Canadian yo-yos have stolen our name

410
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,540
to make money.

411
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,220
And the reason they've been able to get away with it

412
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,880
is A, they already have a lot of money.

413
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,900
And B, they're in Canada, which makes it hard for us

414
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,560
to pursue through legal options.

415
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,640
And as far as I can tell, they must be nuts

416
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,460
because they're digging their own graves deeper and deeper

417
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,720
as far as the art world integrity goes.

418
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,280
And I don't doubt that the names Nelson Thal and Bob Dean

419
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,060
will become synonymous with big corporate rip-offs

420
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,620
of struggling independents.

421
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,700
I don't doubt that at all.

422
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,740
But tonight, we would like to,

423
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,320
illustrate to you the range of artists

424
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,200
who have worked subgenius into their stuff,

425
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,120
with permission now, as friends, not claiming

426
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,020
to be Bob themselves.

427
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,480
I mean, not even we do that.

428
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,020
We're not stupid enough to do that.

429
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,340
Public domain.

430
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,080
Raw material for your reuse.

431
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,420
Here it is.

432
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:02,860
The Bob Dean Show.

433
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,020
Public domain.

434
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,280
Here it is.

435
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,960
Duplication.

436
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,600
Raw material for your reuse.

437
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,100
Go right ahead.

438
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
Make a buck.

439
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,040
It's all yours.

440
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,220
No permission or clearance of any kind is necessary.

441
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,160
Go right ahead.

442
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,820
Do anything you want with raw material for your reuse.

443
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,420
I hope that's clear.

444
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,880
Of course, you just can't beat the island.

445
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,000
Corporate lawyers behind the artists.

446
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,860
Go ahead and try.

447
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,300
I'm not a lawyer.

448
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,160
I'm not a lawyer.

449
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,540
I'm not a lawyer.

450
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:02,820
I'm not a lawyer.

451
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:02,820


452
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:02,820


453
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:02,820


454
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,820
If your stimulation for cover is waxed,

455
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,200
I'll see you in a minute.

456
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,500
Don't cheat.

457
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,500


458
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,500


459
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,440
I don't sound.

460
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,860
I don't sound.

461
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,180
I don't sound.

462
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,760
I don't sound.

463
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:38,440
I don't sound.

464
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,300
That was a bad word.

465
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,440
I hope the FCCA...

466
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,560
No, I didn't.

467
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:41,740
No.

468
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,500
F-U-2-35?

469
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,640
Three.

470
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,780
Two, three.

471
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,760
Oh, yeah, but they have to see the word dangling in the air in front of their eyes.

472
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,240
Oh!

473
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,820
Well, they're subgeniuses.

474
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,780
Maybe they will see it.

475
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,280
The only three quarters I've seen anyway.

476
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,020
Yeah.

477
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:57,980
Thank you.

478
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,040
Oh, Ranger Rich.

479
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,720
She lets us do this show.

480
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,400
That woman lets us do this show.

481
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,140
She's really the main reason we've managed to stay on the air.

482
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,300
And you better listen to her.

483
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:08,660
Okay.

484
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:19,160
Okay, OBE, or Out of Band Experience in Boston, Reverend Bill T. Miller, has released a new

485
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:26,320
album called Kings of Feedback, and I would love to just play that whole album on this

486
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:26,540
show.

487
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:33,800
Some of it is undecensorable, you might say, but check it out.

488
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,680
Oh!

489
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,740
Get me alot of love, compañers.

490
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,520
Stop it!

491
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:57,720
Oh, revered, lieber Father, remember, beside the Gods, when he left home half a century

492
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,160
ago, with quite the streak of tragedy, with good health, his great friend-

493
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,860
He took D Aurora.

494
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:58,860


495
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:58,860


496
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,500
Muah!

497
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,280
25 books.

498
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,420


499
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,420


500
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,420


501
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,720
I'm seeking salvation.

502
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,680
There are enemies of children's souls.

503
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,620
All alone in this world of wickedness.

504
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,780
Search inside yourself for your soul.

505
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,280
In the name of the Jesus, I'm going to go.

506
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,020
No, no, no.

507
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,360
No, no, no.

508
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,680
Don't stop me here. Don't stop me here.

509
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,860
Fight the real enemy.

510
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,920
Don't you want to be saved?

511
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,800
Don't you want to be saved?

512
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,940
Fight the real enemy.

513
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,700
We're all looking in the same direction.

514
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,380
We're not seeing quite the same thing.

515
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,060
You're looking at me and I'm looking at you.

516
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,940
But we're all going insane.

517
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,300
We're all going insane.

518
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,940
The dragon's died.

519
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,880
We'll find the God.

520
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,060
No, no, no.

521
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,180
We're all going insane.

522
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,220
We're all going insane.

523
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,020
No, no, no.

524
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,980
The mind is good and the heart is free.

525
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,740
We're all going insane.

526
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,380
We're all going insane.

527
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,220
Fight the real enemy.

528
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,820
We're all going insane.

529
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,380
We certainly don't want to preach to people.

530
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,080
We're all going insane.

531
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,140
Are you going insane?

532
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,300
Eislyn hasn't died yet.

533
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:45,300


534
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,620
I'm locked inside this house and will continue on forever.

535
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:47,960
More than that.

536
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:47,960


537
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,060
For gots, you crossed over the line.

538
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,820
You Police, determine how I get rid of these god.

539
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:52,780
You.

540
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,040
A-You can do anything to help poor people.

541
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,040


542
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,780
I can do anything as long as I live.

543
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:03,780


544
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,160
At a lower level.

545
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,200
It's inside of me and you

546
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,080
We gotta come together

547
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,620
To understand what's gonna happen

548
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,460
Find the real enemy

549
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:21,380
You gotta believe in yourself

550
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,120
Find the real enemy

551
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,220
It's inside of you

552
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:33,640
You gotta find that enemy inside of you

553
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,480
You gotta believe in yourself

554
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,940
Everyone but one

555
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,060
Listen to me, mister!

556
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,920
It's salvation I'm talking about!

557
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,300
Find the real enemy

558
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,440
Repent!

559
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,460
Find the real enemy

560
00:27:52,460 --> 00:28:00,380
All in all

561
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:00,540
All in all

562
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,980
All in all

563
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:18,660
All in all

564
00:28:42,440 --> 00:29:03,880
All in all

565
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,820
All in all

566
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,140
All in all

567
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:33,960
All in all

568
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,440
All in all

569
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,960
All in all

570
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:33,280
It can't be as compared

571
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,140
Because why do you want to be normal?

572
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,560
Incredible. Absolutely incredible.

573
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,760
Completely normal.

574
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,980
These occurrences are pure figment of imagination.

575
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,760
It's not normal.

576
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,820
Wake up, all the boys!

577
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,020
The chair is...

578
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,600
Come on, the chair is...

579
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,280
The chair is...

580
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,380
The chair is...

581
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,060
And that was...

582
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:38,160
what we just played with Normal by OBE.

583
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,680
They're kings of feedback series.

584
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:47,060
And you can reach, these are available as LPs and EPs and tapes and everything else.

585
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:56,420
You can call OutBand Experience, Reverend Bill Miller at area code 617-LICK-OBE.

586
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,500
That's right.

587
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,100
Lick-OBE.

588
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,220
617-LICK-OBE.

589
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,740
Or write them at post office box 221.

590
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,960
That's 221 Boston, Massachusetts.

591
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,000
02123.

592
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,600
What an easy address.

593
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,580
Box 221 at 02123 there for kings of feedback.

594
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:30,260
Non-Subgenius Foundation records that have stuff about Bob and it's fine with us.

595
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,600
We're real happy to see it.

596
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,920
As opposed to this.

597
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,020
Bob's Media Ecology stuff.

598
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:48,160
It's so sad that some people have to take a good idea and steal it, misuse it and wreck it basically to save themselves the work or the need for any talent of their own.

599
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:48,520
Huh.

600
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,520
This has been your re-enunciator.

601
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,680
Fake me.

602
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:58,760
Fake me.

603
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,540
We're non-violent with people.

604
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,120
We're non-violent with us.

605
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,720
Everything basically disappeared.

606
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:11,920
Disappeared.

607
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,560
Disappeared.

608
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,020
Disappeared.

609
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,840
Stupid nutty bad brain.

610
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,740
I want to kill you.

611
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,840
Used slack.

612
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,600
Yeah, here's some stuff about used slack.

613
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,160
This is a little clip from the San Francisco Weekly.

614
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,400
Last week.

615
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:28,920


616
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,440
Slack.

617
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,520
Slugfest.

618
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:44,800
Fur is flying among factions of the Church of the Subgenius over the question of who bears the standard of the real Bob Doves.

619
00:34:45,120 --> 00:35:04,040
It all goes on and on but the gist of the hissy fit boils down to mudslinging between a certain Reverend Ivan Stang and Toronto dwellers who've released an album culled from their Canadian Media Ecology radio talk show hosted by, you guessed it, Bob Doves.

620
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:14,840
Threats of lawsuits and seething letters to various editors have followed but the Toronto group vows to release volume two of their Bob's Rants in February.

621
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,060
Am I the only one who's reminded of the never-ending negative land saga?

622
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,340
Yeah, used slack, dear friends.

623
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,740
Slack!

624
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,840
Used slack, dear friends!

625
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,860
Slack beyond your wildest dreams.

626
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,520
Buy now and slack!

627
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,040
You have the power to find slack.

628
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,620
Good something for nothing!

629
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,080
Credit cards are taken.

630
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,180
Slack!

631
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,340
Send cash!

632
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,040
I want more slack.

633
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,740
Send your money now!

634
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,280
Conspiracy denied me again.

635
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,780
Send your money!

636
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,880
I will have my slack.

637
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,840
Your slack's open and here it is!

638
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,460
Slack!

639
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,700
Buy your slack!

640
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,520
Used slack!

641
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,900
Another time.

642
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,100
New slack!

643
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,080
Your period.

644
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,320
All sorts of slack!

645
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,760
New slack!

646
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,840
Every kind of slack imaginable!

647
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,100
Slack!

648
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,000
Slack from the other side of the world!

649
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,160
The slack?

650
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,480
Slack from right next door!

651
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,280
The slack!

652
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,460
Very good!

653
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,900
The slack's over here!

654
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,780
The slack's over in the middle of the yard!

655
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,100
Used slack!

656
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,820
Buy it here!

657
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,460
Buy it now!

658
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,200
Used slack!

659
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,640
We have used slack!

660
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,540
I don't know which word I want my slack!

661
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,520
You slack!

662
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,380
You slack recognition!

663
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,500
You slack!

664
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,320
I don't know which word I want my slack!

665
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,840
You slack!

666
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,440
You slack!

667
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,440


668
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:05,860
Slack!

669
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,500
Slack!

670
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,360
Slack!

671
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:07,820
Slack!

672
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,760
Slack!

673
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:08,760


674
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:08,760


675
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,680
If you have the cash, you can have your slack.

676
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,860
Money and slack.

677
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,060
Something for nothing.

678
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,820
Slack and green.

679
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,080
Slack!

680
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,340
Slack and government control for your protection.

681
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,480
Slack!

682
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,480


683
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,480


684
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,480


685
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,480


686
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,480


687
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,480


688
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,480


689
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,540
I want more slack!

690
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,720
Slack is not for everyone!

691
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,240
You cannot take my slack away!

692
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,840
Slack can be taken by prescription!

693
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,880
Slack!

694
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:50,880


695
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,360


696
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,360


697
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,720
Slack!

698
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,180
Slack!

699
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,360
Slack!

700
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:56,720
Slack!

701
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,180
Slack!

702
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,000
Slack!

703
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,600
Slack!

704
00:37:59,600 --> 00:37:59,900
Slack!

705
00:37:59,900 --> 00:37:59,960
Slack!

706
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,200
Slack!

707
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,280
Slack!

708
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,280


709
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,900
He's used slack there by Kings of Feedback.

710
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:15,700
And yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna get back on that subject of Bob Dean.

711
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,320
The counterfeit Bob Dobbs.

712
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,180
Actually don't worry this will probably be the last one.

713
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:29,280
But actually, lately, I've come to sort of a plateau of hate It's kind of evened off

714
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,760
for me.

715
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,260
I have to admit that for several weeks, I've been letting these fake Bob Dobbs yo-yos kind of get to me.

716
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,280
You know, I was waking up angry every morning.

717
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,520
Well, not every morning. Not always.

718
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,280
I had other things to think about some mornings besides them.

719
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:51,520
But it had been getting bad, and my blood pressure would skyrocket whenever I thought about them.

720
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,340
And my rants, I'll admit it, were starting to get strident and shrill.

721
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,020
And perhaps they still are.

722
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,760
It was kind of an impasse.

723
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,660
But yesterday, my hate finally crossed over.

724
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:14,800
From the paralyzing, humanoid, Denian-style hate to the ascended, true subgenius-like hate squared.

725
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,840
And I was freed!

726
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,680
And last night, I started writing satires on them.

727
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,640
Which makes me feel like things are getting back to abnormal.

728
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,000
I mean, I had several different...

729
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,740
Different events helped me reach this understanding.

730
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,980
First, the best thing was Negative Land and Steinsky.

731
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:39,060
And pretty much everybody else who'd been paid to work on the second fake Bob album caught on.

732
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,620
And they're denouncing that treacherous bunch.

733
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,660
Yes, yes.

734
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,680
Justice shall prevail.

735
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,180
And secondly, a bunch of magazines and radio stations have checked out both sides.

736
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,060
And they're all about ready to pounce on those bastards.

737
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,740
But the best thing of all.

738
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:03,980
The best of all was, I was sent a copy of an interview with Bob Dean.

739
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,060
Conducted by our friend...

740
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,200
Dad.

741
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:22,120
Who hosts the Hour of Slack and Dad's new Slack shows in Portland, Maine on WMPG.

742
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,260
And I finally got to hear...

743
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,620
Oh, I have something I can play to you.

744
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,940
What Dean is saying about us.

745
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,320
And about me and the entire rest of the church, really.

746
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,420
I didn't want to read their press release to you.

747
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,520
Because if I did, you'd think I was making it up.

748
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,760
You would think it was me doing a satire of these guys.

749
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,960
But now, it's like you can actually hear what he wants you to believe.

750
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:53,060
So let's just move into this vindictive, hateful, wonderful, wonderful thing.

751
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,780
Ah, yes.

752
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,680
Bob.

753
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,280
I want.

754
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,100
All mine.

755
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,580
Garment of fear.

756
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,060
You just kind of get your hands around that concept and work it.

757
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:27,240
Well, I would just like to point out the fact that there's a musical group.

758
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,980
Locally, that has the name Bob J.R.

759
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,360
There's a musical group named Bob J.R.?

760
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,640
I'm quite suspicious of their intent.

761
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,760
It seems like there's a lot of false Bobs lately, you know?

762
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,000
There are false Bobs.

763
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,580
And stick around.

764
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,380
In a few minutes, we're going to play this Bob Dean interview I did.

765
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,160
And you'll hear the falsest Bob of all.

766
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,600
I'm looking forward to it.

767
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,080
Okay.

768
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,740
Who would do that?

769
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,560
Bob.

770
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,860
But Bob is not real.

771
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,500
There are pages torn out.

772
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,960
That is real, Harold.

773
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,120
Okay, okay.

774
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,760
Well, maybe.

775
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,180
Maybe.

776
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,760
Okay.

777
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,640
Bob is real.

778
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,100
He's been having me since I was 12.

779
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,740
I had nothing to do with the CD.

780
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,600
You had nothing to do with it?

781
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,080
No.

782
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,480
I don't know these people.

783
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,520
Nelson Saul and Dave Neufeld.

784
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,260
Bob Dean.

785
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,860
Yeah, Bob Dean disappeared.

786
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,160
About four years ago.

787
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,860
Mm-hmm.

788
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,820
In 88.

789
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:39,820
I've heard from Neufeld and Saul that the last place he was at was at Stank's house, October 28, 1988.

790
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,520
This is a fact, huh?

791
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:41,980
Yeah.

792
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,380
Oh.

793
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,400
So Bob Dean, I've been sent this stuff.

794
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,120
He's ranting about Nelson Saul and Bob Dean.

795
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,700
Yeah, Nelson Saul was involved, but Bob Dean hasn't been seen in years.

796
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,440
But my own history goes back to 1922 when I was born.

797
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,780
Yesterday, February 2nd.

798
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,860
The day Ulysses came out by James Joyce.

799
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,840
So I've just turned 71.

800
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,900
And I had a butler.

801
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,840
Just to bring up a date, I had a butler named Tom Deshaies.

802
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,020
And he sort of decided to defect from me.

803
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,660
In early 91, he sort of jumped ship out of what I was doing.

804
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:27,420
And the next thing I know in April, April 22nd, I found out was the release date of the first FOSMETEOROLOGY.

805
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,780
And there was this thing on the market produced by Nelson Saul and Dave Neufeld.

806
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:37,720
The only thing that refers to me that was actually written by me is the memo to Prince Charles,

807
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,160
which I actually wrote back in, I think it's 87.

808
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,700
And the only person who would have access to that is Tom Deshaies.

809
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,880
So I think Tom Deshaies is somehow working with Nelson Saul and Dave Neufeld.

810
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,760
Oh yes, dear friends.

811
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,620
Well, let's stop and examine these things every now and then.

812
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,700
So now...

813
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,400
Now, that was probably the last time I was in the United States.

814
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:57,400


815
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,960
Bob Dean talking to dad of Dad's New Slacks.

816
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,560
So now Bob Dean is ashamed of Nelson Saul.

817
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:10,800
He doesn't know Nelson Saul or the engineer of the album.

818
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:16,540
Bob Dean, he says, disappeared at Stang's house in 1988.

819
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:24,720
Now, it's true that Dean came to my house in 1988 and told me he was going to play Bob Dobbs on the radio.

820
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,520
And I told him I didn't think that was a good idea.

821
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,400
I really didn't want him.

822
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:27,560
I really didn't want him to.

823
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,020
And I didn't think he sounded anything like the Bob I knew.

824
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,680
And Bob can speak for himself.

825
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,180
You know, he doesn't need some...

826
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,340
This guy.

827
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,900
But anyway, remember that.

828
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,640
Remember that little bit there about how Bob Dean disappeared at Stang's.

829
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,340
And I guess at that point he became Bob Dobbs.

830
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,380
And he's 71 years old now.

831
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,500
And yet makes very trendy references, we notice.

832
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:55,840
And suddenly, Saul and Neufeld did this album.

833
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,080
But it's not his fault.

834
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,920
So he can stab them in the back now.

835
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,540
I see.

836
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:09,920
By the way, the guy that he keeps referring to, David Neufeld, is probably the only blameless person involved in this thing.

837
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,660
He's the only one.

838
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:15,600
Actually, with any talent, he did a pretty good mixing job on those things.

839
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:21,840
It's kind of a shame, really, that they had to put our name on their stuff.

840
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,020
I just don't get it.

841
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,100
But actually, there's a new Bob's Media.

842
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,440
Bob's Media Ecology 2 disc.

843
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,880
It's coming out this month.

844
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,920
And I was supposed to have a copy tonight.

845
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:40,280
But, you know, cheesy publicists in Toronto can't quite get it together that fast.

846
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:49,220
Anyway, what they did do for me, though, was they gave me an opportunity to speak with this Bob Dean or Bob Dobbs, as he called himself.

847
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,340
But, you know, it's interesting.

848
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,160
It's not with the quotation marks around Bob.

849
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,380
And he says that's just Stang's interpretation.

850
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,320
Yeah, I spoke with him.

851
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,740
And he kept me on the horn for a long time.

852
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:07,820
And he told me the truth, as only he knows it.

853
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,720
Oh, yeah.

854
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,220
You know, I played along with him.

855
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,320
I actually let him think that I was interested in what he had to say.

856
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:21,260
But I'll tell you the truth.

857
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,040
I mean, this guy, if he has any one particular talent, it's his ability.

858
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:40,540
To lie in such a powerfully straight faced manner that that many people actually believe what he's saying.

859
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:45,860
Unless, of course, you're of Yeti extraction, in which case you can see right through it.

860
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,840
But he is an extremely talented.

861
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,220
I mean, as well as being a talker, I mean, the guy can talk a mile a minute.

862
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:56,620
And.

863
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,140
But he's a great liar and fantasist and deceiver.

864
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,780
And.

865
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,040
The thing about is he's still quite a subgenius.

866
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,640
I mean, that's that's the difference here.

867
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,320
That's the difference is that.

868
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,360
The real subgenius church has room for everybody.

869
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:24,080
It doesn't mean it doesn't matter if you're a dangerous, demented, twisted poe buck or like Jane or hyper cleats.

870
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,740
Or or a fascist.

871
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,640
Ego centric science fiction geek like Bob Dean.

872
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:37,300
Or just a plain old dad like me.

873
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,700
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.

874
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,240
Any abnormal sound?

875
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:56,200
Well, I was going to be a break in the genetic line and I felt my role was to freeze.

876
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,420
I was going to be a

877
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:09,380
whoever was interested from the pink prison of being rapidly imploding hologram of the 70s, maybe I had to stay in the secret

878
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,900
council and do all the dirty work.

879
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,120
I was involved in the fascination.

880
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,480
Part of the King.

881
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,640
Kennedy, George Wallace, you know, back in the 50s.

882
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,500
Other jobs and money, much money laundering, drug dealing.

883
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,140
So you're not the the J.R.

884
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,680
Quotation marks.

885
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,160
Bob.

886
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:26,720
Dot.

887
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,480
Bob mentioned in some of the genius foundation literature.

888
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,180
Well, technically, I'm not J.R.

889
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,000
I don't have those initials.

890
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:44,280
I am the Bob Dobbs that that's saying right, folks, because when he met me in the late 70s in Dallas and followed Drummond, I think I inspired him.

891
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:50,640
And the effect of personal encounters with me will create will burst the creative instinct and expand it.

892
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,900
And I think that the whole cartoon figure they created was the attributes of the effect I had staying.

893
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,260
But.

894
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,460
No, no way.

895
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:00,780
No.

896
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,300
No.

897
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:01,960
No.

898
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,160
No.

899
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,680
So.

900
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,440
Well, now we find out the excess have landed.

901
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:25,540
And and even though Bob Dean first met us in 1988 and then became Bob Dobbs, yet Bob Dobbs met us in 1979 and inspired everything that all of you and the rest of us have ever done in the name of Bob, all inspired by this guy.

902
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,240
You hear talk about.

903
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,240


904
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,240


905
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,240


906
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,240


907
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,240


908
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,240


909
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,240


910
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,620
You know...

911
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:59,940
You're doing a good job, but it seems that, uh...

912
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:04,700
I mean, the J.R. Bob Dog that I've read about in subgenius lore...

913
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,000
Yeah.

914
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:10,260
Um, is someone who is out to unmask the conspiracy...

915
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,420
That's what I'm doing. That's what Lockdown Bob Rule means.

916
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:18,460
To free what Stang calls subgeniuses from the pink prison, which I will do.

917
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,000
And the X's have already landed. He has the date 1998.

918
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,640
They arrived in February, March 88 from the Booty's Constellation.

919
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,240
And I'm very confident that they're going to be there.

920
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,620
And I'm not saying that they're going to be there.

921
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:35,480
I'm just saying that in 15 years, you'll know that the first contact was made from the aliens from the Booty's Constellation.

922
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,940
So this is historic, what I'm saying. You don't know if it's true now.

923
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,360
They're the ones doing the crop circles.

924
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:44,700
But I don't expect people to believe this stuff, you know, that I have access to this situation.

925
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:49,260
I mean, Stang's projection of July 5th, 1998...

926
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,840
Coincidentally, and he would know this, when he met me in the late 70s...

927
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,240
My father died on July 5th, 1998.

928
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,920
And in 1976, exactly 22 years later, you have Stang mapping out the return of the X's.

929
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:06,960
So that... I met Stang in the late 70s, if I can remember accurately.

930
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,640
So that was after my father died. So I probably told him that fact.

931
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:14,140
Well, what's this date he's referring to about way back in 87?

932
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:18,460
I mean, I like his works. They're funny. It's interesting stuff.

933
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,960
It's not as accurate as what I'm going to lay out. But...

934
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,540
Well, I don't think he's interested in accuracy.

935
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,760
Oh, yeah. He's free to be inaccurate if he wants to.

936
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:32,300
But I haven't got the freedom or time or leisure to be inaccurate.

937
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:37,180
I mean, for to do the tetrad management I'm engaged in, I've got to be very precise.

938
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,140
So he interpreted me, and then Nelson Thal and Neufeld interpreted me.

939
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,780
I think they interpreted other aspects of myself that Stang wasn't aware of.

940
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,420
So I don't know how Stang can say that they ripped him off.

941
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,520
I mean, they have a right to interpret me as much as they want.

942
00:51:54,320 --> 00:52:00,420
Oh, gee, thanks, Bob. I'm so glad that I have the right to interpret you.

943
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:05,760
I'm glad that all of us subgeniuses have been able to interpret you without even knowing it.

944
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:12,360
Yeah, what a... I mean, does this sound like the J.R. Bob Dobbs?

945
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:18,200
You know, anyway, he goes on and talks about how he's the Dobbs in Catch-22.

946
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,500
Catch-22 is also based on him. Or at least that Dobbs character in there.

947
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:31,300
Now, listen to this part coming up where he talks about the great deal that his producer, who he claims not to know...

948
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,600
Now, these guys get together. I mean...

949
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:39,140
And later on in the conversation he talks about he keeps letting slip that they do know each other.

950
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:44,000
Well, Thal has the tape. Well, not Thal. I have the tape. Thal doesn't have the tape. You'll see.

951
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:50,760
The Church of the Subgenius is broke, and there's no way he can fight them, particularly in the Canadian courts.

952
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:55,320
Oh, you know, from what I understand is that Nelson Thal offered a whole business arrangement with them.

953
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:01,480
But, uh, matter of fact, he told me that some of the things Stang is writing in these letters in the magazines are erroneous.

954
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,940
What, the option, uh... letter?

955
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,600
Yeah, the statement that Nelson Thal has not returned his call.

956
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,400
I know we've tapped since I'm still trying to find out where Tom Foucher is.

957
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,840
I've tapped some of Nelson Thal's calls with Stang.

958
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,480
And they arranged a meeting in, uh, I don't know, Detroit, Chicago in October.

959
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,760
But the, uh...

960
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,380
The, uh...

961
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,560
The strike of the U.S. Air Network, uh, canceled that meeting.

962
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,460
Then, uh, then they had a meeting over there.

963
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,660
Did you arrange that? That strike?

964
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,280
No, I wasn't part of that. But I'm trying to find out who is arranging it.

965
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:34,140
I think, uh, uh, Tom Foucher is working behind the scenes with Thal and Neufeld.

966
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,580
Though I can't pin him down.

967
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,060
And so, uh, that's why I was monitoring. I know about this stuff.

968
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,780
And then I know that, uh, we have tapes of these conversations.

969
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,800
I know that... I mean, Thal doesn't have tapes, but I do.

970
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,400
And, uh, they'll be used when it's necessary against Tom Foucher.

971
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,740
I wish they'd make a new album.

972
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:54,900
Make Bob's Media Ecology III out of my phone calls to these guys.

973
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,740
You know, as he talks about how, well, uh...

974
00:53:59,360 --> 00:53:59,800
Uh...

975
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,600
How Stang had said that Thal wouldn't return any calls.

976
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,140
And what a lie. I mean, of course he would.

977
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,480
I never said that Nelson Thal wouldn't return any calls.

978
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,480
I said Bob Chicken Dean wouldn't return any calls.

979
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,380
And he still hasn't.

980
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,900
The guy refu... You know, well, I don't blame him.

981
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,440
I would be damn scared to face what he'd be facing if he did.

982
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,880
Uh, but, uh, I mean...

983
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,460
I guess he'd just rather let the embarrassment pile up.

984
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,200
It's unbelievable.

985
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:27,280
Yeah, his producer, Nelson Thal, called us up and offered...

986
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,880
Here was the great deal, the wealth that Thal offered us.

987
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,860
He said that we could...

988
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,940
He would let us distribute his album.

989
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,520
You know, what a generous guy.

990
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,820
He would let us distribute it.

991
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,440
You know, and all we'd have to do is pay him.

992
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,860
I know that, uh, Thal then offered a certain deal to us.

993
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:48,860


994
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:51,460
And, uh, we were all in a lot of trouble with Reverend Stang that he turned down.

995
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,460
So, and he hung up on Thal.

996
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,740
So, it doesn't sound that he knows how to do business being a...

997
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:02,060
Thal is wealthy, but he's certainly willing to share the wealth if, uh, Stang knows how to deal with it.

998
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:02,680
But I...

999
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,080
Yeah...

1000
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,980
I don't understand why he gets upset about the copyright,

1001
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,000
because there is no problem and there's nothing about the Church subgenius on that CD.

1002
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,400
Oh, no, no, nothing.

1003
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,120
No, there's just mentions of slack.

1004
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,000
And pinks.

1005
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,520
And conspiracy in the excess.

1006
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,520
That's about as close as you get to anything to do with the subgenius.

1007
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,000
And the name of the Church of the subgenius.

1008
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,760
Yeah, but there's, uh, no copyright on the English language.

1009
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,380
I mean, slack is, uh, in Webster's, in the dictionary of slang.

1010
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,480
So, uh, how could anybody, uh, say they own the word?

1011
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,980
See, that's the problem with Stang's Church.

1012
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,260
It presents slack as something easy.

1013
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,280
And it's only been easy for myself over the last several lifetimes,

1014
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,120
uh, because I had gotten it so long ago.

1015
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,980
But for most pinks, and you are a pink,

1016
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:53,320
you only recognize your subgenius as it's been sparked by Stang or this album or my talk.

1017
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,660
You only begin to recognize the potential of the subgenius in you.

1018
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,140
And you gotta work to get it.

1019
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,000
I think I could probably get more slack by burning your book than by reading it.

1020
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,540
No, I don't think you could.

1021
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,200
This is a big opportunity.

1022
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,980
Oh, thanks for the big opportunity, Bob.

1023
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,420
Uh, one last little bit I'm gonna play for y'all.

1024
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,180
And I want you to listen.

1025
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,120
He has a problem here between we and them.

1026
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:17,880
Or us and them.

1027
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,220
He starts to say that we have this video out, but oh no, I don't know the people who did this video.

1028
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,520
It's nice.

1029
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,120
You ever watch Rush Limbo?

1030
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,380
Or Limbaugh?

1031
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,000
No.

1032
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,600
That TV show?

1033
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,220
No.

1034
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,380
Yeah, he's an interesting guy to watch.

1035
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,600
You ever read Camille Pallia?

1036
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,120
No.

1037
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:39,840
Did you ever read, uh, what, Linda LaRouche's stuff?

1038
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:40,380
No.

1039
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,560
What do you read?

1040
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,420
You don't read much?

1041
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,040
You know what we got a video of?

1042
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,460
When I say we, I mean them.

1043
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,160
They have a video out now for Everything's Disappeared.

1044
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,000
Pretty good.

1045
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,780
Based on their interpretation of my chart.

1046
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,720
That's in the first CD.

1047
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,760
But, you know, I guess you'll get it for free.

1048
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,360
You know, you guys on the college network get a lot of things for free.

1049
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,960
Part of having a radio show, you get things sent to you, right?

1050
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:05,940
Yeah.

1051
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,240
That's about all the slack I get, Bob, you know.

1052
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:08,700
Yeah.

1053
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,100
Well, you never know.

1054
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,260
Now that you've paid for it, you know, maybe I'll call you and give you a free call sometime.

1055
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,920
What a generous guy, you know.

1056
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:24,700
As, um, Dad, who was, uh, doing the interview there, and Paul, we appreciate it, Dad.

1057
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,860
That was wonderful.

1058
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,440
Uh, Dad, at the end of his letter here, says,

1059
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:35,360
Well, I suppose they think they're being really cool neoists by appropriating Bob's sacred name.

1060
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,600
But in the long run, I think you protest too much, he tells me.

1061
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:43,980
These guys are never going to get rich off recycling McLuhan, uber conspiracy drivel,

1062
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,880
and the same wimpy disco tune with 17 different mixes.

1063
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,080
No matter how much publicity they get in the short term.

1064
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:56,340
He says, uh, you know, I'm sure you think it's pink to give this guy any publicity,

1065
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,920
but I say let him spew.

1066
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,820
Nobody gets, likes, or believes his message anyway.

1067
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:01,640
Nobody I know.

1068
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,640
And, uh, boy, it's true.

1069
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:08,080
We've gotten a lot of mail from people who were angry at us thinking we were him.

1070
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,540
And others who instantly realized the difference here.

1071
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:16,800
Old Reverend Stark in, uh, New York says, uh,

1072
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,100
I never could figure out what he was talking about on that stupid CD of his.

1073
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:29,000
Now I know the reason was that my truly yetinsen brain cannot process this Glorp scum's insane babblings.

1074
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,060
And it does get pretty insane.

1075
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,260
It goes on and on and on and on and on.

1076
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,520
And, friends, I don't know.

1077
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:42,020
Uh, after this, he probably won't ever hear me mention Dean and his counterfeit garbage again.

1078
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:46,780
I mean, after all the meanest thing I can do to a person who's too mean.

1079
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,460
To forget him.

1080
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,640
To ignore him.

1081
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,880
To banish him from my thoughts entirely.

1082
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:57,060
That's my prerogative as a truly great subgenius.

1083
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,040
As every subgenius should see itself.

1084
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:05,260
Uh, to cause others to cease to exist by ignoring him.

1085
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,920
By really blowing him off.

1086
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,960
Then they're relegated to the dustbin of the universe.

1087
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,960
And until now, I've only felt that way about three people.

1088
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,580
I can't remember who they are.

1089
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,140
But now there's two more.

1090
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:28,220
Two more people to whom my hate grew to a transcendent hate squared and thus doomed them forever to the garbage heap of subgenius history.

1091
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,380
And I do mean forever.

1092
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,820
We'll tolerate a lot.

1093
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,000
But, uh, after we're pushed past the limit, that's it.

1094
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,120
That's it.

1095
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,400
Forever.

1096
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:39,380
And ever.

1097
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,220
And ever.

1098
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,700
And, you know, the only...

1099
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,600
I don't know.

1100
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,280
Dad's observations calm me down quite a bit.

1101
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,740
He pointed out that I have gotten too upset.

1102
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,740
And how can we possibly worry about somebody whose imitation of us is so boring and irritating.

1103
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:57,580
I mean, as boring and irritating as we are.

1104
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,060
Just listen to that guy.

1105
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,520
Although, you know...

1106
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,980
And he also pointed out, after all, Bob Dean is a subgenius.

1107
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,360
A bad subgenius.

1108
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,300
A treacherous, misguided one.

1109
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,400
More dangerous than a thousand pinks.

1110
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,040
But you gotta give him credit.

1111
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,900
No pink could lie.

1112
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,600
Like Bob Dean.

1113
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,260
Well, we have one message for Bob Dean.

1114
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,160
Well, I knew J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1115
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,280
And you, sir, are no J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1116
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:37,060
Hey, your mother, your mother has been using my name for many years.

1117
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,660
Come on over to my place.

1118
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:44,400
I'll cut your belly open and make you look at all the boring tape you got in there.

1119
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:50,820
I'll put the B.O.B. on both cheeks of your life.

1120
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:52,440
On both cheeks.

1121
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,660
You'll remember me for the rest of your life.

1122
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,260
You'll be named after me for the rest of your life.

1123
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:07,240
You see, friends, the difference is all these other artists that we've played in the past and will continue to play.

1124
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:13,280
All of them except the Canadian False Bob seem to understand that this is a big collaborative project.

1125
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:21,140
The Canadian counterfeiters didn't collaborate with us or with anybody else except by lying to them.

1126
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:25,820
And they don't acknowledge that any other subgenius artists even exist.

1127
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:38,180
I mean, they think that with their money they can blanket the media with PR that will somehow eclipse our 13 years worth of existence, books, radio shows, videos, etc.

1128
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:43,200
But they don't have any of what makes this old.

1129
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,860
This old church what it is, friends.

1130
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,840
They're not angry.

1131
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,540
They're not funny.

1132
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:56,760
And they don't throw open their arms to any old weirdo who feels alone out there almost no matter how weird they are.

1133
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:57,860
In fact, there's none of that.

1134
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:07,140
There's just this endless spew of quotes from Marshall McLuhan and LaRouche and various other conspiracy crackpots.

1135
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:11,640
And it's like the church of the sub McLuhan for intellectual conservatives.

1136
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,280
And everybody else is cut out.

1137
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,860
Forget any other subgenius artists or preachers or bands.

1138
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:22,320
All those thousands of people who have been contributing to spreading Bob's hope for the weirdos.

1139
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,360
Forget Bob himself, man.

1140
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,920
This Bob Dean guy says he is Bob.

1141
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,840
And you know, I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't actually believe that.

1142
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:35,540
We run into about one psycho a year who thinks he's Bob and Jesus combined.

1143
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,180
And the difference is most of them are homeless people.

1144
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,780
But this guy has a sugar daddy.

1145
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,140
Nelson Thal.

1146
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,440
Who seems to be a little too dense to see the mistake he's made.

1147
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:47,320
He wanted to buy.

1148
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:50,800
I think Thal wanted to buy himself a pet artist.

1149
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,080
And the pet artist turned out to be a plagiarist.

1150
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,180
But Thal didn't think anybody would care.

1151
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,920
To actually press people who want to hear a less biased.

1152
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:06,420
So I should talk to Negative Land or Steve Stein or for that matter anybody who's worked with these guys.
