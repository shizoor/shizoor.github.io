Frank Zappa's classic Peaches and Regalia. Beautiful, beautiful piece of music that
many of us of us old folks cut our teeth upon and you know we don't play much
Frank Zappa on the Hour of Slack and it's because Frank Zappa may very well
be what led you here if you're over 30 and you know what we like to do for Bob
is to lead you on to the next thing help the next poor sucker down the line as
Frank himself said and recently I was given to hear of a conversation actually
something I picked up off the internet in which someone had had been griping on
alt Frank fan Zappa or something about how oh you know it's so sad Frank's dead
and Captain Beefheart only does paintings now
and maybe he's dead.
I mean what is what is there left and Zug's Rift our fellow minister and a
great musician Zug's Rift responded that well you know buddy it's not like there
aren't other musicians floating around there I mean are you just as
conservative as that guy that can't listen to anything but Led Zeppelin now
that he's 45 years old?
You know yep.
Frank's dead as a doornail and and the captain has gone on to other things and
he's not gonna make any more music but friends have you bothered to seek out
that Rudy Schwartz project CD or that Zug's Rift CD that Kings of Feedback
that silica gel Reagan's Pollock or even swinging love corpses or Doctors for Bob
have you have you?
Well I'm not sure.
Um Friends I was thinking about that and this is gonna be our nepotistic Friends of Stang music show but don't be afraid because
old Reverend stang has some very talented friends.
um so it will be a musical show a musical show indeed of
people might complain that well I sent my tape to Reverend stang...
It's true that it was unlistenable and I did not want to listen to it...

I did not put any label on it,
and I did mention in my handwritten note on the napkin
that it probably sucked,
but he never played it on his show.
He only plays his friends.
Well, here's why.
bass & drums play in bright rhythm
That was Joe Newman, and that's good music.
We'll be talking about Bob.
We'll have songs about Bob.
We'll have Dr. Bizarre's rap-a-like songs about Bob.
It's all right, we'll have Bob, we'll have Bob.
What are the possibilities of complete music?
Follow us at Mr. Slack.
Boop-bop, beat-up!
Boop-bop, beat-up!
Boop-bop, beat-up!
Boop-bop, beat-up!
Bob is lucky, not smart.
Boop-bop, beat-up!





That's for puke from people like you.
Would you F.I.P. to the FBI?
Would you tell to them a dirty lie?
Everything will soon turn out all right
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum!
Did you F.I.P. to the FBI?
Would you tell to them a dirty lie?
Slowly slid in both my wrists
Metaphorically speaking, that is.
Bob is lucky, not smart.
In fact, by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence,
he is gifted with incredible stupidity.
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness.
This enables him to act without thinking,
to surf effortlessly on the luck plane,
to float down the fabled path of least resistance.
In fact, to make a million dollars every time he screws up.
A catatonic stupid
Where do you think you're being?
A catatonic stupid
You'll know you'll never again
Cole, what are you doing?
Cole, hi, man.
Hey, how's it going?
Christ, okay.
Oh, you brought me some tapes.
Yeah.
Oh.
From bearing gifts.
Oh, Jesus comes bearing gifts.
St. Andrew.
Cole, Jesus.
What's that noise?
Feedback from my great presence.
I guess either that or my little headphones here.
Tray full of lab mice.
Tray full of...
Now, this is what it's like, friends.
We're on the air, by the way.
See, I've been sitting here.
I've been playing.
This is a...
This is a show of nepotistic friends of ours music.
It's like Joe Newman, Zug's Riff, Negative Land, you know.
No, it's Doerr.
Oh, now, is that my Bryce CD?
Oh, Bryce.
Oh, okay, good.
I was worried about that.
Okay, well, what is this new CD?
Numersonic.
Frequencies of the Beast.
Oh, look at the titles on this.
Hippie Freakout.
The Mark of the Beast.
Creature Double Feature.
Martian.
Girlfriend.
Greetings, Earth.
Hey, I wonder if these are X Day.
This some...
You know what it might be.
Let's see what this letter is.
Tray full of lab mice.
Dear Ivan, I worship you.
I once contributed my little Jesus being crucified on Telephone Pulse collage.
So he's the one who did that.
You must immediately play Numersonic on your show.
Practically, the whole album is your cup of tea if you ever steeped a bag.
I also enclose Unbunny, which may not...
...appeal to your fine sensibilities.
Okay, here, Numersonic.
Make Unbunny and Numersonic household names by tomorrow noon.
My telex operators await your instructions as we just hatched our label yesterday.
I'll make the press kit short.
Unbunny just put out his first album.
He drives a flower delivery truck.
I guess...
It says Goiter Boy is the one to use if I use any of them.
But now the second CD.
Numersonic is the band.
Frequencies of the Beast is the album.
The lead singer is a credit to dementia, having been certified homeless.
Get the...we got another one!
We got another...this is like a...
The ultimate, quote, outsider artist and schizophrenic for the last 20 years.
Yet he's not just a novelty act.
He improvises wildly funny lyrics and sounds like Elvis with a sore throat.
The opening song, Hippie Freakout, will be the...
The smash hit of the album.
Most of the profits go to Paul's coffee fund.
Well, I was just telling that we only played stuff by our friends.
But now here's proof that if somebody sends us something wild enough...
We've never even heard this, friends.
We've...we have...
I hope it's clean.
You're hearing it for the first time just as we are.
Well, we are on tape, so...
You know, I'm lying my ass off to them.
Okay.
Here it is.
Hippie Freakout.
Thinking about a bunch of hippie in the parking lot.
All set out there ready for a bout.
I says, hey, you fellas, you better be careful because someone's gonna holler.
And we're sure gonna start there and we're all gonna shout.
And there's no doubt about it, someone's gonna call the cops.
One guy said to me, he says, hey, mind your business, friend.
This is none of yours.
I says, well, I'm aware of that.
But I'm trying to be concerned for you and what's gonna happen.
If you get caught.
So it doesn't really matter.
One way or another, they didn't seem to care.
I says, hey, listen, you guys.
Don't you realize that we all out here sitting out in the front chair?
So there was a bunch of hippies.
Yeah.
Hippie Freakout.
It's all set to go out there in the parking lot and get ready to do themselves a bout.
So there was this young lady.
I took a look at her.
I says, oh, ho.
Give me a, give me, give me a drag or two.
She says, hey, get away from me.
I don't want nothing to do with you.
She took a shot in her arm and I could see.
I says, hey, you're getting rather kind of dizzy.
She says, hey, hey, you can kiss when the sun doesn't shine.
I says, hey, don't tell me that.
Just do the things on time.
She just starts shaking.
She started wiggling, going from side to side.
She says, hey, come on over here.
You want to be my guy?
I says, hey, what makes you think that I'm any different from you?
Because I have a clean haircut and I just don't seem to know what to do.
She says, hey, man, let that reefer smoke it strong.
Pump that old needle up your arm.
I says, oh, yeah, I surely will.
She says, hey, brother, have a drink.
Have another or two.
This is one thing I want you to do.
Well, friends, we have no idea whether this song goes on for another hour or two or what.
It is definitely a hippie freakout.
Do you believe that you're mine?
You are for few in this particular time.
Do you believe that you seek guidance, understanding?
Do you think of yourself as being somewhat mentally ill and disturbed?
Do you think that your drinking problems will really, really cause you the troubles after all?
Do you really think that you're a drunk?
Do you think that your life is so bad that you know it wasn't?
Do you know what my hands are?
Do you know what my hands are?
Now.
Yeah, go ahead, Paul.
My outer space machine.
The woman with the eyes so big and bright.
My outer space machine.
The woman that has to come through in disguise.
Yes, my outer space machine.
Well, friends, this show is a strange show.
We got a bit sidetracked there into some hippie freakouts when Jesus suddenly, right in the middle of being nepotistic,
Jesus showed up with a little bit of a show.
With some tapes or CDs from strangers.
And I went and played them anyway just when I was trying not to be democratic.
I was trying to just stick to my buddies and the graft and grifting of, uh,
Praise Bob Joe Newman and the Rudy Schwartz Project.
Oh, yes.

She got back to her residence on Sunset Boulevard, where the residue of her love had died through.
I got bit and stoned by a Ned fly, went swelled up into a baby, and floated away up in outer
space like a Jules Verne hot air balloon.
Jacob Barley took a doll axe and bled his tiny trim and all his little friends.
Disney from Starsdale!
That's why I'm having a heart attack!
Can't be the same till I get my baby back.
She's gone and left me broken hearted. Came to stay but now we've parted.
Like a trans-continental island, burning, floating across the seven seas.
Corporeal to cost information and delicate bacteria, chitted in a mustard keg.
Her lover made a beautiful sunset. She's not a lefty, what shall I do?

Um, and this is also Zugz in the background.
I'm about to give the address of Dr. Zugz Rift and also the address for Joe Newman, okay?

Got here as soon as I could.
Oh, Julie.
Say, what is this whole thing all about?

There's a whole bunch of people coming after you
You better stop n try to listen to me
There's a whole bunch of people coming after you
Cause they want to ram a little something up your buns
And they call it the conspiracy
Well, they'll make you think and act just the way they choose
And they'll make you overpay just to sing the blues
And they'll tell you what to say and they'll never go away
Cause they got you in your work and they'll never let you play
Cause they kind of just designed it to work that way
Cause they kind of just designed it to work that way
And because of their design, well, it washes out your mind
And you think you're doing fine, but you're wasting all your time
Being very well behaved for the big machine

And they'll tell you what to say, but they'll never go away
Cause they got you in your work and they'll never let you play

The one high exalted master of slack
I am the carburetor of the universe
The rubbery wheels on a child's toy truck
I am the peloton of the universe

The cork of intercourse
I am the force behind all foolishness and humor
The laughter of the raving lunatic
The wisdom of ignorance
The death rattle of the infant of seriousness
I am slack
I have come
And my organ still swells
To spread the legs of your mind
And I will thrust my holy rod
Into the balkans of your kingdom





In your regresions

interspersed with X Days of Coming and Fight the Real Enemy
by the great Bill T. Miller of Kings of Feedback and Out of Band Experience.

The iodine, the 1, 3, 1, has got my thyroid on the run.
And the krypton, the 85, is making it hard just to stay alive.
But the iodine, the 1, 3, 1, the iodine, the 1, 3, 1, has no more run.
