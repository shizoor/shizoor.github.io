1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,220
I'm afraid.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,100
Be quiet.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,360
There he is.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,100
Look at his face now, David.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,200
Yes.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,120
I see it.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,680
It's composed.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,340
It looks human again.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,480
Perhaps we're not meant to tamper with the natural.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,580
So genius.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,160
Powerful.

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,700
Be quiet.

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,160
He's looking this way.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,800
It's me, though.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,840
No!

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,380
The god damn it.

17
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,980
He's still coming.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,400
The story of Bob goes back in time to the very beginning of time.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,320
And it's a tale that keeps repeating itself throughout the centuries.

20
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,900
We hope all young people throughout the solar system

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,460
will be able to see the power of God.

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,000
And we will join us in celebration of this great day in our faith.

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,820
We only wish you could see it, folks.

24
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,860
This surging crowd of subgeniuses.

25
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,920
Intractable and unruly.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,760
I can't help thinking.

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,140
Barely kept in control by the last semblance of civilized behavior.

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,820
Everything is bullshit.

29
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,660
Which they cling to as so many foul and soiled rags.

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,160
But how would that be different from any other day?

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,400
Soon their souls will be scrubbed with the steel wool of tradition.

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,600
And they will take off into the noosphere.

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:43,100
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,020
Yeah!

35
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,180
A beautiful trajectory.

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,440
A beautiful liftoff.

37
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,740
Here at Cape Canaveral Gravel this morning.

38
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,820
The great silver rocket climbing on a pillar of flame

39
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,160
and toward fame and fortune.

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,460
Already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain.

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,880
And civil defense authorities state the situation is much the same

42
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,920
across the entire country.

43
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,440
Martial law is now nationwide.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,900
Bob, follow that channel.

45
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,340
This is a class one...

46
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,400
You won't need your wallet here.

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,100
Ten thousand miles from the atmosphere.

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,220
And your home.

49
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,980
I got exactly what I wanted!

50
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,140
Ha ha ha ha ha!

51
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,140
Two, one, two, three, two, one.

52
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,200
Woo!

53
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,860
Someone's crying on the roof above.

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,500
All the media here for the show.

55
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,920
I've been waiting for our friends to come.

56
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,860
Night spiders and ropes with me falling.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,140
A dirty rampant for a visit.

58
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,460
A dirty rampant for a visit.

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,920
I can't.

60
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,400
We met one in Termin and mostly fall.

61
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,180
And now...

62
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,120
The moment you've been waiting for...

63
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,720
The aliens are about to materialize before your eyes.

64
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,660
They came to us from a far distant planet.

65
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,460
And now here they are in our midst.

66
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,520
I insist.

67
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,920
Let's hear it for...

68
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,900
The alien.

69
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,900
The alien.

70
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,460
The alien.

71
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,980
We are coming! We must be able! We must be able!

72
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,520
We're all going to die!

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,860
Let's kill him.

74
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:17,760
You wanna kill him? I don't think that's a wise thing. Not a wise thing to do. Do you really think that you can't even see him? You will feel him. And if you're dreaming that you can take him, I don't think that's a very wise thing to do.

75
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,280
And now we look through a curtain of mist.

76
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,980
As the new subgenius paradigm is being born.

77
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:45,000
An efflorescence here. Vegetable uprising of tendrils, shoots, tiny quivering timorous leaves and huge dank creepers of Spanish moss.

78
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:52,540
Descending like the snaggled teeth of a broken jaw to cut out all light.

79
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,020
Philo, why don't you take that drum?

80
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,820
Robot down. I hate him.

81
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,080
Chappy is out of control.

82
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,640
Shut him off. Blank him. Erase him. Hey, you too, Hal. Put it...

83
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,360
Where's my background music? What did you guys do?

84
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,120
Well, we assessed the situation and then just like...

85
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,240
Just like old Daniel Boone, we said, be sure you're right.

86
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,440
Then go ahead. And so, since we thought we were right...

87
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,060
Be sure you're P.

88
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,300
Went right ahead on that terrible planet of the apes.

89
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,420
Get your filthy paws off me, you damn dirty pink.

90
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,260
Oh, oh, this is terrible. Terrible. Just terrible. Oh.

91
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,720
I'm out of here.

92
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,280
In the foavyatar, g рассказывation and even more terrain.

93
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,400
What up, Princess Williams?

94
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,040
I have information about the food available him.

95
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,860
Food? Well, bring it on.

96
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,320
Availability.

97
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,820
I guess we're having hot and sour snails.

98
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,220
Yes.

99
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,600
Rubber spiders in...

100
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,720
What is available are, for the next half hour,

101
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,760
you can get ham and Swiss plus chips for $6,

102
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,080
or just the sandwich for $5.75.

103
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,680
A terrifying revelation.

104
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,280
Grapes, hummus, and pretzels for $5.

105
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,460
All mixed together.

106
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,380
Chips for 50 cents.

107
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,260
Chips off the old block.

108
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,260
Gripped grapes for $3.25.

109
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,060
Pre-gripped grapes.

110
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,020
And hummus and pretzels for $2.50,

111
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,440
and that's available for the next half hour.

112
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,480
I'm talking about real food, man!

113
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,480
Hummus, another word for soil or dirt.

114
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
We call it earth,

115
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,220
and we intend to chew the soil over slowly

116
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,460
to masticate it to appreciate its local quality.

117
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,360
She was going to make some grandma-faced sandwiches.

118
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,040
Yeah, but they got those down here.

119
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,920
No.

120
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,200
They only have ham and Swiss.

121
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,860
And it's really ham.

122
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
It's just, you know...

123
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,940
Well, if it's a genuine hummus Alabamus,

124
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,320
I'll just have one.

125
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,680
But we've got schmoo meat up there.

126
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,980
Well, whatever is easy, we should do,

127
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,700
and whatever is hard, we should not.

128
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,560
They slice themselves up for you.

129
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,200
Yes, I know.

130
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,040
And obligingly, with a twinkling tear in their little eye.

131
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,300
Oh, but they're happy.

132
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,280
They love to do it.

133
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,760
It hurts.

134
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,800
But that's what they...

135
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,660
always wanted to do, the schmoos.

136
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:58,000
And those tendrils, those little mustache-like feelers

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,220
that they have quiver with excitement.

138
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,980
Oh, is that what those are?

139
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,460
I thought they were just a mustache.

140
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,060
They're like a mustache.

141
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:06,880
That's it.

142
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,920
All the creatures in the Valley of the Schmoon have them.

143
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,360
The schmoo grow in Slobofia, right?

144
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,860
No, they come from the Valley of the Schmoon in Dogpatch.

145
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:18,980
Oh.

146
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,240
I thought they were...

147
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,400
They come in, you know, in the upper Slobovia.

148
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,020
It would have been lower Slobofia, but I don't think so.

149
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,480
I believe that they came from the Valley of the Schmoon.

150
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,160
Hey, Reverend Stang.

151
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,880
Yes, sir.

152
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,000
Give me this kind of output,

153
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,480
and let me plug it in with these kind of inputs.

154
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,340
Yes, he really puts out.

155
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,980
We are having technical difficulties.

156
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,420
Please, stand by.

157
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,940
Now, what about the electrostimulonerve reinforcement bracelet?

158
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,260
They all have to have one of those damn things on,

159
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,380
and they don't come off, neither.

160
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,180
No how.

161
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,600
It's happening.

162
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:11,920
What?

163
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,320
It's an attack.

164
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,020
Excellent.

165
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,780
Now it's time we scream death.

166
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,760
Meanwhile, far below the Earth's surface...

167
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,520
Lieutenant.

168
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:20,780
Yes?

169
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


170
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


171
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


172
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


173
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


174
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


175
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


176
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


177
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


178
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


179
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


180
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


181
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,780


182
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,940
Dobbs and I have been training local pilots in Cobras

183
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,200
for their own strike forces against the cartel.

184
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,780
Lead, this is Snake 2, entering Sector 4079.

185
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,000
Roger.

186
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,420
Advise to leave Robbs in our position.

187
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,340
Will co, Dobbs.

188
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,880
How's the view up front, buddy?

189
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,800
I'm not crazy about it, man.

190
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,700
I'll be glad when we get out of this canyon.

191
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,200
I was flying wing that day with Captain Tejada.

192
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,360
Lieutenant Dobbs, the other American,

193
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,060
was the flight leader in the front program.

194
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,860
We were entering a sector we'd never been before.

195
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,600
Stop.

196
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,760
The thing of it is, Bob, I got a bad feeling on this one.

197
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,920
I don't think I'm gonna make it out.

198
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,740
Get thee behind me!

199
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,600
Are you in danger, Pastor?

200
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,520
All right, roger.

201
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,740
Just a little argument with my co-pilots.

202
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,240
Over.

203
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,100
That's great.

204
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,340
Meanwhile...

205
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,060
The units are approaching the station.

206
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,960
They're coming straight at us.

207
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,200
It's the most...

208
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,220
Nah, it can't be.

209
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:13,680
It is.

210
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,360
Ah!

211
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,780
Rob!

212
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,500
Ah!

213
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:16,820
Ah!

214
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:16,960
Ah!

215
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,720
Ah!

216
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:17,720


217
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
I have visual.

218
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
I have visual.

219
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,120
I have visual.

220
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,560
I have visual.

221
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,500
Snow.

222
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,820
Fearing 235, 40 degrees.

223
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,080
What the hell is going on?

224
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,680
We're under attack.

225
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,400
Yeah.

226
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,900
Right.

227
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,580
Nice.

228
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,180
Bob is my only hope.

229
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:34,640
Back off!

230
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,000
Did it go off?

231
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
How can what ordinary man have so many enemies?

232
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,080
Of course, that's just the start.

233
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,240
You smack bastard!!

234
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,040
We were five miles from the objective when we saw the scorpion attack helicopters.

235
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,040
value.

236
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,460
Try to jump the other way now, Dobbs.

237
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,000
Dobbs, move it. You're 12 o'clock.

238
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,280
Stone, you're on your own. Take your next shot.

239
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:58,880
Here I am.

240
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,280
He's turning over.

241
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,520
Dobbs, ain't a guy like to be taken advantage of.

242
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,420
Breaking formation.

243
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,560
Steady. Steady.

244
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,660
Stay with him.

245
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,420
Next shot.

246
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,060
Here you are, Dobbs. What I owe you. With interest.

247
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,440
Bob!

248
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,540
Bob!

249
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,720
Bob!

250
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,500
Thank you, Blackhawk. Get the hell out of there.

251
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,680
Bob?

252
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,360
Can you read me?

253
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,940
Do you copy?

254
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,000
We're dubbed.

255
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,480
Bob.

256
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:42,880
Bob.

257
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,240
Bob is dead.

258
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,840
They shot him in the head.

259
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,160
You want to make an omelette, you gotta break some eggs.

260
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,700
Son of a bitch!

261
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,380
I'll get you for this!

262
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,040
What did you do to me?

263
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,240
What did you do to me?

264
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,120
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

265
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't want to live!

266
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,880
I do not want to live!

267
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,880
Oh, mama!

268
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,520
He is cool.

269
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,140
So,

270
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,820
space travelers come halfway across the universe

271
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,560
to this planet,

272
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,760
and this is how we greet them, is it?

273
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,160
With rocks!

274
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,460
And with...

275
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,820
with avocados!

276
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,600
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!

277
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,440
These aren't space monsters

278
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,080
with TV aerials stuck on their heads.

279
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,400
They haven't come here to zap your planet

280
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,220
with their ray guns.

281
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,600
These are fellow beings.

282
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,880
Come in peace.

283
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,660
You do a bit of shopping.

284
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,260
People of Earth,

285
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,020
people of Earth,

286
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,620
we should count ourselves privileged.

287
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,080
Yeah, you're privileged

288
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,500
to greet these intrepid pioneers

289
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,020
who come so far across the space.

290
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:01,940
Hey!

291
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,480
They took me off!

292
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,260
They got my truck!

293
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,580
Oh, who would have believed it?

294
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,340
What happens is gonna happen to you, and all of you.

295
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,440
And it's gonna be worse.

296
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,260
A lot worse.

297
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,320
That's great.

298
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,140
No, let's have no more curiosity.

299
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,680
Let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up.

300
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,660
If you are laboring or in distress,

301
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,080
you can be assisted by following the simple rules

302
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,960
outlined in this publication.

303
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,060
It's quite convenient and without complication.

304
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,020
There is no difficult machinery to buy or assemble.

305
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,520
Just pick one up free of charge

306
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,220
here at X Day,

307
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,980
22.

308
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,300
The clouds will open,

309
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,880
and the dreadful judge in middle air

310
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,160
shall spread his throne.

311
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,880
The second coming shall be at hand.

312
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,860
The quick and the dead shall be judged.

313
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,000
As soon as we get hooked up.

314
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,000
Yes, we're belting for Bob.

315
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,960
Belting for Bob.

316
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,800
Releasing the foul gases of decomposition

317
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,200
to leave the earth.

318
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,020
The vacuum will leave behind the purified new man.

319
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,900
The subgenius of the new eon.

320
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,080
Alfred E. New Man.

321
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,400
Yes, the new man is a new man.

322
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,500
A novus homo.

323
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,540
The kind that will walk the earth

324
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,760
after the old kind are all swept away

325
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,580
by the dust rag of history.

326
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,220
And the end dust of doom.

327
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:53,380
And the vacuum cleaner bag shall cover and absorb them all.

328
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,000
And the Murphy's oil soap of fight.

329
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,100
With the lint of long usage.

330
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,060
The wine press of wrath.

331
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,460
The blender of anger.

332
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,880
Yes, and the osterizer.

333
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,040
The egg scrambler.

334
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,500
The killer of justice.

335
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,220
Oh, here it comes now.

336
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:22,680
Run!

337
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,680
The sword of truth.

338
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,800
The helmet of justice.

339
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,120
No, this is the shield of justice.

340
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,980
What's this helmet here for?

341
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,300
The helmet of idiocy.

342
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,100
Oh, well.

343
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,780
Don't put it on.

344
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,280
What was that?

345
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,100
I can't hear you with this helmet on.

346
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,060
You're pretty funny sounding.

347
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:47,900
Hehehe.

348
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,180
Tune-ups of the gods.

349
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,940
This is the show, by the way.

350
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,060
This is the best show you'll hear tonight.

351
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,380
Just run her up there on the platform.

352
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,780
We'll take a look under her.

353
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,100
This is our best show.

354
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,780
This is the best show you'll hear tonight.

355
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,320
The pits pointed.

356
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,240
The ingrown hubcaps replaced.

357
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,260
That was actually the Sween Love Corps' hit song, which this is our best song.

358
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:29,360
It was a terrible, terrible song, but it set a low bar and low audience expectations so

359
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
that if anything good happened, then they were pleasantly surprised.

360
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,280
You see, it's self-referential.

361
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,460
It's postmodern.

362
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,060
It's looking back at its own belly button.

363
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,860
It's what everybody does these days.

364
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,220
Yeah, yeah.

365
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,700
It's a cool new thing.

366
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,580
It's a trendy thing.

367
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,220
It's breaking the fourth wall and the fifth wall and picking the third nostril.

368
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,840
It's a deconstructionist, you know, that whole thing.

369
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,100
Yeah, yeah.

370
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,760
It's postmodernist.

371
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,280
That's what it is.

372
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,040
It's a satire, officer.

373
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,860
It's just a joke.

374
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,500
Yeah, exactly.

375
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,040
Just like Mad Magazine, officer.

376
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,160
These aren't the people you're looking for.

377
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,360
We was just looking at the stars.

378
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,040
These aren't the drugs you're looking for, officer.

379
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,540
What are these boys doing out here in this field?

380
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,360
Why, they's just looking at the stars.

381
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,480
That's right.

382
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,220
They's looking at the stars, huh?

383
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,820
That's right.

384
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,460
These boys are so sensitive.

385
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,480
And the wandering stars.

386
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,680
The ones that won't stay still.

387
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,380
We're watching those two to make sure they don't do anything.

388
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,000
We wouldn't like.

389
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:59,740
And while we're waiting and doing this, delicious sand-widgies are being prepared in the kitchen with gleaming culinary science.

390
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Ready to be delivered for an overwhelming jolt of sensual everyday pleasures.

391
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,360
Well, we're waiting for the schmoo sandwiches from the...

392
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,160
Up the hill, from the big house, where we get to stay.

393
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,480
That's right.

394
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,380
The big house.

395
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,460
It's also the reason why we never make any profit off of that stay.

396
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,720
The big house has big bills.

397
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,400
Actually, it's quite reasonable for normal people, but, you know, it's hard for such geniuses.

398
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,900
Okay, I'm gonna change something up again.

399
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,640
I'm gonna reverse that last decision.

400
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:34,980
All right.

401
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,720
A big bill can go whistle for his separation.

402
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,360
Gotta do it.

403
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,620
All right, all right.

404
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:39,840
All right.

405
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,580
No, I'm gonna do it.

406
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,240
I thought I was gonna do it.

407
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,260
He's gonna do it.

408
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,260
I gots to do it.

409
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,520
Okay.

410
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,920
Are you sure it's the red wire you're supposed to cut?

411
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,800
I thought it was the black wire Bob said.

412
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,100
Ayee.

413
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,560
Oh, no, not that again.

414
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,480
You know, that monkey...

415
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,700
That wind-up monkey has gotten a lot more of a repertoire, I've noticed.

416
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,520
Pull that...

417
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,840
Unplug that one there.

418
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,060
You want this one unplugged?

419
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,400
Okay.

420
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,160
Roger.

421
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,160
No, you unplugged me.

422
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,460
You unplugged me.

423
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,280
There you go.

424
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,720
Now look what you did.

425
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,840
What are you doing?

426
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,200
That didn't work.

427
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,760
Say back that one we had before, Reverend Steins, Emil.

428
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,000
Reverend Schlemiel.

429
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,280
The one that I put away already because you said we wouldn't need it.

430
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:28,860
Yeah.

431
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,960
Now we're, sometimes you have to go backward in order to go forward.

432
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,640
You have to get yourself untangled from a mess of doctrinal error.

433
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,300
And you have to get that all straightened out before you can climb over the fence.

434
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,600
Into the pasture of pleasure.

435
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,100
You know, every time you have me do something, it causes me terrible physical pain.

436
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,860
How about that?

437
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,060
You're causing Reverend Stang to feel pain.

438
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,060
I get up to you.

439
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,400
You know, I am completely imperfect.

440
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,940
Do all physicals.

441
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,380
Physical pain.

442
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,520
You didn't like that one.

443
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,700
Except my own, of course.

444
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,600
And things like that.

445
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,360
What was it?

446
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,020
Ah, but.

447
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,180
Now we're going to have a really hot video of people just sitting and not moving around.

448
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,540
We'll want to watch this very carefully.

449
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,240
Multiple times.

450
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,720
Can you turn down that output level a little bit on that line?

451
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
It's really putting out.

452
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,460
Can you put up your stuff?

453
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,040
I think you need the nine iron for that.

454
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,760
Output control.

455
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,280
Okay, no output control.

456
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,620
We're going to fly blind here.

457
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:48,420
And you can see the incredible presentation being given here while we're waiting for the people to assemble on the main stage.

458
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,680
The subgenius dancers are giving it all.

459
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,360
It's an incredible spectacle.

460
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,120
It's an incredible spectacle.

461
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,760
Whirling flaming torches of pure palutonium around their heads.

462
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,460
They're producing a fiery spectacle.

463
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,300
Which ranks second to none.

464
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,900
And now exhausted, they drag away the temple priestess.

465
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:20,580
And at this point, the flathead sisters come out with their special offering.

466
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,520
It is laid reverently on the folded cloth.

467
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,600
Before the dais.

468
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,800
It's a miracle.

469
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,740
Ivan Stang's arm.

470
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,460
It's going up, up, up.

471
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,520
That's it.

472
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,700
Just pull up arm A with arm B.

473
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,080
It's a backup system.

474
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,620
Most of Reverend Stang's parts are bionic by now.

475
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,120
Occasionally, they may need a little time in the shop.

476
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,700
All that tinkering and rewiring.

477
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,280
Cross-circuiting to be, you know.

478
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,820
A little bit of that.

479
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,440
Why, he's good as new.

480
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,980
Ready to roll out.

481
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,300
Like any radar-activated robot.

482
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,440
And are there any special messages for the aliens this year?

483
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,820
We are ready to transmit.

484
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,440
We're transmitting?

485
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,900
This is a whole list of gripes and grievances.

486
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,340
A laundry list of bitching to be sent to our unearthly allies.

487
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,060
To show how truly ready we are.

488
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,080
For them to make their belated appearance at last.

489
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,100
Just show up.

490
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,640
As Woody Allen said.

491
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,540
That's the major part of succeeding.

492
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,600
Just be there.

493
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,740
You know, Onan had a whole rant about showing up.

494
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,920
Like, you could...

495
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,720
You don't have the right to complain about anything until you've actually shown up.

496
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,220
Yes, you can't sit back in your underwear and complain about everything.

497
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,500
Wheelchair generals.

498
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,040
Armchair quarterbacks.

499
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,520
Why, I ought to...

500
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,260
Yeah, they don't...

501
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,000
You can't sit while you're shitting on your own pants.

502
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,240
You don't want to fall between two stools.

503
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,180
You have to be ready.

504
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,120
You have to be whipcord ready.

505
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,580
You say you can't...

506
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:51,840
Did you, Dr. Drummond, did you say you can't sit while shitting on your own pants?

507
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,680
Now he says he didn't say that.

508
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,500
Yeah, no, I said that.

509
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,360
I did say that.

510
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,480
You cannot shit while sitting on your own pants.

511
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,960
He says a lot of things.

512
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,160
Every time you use that pro...

513
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,420
Every time you use that pro...

514
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:02,420


515
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,980
Profane language, I have to make a special version for the broadcast radio.

516
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,700
It'll have to be redacted.

517
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:09,920
Children's show.

518
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,840
As soon as he starts flapping his lips, you're going to have to put in a...

519
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,480
Sound effect.

520
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,040
I should just make a filter that automatically makes a beep to replace anything Philo says.

521
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,720
Or you could just beep anyway.

522
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,440
And people would think Philo was talking.

523
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:26,740
Boop.

524
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,520
See?

525
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,840
There's Philo right now.

526
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,180
But we only have to do that for the broadcast.

527
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,280
Older.

528
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,500
Allergy site.

529
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,320
My allergies are killing me.

530
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:40,820
This pollen.

531
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,400
What kind of plants grow here?

532
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
I can barely breathe.

533
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,760
Just cut them up like regular chicken.

534
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,260
Where's my Runtussin DM?

535
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,260
There it is.

536
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,720
Oh, God.

537
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,460
Just in time.

538
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,240
Must reach oxygen.

539
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,520
It's right over here.

540
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,780
Too late.

541
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,060
Good.

542
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:02,800
I...

543
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,820
I...

544
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,020
If the bag does not inflate, you're shit out of luck.

545
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,540
Well, uh, also...

546
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:11,700
My...

547
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,840
My will...

548
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,400
The will and the treasure map are hidden in the...

549
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,200
In a plastic packet under your seat.

550
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,320
Inside the table leg, it unscrews my secret medicine for my heart.

551
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,120
Ah, that's better.

552
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,940
Two hundred percent alcohol, indeed.

553
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,340
But whatever it is, uh...

554
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,580
It, uh, serves the purpose.

555
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,740
Easy things to understand.

556
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,600
Breathe an acid spray.

557
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,740
Well...

558
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,420
Ahem.

559
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,620
Bah.

560
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,680
Ahem.

561
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,740
Bwah.

562
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,320
I don't understand why people say that crap's supposed to be healthy.

563
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,620
It is.

564
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:58,820
It's...

565
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,680
It's real healthy.

566
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,380
It's health...

567
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,160
Good health...

568
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,720
I end up...

569
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:01,980
Ah.

570
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:02,820
Just...

571
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,380
Unable to breathe.

572
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:04,780
I...

573
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,300
This planet's atmosphere just isn't right.

574
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,100
And the gravity so heavy.

575
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,020
Oh, it's horrible.

576
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,520
We need to go back to where Princess We came from.

577
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,920
If only we could figure out where it...

578
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,600
Where it is.

579
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,220
The city of helium.

580
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,920
The greater and lesser helium.

581
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,000
Ahem.

582
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

583
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,380
The incomparable Princess We.

584
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,880
So...

585
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,420
Uh...

586
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,420


587
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,320
Um...

588
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:33,940
See, uh...

589
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,740
United...

590
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,320
Uh...

591
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,220
World...

592
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:36,480
Uh...

593
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,240
The green men of the Dead Sea Bottoms and, uh...

594
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,260
Well, you know...

595
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,100
You take it from there.

596
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,740
Only now, this is supposed to be Earth.

597
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,700
So, everything is all turned around, turned upside down.

598
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,840
Well, they want you to think it's Earth.

599
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,900
Squeegee, de-joo-jawed, jim-jammed.

600
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,740
So...

601
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:57,440
Uh...

602
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,380
You just have to...

603
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,340
To figure it out.

604
00:26:59,440 --> 00:26:59,800
But...

605
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,280
Um...

606
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,220
If it...

607
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,480
It wouldn't be so heavy if, uh...

608
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,140
They hadn't messed with the gravity.

609
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,300
Uh...

610
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,720
Uh...

611
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:18,440
You know, Dr. Howell, in the virtual bit world where many of us live, uh...

612
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,020
You can actually adjust the physics.

613
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:28,880
For instance, I got to mess with a doctored bit world of Grand Theft Auto...

614
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,520
In which the friction had been turned down to zero.

615
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,860
Uh...

616
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,940
Slip and slide, eh?

617
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,600
Yeah, yeah.

618
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,340
If you even bumped a car, it would shoot off at high speed or flip through the air.

619
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,280
And driving, of course, was just crazy.

620
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,020
It was fun.

621
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,260
Blow your mind, man!

622
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,740
Yeah, that was the whole idea.

623
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,220
Blow your mind.

624
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,720
So, you can just turn those knobs and make it weigh next to nothing.

625
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:58,980
Eh?

626
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,120
Microgravity on demand.

627
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,660
Well, that's the problem with artificial gravity.

628
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,920
You'll get those glitches.

629
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,500
Uh...

630
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:09,920
Uh...

631
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,820
Captain Kirk had to deal with that.

632
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,680
He and Scotty were running through the engine room of the...

633
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:21,160
Either the engine room of the Enterprise or else an abandoned beer factory in Cleveland

634
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,140
that had been dressed up to look like the, uh, Enterprise engine room.

635
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,200
And what?

636
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,300
The gravity failed?

637
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,700
Yeah, the gravity's kind of shut down.

638
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


639
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


640
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


641
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


642
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


643
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


644
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


645
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


646
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


647
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


648
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


649
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


650
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


651
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


652
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


653
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


654
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


655
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,380
It was just sitting on and off.

656
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,420
So, they're, you know, they're trying to run along these catwalks and things, but then

657
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,200
suddenly they're bouncing off of them.

658
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,920
And then the gravity comes back and it's like, hang on to something again.

659
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,700
Well, it comes with the territory.

660
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,800
Hell yeah.

661
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,980
They don't let just anybody in the Starfleet these days.

662
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,040
Not like they used to.

663
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,640
In fact, uh, they're gonna bring what looks like chips and dip, uh, baby carrots, uh,

664
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,520
mushrooms, uh...

665
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,160
Little snails, uh...

666
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,740
There's some cocktail sauce.

667
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,900
Uh, those look like shrimps over there.

668
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,560
But they're babies!

669
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,720
Who cares?

670
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,720
They lost out.

671
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,280
They're losers in life's lottery of luck.

672
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,600
Time to chew them up and swallow them down.

673
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,700
Oh, you got that from that last Trump rally.

674
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,100
It's terrible when you're starting to steal lines from Trump.

675
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,700
Well, we just want to, uh, enjoy all the baby shrimp that they've got.

676
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:28,700


677
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,820
Agh.

678
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,720
Comm我說

679
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,300
It's time to go.

680
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,900
Gonna mash the

681
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,600
duck spots.

682
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,180
Now, the Loop Metro of Oklahoma has turned into an old school

683
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:45,400
garbage dump.

684
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,780
That's just...

685
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,060
Who?

686
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,300
The Shrieking Ghost.

687
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,260
Oh, really?

688
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:06,360
Just when her album had turned golden, she had to go and do something stupid.

689
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,160
That even happens to spirits now.

690
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,360
If they're famous, fame is what kills them.

691
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,720
It's more the fame that kills them than anything.

692
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,520
They die of it.

693
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,380
I've made sure that that won't happen to me.

694
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:31,140
Yes, we're well protected from that particular stroke of fake weapon.

695
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,840
No accidental Heath Ledger type high-priced death for us.

696
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,100
Our doctors wouldn't trust us with any kind of those kind of pills.

697
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,520
Not for ten minutes.

698
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,820
Not even them kind pills.

699
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,440
Oh, speaking of which, we have them kind pills.

700
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,140
We do?

701
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,140
I've got a whole bag of them.

702
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,420
Yes, I do.

703
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,320
Are they tasty?

704
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,520
I'm afraid to take them.

705
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,260
You've got to throw them to the audience.

706
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
That's what they're for.

707
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,080
I like them kind sugar pills.

708
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,980
That's what they're there.

709
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,580
We'll throw up the pills onto the audience.

710
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,980
Yes, we'll throw out the pills to the audience,

711
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,240
and they will gratefully take them.

712
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,560
They're on the spot.

713
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:12,980
Oh.

714
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,120
That's it.

715
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,800
Fight C. Todd just brought this slogan on a piece of cardboard.

716
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,300
That's actually Reverend Argus Fox.

717
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,560
That's his motto.

718
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,240
Not a rebel, just an idiot.

719
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,000
He just said it once, and I cracked up when I heard it.

720
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,900
Youthful idiot.

721
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,140
It sounded so true.

722
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,000
He was sitting right here at the time.

723
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,820
He said, apropos of nothing, I'm not a rebel.

724
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,300
I'm just an idiot.

725
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,600
Well, who characterized him, mischaracterized him?

726
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,060
It stuck with me.

727
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,720
I thought, that's the subgenius condition.

728
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,980
I'm not a rebel.

729
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,480
I'm just an idiot.

730
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,580
There, there.

731
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,540
It's all right.

732
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,960
Here they are, the pills.

733
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,360
More than kind pills, Bob.

734
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,940
You see, you shouldn't have mentioned the pills.

735
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,680
Now, here they are.

736
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,480
We're being inundated by pills as we attempt to do this program.

737
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,240
I don't know which ones I should take here.

738
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,600
The colors, the types, really bewildering, amazing.

739
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,880
What are those?

740
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,500
They really are them kind pills.

741
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,660
There's a bag of them.

742
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,980
It says that on the prescription, on the jar, them kind pills.

743
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,960
It is a prescription label with a barcode and everything.

744
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,020
Rx, Bob Dobbs Pharmacy, to you.

745
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,140
It expires, oh no.

746
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
It expires 1998.

747
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:53,080
It says, them kind pills, there's a little picture of Bob, take only as needed or whenever you want.

748
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,580
What?

749
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:54,580


750
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,200
There you go.

751
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,820
Let's have some now because I need and want them.

752
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,460
Well, there's a good, they have cotton holding them down.

753
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,820
They, oh my God.

754
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,120
Yeah, it's king cotton.

755
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,340
They're multicolored.

756
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,280
Yes, they're brilliant.

757
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,380
It's like somebody playing Candy Crush over here.

758
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,820
You'd almost think they were M&Ms, but there's no M on them, so they must be them kind pills.

759
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:17,920
Yes.

760
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,240
If I owe you one of them, here they are.

761
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:20,760
Sure.

762
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,860
And, you know, these.

763
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,760
They look like those over there.

764
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:24,760


765
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:24,760


766
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:24,760


767
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:24,760


768
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:24,760


769
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,680
The counter go fast pills.

770
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:35,380
These pills actually come from the family of the late Reverend Roberto de la Rosa.

771
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,980
I just took one.

772
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,040
I took one.

773
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,260
He was the one who first begged Bob for more them kind pills.

774
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:53,900
And, of course, as you might expect when you're that way about those kind or them kind, his, he didn't last forever.

775
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,760
And his.

776
00:33:54,780 --> 00:34:10,120
His widow has now distributed for free these prescription bottles of them kind pills so that all subgeniuses can go the way of the brave Reverend Roberto de la Rosa.

777
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,360
Well, he went before, as it were.

778
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,960
Yes, a true pioneer.

779
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,300
And he didn't pack a suitcase either.

780
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,640
Could you send me some more of those pills?

781
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:23,980
Them.

782
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,420
Pills?

783
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,260
Bob.

784
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:25,800
Kind pills?

785
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,240
I.

786
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:28,940
I really like them.

787
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,820
A bucket of pills will cure your itchings.

788
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,760
Pills, Bob.

789
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,380
Bob.

790
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,380
Yeah.

791
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:36,980
Yeah.

792
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:43,800
Sandy Boone, the director of the great motion picture called J.R. Bob Dobson.

793
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,480
And the church of the subgenius.

794
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:51,000
Made these were going to be handed out to audiences at the premieres.

795
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,560
And she forgot.

796
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:53,920
Well.

797
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,240
And every time.

798
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:01,920
But we caught up behind her and we've got those pills right here and now in a large plastic bag.

799
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,480
And we intend to distribute them.

800
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,920
Listen to that bag rustle and crinkle, folks.

801
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,760
That's no ordinary Foley sound.

802
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,780
That is the sound of a bag of pills being fondled.

803
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,660
And now they're being put out on the tabletop.

804
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:23,300
You have to come up here so we can see that you don't take more than your fair share of them.

805
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,900
Yeah.

806
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,160
And you're going to be able to see that you're not taking any more than your fair share of the bag.

807
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,160


808
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:32,760
Incidentally, unlike the kind that we distributed at Devivals long ago, these might have sugar.

809
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,280
So we don't want to kill any diabetics prematurely.

810
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,820
Wouldn't be enough unless they gobbled every last pill here.

811
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,900
But, you know, they are also a nostrum panacea.

812
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,160
They're good for what else?

813
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,480
They will help you all along.

814
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,360
By the way, and what have we?

815
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,220
Oh, my goodness.

816
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,900
Look at that.

817
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,080
It's tall.

818
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,180
It's Reverend Fenard.

819
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,540
Well, she's brought more of those allergy pollen bags.

820
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,340
Take care of that allergy suppressant, Reverend Stang.

821
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,580
I've got to learn to take it easy with these allergies.

822
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,680
I can barely breathe.

823
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,800
Yeah, my problem is I can't inhale, Reverend Fenard.

824
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,320
She's pointing out that her allergies are delivered in an inhaler.

825
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,360
But I've got my allergies are so bad just naturally now.

826
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,580
I've never had them before.

827
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:41,100
You know, the excess are rupturing us one part at a time.

828
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,680
Bit by bit, they are collecting the remains of our mortal bodies.

829
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,080
They started with my, in my case, they started with my hair.

830
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,060
Then my parts of my memory.

831
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
Then my morals.

832
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,380
Then, and then lately it's been terrible things.

833
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,120
My immune system.

834
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,900
My resistance to arthritis.

835
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,380
My health.

836
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,900
They're rupturing one thing at a time.

837
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:18,500
In fact, there's another one thing they took from me right about this time last year.

838
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,200
Yeah.

839
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,040
It's, I'm not going to go into it because it's really, really bad.

840
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,400
It's really sad.

841
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,080
Well, all right.

842
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,660
Yeah.

843
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,780
But they do.

844
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,460
They are constantly filching.

845
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,940
They have taken some people.

846
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,020
It just, you know.

847
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:41,560
You know, this, our number has been depleted by people lifting up the saucers before their time as we measure time.

848
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,200
They're stealing a march.

849
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,860
They're gaming the system.

850
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,500
Well, that is the same with everything, including this.

851
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,120
The angels needed drive-in movies.

852
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,040
So they ruptured.

853
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,280
Dr.

854
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,000
Dark.

855
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,340
They needed somebody to kick their ass.

856
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,520
So they ruptured legume and they needed a really good barbecue.

857
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,300
So they took heathen.

858
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,820
They needed a really, really sweet girls.

859
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,360
They took Reverend and atrocity.

860
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,960
There's just an endless list of them.

861
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,260
It's terrible.

862
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,480
They're selfish is what they are.

863
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,520
They're magpies picking over the subgenius treasure trove.

864
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,480
No kidding.

865
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,800
And what?

866
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,040
And what?

867
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,040


868
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,600
And look at what they've left us with.

869
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,100
Look at what these people.

870
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,860
Look at those listeners.

871
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,440
Yes, they are fine specimens.

872
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,700
I'm sure they'll do just as well.

873
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,860
We need to feed those sex right there.

874
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,960
We can't even afford viewers.

875
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,840
We can only afford listeners.

876
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,060
And only seven or eight of them.

877
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:49,600
It's funny how on your screen it says how many viewers you have when it means how many listeners you have.

878
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,840
Did you ever figure that one out?

879
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,340
No, that's not.

880
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,880
My screen doesn't say.

881
00:38:53,060 --> 00:39:00,240
My screen says listeners and it never goes above 25.

882
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:06,780
It says like 28 peak 34 or something like that.

883
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,660
Peak meaning I guess when the most are listening.

884
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,340
50 is the peak at WCSB.

885
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,780
Of course, we have much more sophisticated equipment here at Tarzan's radio station.

886
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,040
It's just talking about something.

887
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,300
We peak on about it.

888
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,040
About 2,000 micrograms.

889
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,420
I'm afraid Dr. Drummond is having an episode.

890
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,840
Learn to cough like Dr. Drummond.

891
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,620
Where's the cough button at?

892
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,680
Those pills he took in Arabia.

893
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,900
Every now and then it affects him like this.

894
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:47,300
But he'll be back to normal in two shakes of a fish's tail.

895
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,180
Yes, Dr. Drummond has had these episodes many times before.

896
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,040
Yes, sir.

897
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,040


898
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,040


899
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,040


900
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,040


901
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,040


902
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,040


903
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,040


904
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,040


905
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,040


906
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,040


907
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:57,560
He has to ignore him and he will soon be his usual affable self.

908
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,760
Ere the Leviathan can swim a lead.

909
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:05,900
That's a very charitable way of describing Philo's normal self.

910
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,920
Affable.

911
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,200
Yeah, that's right.

912
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,100
You're not exactly lying.

913
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,100
I have an alien affability.

914
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,480
Except possibly by gross omission.

915
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,240
But yeah, no one more affable than Dr. Drummond.

916
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,800
That's right.

917
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,260
That's right.

918
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,600
There may be other things.

919
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,040
That's right.

920
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,040


921
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,300
That's right.

922
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,920
There may be other things about him as well as affability.

923
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,360
Well, now, Stan, I've noticed that often you're making a marvelous complimentary statement

924
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:39,420
and then you have to qualify it in some way in the interest of pure lexicographic elucidation.

925
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,220
That's our way.

926
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,220
It's the way we...

927
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,200
It's called ball busting, you know.

928
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,740
We have a ball busting...

929
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,580
Or ranking.

930
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,740
You're ranking on him.

931
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,020
You're just ranking on him.

932
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,900
Everybody got a gold ball.

933
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,780
Ball busting...

934
00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:01,460
Now, Dr. Drummond, you know, you can't be heard very well unless you lean in to the mic like so many refuse to do.

935
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,300
Lean in.

936
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,420
Especially me.

937
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,340
Lazy over men and...

938
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,740
Especially me.

939
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:17,160
And uber women who even have their own radio show but still won't treat Mr. Microphone properly.

940
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,880
Yeah, I can't get him anywhere near my microphone.

941
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,640
Microphone.

942
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,080
It's Mr. Microphone.

943
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,220
Hi, girls.

944
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,560
Yes, you drive around your neighborhood to act like a flaming...

945
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,160
And they come a-running.

946
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,680
Reverend Stang, do you have some batteries I can borrow?

947
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,480
Now...

948
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,680
Can you be more specific?

949
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,140
Philo's bionic parts.

950
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,820
I remember your fid chuli saying, I need a ride from the airport.

951
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,680
Yeah, he's double A's.

952
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,640
Double A batteries I can borrow.

953
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,820
Whether it was 6.38...

954
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:52,840
I'll pay you back.

955
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,040
I'll pay you back.

956
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,040


957
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,900
6.30 p.m.

958
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,700
Or which airport.

959
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,280
Or what day.

960
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,440
Can you pick me up in London and drive me to the...

961
00:41:59,440 --> 00:41:59,640
Method of transportation.

962
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,000
Can you pick me up in London and drive me to the...

963
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,600
Once I get my saucer, I can.

964
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,820
What's left of London.

965
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,200
I need to pick up the British Museum while I'm there.

966
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,220
Thanks for reminding me.

967
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,820
How about the Imperial War Museum?

968
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,760
I've never been there, but I figure one of my friends will get it.

969
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Yeah, it's got...

970
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,040
I'll still have a chance to see it.

971
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,620
You'll probably get it.

972
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,300
Yeah, right.

973
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:22,460
Right.

974
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,480
Papa Joe Mama will get all those war museums.

975
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:32,280
Oh, I actually have my eye on the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, but it's for the furniture.

976
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,800
And if somebody else wants the artwork...

977
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,980
You don't like all those gloomy paintings in there?

978
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,320
No, I don't really care.

979
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,860
The babies, the baby Jesuses scare me.

980
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,380
Yes, there is something eerie about them.

981
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,660
Yeah, they...

982
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,300
The light of the world beaming from their wee countenances.

983
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,160
Yeah, for several hundred...

984
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,340
For several hundred years, artists in Europe really hadn't learned how to do babies in a non-terrifying way.

985
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,400
Well, it wasn't just any baby.

986
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,940
They had to draw of numinous quality.

987
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,980
Yeah, it was Jesus, of course.

988
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,660
Baby Jesus.

989
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,920
Hundreds and hundreds of scary, scary pictures of baby Jesus.

990
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,820
Well, these days, he's riding a triceratops.

991
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,400
Well, these days, you know, heck, everything goes.

992
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,660
He's riding a triceratops.

993
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,920
Jesus is riding a dinosaur off the edge of the flat earth.

994
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:29,960
I like the way that one movie portrayed Jesus, you know, like you always think of Jesus in his infantness.

995
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,580
He has these very...

996
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:31,940
Hello?

997
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:32,920
Hello?

998
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,660
Jesus, on the line for you.

999
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,020
Hello?

1000
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:36,980
Who's she on?

1001
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:37,980
Oh, here, I'll get that one.

1002
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,600
Take that call.

1003
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,580
We have callers coming in here.

1004
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,800
Could that be my phone?

1005
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,620
Yeah, we've got phones, phones, phones here at Subgenius Headquarters.

1006
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,840
And we do take your calls.

1007
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,260
Your calls are important to us.

1008
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,760
Oh, no, I'm not falling for this.

1009
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:52,800
Oh, what is it?

1010
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,800
What is happening?

1011
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,160
Brigham City, Utah.

1012
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,180
Oh.

1013
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,360
The phone call was coming from Brigham City, Utah.

1014
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,660
A good idea to avoid that one.

1015
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,720
They wanted to try to get you to be a Mormon.

1016
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:09,900
Oh, it'd be an angel with a flaming sword coming to kick our butts for not being Mormons.

1017
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,080
Well, they can get you after they're dead.

1018
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,120
Speaking of angels with flaming swords, where's my lighter?

1019
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,920
We're the same as Mormons.

1020
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,580
We're just missing one M.

1021
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,800
I don't know, man.

1022
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,140
I didn't see it before.

1023
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:22,820
In the middle.

1024
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,700
We were using a thing that had its own inboard.

1025
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,980
Where's my fire stick?

1026
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:31,020
We were using a stick that already had fire attached to it somehow.

1027
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,300
Philo, do you have your...

1028
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,720
Which one of you thieves stole my fire stick?

1029
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,600
Oh, wait, here it is.

1030
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,980
I did not, but I...

1031
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:43,940
Philo, your mic sounds strangely much louder and rougher than everyone else.

1032
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,100
The voice of authority.

1033
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,580
Is it because I'm too close to it?

1034
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,580
May have been, yeah.

1035
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,580
I probably need to be right here.

1036
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,520
You'll be right here.

1037
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:55,640
And no closer.

1038
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:55,640


1039
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,000
You'll be sorry.

1040
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,400
And no mother, father closer.

1041
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:58,740
Right.

1042
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,780
No mother, fathering closer.

1043
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,380
That's the way to do it.

1044
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,820
We can always put in the cuss words.

1045
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,280
You want me to clean up my speech, right?

1046
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,900
Just lean over and put your lip on the microphone.

1047
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,500
Yeah, but that does mean I...

1048
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:10,500


1049
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:17,940
I have to put the cuss words back in for the internet version or they'll say we cheated

1050
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,160
them.

1051
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,060
Some of the bitches.

1052
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:20,060


1053
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:20,560
I don't know.

1054
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:20,560


1055
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:20,560


1056
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:20,560


1057
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:20,560


1058
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:20,560


1059
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:20,560


1060
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:20,560


1061
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:20,560


1062
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,120
Wait a minute.

1063
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:21,900
No, we don't have to.

1064
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:22,440
That's free.

1065
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,440
That part's free.

1066
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:23,800
It's free.

1067
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,300
They paid it for the censored version.

1068
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,320
The censored version costs.

1069
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,960
That shows you've had an editor there.

1070
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,680
Yeah, well, somebody asleep with their finger on the cuss word button.

1071
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:43,840
The one at WCSB is very irritating.

1072
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,360
The loop that plays when somebody says a bad word.

1073
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,480
What's it sound like?

1074
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,540
First, it makes a loud noise.

1075
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1076
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1077
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1078
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1079
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1080
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1081
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1082
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1083
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1084
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1085
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1086
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1087
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:50,540


1088
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,480
It's a good guitar riff.

1089
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:52,900
Twang.

1090
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:55,720
Inappropriate.

1091
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,000
But it lasts about five seconds.

1092
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,160
Yeah, I've heard that.

1093
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,160
Yeah.

1094
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,000
It's a...

1095
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,660
How about where they take the bad word and they flip it around so it's backwards, but

1096
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,160
it's still there in the...

1097
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,360
You know what word I hate is the...

1098
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,440
Why do you do that with music?

1099
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:12,920
I hate words too.

1100
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,060
I hate the word inappropriate.

1101
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,160
Inappropriate.

1102
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,920
I don't think people should be allowed to say it.

1103
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,060
It triggers me.

1104
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,780
I get triggered when I hear inappropriate.

1105
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,540
When somebody says inappropriate, I don't know what to say.

1106
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:20,540


1107
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:20,540


1108
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:20,540


1109
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:20,780
I think inappropriate.

1110
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,080
I think that's something like tiny little child.

1111
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,280
Inadequate.

1112
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,600
I need a knock...

1113
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,940
Never mind.

1114
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,260
Never mind.

1115
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,840
I was going to talk about brutality.

1116
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,180
That's what you were thinking a second ago.

1117
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,300
I was going to...

1118
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,280
You're going to go back to...

1119
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,880
I was going to speak about personal brutality.

1120
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,220
...Philo Drummond's knock ahead-itorium again.

1121
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,360
I see.

1122
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,860
It's easy to get him going on that subject.

1123
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,700
I'm not the living crap.

1124
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,580
Pressure is building up.

1125
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,280
In fact, Pastor Pressure and Reverend Joicer.

1126
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:50,540
I see.

1127
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:50,540


1128
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:50,540


1129
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:50,540


1130
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:50,540


1131
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:50,540


1132
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:50,540


1133
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:50,540


1134
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:50,800
They're all here.

1135
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,420
Oh, good.

1136
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:51,560
That's great.

1137
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,780
They just pulled up in their pressure cooker mobile.

1138
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:03,200
We were talking about clubbing and being the well-known club man carrying a large club

1139
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,860
of stone or wood to vent one's anger.

1140
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,500
That's Reverend Caveman.

1141
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,780
It's all the such geniuses literally live up to their...

1142
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,940
You let stone you when you're trying to do your thing.

1143
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,280
They're funny names, like for Pastor Pressure is always under pressure.

1144
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:17,560
Right.

1145
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,500
And Reverend Funny Name is always...

1146
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,320
He's always being ridiculed for his ridiculously stupid name.

1147
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,720
And whatever you do, don't mess with Fight C. Taj because he lives up to his...

1148
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,340
He will fight and then he'll say, C. Taj you so.

1149
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,000
Right.

1150
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,060
Yeah, Taj you so.

1151
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,920
So that's what his name stands for.

1152
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,180
I'm trying to get rid of these.

1153
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:39,960
I never can remember.

1154
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:46,840
He's told me what it means every year for 25 years now, but I always forget.

1155
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:56,060
Some trick name, Fight C. Taj.

1156
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,940
Well, you have to be a 33rd degree subgenius to understand that.

1157
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:01,420
Yeah, yeah.

1158
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,100
You got to be a genius.

1159
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,800
It's part of the inner mysteries of the inner mainspring of subgenius.

1160
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,900
When I've been told I understood it, I just forgot it.

1161
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,320
But again, let's see the exes are coming every year, but they're just taking bits and pieces.

1162
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,660
They take the holes out of the Swiss cheese sometimes.

1163
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:21,820
Man.

1164
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,780
Which is how our brains often end up looking after exes.

1165
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,420
Spongiform.

1166
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,560
Well, you see, people don't eat enough fat.

1167
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,440
If you eat enough fat, your brain will be okay.

1168
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:38,060
But otherwise, you'll get the onset of the amygdaloid plaques and other things because

1169
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,160
there's no lipidity.

1170
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,520
There's no fatness.

1171
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,080
Okay.

1172
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,300
Well, we've used up the Planet of the Apes score by Jerry Goldblum.

1173
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:46,300


1174
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:46,300


1175
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:46,300


1176
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,220
Your brain is made of fat.

1177
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,500
Fat has been demonized by the sugar industry.

1178
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,300
Fat doesn't even make you fat.

1179
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,160
Essential part of the human diet.

1180
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,600
Human fat is the best kind of all.

1181
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:08,980
Humans have already made that fat, but as many can recollect, chicken fat is considered

1182
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,960
by a great number of people who should know.

1183
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,320
A healthful thing.

1184
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:15,840
You know?

1185
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,300
Yeah.

1186
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:22,220
I think we should all try to apply to individuals struggling with some sort of minor illness.

1187
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,060
Just like Grandma used to do back in her kitchen.

1188
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:26,960
God bless her.

1189
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:34,440
Yes, we remember the old iron stove, the spice cabinet, and of course the concrete steps

1190
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:40,140
down to the fruit cellar where there were all the jams and jellies put up for the winter.

1191
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,840
Sometimes she'd give the neighborhood urchins a popsicle.

1192
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,300
That's why we came here.

1193
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,020
We came over there and hung around until she gave us a popsicle.

1194
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,240
Otherwise we wouldn't leave.

1195
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,740
See, she had to get the idea.

1196
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,160
A popsicle.

1197
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,320
And now...

1198
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:00,880
Well, but then we'd go over to our clubhouse in that old refrigerator that we used.

1199
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:01,920
That's right.

1200
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:08,300
With the little hand-drawn pictures of Bob on the wall and the no girls allowed sign.

1201
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,500
Read those Tijuana Bibles in there.

1202
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:11,240
Yeah.

1203
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,260
We always thought...

1204
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,000
You know, I didn't realize for years.

1205
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,440
We had the S backwards on girls.

1206
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,860
Now it just seems like an adorable childish mistake.

1207
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,800
Then it was a source of embarrassment.

1208
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,080
Dr. Drummond, is that necessary?

1209
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,280
I'm Dr. Drummond.

1210
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,300
I was afraid of that.

1211
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:37,280
The minute I said the subgeniuses live up to their name...

1212
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:44,120
The Subgenius Percussion Ensemble with Dr. Philo Drummond will return in a moment.

1213
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:44,980
Tori, I'm sorry.

1214
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,880
Tori over there is famous for tearing men in half.

1215
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,500
Good Lord, you're not safe anywhere.

1216
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:56,220
It seems like such a pleasant campground, but everyone has a secret sinister superpower

1217
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,880
who you meet here.

1218
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,740
Don't do that Dr. Drummond.

1219
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,980
Sometimes it's better not to know...

1220
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,360
Oh, well, look at that, well...

1221
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,280
You're interfering with this perfect fact?

1222
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,980
Put your headphones on, you can hear why you shouldn't do it.

1223
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,420
Well, why do we have to...

1224
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,640
Put your headphones on, you crazy man.

1225
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,840
Must we cruise direct each other's performance?

1226
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,980
Oh, no, look, everything's going oxy.

1227
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:14,980


1228
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:15,600
off the table.

1229
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,320
Yeah, you're going to get

1230
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,840
disconnected here.

1231
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:24,580
Oh, my filthy shit.

1232
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,120
Do you see why?

1233
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,420
Do you hear the music in the background now?

1234
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,900
Yeah, that sounds awesome.

1235
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,280
That's our clubhouse music.

1236
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,580
Yes, here in the honeycomb hideout.

1237
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,920
Look, he can't stop.

1238
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,520
He's just like a dog.

1239
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,620
A little kid.

1240
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,820
Like a dog, he hunts in dreams

1241
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,320
and thou art staring at the wall.

1242
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,220
This reminds me of when I invited my

1243
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,380
grandsons, age six and age

1244
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,280
eight, to be on the hour

1245
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,180
of slack. Boy, was I

1246
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,020
sorry. What, were they

1247
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,100
fidgeting and bored out of their

1248
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,120
stuff? No, no, no. They shrieked and

1249
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,140
screamed nonsense that they'd

1250
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,840
heard on television and YouTube.

1251
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,000
And we did

1252
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
manage to do one skit

1253
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,980
where we hunted Bob

1254
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,240
until Bob turned around and hunted us

1255
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,780
in a dark cave.

1256
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,080
There were a lot of scary parts in that.

1257
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,040
But I had to edit the hell out of that.

1258
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,300
That sounds scary to me.

1259
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,280
Yeah, I'd like to hear that one.

1260
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,100
That sounds like a real winner.

1261
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,120
But they did

1262
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,880
the same thing Dr. Drummond did.

1263
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,900
They couldn't resist everything

1264
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,960
I requested they not do.

1265
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,120
Well, those could be like a Foley effect,

1266
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,800
you know, like when you're

1267
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,400
talking about a fist fight or something.

1268
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,080
You could add in those bumps

1269
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,680
and bumps to make it real.

1270
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,100
I can't hear what anybody says

1271
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,140
when you do that.

1272
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,840
Nobody's saying anything when I'm doing that.

1273
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,660
Twister punch.

1274
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,500
Nobody's saying that when I'm doing that.

1275
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,040
Everybody's waiting for me to do it.

1276
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:53,180
No.

1277
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,920
No, that's not true at all.

1278
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,460
Everybody's treading you, Jeremy.

1279
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,240
All six of those people in those chairs right there.

1280
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,740
I don't know what all

1281
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,280
you're looking at.

1282
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,500
They're on the edge of their seat because they're about to leave.

1283
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,440
Please, please, play the drums.

1284
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,240
No one will be admitted

1285
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,000
during the last four minutes

1286
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,900
of the presentation.

1287
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,540
Just for you.

1288
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,300
Watch for the fear flasher

1289
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,400
and the horror horn.

1290
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,480
Can you at least turn it down a little bit?

1291
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,320
All right, I'll turn it down

1292
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,020
a little bit.

1293
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,360
He certainly did.

1294
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,320
Look what you've gone

1295
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,160
and done again, Dr. Drummond.

1296
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,060
Here's another fine mess

1297
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,980
you've got us into.

1298
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:34,900
Is that better?

1299
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,520
No. Is that better?

1300
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,600
It's a little better. It'd be better if it was silent.

1301
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,080
The burbling, tweety

1302
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,820
electronic noise

1303
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,420
is great, but you're drumming,

1304
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,660
Dr. Drummond.

1305
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,280
The burbling of innumerable brooks.

1306
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,520
So what you're really saying is you

1307
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,980
bring back the burble tweeting noises.

1308
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,120
No.

1309
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,080
The electronic tweeting

1310
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,720
noises, but quietly.

1311
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,540
Just in the background

1312
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,320
so that the people listening

1313
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,560
think maybe they're losing their mind.

1314
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,880
The tweeting, tweet birds, and the straw

1315
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,620
built shed.

1316
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,400
Because there's this nice clubhouse music.

1317
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,160
I got you.

1318
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:11,860
I got you.

1319
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,920
The echoing horn.

1320
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,260
It's all clear to me now.

1321
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,020
And for a limited time only.

1322
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:19,940
Clear as mud.

1323
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,820
We're going to induct you

1324
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,160
into this cult of cults

1325
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,540
called the Church of the Subgenius.

1326
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,980
Whether or not you came with your credentials

1327
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,040
entirely in order,

1328
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,300
when you leave, you will

1329
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,640
cleave even further

1330
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,140
to these special principles.

1331
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,860
Is this a practice we're doing now?

1332
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,160
It's sort of like practice, right?

1333
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,680
You hear nothing but the sound.

1334
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,880
This is the first show

1335
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,120
of the event day 22,

1336
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,780
Dr. Violent Drama.

1337
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,100
Okay, testing.

1338
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,360
Testing 1-2.

1339
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,200
Oh, wait.

1340
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,820
I think we ascertained

1341
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,940
that you didn't really need to be kissing

1342
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,640
the phone.

1343
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,260
Testing 1-2.

1344
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,320
2-9-3-0.

1345
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,300
It's an uphill battle.

1346
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,160
The Slackless Children's

1347
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,060
Dinosaur Fund.

1348
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:12,620
Did you know?

1349
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,700
I was outside yesterday

1350
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,580
and I heard a bird in the trees

1351
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,560
and it said, it actually said

1352
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,700
this. It said

1353
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,080
tweet, tweet,

1354
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,400
tweet.

1355
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,320
I couldn't believe it. It was like the bird.

1356
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:26,860
The bird.

1357
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,840
Was your baby walking down the street?

1358
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,400
The bird that defined the sound

1359
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,360
that birds make.

1360
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,160
Was your baby walking down the street?

1361
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:36,900
No.

1362
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,280
I was just walking down my own

1363
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,120
driveway and I heard tweet.

1364
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,820
I said, sweetie, listen to that.

1365
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,260
It's the bird.

1366
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,920
It's the tweet bird.

1367
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,600
They decided,

1368
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,640
what's the sound that birds make,

1369
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,640
generically speaking?

1370
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,380
And somebody said, oh, they say tweet, tweet.

1371
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,300
They Twitter.

1372
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,420
The swallow Twitters.

1373
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:01,040
This is the bird that defined what the default

1374
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,020
generic bird sound is.

1375
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,120
And I heard it with my own ears.

1376
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,120
It said tweet.

1377
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,800
And smaller foolers mucking melody.

1378
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:10,560
Distinctly.

1379
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,380
As if it's the spoilage.

1380
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:12,900
Tweet.

1381
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,220
I want to meet the dog that actually says bark.

1382
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,100
I've met that dog once.

1383
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,180
In Ripley's Believe It or Not,

1384
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,140
there was a dog,

1385
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,820
and I don't know whether I believed it,

1386
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,480
who said, I want some.

1387
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,320
I want some.

1388
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:31,600
Supposedly.

1389
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,440
I can believe that.

1390
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,060
That's no problem for me to believe.

1391
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,240
I can either, but that's all my dog says.

1392
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,060
He just doesn't enunciate.

1393
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,640
It's so easy to believe that.

1394
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,240
My dog would say it, but he just hasn't really gotten there yet.

1395
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:45,940
But he does go,

1396
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,380
Well, that's part of it.

1397
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,460
At least he's attempting to make communication with a sound.

1398
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,980
I might even have a little video of him doing that.

1399
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,600
Oh, well, make sure he watches the video

1400
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,580
so he gets drawn into the loop.

1401
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,960
I have a whole 15-minute album of my pit bull, Claudia,

1402
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,260
going, I can't imitate it.

1403
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,000
It's not a human or canine sound.

1404
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,300
Well, one that expresses that.

1405
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:17,600
I'll have to just cut to a sample here, now.

1406
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:18,620
There.

1407
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,900
I don't know.

1408
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,000
I don't know.

1409
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,700
I don't know.

1410
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,260
I don't know.

1411
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,320
I don't know.

1412
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,200
I don't know.

1413
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:31,240
I don't know.

1414
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:32,920
I don't know.

1415
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,600
I don't know.

1416
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,900
I don't know.

1417
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,880
I don't know.

1418
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:38,100
I don't know.

1419
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:54,260
Oh, well, will you look at that.

1420
00:57:54,680 --> 00:58:00,700
Yes, you can teach an old dog new tricks, according to Mr. Ivan Stain.

1421
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,160
Is that a hint?

1422
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:01,960
Is that a hint?

1423
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,800
David Heights.

1424
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:09,880
Here you see him frisking and frolicking with his two obedient pet dogs.

1425
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:15,840
Yes, it's a great day to be out, as these frisky fellows can show.

1426
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:23,100
Time to smell the trees and to try to dig under the fence.

1427
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:30,900
To try to burrow out of the yard so they can run away and never return.

1428
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,740
That's horrible.

1429
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,940
Well, that's what I...

1430
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,540
That's Aspen.

1431
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,820
Oh, it's pretty loud.

1432
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,700
I thought it was your voice.

1433
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,100
I thought you were uncannily doing a really good dog bark.

1434
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,780
I couldn't see your mouth.

1435
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:51,920
Huh?

1436
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,820
Uh, Wiley Philodrum.

1437
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,280
It was.

1438
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,100
You fooled again.

1439
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,880
But it wasn't Philo.

1440
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:03,260
Well, it was caused by Philo.

1441
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,840
These events were set in magnum motion by Philo.

1442
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:08,300
What?

1443
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,820
And now we're settling in to our new roles here.

1444
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,960
Putting on the dog a little bit.

1445
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,940
Are you going to take a break or are you going to do a show?

1446
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:19,980
Yeah, we're going to take a break.

1447
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,540
Okay, this is official.

1448
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,380
We're going to continue to play the effect of the faithful hound.

1449
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,680
Look at the way the audience responds to that news.

1450
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,660
They're applauding.

1451
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,280
They're so happy we're taking a break.

1452
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,500
They're cheering.

1453
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,080
Yes, they're...

1454
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,180
I guess they must have really liked our show.

1455
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:39,240
Waving and the subgenius beanies are flashing in the sunshine.

1456
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,440
And I'm amazing.

1457
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,640
Yeah, you take it.

1458
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:56,060
Okay, friends on the internet, where I can flog our swag legally.

1459
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:01,200
If you want to help yourself and the Church of the Subgenius

1460
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,320
and get a pretty cool package with like 25 different nifty things in it,

1461
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,060
like pins and bumper stickers,

1462
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,600
and a real preacher card,

1463
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:15,760
You need to go to subgenius.com and click to become a minister.

1464
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,740
You'll see photos and a list of all the stuff you get

1465
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:24,220
and you really do get to go to the Scrubgenius forum.

1466
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:29,160
Which is members only and where we talk in ways that people don't talk on Facebook.

1467
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,120
Much, much smarter ways ironically enough.

1468
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:33,900
Isn't that funny?

1469
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:37,380
We also have things like T-shirts and damn near everything.

1470
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,560
you can think of with Bob's face on it.

1471
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,680
That and a huge selection of other subgenius graphics.

1472
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:48,020
And we sell several very weird DVDs and CDs of the Bob songs

1473
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,700
and old MP3 stashes of this show.

1474
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,000
And best of all, from our main online store,

1475
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,420
you can buy the Book of the Subgenius,

1476
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,080
which is by far the greatest thing we've ever done.

1477
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,660
It's an actual Simon & Schuster book,

1478
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:05,480
22 bucks, in print for over 30 years.

1479
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,740
And every copy that we send out is signed by yours truly.

1480
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,840
For that matter, your address on the puffy envelope

1481
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,600
is handwritten by me also.

1482
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,960
Keep my fingers nimble.

1483
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,940
That's subgenius.com.

1484
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:20,100
And remember, it's only money.
