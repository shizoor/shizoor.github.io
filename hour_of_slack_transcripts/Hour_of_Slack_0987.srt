1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
Welcome to Difficult Listening Hour.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,720
SHOW ME, TELL ME, TELL ME!

3
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,580
And now, the subgenius.

4
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,120
Yes!

5
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,680
Our...

6
00:00:59,680 --> 00:00:59,980
Our...

7
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
Oh, God!

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,120
And it's so repulsive if...

10
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,580
Atomic batteries to power.

11
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,220
Reminds us of me.

12
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,280
You're ready to move up.

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,700
Ah, yes, dear friends.

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,560
Tonight's show would be Hour of Slack number 987.

15
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,780
But we're so far behind,

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,060
and Sid have been doing so many live devivals and things

17
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,620
that putting all that together,

18
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,420
is going to have to be put off.

19
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,200
And so, to now,

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,020
to now, we're running Hour of Slack number 360.

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,240
The Pobucker special show from around,

22
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,760
somewhere in 1991, I guess.

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,180
Featuring the incredible prank call tapes

24
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,000
of Arnie and Barney to the late Benny.

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,740
Thank you.

26
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,900
Thank you.

27
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,880
in this country

28
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,520
harping on the wars they fight

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,600
laughing about the way things ought to be

30
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,280
I don't mind them switching sides

31
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,100
and standing up for things they believe in

32
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,600
but I don't mind them doing the wrong thing

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,320
When they're running down, I touch the man.

34
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,740
They're walking on the fattened side of me.

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,300
Hello, I'm Otis.

36
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:39,940
Hey.

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,880
What? I told you to quit bothering me.

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,840
Well, I want to ask you something.

39
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,320
What?

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,460
What's that big old green truck doing out there in front of the showroom?

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,700
Well, right, that ain't none of your business either, is it?

42
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,960
You don't supposed to be parking on the street like that.

43
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,200
That ain't none of your business.

44
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,280
Don't worry about it.

45
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,740
Goddamn it.

46
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,220
Hello, I'm Otis.

47
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,400
Yeah, I'm going to tell the police to have a move that old truck.

48
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,900
You tell them, and please do, will you?

49
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,960
Please, Otis.

50
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,080
How about Otis?

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,000
Would you come see my new house this week, either?

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,280
Ain't you got nothing else to do?

53
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,340
Would you come see my new house this week, either?

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,300
Where's your new house at?

55
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,460
You lied to me the other day, too, about something.

56
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,080
What?

57
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,540
You said you had tomatoes out at your garden.

58
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
You ain't done it.

59
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,160
I have.

60
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,660
What'd you lie to me for?

61
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,880
This fruit stand's mine. It was my garden.

62
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,600
Huh?

63
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,040
This fruit stand's my garden.

64
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,080
Well, you got one on me there.

65
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,960
Yeah, goodbye.

66
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,460
Now, what motive?

67
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,740
I asked you not to bother me.

68
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,900
I won't ask you something.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,340
That's what you say every time you call.

70
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,380
You said yesterday.

71
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,240
No, it ain't none of your business.

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,480
It was.

73
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,160
Barney want me to keep an eye out for it.

74
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,440
What?

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,840
Now, what motive?

76
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,100
Barney want me to look out.

77
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,000
Quit bothering me.

78
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,040
Listen, why don't you quit bothering me?

79
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,920
What are you going to eat today?

80
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,060
None of your business.

81
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,420
I saw you the other day out there across the hospital,

82
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,220
got the little cafe.

83
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,820
Yeah, well, why don't you let me know who you are and so forth?

84
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,180
You eat out there a lot.

85
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,300
None of your business.

86
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Well, I saw you eating out there today.

87
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,520
Yeah.

88
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,940
I'll just get the little cafe.

89
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,720
Listen, listen.

90
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,700
Now, why in the hell can't you leave me alone?

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,340
They got pretty good food in there.

92
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,560
I don't know.

93
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,780
Why don't you go try it?

94
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,700
Well, I've eaten in there a time or two, but it's been a long time ago.

95
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,440
Well, listen, quit bothering me, will you?

96
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,100
Barney.

97
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,500
I don't want to hear from you.

98
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,960
I mean, I don't give a damn about you.

99
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,500
I want to tell you something.

100
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,140
What?

101
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,440
I saw you out there one time in Stoneport.

102
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,160
I hope I can see you.

103
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
You shouldn't have been drinking a beer out there today.

104
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,800
I hope I can see you.

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,920
You're not supposed to drink beer.

106
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,080
I drink beer when I get ready or anything else.

107
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,260
You don't want to drink beer.

108
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,980
I do whatever I damn please.

109
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,380
It's nobody's business but mine.

110
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,260
Boss.

111
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,740
Damn, the boss and you too.

112
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,160
Well, I wouldn't want to see you get fired, bitch.

113
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,260
I haven't been fired.

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,720
Barney told me.

115
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,100
It ain't none of your business if I do.

116
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,080
I work without pleas.

117
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,600
I don't have to work all the time.

118
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,480
Well, you drink beer.

119
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,160
You drink beer every day and night.

120
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,160
No, hell no.

121
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,640
You don't need to be drinking beer at night or anything.

122
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,240
You're kidding me.

123
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,880
Oh, yes, dear friends.

124
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:16,600
Oh, I love to hear that recording of poor old Benny getting harassed by Arnie.

125
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,680
And we'll be hearing other excerpts from that famous tape.

126
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,480
Because, you know, I don't want to hear that.

127
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,480


128
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,420
But tonight we're going to, on the hour of slack on this religious broadcast, we'll

129
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:37,840
be listening to some of the subgenius preaching from the Subgenius World Convention in Chicago

130
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,480
about three weeks ago.

131
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:48,200
But also tonight I thought we would indulge in a short study in po-buckers through song

132
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,760
and prank call.

133
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,480
The word po-bucker may need some explanation.

134
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:03,320
To some of you people new to our religion, po-bucker generally means a person with very

135
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,620
low values, usually an ignorant type of person.

136
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,740
The common image is of a person in a pickup truck or a person, the kind of person with

137
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,980
a pickup truck up on blocks in their front yard for five years.

138
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,580
I mean, it doesn't always mean poor.

139
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,600
Poor, but just means trash.

140
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,760
Don't get me wrong.

141
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm not saying anybody with a pickup truck.

142
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,620
You see, there's a lot of subgeniuses with pickup trucks.

143
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,980
There are many rich po-buckers for that matter.

144
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,200
A lot of subgeniuses are part po-bucker.

145
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:48,100
I probably wouldn't talk the way I do if I wasn't that way somewhat myself, dear friends.

146
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,160
The term, actually, many people figured what it meant.

147
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,260
Oh, that means a subgenius who's poor in bucks.

148
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,240
It's not.

149
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:05,480
It's a term that's a corruption of an African language word, booker or bookra, which meant

150
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,600
boogeyman or demon.

151
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:16,160
And the African slaves brought to America, some of them called white people bookers or

152
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
buckra.

153
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:24,560
And white trash, therefore, were called poor buckra or po-buckers, which is how my people,

154
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,600
my dad's family, used to pronounce it.

155
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,460
And these famous telephone experiments would have to be a big part of any study of the

156
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,440
rich texture of po-bucker life.

157
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:47,020
The tapes of Arnie, his many calls to Benny, Benny Garrick, at Al White Motors.

158
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,780
Now, and Al White Motors is in Tallahoma, Tennessee.

159
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,800
I believe, near Nashville.

160
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,060
Benny was harassed by these calls for like three years.

161
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,560
And he recently died.

162
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,820
In fact, Benny died just in July.

163
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,860
We have a copy of his obituary from the newspaper.

164
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:20,720
Now, why would we know so much about the people on this prank call tape?

165
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,860
Well, we were that curious.

166
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,560
And one who was even...

167
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:32,200
Even more curious was your fellow subgenius minister and scientist, Reverend Lou Minotti,

168
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,200
who recently moved to Nashville and discovered a lot about these prank calls.

169
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:44,080
For one thing, Arnie worked in the same building as Al White Motors...

170
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,200
In the Al White Motors building.

171
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,640
He worked in the parts room.

172
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,340
And Benny worked in the showroom.

173
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,340
When Arnie was making these calls to Benny,

174
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,800
he could see Benny.

175
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,780
And Benny knew the person who was playing Arnie.

176
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,560
Arnie was one of several aliases.

177
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,040
Another one was Ross Joe.

178
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,640
And the...

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,880
It's just...

180
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,120
Well, I think we should get back into these tapes.

181
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,800
And I'll tell you a little bit more that's even more frightening

182
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,100
about the incredible Arnie and Barney and Benny tapes

183
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,720
after this message.

184
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,940
Friends between us is not very far.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,620
Oh, Lord!

186
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,680
I'm giving my love to you

187
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,740
Cause I only want to see you smile

188
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,740
You've got nothing to lose

189
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,660
But a failure to choose

190
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,500
And you're turning into somebody new

191
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,400
We won't

192
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,840
Oh, no!

193
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,980
Give a dog a bone!

194
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,920
Dog, come flanking through the door

195
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,600
Get one of the girls who's real

196
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,740
I'll let you go

197
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,120
I'll make a bow and bow

198
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,480
Due to today's modern recording techniques,

199
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,280
you may play these hits with true stereo reproduction.

200
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,240
Say hallelujah!

201
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,980
Seen it all on TV

202
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,800
Lee Harvey got gunned down

203
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,560
Murdered by the police

204
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:24,560


205
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:24,560


206
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:24,560


207
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:24,560


208
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:24,560


209
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,540
By Jack Ruby

210
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,320
The biggest sleaze in town

211
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,980
He stuck that gun into his ribs

212
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,860
And said, here's looking at you, kid

213
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,920
Ruby killed Lee Harvey

214
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,680
TV proved he did

215
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:50,420
And Lee Harvey was a friend of mine

216
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,480
A very good friend

217
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,520
Leave me alone.

218
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,100
Hey.

219
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,640
Stop.

220
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:56,980
I still will.

221
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,020
But I've introduce my boys

222
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,020


223
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,180
My averting

224
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,720
Tell me down is there

225
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,920
What he knows

226
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,780
The guy he knows

227
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,220
A bad guy

228
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:13,300
A bull

229
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,780
A apostate

230
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,980
A policePHB

231
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:24,560
A moron

232
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,560
ры

233
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,660
and went up on my house rent, and I'm gonna have to move out.

234
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,400
Well, good.

235
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,660
I've been wondering.

236
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,120
Move out in the damn world.

237
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,940
I wondered if you could find me a place up there close to the fourth place I can rent.

238
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,960
Get out of the state.

239
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,740
See you, V.

240
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,300
Goodbye.

241
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,020
Vinnie.

242
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,040
How are you, mother?

243
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,780
Vinnie.

244
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,800
Why don't you leave me alone? I'm busy.

245
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,560
Barnett said you used to have some rental.

246
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,940
Leave me alone. I'm busy. Bye.

247
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,480
Bye.

248
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:08,440
Shoot up, kill them, bang, stab them, crush, slice, kill, eat, and boil in oil with catapults, throwing rocks and grenades.

249
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,600
I say that I want to see knife cutting, slicing and chopping and cutting, blowing up.

250
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,000
Well, yeah.

251
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,940
You can kind of see it, man.

252
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,920
We're gonna solve all these problems.

253
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,560
I say give our clubs and give our guns and give our knives and grenades and bazookas.

254
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,420
And tank and aircraft instructions.

255
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:33,280
I say there's free instructions for everybody on karate, sabotage, anarchism, everything there could be.

256
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,740
I say there's free lessons from the time of you two on how to do everything there is potentially to kill another person.

257
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,580
There's no hope for humanity anyway.

258
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,700
I'm just gonna watch the world end.

259
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,220
I'm gonna make a million dollars.

260
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,560
Praise God!

261
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,780
I'm gonna help!

262
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm gonna help me!

263
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,660
Now, what, Moses?

264
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,740
Listen, buzzard, why don't you talk to me a minute?

265
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,840
Why don't you go to hell?

266
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,860
What's my brother been telling me? Is it true?

267
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,720
Well, listen, I don't even believe you got a brother.

268
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,000
Well, he said he used to be lovers over here.

269
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,960
Go ahead. Go to hell.

270
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,520
Hello?

271
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,560
Baby, what you talking about, man?

272
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,340
This is Paul Ford.

273
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:24,860
What?

274
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,140
Why don't you park up next to the building for a minute?

275
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,560
Why don't you tell me you're on business?

276
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,320
Hey, Benny.

277
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:29,740
Yeah?

278
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,940
Benny, I'm on the phone, too. I'm Arnie.

279
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,980
Well, I'm on it, too.

280
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,120
I'm Arnie, Benny.

281
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,500
Yeah.

282
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,500
We're all together.

283
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,320
Good.

284
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,460
We're all together tonight, Benny.

285
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,260
I can't.

286
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:40,680
Why?

287
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,420
Because I said I can't.

288
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,500
We'll have a good time.

289
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,160
Mm-hmm.

290
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,020
I'll do the cooking, Benny.

291
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,100
Yeah, you'll do what?

292
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,240
I'll do the cooking.

293
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,880
I'm down for all of you up there.

294
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,940
Oh, Benny, you'd like it if you ever got it.

295
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,840
You'll do it.

296
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,260
Yeah.

297
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,600
You'll do it, Benny.

298
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,140
Yeah.

299
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,980
I wish you would do something for me.

300
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,300
What's that?

301
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,280
I wish you wouldn't worry my brother about his boy got killed over in Vietnam.

302
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,660
Well, I can't hear it, Benny.

303
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,040
But he told me you aggravated him.

304
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,280
I wish you'd quit worrying me.

305
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,000
We ain't trying to worry you.

306
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,960
Yes, you are, too.

307
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,520
We won't be your friends.

308
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,780
Well, come on up down and meet me and let me see if I can be a friend to you.

309
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, I don't care to meet you, but Barney says he don't want nothing to do with you.

310
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,760
Well, I don't care.

311
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,880
I don't want nothing to do with him, then.

312
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,860
Benny, you hit me in the head.

313
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,000
Get back to where you feel about it.

314
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,640
You hit me in the head, Benny.

315
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,920
Well, you asked for it, didn't you?

316
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,080
No, Benny, I was riding on my own business.

317
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,280
You told me you asked for it.

318
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,440
You was after my woman.

319
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,260
Oh, boy.

320
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,420
Yeah, you was.

321
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,720
I know that's a lie.

322
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,480
But, Benny, it still hurts.

323
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,880
Well, I can't help it.

324
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,180
Benny was bad after women back in them days.

325
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:35,980
I know it.

326
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,580
Back during Count Forrest's day.

327
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,580
Now, who are you?

328
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,260
Benny, you was like a little old rooster.

329
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,420
I asked you, who are you?

330
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,020
I'm Arnie.

331
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,700
I'm Barney.

332
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,240
Yeah?

333
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,720
I'm Arnie, and he's Barney.

334
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,480
Well, both of you.

335
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,380
And you're Benny.

336
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,900
Now, you're Benny.

337
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,560
Now, isn't that funny?

338
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,160
Yeah.

339
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,100
Isn't that funny?

340
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,480
Yeah.

341
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,180
I'm glad you get a kick out of that.

342
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,680
Would you go to hell?

343
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,800
Oh, dear friends.

344
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,800
Just an amazing, unusually long segment there.

345
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,680
Although, after three years of calls like that,

346
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:16,120
Benny got to where he would get into long, sad discussions with Arnie.

347
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,920
Arnie started claiming to be Benny's son.

348
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,540
The bold surrealist, dear friends, Arnie Swenson.

349
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,060
Praise Arnie Swenson.

350
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:37,620
Now, what makes the whole thing even more surreal is that everyone at Al White Motors

351
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,420
knew who was pestering Benny.

352
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,740
Everyone in town knew.

353
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,760
The DA knew.

354
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,760
The sheriff knew.

355
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,540
Everybody but Benny knew.

356
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,520
And people.

357
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,200
People all over town served as Arnie's eyes.

358
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,100
They could follow.

359
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,480
They could.

360
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,500
Arnie could follow Benny around and know what he'd been doing at odd times of his life.

361
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,280
And just as Lois Lane never caught on about Clark Kent,

362
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,520
somehow Benny never made the connection.

363
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,880
Arnie did some spectacular things that aren't on tape.

364
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,220
At one point, he bought a broadcast microphone and set Benny's radio,

365
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,740
before he came into work,

366
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,760
to the frequency that that little mic would broadcast on.

367
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,660
So when Benny sat down with his cup of coffee and his cigarette to start the day,

368
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,360
he turned on the radio and there was Arnie going,

369
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,100
Benny!

370
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,940
Benny, how come you parked your green truck over there by the fire hydrant?

371
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,300
And Benny, Arnie could, as I said, could see Benny when this was going on.

372
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,240
And Benny, when he did that, just reached over and turned it off.

373
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,880
That was all.

374
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,700
He didn't express any surprise that Arnie had even invaded the area,

375
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,640
because at that point, friends,

376
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,760
let's see, there was this network of spies, you see,

377
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,240
who, for instance, Arnie would keep tabs on Benny's movement, it says here,

378
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,320
and would call him at the barber shop and the liquor store, among other places.

379
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:16,160
Imagine, it would be as if, well, as Lou explained to me,

380
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,620
this is sort of like a crazed Andy of Mayberry scene,

381
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,680
it's like, what if Andy was secretly tormenting Barney Fife?

382
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,400
And everyone in town knew about it.

383
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,400
Floyd knew about it, Goober knew, everybody knew,

384
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,080
and everyone except Barney.

385
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,780
It was like everyone had an evil side.

386
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,000
Anyway, I got a letter from Lou,

387
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,420
who has some newly revealed background data pertinent to the Al White Motors saga,

388
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,680
and I know that many of my listeners wish they had this tape,

389
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,400
but a lot of my listeners do have it.

390
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,060
It was a pledge giveaway,

391
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,680
and it was a pledge giveaway,

392
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:49,680


393
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:49,680


394
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:49,680


395
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,740
and I know that we sent out dozens of them.

396
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,520
As Lou says here,

397
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,160
I have spoken to the individual at the firm

398
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,820
who engaged in the protracted phone debate with Benny Garrick.

399
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,920
He actually spoke to Arnie.

400
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,580
I found him to be a warm-hearted, seemingly sincere soul

401
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,600
who frankly spoke of his unique contribution to telephone research history.

402
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,420
Among the key findings,

403
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,680
Benny and Arnie were good friends,

404
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,800
and they were friends before the calls commenced.

405
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,540
And even while the calls were going on,

406
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,920
Arnie and Benny used to go fishing together.

407
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,660
Arnie speaks favorably of Benny today in the wake of his passing,

408
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,700
though he does admit that Benny had a stubborn streak

409
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,760
and disliked anyone getting the best of it.

410
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,160
Arnie would make his calls early in the morning

411
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,420
when both began work at Al White Motors.

412
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,000
Arnie would usually knock off by late morning,

413
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,520
then immediately walk across the showroom and ask Benny,

414
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,980
who it was he'd been cussing out on the phone.

415
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,140
Can you imagine the gall to do that?

416
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,860
Approximately five hours of calls survive on tape.

417
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,220
We should be getting the complete series soon,

418
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,120
but we won't play them all on this show.

419
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,400
Arnie reports that Garth Brooks, Clint Black, Chet Atkins,

420
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,820
the governor of Tennessee, are among his fans.

421
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,500
Rumor has it that Senator Al Gore is a big Arnie fan as well.

422
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,440
And Clint Black tried to give a copy to George Bush several years ago.

423
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,320
Now imagine how much better the country would be now

424
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,800
if those bold surrealists had indeed gotten through to them.

425
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,160
Dear friends.

426
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,980
A waitress asked me what we'd like to have.

427
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,240
And I said, I don't know, really.

428
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,260
What would you suggest?

429
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,160
And she stood still.

430
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,120
She just kept staring at me.

431
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,700
And I started getting very nervous.

432
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:04,840
At the time, I had a beard and I lost a few pounds.

433
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,660
And I thought it would be very hard for anyone to recognize me.

434
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,180
This song is dedicated to Jesse Presley,

435
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,660
the aborted fetus twin brother,

436
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,420
and the brother of Elvis.

437
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,720
You can't arrest me, officer.

438
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,680
I'm not drunk.

439
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,700
I might be half-ass drunk though.

440
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,040
Whee!

441
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,480
Half-ass drunk.

442
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,300
Hell, you know who you are.

443
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,440
When you got a hangover and it's all hung over back.

444
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,140
Say to your girlfriend's car.

445
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,540
Half-ass drunk.

446
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,180
Just you and me.

447
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,620
Sergeant Carter haircut.

448
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,420
Gomer files hooked up.

449
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,300
Living off a LSD.

450
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,440
Half-ass drunk.

451
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,100
And I'm feeling blue.

452
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,660
Half-ass drunk.

453
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,980
Well, a flood come in and it washed away my den.

454
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,980
And my water bill's still passed due.

455
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,360
Half-ass drunk.

456
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,820
I called my boss.

457
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,580
I ain't feeling quite right.

458
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,100
Well, it can't be Monday,

459
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,480
cause I don't remember Sunday.

460
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,420
And my hands are sitting Saturday night.

461
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,880
We love songs.

462
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,480
Half-ass drunk.

463
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,660
Half-ass drunk.

464
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:49,660


465
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:49,660


466
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:49,660


467
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,720
Hell, I'm drunk, yeah.

468
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,320
Well, I used to have a job.

469
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,660
But I'm sick of getting robbed.

470
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,600
So I finally do a band quit.

471
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,040
Mama had a fit.

472
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,700
Half-ass drunk.

473
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,540
Well, my head feels odd.

474
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,980
Well, baby needs food.

475
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,700
But his daddy needs a lewd brother.

476
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,440
Baby better find himself a job.

477
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,700
Half-ass drunk.

478
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,380
Half-ass drunk.

479
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,180
Half-ass drunk.

480
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,800
And I'm having fun.

481
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,660
Half-ass drunk.

482
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,760
Hopped on a hill cause I had to take a pill.

483
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,780
But I couldn't quite find my tongue.

484
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Half-ass drunk.

485
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,760
Hell, I can see.

486
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,340
Well, they said the light was red.

487
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,380
Now a couple of folks.

488
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,680
Well, there was 22 mangled.

489
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,040
And there was one guy that was gimped up pretty good.

490
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,840
He had to sort of walk like this for the rest of his life.

491
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,200
And there was one guy,

492
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,080
it was pretty neat.

493
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,140
He was hurt pretty good, I guess.

494
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,740
They had like this machine that was like hooked up

495
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,440
where he had this tube running up through his nose.

496
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:19,660
And he was like, oh, I'm gonna die.

497
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,520
And he was like, oh.

498
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:22,520


499
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:22,520


500
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:22,520


501
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,160
And it was like a blade he chopped straight down on his toes.

502
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,040
And last I heard, he still couldn't walk.

503
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,860
And there was one guy, well, this is what's weird.

504
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,660
They found parts of him on the front of the car

505
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,820
and other parts of him on the back of the same car.

506
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,860
I mean, it sort of defies the mind, doesn't it?

507
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,500
How you could find pieces of the same person

508
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,760
on the front and back of the same car.

509
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,640
I mean, I just don't understand.

510
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,660
They ought to run some kind of scientific experiment

511
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:49,660


512
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:49,940
or some scientific test.

513
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,720
I don't even see how that could even happen.

514
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,240
And a couple folks dead.

515
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,700
Well, it sure looked green to me.

516
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,220
Half-ass drunk.

517
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,140
Hell, I wish I was.

518
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,380
Turned a brand new Trans Am into an old tin can.

519
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,400
Trying to outrun the fuzz.

520
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,520
Half-ass drunk.

521
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,260
I'm a victim of lies.

522
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,380
Well, there's nothing wrong with me, Your Honor.

523
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,060
I can see, hell, I got you damned.

524
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,220
You dug your eyes.

525
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,460
Half-ass drunk.

526
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,180
Oh, woe is me.

527
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,660
Well, I don't really pay,

528
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,020
but it's steady every day.

529
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,960
Breaking rocks till they're broke as me.

530
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,400
Half-ass drunk.

531
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,320
Well, I'm half-ass drunk.

532
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,980
Lord, I'm half-ass drunk.

533
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,660
Just sorry, oh, well, I'm half-ass drunk.

534
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:49,660


535
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:49,660


536
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
Half-ass drunk.

537
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,760
364-886-333

538
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,020
Oh, man, friends,

539
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,240
that was Jane or HyperClete's

540
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,360
doing half-ass drunk

541
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,900
as part of our

542
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,960

00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,640
little things

581
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,600
like, uh, you know, parking

582
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,480

583
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,260

584
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,680
trash cans

585
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,540
sittin' out there. You're gonna have to start

586
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,700
picking them up, okay?

587
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,320
Well, I don't know, I

588
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,500
pick my trash cans up just

589
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,720
when the drugs

590
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,660
come along, I pick them up. Well, that's not

591
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,340
all that is out in that lawn, too.

592
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,660
Huh? Your lawn, it's

593
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,640
needs serious mowing problems.

594
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,540
I think you live in the wrong

595
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,520
place. No,

596
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,800

597
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,340
know that we wanna have a nice

598
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,700
atmosphere around here, and you're gonna have to take better care of it.

599
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,480
Well, I think you live in the wrong place, cause

600
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,080
my lawn doesn't, is not in bad shape.

601
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,520
Well,

602
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,740
you know, you just need to mow it a little bit

603
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,580
more, you know, we're not real too picky

604
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,440
about it. Well, I keep my lawn

605
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,720
mowed. Okay.

606
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,160
Are you sure you got the right plan?

607
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,840
You're Max O'Green, aren't you? Right.

608
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,040
Okay, 1214 Westbrook.

609
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,440
Hey, it's Westbrook.

610
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,920
Well, you know, we don't wanna,

611
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,280
you know, you just... Where do you get

612
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,200
it from? I'm right down

613
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,180
here, uh, about four doors down, they kinda

614
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,240

615
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,440
chairman of this here, so.

616
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,940
Thought I'd give you a call and be real,

617
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,140
you know, manly about it.

618
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,660
Maybe it's Westbrook.

619
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,800
It's getting out of hand, Max.

620
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,380
Well, what's, what's

621
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,280
getting out of hand?

622
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,460
Well, you just need to take better care of your house

623
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,340
and your, your things, you know, we got that.

624
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,420
Stings? Huh?

625
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
It was stings.

626
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,400
I didn't understand you. What'd

627
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,380
you say? I said you have

628
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,440
to take better care of your, uh, possessions,

629
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,040
you know, if you wanna stay in this neighborhood.

630
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,440
We'll blackball

631
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,640
you. You never,

632
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,200
you never get another house in this neighborhood

633
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,500
again.

634
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,700
So what, I don't,

635
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,520
I thought my house looked as good as

636
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,140
anybody else's on here. Well,

637
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,700
you know, just

638
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,140
consider this here a fair warning.

639
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,280
We, we'll just, uh, give you a couple chances,

640
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,440
you know, and then things don't work

641
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,500
out, we'll make an arrangement for you, Max.

642
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,300
Well, I own my home. I don't

643
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,460
know how you can make it in there.

644
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,660
We ain't no small-time

645
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,220
organization. We take care of that.

646
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,360
I don't wanna get into that, you know,

647
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,260
that's, we don't even wanna talk

648
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,160
about that. Just take care of the lawn a little better.

649
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,920
We'll check back with you and

650
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,500
take progress on that. What'd you say your name

651
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:55,680
was?

652
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,060
I think it was Jerry Toefer.

653
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:00,920
Jerry?

654
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,360
Jerry Toefer.

655
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,460
H-N-A. Chairman.

656
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,240
T-O-L,

657
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,480
how do you spell it last name?

658
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,260
T-O-L-F-E-R.

659
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,280
Now, we'll, we'll give you a call back here

00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,420
in about a month or so, and, uh, we'll get you back.

661
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,120
We'll talk to you later then.

662
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,760
We'll talk to you later then.

663
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,560
See you later, Max.

664
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,580
Better beware, Max. I wanna tickle your love offerings.

665
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,600
Sir?

666
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,900
I wanna tickle your love offerings.

667
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,080
Hey, that's fantastic.

668
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,880
Is it? I'm coming over too.

669
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,620
Good!

670
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,380

You're gonna what?

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,280
I'm gonna bathe your entire family tonight.

673
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,140
How's that?

674
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,340
You know, in the tub with the sponges and the water.

675
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,900
Well, you sound like just the right kind of guy.

676
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,820
Well, you sound like just the right kind of guy.

677
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,060
You betcha I'll do it, too.

678
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,320
You don't know us.

679
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,020
We get drunk.

680
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,540
We like to go canoeing and bathing.

681
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,400
Well, I tell you what.

682
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,240
I got a whole bunch of friends

683
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,880
that sit exactly the same way.

684
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,640
Well, maybe we can get together.

685
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,480
Have one of them fleece heels or something.

686
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:10,920


687
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,900
Are you living in Calipho?

688
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,680
Huh?

689
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,060
Are you living in Calipho?

690
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,720
I could be.

691
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,400
I wanna live in that canoe you got.

692
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,180
Oh.

I've got a head of a bitch love

709
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,120
That's running the back of my head like a dog

710
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,900
What's over?

711
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,660
I can't say her

712
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,920
My girlfriend is a

713
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,300
All I got

714
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,260

But I can't say her

716
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,020
My girlfriend is a

All I got

718
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,220

719
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,360
And uh

720
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,780
We'll be playing more material from the sub-con there

721
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,040
You'll hear some Sister Mary Squared

722
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,880
Some Sister Velveteen Sly actually

723
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,000
I think we played most of Mary Squared's formal ranting

724
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,560
But also some informal material from the conspiracy panel discussion

725
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,580
With G. Gordon Gordon

726
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:30,800
And those aforementioned lady preachers

727
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,000
And those aforementioned lady preachers

728
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,000


729
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,040
And dominatrixes

730
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,000
And uh

731
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,920
Yes

732
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,860
Boy we got a call

733
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,480
We could tell a rumor

734
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
On the air

735
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,840
It would be so fun

736
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,800
But I think we better be safe than sorry

737
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,220
Because I would hate to have the secret service

738
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,800
Call the station up

739
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,200
And subpoena somebody

740
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,320
Make them go where did you hear this

741
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,400
You know where was the leak

742
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,820
Oh well

743
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,920
Oh well

744
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,140
This shit is getting serious

745
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:06,400
We gotta get out

746
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:06,600
Everyone up

747
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:06,720
Go home

748
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,100
Turn us down

749
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,420
He's multiplayer

750
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,740
Yeah

751
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,640
Until Kodach GواT

752
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,000
I should live

753
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


754
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


755
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


756
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


757
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


758
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,760
There's no moreels they' m not waiting on you

759
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,360
Connie's kiss cascades from her lips, lest it burn, leave a tip.

760
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,720
Can you confront the candle of Connie?

761
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,980
Now this chick, I'm a chick with a Y, of course.

762
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,160
This chick has to cruise.

763
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:56,480
But the chronicles of Connie will continue as I keep on co-opting conspiracy and cracking cliches.

764
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,940
For I am Connie, the ultimate con.

765
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,180
Praise Connie!

766
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,820
Praise Connie!

767
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,440
I love it! I love all the Connie worshippers who are here.

768
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't know what's reverence.

769
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,240
I don't know what the dang has been doing lately, but I remember he used to talk about the makeup of the church.

770
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:26,840
Being just, oh, I don't know, a whole bunch of computer nerd types.

771
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,340
People just spend all their time indoors, you know.

772
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,160
Never getting out and talking to women or being friendly.

773
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,640
They just didn't know how to please a Connie.

774
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,660
And I'm so glad to see this new young crap of subgenia.

775
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,360
Yes!

776
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:45,680
Yes!

777
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,240
No!

778
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:47,600


779
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:47,600


780
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:47,940
MSG!

781
00:34:50,240 --> 00:35:01,260
Wherever one or more are gathered together in the name of greed, greed, confusion, control, and censorship, there is the conspiracy.

782
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:10,560
But I want to know, all you out there, after hearing all this stuff that should have gotten you riled up tonight, how big is your hand?

783
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,440
You know what's going to happen?

784
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,120
430.

785
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,140


786
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,840
years. X day. And our revenge will come on X day. Our revenge will come because what's

787
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,300
going to happen to those pinks and those normals? They're going to go through the worst experience

788
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,820
of their entire lives. They are going to be forced all of a sudden to be obsessed with

789
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:38,420
sex and enjoy it. And they're going to enjoy it. But you know what else they'll feel? Because

790
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,420
they're those pinks and those normals. They will feel guilt. They won't be able to help

791
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,300
it. You'll see those nice little ladies that you saw typing into office. They'll be like

792
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,720
ripping their clothes apart. They can't help it. They'll be like, oh my God, I'm so horny.

793
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:59,020
But it's bad. For weeks. I must have. For two weeks. For three. And it'll seem like

794
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:05,160
thousands of years. That is what they will be doing on X day. They'll be up. Losing

795
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,400
a sport. They will show up.

796
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,740
Oh, yes, dear friends.

797
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,160
Some, uh,

798
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:19,260
new prophecies about X day, the end of the world, as understood in our church. The pinks

799
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,640
will suddenly start having fun, but they'll feel so guilty. It'll be like hell. They'll

800
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,860
be ravishing each other in those offices, but they'll, they'll hate it. They won't be

801
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:36,160
able to stop themselves, but they'll hate it. Speaking of X day, Reverend Zafod left

802
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,300
a message on, on the church headquarters phone last night with the most outrageous request.

803
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,400
He said,

804
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:49,620
can't you call Bob up and change the end of the world to like, I mean, you got it. It's set up for

805
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:55,260
seven o'clock in the morning, July 5th, 1998. And at seven o'clock in the morning, everybody's going

806
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,140
to be hung over. It's going to be horrible. They're not going to get up. They'd rather burn

807
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:05,120
with the pinks than get up in the morning, get up that early in the morning. So I'm sorry, Reverend

808
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,740
Zafod, but even if I did call Bob up about that, somehow I don't think that the Xs are going to

809
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,380
change their schedule.

810
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:43,360
Just because you don't want to be, the idea is you don't fall asleep the night before. Okay. You just stay up that way. You don't have the hangover. It'll of course, sooner or later, it's going to catch up with you. But, uh, you know, I'm, I'm just sorry. The, the, the, these God-like creatures from planet X just are not going to set their alarm. They're not going to be, I mean, you're just going to have to put up with their wake up call. All right. I mean, there's only so much that you can do.

811
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:50,060
You're going to have to get for that 20 bucks. I mean, eternal salvation is, is a lot to ask right there. You ought to be satisfied with that.

812
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:09,620
The difference is when a, when a, somebody in a, when a pink, a human sees something that shocks them, they run away. They don't like it. When a subgenius sees something that shocks them, that offends them, they go, what? This is, I'm shocked. I'm offended. I want to know more.

813
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:28,620
If they still don't like it, then they might lynch it. But that conspiracy, that confederacy of dunces, you know, the horrifying thing is it's not that they're stupid.

814
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:38,140
The individual pink may be much more intelligent than a given subgenius because look at the word subgenius. It's not the intelligence that counts. It's what you do with it.

815
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,500
It's common sense, sense of humor, and dollars and cents.

816
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:58,340
But yet these pinks, these mindless bovine stereotypes, and that's all they are. They're walking stereotypes. Sometimes generic slurs do apply in the case of pinks.

817
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:09,020
This is Lee Edwards, commonly known as the Christian con man, because I have total confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ as my savior.

818
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,940
And now this, this being my first album in Hawaii.

819
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:22,000
I want to dedicate this album new to you, my loving wife, for all the inspiration you have given me in life.

820
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,680
And their children are captives on the spot.

821
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,040
Also happy with Stretch Levi.

822
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,160
Also happy with Stretch Levi.

823
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,200
Etc.

824
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:40,700
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder.

825
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:41,840
Who?

826
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:42,840
Who?

827
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,340
Who?

828
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:53,440
And all you have to do is squeeze your little finger, ease your little finger back.

829
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,600
You can change the world, whatever else is true.

830
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,640
You trust your little finger.

831
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:12,760
Just a single little finger can change the world.

832
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:15,820
Just a single little finger can change the world.

833
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,520
Is that justice?

834
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,740
Is that proper?

835
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,600
I'm talking to you.

836
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,660
Life's so cruel.

837
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,500
Why not end it all?

838
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,420
Oh, man.

839
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,940
Happy birthday.

840
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,400
Gee, thanks, man.

841
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,620
I'm glad you went through all that trouble to write that for me.

842
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,600
You're welcome.

843
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:43,600


844
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,280
And if you can't whoop it, go down.

845
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,860
Go down.

846
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,920
That's a lesser-known slogan of Bob's.

847
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,840
No, go down sometimes.

848
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,320
I just want to tell you, don't pay no attention to my brother.

849
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:04,740
He...

850
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,640
I ain't no paying no attention to neither one of you.

851
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,540
He ain't got a good sense.

852
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,400
Yeah.

853
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,460
I don't want to pay no attention to him.

854
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,140
I wish y'all would've been worrying me.

855
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,300
Can you imagine not dropping me?

856
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:13,340
I'm not dropping you.

857
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,460
You ain't got nothing to worry about.

858
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:14,820
And all you gotta do is and you can't get me next time.

859
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:14,820


860
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:14,820


861
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:14,820


862
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:14,820


863
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,840
And I got nothing from the news.

864
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:15,840


865
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,060
I've been trying to be nice to you.

866
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,140
Oh, no.

867
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,120
I'm trying to be crazy.

868
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,040
That's the last we could do.

869
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:21,660
Well...

870
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,100
Don't call me no more, Mr. Portalez.

871
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,480
They're getting aggravated about it.

872
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,380
Don't pay no attention to my brother here.

873
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,080
Well, don't call me no more, either.

874
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,320
They're getting pete off about it.

875
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,860
Who is?

876
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,000
The company.

877
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,000
Oh, is that right?

878
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:34,320
Yeah.

879
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,400
Well...

880
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,120
They don't know who we are.

881
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,180
No, and I don't either.

882
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:38,880
Oh.

883
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,580
Well, I wish you wouldn't bring it up to my brother about his boy.

884
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,760
He tears him all to pieces.

885
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,700
I ain't brought it up.

886
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,560
He starts crying.

887
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,740
I didn't bring it up.

888
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,660
He says you call him.

889
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,000
I ain't done nothing.

890
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,040
I ain't done brought up.

891
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,540
The hell you the one wrong with calling me?

892
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,380
He says you call him about his brother.

893
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,900
Well, you know, the hour of slack really is made for those who tuned in by accident.

894
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,700
That's right.

895
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,320
Those who scanned the dial.

896
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,680
That's what the show is for.

897
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,960
Leave me alone, will you?

898
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:08,720
Leave me alone.

899
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,900
You got a house to rent?

900
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,820
No, I haven't.

901
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,160
Don't call this number no more.

902
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,120
What's wrong with your car?

903
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,860
I want motors.

904
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,840
The authority told me you got some rental property.

905
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,720
Motors.

906
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,660
Have you got anything else to do?

907
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,800
As long as they can sit and visualize world peace.

908
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,720
Boy, that's better than folk.

909
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,780
Boy, that's better than folk.

910
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,700
Because it's magic.

911
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,400
And think of the ant.

912
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,760
Oh, the ones you poison and step on.

913
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,880
They have rights, too.

914
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,260
Think of the lice that inhabit people.

915
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,100
They have rights.

916
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,520
They have rights, too.

917
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,160
What about Poo-hoo-jee?

918
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,140
What about bees?

919
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,180
That's right.

920
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,740
Nature is an open-ditch latrine in mid-summer.

921
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,780
Do not deny your evolutionary destiny.

922
00:42:53,100 --> 00:43:00,160
Which involves lots more sweating and being stinky and killing and stuff like that.

923
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:00,820
And frapping.

924
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,500
We try to keep the killing down and the frapping up.

925
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,480
But realize if you can visualize the nuclear winter,

926
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,960
you can save in your air conditioning belts.

927
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,780
If you believe.

928
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,340
But only if you believe.

929
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,840
And nuclear winter sports.

930
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,080
The nuclear winter Olympics.

931
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,000
The nuclear winter is hot.

932
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,720
It's cool.

933
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,820
He's going down the slope now.

934
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,200
Look, his hair blowing off in little tufts in the breeze.

935
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,820
Chunks of radiated flesh flying out.

936
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,640
It's so poetic.

937
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,020
Dangerous sex on skis.

938
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,440
Backwards.

939
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,360
But you see, the things like abortion and pro-life,

940
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,520
and contra-life or whatever you want to put it.

941
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,020
Those are all little issues that have been designed to keep you busy.

942
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,740
To keep you stirred up.

943
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,520
To keep you worrying about this.

944
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,740
And keep you worrying about that.

945
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,620
The war on drugs has eroded your civil liberties to the point where they can kick your door

946
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,280
in anytime they want to.

947
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,940
All they've got to do is say drugs and your wife is in jail.

948
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:58,860
You're in jail.

949
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,140
Your children are far away.

950
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,260
Cadillac's taken away.

951
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,320
Cadillac's taken away.

952
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,340
They can walk up to you in any airport in the United States.

953
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:06,340


954
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:23,480
United States of America and say, excuse me, did you pay for that ticket in cash? Yes, I did. Can we see your wallet, please? Here it is. Sir, you have cash money on you. We're going to have to confiscate it because you fit the profile of someone going somewhere probably to buy drugs.

955
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:41,460
This exists right now. The war on drugs is probably the single most divisive and single-minded effort to erode every little bit of freedom that we've managed to wring out of these sons of bitches in the last 200 years.

956
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:50,380
We've spent 200 years trying to spread that we the people to include someone else besides landowning aristocracy.

957
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,060
And now that we're finally beginning to do that,

958
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:58,800
they're going over to the other end of the Constitution and gradually saying, you don't have the right to do this.

959
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:04,060
You don't have the right to do that. Everything that is not forbidden is prescribed.

960
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,760
And if you don't watch it, we're going to get you. And that's what you've got to remember.

961
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:15,500
Nobody up there is a friend of yours. Nobody up there wants to see you have what you would call freedom.

962
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,620
The whole purpose of this government in this country right now is to produce

963
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,920
consumers and workers who will keep

964
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:27,140
the cost of labor down, the profits high for the earning people.

965
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,480
I'm not a communist or anything like that.

966
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:36,560
I'm just simply saying that if you believe that any of these people that are running for office are going to do anything for you as a subgenius,

967
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,180
if you believe any of these people who proclaim to be on the side of liberty and freedom give us what you want,

968
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,140
then you have bought the conspiracy lie.

969
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,100
Fascism back for the people!

970
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,080
Fascism for the people!

971
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:50,820
People!

972
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,560
The subgenius church is behind!

973
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,040
People!

974
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,000
People's fascism!

975
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,340
The individual fascism!

976
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,760
Don't visualize world peace. Visualize armed insurrection.

977
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,320
Every dad a duche.

978
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,460
That's right.

979
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,680
Every mom an evita.

980
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,120
So what are you guys going to do at this revival meeting?

981
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,060
You're going to make fun of religion and stuff, right?

982
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,620
We never make fun of religion.

983
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,740
You must understand we're making money off religion, but not fun off religion.

984
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,340
No.

985
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:19,760
No.

986
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,480
No fun.

987
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,240
No fun.

988
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:21,820
No fun.

989
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,840
No fun.

990
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,100
No fun.

991
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,100
No fun.

992
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,100


993
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:30,280
No fun.

994
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:30,540
No fun.

995
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,800
No fun.

996
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,740
No fun.

997
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,320
No fun.

998
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:33,900
No fun.

999
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,140
No fun.

1000
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:35,260


1001
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,300


1002
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,300


1003
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,300


1004
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,300


1005
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,300


1006
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,980
No fun.

1007
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:35,980


1008
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:35,980


1009
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:43,080
Well, as soon as you sign out the, uh, the Jewel Forum for the Lettuce Leaf Kids.

1010
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:50,540
I think you should put up with these guys because they know the right people.

1011
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,700
But you can trust me, Ivan Sting.

1012
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,440
Yes, you can trust me.

1013
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,500
I'm Dr. Ivan Sting.

1014
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,940
And I'm prepared to take your money and give you back your slide.

1015
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:07,980
And I'll be at the revival, the great subgenius revival on the 20th and the 21st at the Victoria Theatre.

1016
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,060
So you can believe in me.

1017
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,660
I'm Ivan Sting.

1018
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,660
I never lie, and I'm always right.

1019
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,480
It extends throughout the universe.

1020
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,880
It has to do with the universe.

1021
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,480
It has to do with Bolivians.

1022
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,320
It has to do with glass man.

1023
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:20,900
That's right, Brady's.

1024
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,440
It has to do with public evidence.

1025
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,020
It has to do with Gilligan's Island.

1026
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,640
It has to do with...

1027
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,580
You go to hell, you son of a bitch.

1028
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:29,880
What?

1029
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,780
You're so sick-minded.

1030
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,460
Why don't you meet me?

1031
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,960
I'm going to show you what sick human beings deserve in this world.

1032
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,760
Yeah, what do we deserve, my friend?

1033
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,900
We deserve your wife, Swampy.

1034
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,520
Yeah, how would you like to be mutilated?

1035
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,880
I don't believe you, you sleazy, slimy, dripping...

1036
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,240
Hold it down, I'm talking.

1037
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,400
Okay.

1038
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,640
I have gone low on you today.

1039
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,940
Do you think I don't know what the hell is going on?

1040
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,000
Do you think, for instance, that I don't know

1041
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,480
that Bill Broden is going out seeing Irene Hall?

1042
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,000
Yeah, the boy that's having that?

1043
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,220
Sure I know it.

1044
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:09,840
Don't you?

1045
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,680
What in the hell's the matter with you?

1046
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,780
What are you yelling, rat bastard, you mother...

1047
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,400
You're on fire.

1048
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,820
You come once or twice...

1049
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,380
Once or twice a year?

1050
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,300
That don't cut no ass with me, see?

1051
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,920
My ass, I'll tell you.

1052
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,660
I'm going to get on some asses today.

1053
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,800
I mean business.

1054
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,080
I'm putting it down, and I...

1055
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,660
I don't know what it means, but I ain't wanting any.

1056
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,340
No?

1057
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,000
Hell, fine.

1058
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,620
Hell, fine.

1059
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,920
All right.

1060
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,260
Okay.

1061
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,000
There's something else, too.

1062
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,740
I know.

1063
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,340
I noticed last Sunday

1064
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:55,260
that one of you put a quarter in the offering plate, see?

1065
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,080
Yeah, Raymond Welch.

1066
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,340
You're the one.

1067
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,840
You put a quarter in there.

1068
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,740
You tight son of a...

1069
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,900
I see all that, see?

1070
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,800
I'm up here where I can see it.

1071
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:11,700
Y'all don't even look or nothing.

1072
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,480
I can see it, see?

1073
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,380
Some of you are doing pretty good,

1074
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,360
and others you ain't doing for...

1075
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,560
All right.

1076
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,520
I'm going to maybe go to another church.

1077
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,400
I don't know.

1078
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,600
I don't give a...

1079
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,920
I've just about come to the end of the road here.

1080
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,560
I've just about lost patience with you people.

1081
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,120
You know we need a Sunday school space out there.

1082
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,680
You say, oh, amen, praise the Lord and all that

1083
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,780
when I'm saying something that you like.

1084
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,260
But when I'm trying to get something done,

1085
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,460
that's something else.

1086
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,160
You get your ass out to the mountains or someplace

1087
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,640
or hide in there and watch that damn tube.

1088
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,140
That's what you do.

1089
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,460
Listen, that ain't going to get it.

1090
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,360
The horse and the horses, it ain't going to do it.

1091
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,100
Uh-uh.

1092
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:09,060
Listen, I tell you, this will determine the day.

1093
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:14,440
No doubt whether I will be your pastor or not,

1094
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,460
but I tell you, if so, fine.

1095
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,620
That's what I want to do.

1096
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,980
But if not, I'm done.

1097
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,700
In fact, my sermon is done.

1098
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,800
Don't give me no more.

1099
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:33,340
Brother Woodrow, lead us in the closing prayer.

1100
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,200
Whether you're going to do it or not,

1101
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,500
I'm a sinner.

1102
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,540
Dismissed.

1103
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,620
How come you hit my brother so hard back here?

1104
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,420
Well, I don't know.

1105
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,700
I'm a hardy.

1106
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,420
You hit my brother.

1107
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,080
Oh, I did.

1108
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,000
Well, he said it deserved it.

1109
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,520
He said you knocked him loose with your shoestrings.

1110
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,300
I did.

1111
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,720
Well, that's good.

1112
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,180
I'll do it.

1113
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,520
I'm going to hit him hard at night next time

1114
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,300
if I ever get a chance to.

1115
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,620
This is potentially five and a half hours of calls.

1116
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,220
This will test whether you're hardcore or not.

1117
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,300
Yeah, yeah.

1118
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,940
But I can truthfully say that these calls

1119
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,560
probably mean more to me than any other calls I've ever heard,

1120
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,900
including ones that I've been somewhat involved in.

1121
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,960
These are, I think, the great...

1122
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,560
In fact, speaking of folklore,

1123
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,900
somebody tried to contact Arnie

1124
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,440
from the University of Virginia

1125
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,980
that was doing a folklore project.

1126
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,260
They wanted to talk to him.

1127
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,080
It's an example of southern folklore.

1128
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:31,720
Wow.

1129
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,740
Hey, so what is Arnie like?

1130
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,000
Very interesting.

1131
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,900
He's kind of like a Mayberry character.

1132
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,180
He sounds like a likable guy.

1133
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,820
In fact, the weekend that I called him,

1134
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,440
he was parking cars in his lawn for the county fair.

1135
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,380
Uh-huh.

1136
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:50,020
He's just a working guy that works in the parts department.

1137
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,640
He was friends with Benny for years.

1138
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,520
He says that Benny was his friend.

1139
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,640
He was a good guy.

1140
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,240
Used to go fishing together.

1141
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,600
He was just like what you would call a po-bucker,

1142
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,020
a bored po-bucker,

1143
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,140
who had been a prankster for years,

1144
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,000
but this was the first telephone prank he had engaged in.

1145
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,660
And he says he meant no malice from it.

1146
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,560
He meant no harm.

1147
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:14,080
But interestingly, he told me why the calls ended.

1148
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,200
Benny got a brain aneurysm.

1149
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,120
Control.

1150
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,660
He's his own church out there.

1151
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,800
Yeah, well.

1152
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,840
It's cold out here.

1153
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,380
Cold and lonely.

1154
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,040
Nobody can understand what's going on

1155
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,540
until the effects are turned down and your brain's turned up

1156
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,940
because it's 4.35 in the morning

1157
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,060
and the president's inside your head.

1158
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:37,960
I know.

1159
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,900
But it's so quiet here in the station.

1160
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,400
We're picking up dead vibrations.

1161
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,380
Good, good, good.

1162
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,640
Dead vibrations.

1163
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,360
Dear friends.

1164
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:57,920
So the KPFA show fades off into their dawn

1165
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,760
there in Berkeley, California.

1166
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:03,140
We don't have to worry about that dawn

1167
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:07,040
for it's the dawn of a new age here

1168
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:11,320
at the Dallas Subgenius Hour of Slack.

1169
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,380
And dear friends, I feel that I should give you a chance

1170
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,360
to write for free information about the Church of the Subgenius,

1171
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,940
if this is the first time you've ever tuned in

1172
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,620
and listened to this show.

1173
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:27,540
Well, there's a lot of other things involved in our faith here

1174
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:33,780
besides prank calls and seditious ranting

1175
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,680
about sexual freedom and how bad the normal people are.

1176
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,980
And you can get that free information

1177
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,940
by dropping us like a self-addressed stamped envelope.

1178
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,860
It would be the best thing you could.

1179
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,060
Just send us postcards.

1180
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:47,540
Shoot.

1181
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,820
You'll get a lot more with the self-addressed stamped envelope.

1182
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,240
And the place to send that is, of course,

1183
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,800
Bob at Post Office Box.

1184
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:08,080
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1185
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,740
You know, my Sunday night just doesn't seem complete

1186
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,880
unless I say that twice.

1187
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,020
That's Bob at Post Office Box.

1188
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,580
181-417.

1189
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,060
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1190
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,540
I am through.

1191
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,420
In fact, my sermon is through.

1192
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:34,840
Will, you want to lead us in the closing head-launching?

1193
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,560
Well, are you going to do it or what?

1194
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,720
Oh, one last thing.

1195
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,180
Oh, yeah.

1196
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,140
Oh, yeah.

1197
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1198
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:48,520


1199
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1200
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,580
Hee, hee, hee.

1201
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1202
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,300
Come on, baby.

1203
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,740
Don't you you be late?

1204
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,480
I want your head.

1205
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,720
I want it tonight.

1206
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,000
Cut your head off.

1207
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,320
A high fence ain't it?

1208
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,300
Heaven know my wall, but a high fence ain't it?

1209
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,620
Yeah, come on, baby.

1210
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,160
I want that head.

1211
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,160
Come on.

1212
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,980
I want your head to hang on my wall tonight.

1213
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,380
My son.

1214
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,640
My son.

1215
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:33,800
My son.

1216
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:35,540
Go!

1217
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,360
Go!

1218
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:41,560
Go!

1219
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,560
Go!

1220
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:11,640
Go!

1221
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,380
Go!

1222
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:54,960
Whoa!

1223
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:00,240
Before I go too much further into this tape, which ain't gonna be far because we only got about one minute left,

1224
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:04,180
I should mention that I don't know who sent us this tape.

1225
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,200
Boy, people send us such wonderful tapes and then they don't put their own name on it.

1226
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,000
This says, Look Out Miami.

1227
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,100
And lists the ten zillion cuts of music and records that were on it.

1228
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,900
But I can't remember which envelope it came out of.

1229
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,440
If anybody knows, tell us.

1230
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,340
Let's have another drink.

1231
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,680
Oh, stop it! You're killing me!

1232
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:35,980
It makes me feel much better just talking to you.

1233
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,060
Anytime, baby. Anytime.

1234
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,740
I can't get over how wonderful Miami is.

1235
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,220
And it's fine, but you shouldn't cry or be overjoyed about yourを.

1236
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,900
You've full control over the вінne´s answer.

1237
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,440
But if I drink any champagne and I end up drinking like a nerd...

1238
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:56,440


1239
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:56,580
Then you better drink it.

1240
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:56,580


1241
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:04,520
So hoi přêmść g Dark Night

1242
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:09,980


1243
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:09,980


1244
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,540
I'll play it and tell you what it is later.

1245
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,300
I'll play it and tell you what it is later.

1246
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,120
Sing that Billy Sweet William now

1247
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,980
Married life done changed him somehow

1248
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,920
He's the man the town used to fear

1249
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,840
Now they all call him Sweet Papa Willie dear

1250
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,180
Stronger than Samson I declare

1251
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:48,100
Till the brown-skinned woman's bobbed his hair

1252
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,340
Excuse me

1253
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:01,140
No wearing out my twat

1254
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,040
I'll play it and tell you what it is later

1255
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,140
I'll play it and tell you what it is later
