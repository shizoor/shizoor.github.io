1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,340
This show's satellite feed, beyond satellite.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,380
It is a tool created by man, for man, for men to use.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,840
Like a screwdriver, or a hammer, or a wrench.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,720
It's something to manipulate something with, isn't it?

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,780
That's what it is, like, oh, let me screw this screwdriver.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,780
I'm just gonna screw you down, you're the public.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,080
Let me get you in my vice here.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,240
TV is a tool. It can be used to do anything.

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,540
Like, you can take a hammer, and you can, like, nail something in the wall,

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,880
and hang something good up on the wall, or you can beat someone's skull in with it.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,200
Same idea. It's not the tool, it's who uses it.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,840
Who it's created for. Do you understand?

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,480
Do you get it, man? Comprende?

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,440
And you have babies, don't you?

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,980
They eat pablum. You know that stuff that really isn't anything?

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,340
It's just pablum? That's what TV is.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,200
It's pablum. Want some? Want some?

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,000
It's good. Sure? It's good.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,820
Want some? Want some?

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,980
Sure? Open wide. It's good.

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,100
Here comes the pablum. Gonna force feed you.

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,200
Want some? Sure? Good.

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,340
It's good. Want some? Want some?

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,120
It's pablum.

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,480
You know what I'm saying?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,120
I'm gonna force feed you the pablum. You want some?

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,920
The man on the TV is gonna force feed me the joke I don't want.

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,500
Invite some people over. Here, I'm gonna invite some people over.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,260
I'm gonna tell them to come over to the wrestling.

30
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,880
There's Hulk Hogan. Come on over. Watch a little TV.

31
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,080
There's Don Johnson.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,940
And behold, the man that came from the TV screen.

33
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,400
Amen, can you say hallelujah?

34
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,340
And he came walking down that lane.

35
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,360
And his name was television.

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,500
Thirty, thirty, thirty. Count them.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,460
And he started. Frames per second.

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,760
Coming at you, TV.

39
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,340
What started as a dream has become a reality.

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,320
It's everybody's reality.

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,640
Don't even bother, cause you can't ignore her.

42
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,460
She's TV. She's everybody's reality.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,840
It's my reality. It's your reality.

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,020
It's my vision. It's my dream.

45
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,180
I'm the Mustang.

46
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,960
And I can tell you, start praying to a new God.

47
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,680
Start praying to a new, new God.

48
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,300
I'm a new God.

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,480
Don't you know you're watching? Aren't you?

50
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,140
Yes.

51
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,380
Yes.

52
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,940
I can see you're still watching.

53
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:56,940


54
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:56,940


55
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:56,940


56
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:56,940


57
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:10,120
I also awoke from the same dream realizing that I had subconsciously gained knowledge of a deductive technique

58
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,640
involving mind-body coordination operating hand-in-hand with the self-genius.

59
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,860
Our old sweat.

60
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,420
Everything about it is dislocated, dreamy, and agitated.

61
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:28,840
It's hallucinatory, higgledy-piggledy panoramas like some deranged overview of Mr. Rogers' neighborhood.

62
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,720
A bird's-eye view of the lower depths.

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:42,380
The sub-genius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station

64
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,240
and only in the city of...

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,120
Here's your host.

66
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,300
My name is Mike.

67
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,880
His name.

68
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,700
Is Bob.

69
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,540
Bob is the slack-jawed leader of...

70
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,260
Bob is the slack-jawed leader of...

71
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,160
Bob is the slack-jawed leader of this gang of ragamuffin dopers.

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,140
It doesn't take much to be the leader of this pack.

73
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,720
I'll say.

74
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,380
Bob wins out through the sheer force of his lunatic savvy.

75
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,200
He may be perpetually groggy from the residue of a thousand fixes.

76
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,200
Bob is the slack-jawed leader of...

77
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,100
But when he's pulling off a robbery, he's surprisingly agile and quick-witted.

78
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,300
He also has as many superstitions as a professional.

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,980
Bob and his gang don't want to get rich.

80
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,980
They're going to stay high.

81
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,320
Has the soulful, famished look of the undead.

82
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,460
Which, in a sense, is what he is.

83
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,520
I'm the Will of Dobbs.

84
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,960
A half-educated boy just like you and me has the unmitigated nerve to stand up and say

85
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,040
God told him to rewrite the Holy Bible because it's full of errors.

86
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,960
Errors, mind you.

87
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,400
And to go out and preach that old churches are an abomination to society.

88
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,800
I'm not going to lie to the Lord except this one.

89
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,760
That God told him personally to go out and get an army to run.

90
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,800
Give him a trumpet and I bet he'd say he's Gabriel himself.

91
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,560
Perversely, they love to export their birth control devices, their precious condoms,

92
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:17,080
their precious condoms,

93
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,820
their precious condoms,

94
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,900
condoms,

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:21,740
their...

96
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,260
condoms,

97
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:23,460
condoms,

98
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,360
their clever,

99
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,240
their precious,

100
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,800
their clever

101
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,740
and well developed abortion techniques,

102
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,240
abortion,

103
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,540
their pletio-

104
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,740
abortion techniques.

105
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,660
Techniques, techniques, techniques.

106
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,040
Their precious condoms,

107
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,340
abortion techniques,

108
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,920
abortion techniques,

109
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,520
abortion techniques,

110
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,760
abortion techniques.

111
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,660
Techniques, techniques, techniques.

112
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,200
Their precious condoms,

113
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,460
abortion techniques,

114
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,040
abortion techniques,

115
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,480
abortion techniques,

116
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,060
abortion,

117
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:01,820
techniques. Now, techniques, techniques, techniques, abortion techniques, abortion techniques. Now,

118
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,880
if we think of international relations to kill their own countries, what contem- cont- country,

119
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,880
cont- cont- cont- country, country, cont- they must talk for us. What contempt to kill their

120
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:25,760
own countries. As for food, could care for 20 billion people. To the overpopulation trees,

121
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:33,080
what contem- cont- country, cont- cont- what contem- cont- country, cont- cont- country,

122
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,780
cont- cont- cont- drum thumpers, anyhow, drum thumpers, anyhow, drum thumpers, anyhow,

123
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,220
drum thumpers, anyhow, drum thumpers, anyhow.

124
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,480
What's a mere 5 billion people?

125
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,040
What's a mere 5 billion people?

126
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,000
They're all countries.

127
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,700
What cunt?

128
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,620
Anyhow.

129
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,400
What's a mere 5 billion?

130
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,320
Anyhow.

131
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,880
To the overpopulation drum thumpers.

132
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,040
Anyhow.

133
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,600
Compared to our escalating abortion rate.

134
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,300
In abortion.

135
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,660
Escalating abortion rate.

136
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,320
In abortion.

137
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,440
True, of every 500,

138
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,580
there's a 5 billion.

139
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,860
There's a 500,

140
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,140
there's a 5 billion.

141
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,180
There's a 500,

142
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,860
there's a 5 billion.

143
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,420
God bless.

144
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,000
God bless.

145
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,680
You and me.

146
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,320
Hello,

147
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,720
listeners and others.

148
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,300
Yeah, the monitors I'm talking to.

149
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:37,920
Now, you know,

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,360
you monitors out there know exactly

151
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,740
to whom I'm

152
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,720
talking to you.

153
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:44,500
That's right.

154
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,760
We know you're out there monitoring

155
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,800
us, but we love,

156
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,080
we love our listeners, but we

157
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,560
hate the monitors.

158
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,120
So, you keep listening. You won't understand

159
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,440
the half of what you hear.

160
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,400
And in fact, our regular listeners may not

161
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,980
because I don't really myself.

162
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,600
Tonight is going to be a

163
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,900
noisy show.

164
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,980
So, you might

165
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,920
follow

166
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,080
my lead and wear headphones.

167
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,220
I have to wear headphones or the show

168
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,780
makes even less sense than it

169
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,400
ordinarily would, but

170
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,060
you out there,

171
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,540
I'd put on my headphones if I were you.

172
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,260
It's just a

173
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,720
thing I like to do

174
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,660
is put on my headphones.

175
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,720
So, tonight,

176
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,260
you want to know that, well, so far,

177
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,680
what have we heard so far?

178
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,540
Blade Runner right now.

179
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,340
Start praying to a new

180
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,440
God. That was the Sedition

181
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,520
Commission and

182
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,120
oh, then some

183
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,240
Twin Peaks stuff. That was Agent

184
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,460
Cooper. We haven't forgotten you,

185
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,920
boys.

186
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,480
And, oh, you know,

187
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,500
Bob is the Slackjaw Leader. I've played

188
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,040
that before.

189
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,300
And then that little

190
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,300
little thing where the

191
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,340
fellow was in such an uproar over

192
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,120
our precious condoms

193
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,520
and our abortion techniques.

194
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,000
See, our

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,100
condoms and abortion techniques

196
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,120
are, by

197
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,000
definition, totally different from

198
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,320
the norm, that which you are familiar

199
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,400
with. Even some of you long-time members

200
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
may not be totally aware of some of our

201
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,680
precious condoms

202
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,220
and abortion techniques.

203
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,060
There, there.

204
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,300
Be watching for that new book of the subgenius.

205
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,260
And that's mostly

206
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,100
what's been going on at the headquarters this

207
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,300
week or so, is working on that

208
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,260
new book, despite

209
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,240
the work is continuing,

210
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,560
despite the best efforts of the conspiracy

211
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,260
and

212
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,420
why the church itself seems to be

213
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,760
trying to throw a couple of

214
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,120
monkey wrenches in the works.

215
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,660
But that's another story.

216
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,440
What else?

217
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,240
Well, myself, one thing I've been doing quite a bit

218
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,680
at the headquarters this week is

219
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,060
changing addresses

220
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,840
on the hundreds

221
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,040
of stark fists

222
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,980
which came back to us

223
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,820
because you out there

224
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,000
that have moved

225
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,340
didn't see fit

226
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,220
to be telling

227
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,420
the truth.

228
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,340
Well, anybody.

229
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,200
You know, the post office, which I can sort of understand.

230
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,400
But you didn't even

231
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,060
tell us that you were moving.

232
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,120
Was that a good idea?

233
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,120
I don't think so. You see, because

234
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,480
if you don't tell us,

235
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,560
you won't get your stark fist.

236
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,380
Now occasionally, if it's been a recent enough move,

237
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,300
why, the good old post office

238
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,380
will let us know and

239
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,400
we have to go through an incredible amount of trouble

240
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,460
re-entering those addresses and sending

241
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,020
them out at great expense and

242
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,420
it tends to sour us.

243
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,600
on those of you who've done that.

244
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,180
And then of course we get those letters

245
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,980
from people, I heard there was a new stark fist out.

246
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,020
Bob.

247
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,720
See, Bob doesn't

248
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,500
do the dirty work, but still.

249
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,540
Bob, I didn't get

250
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,260
my new stark fist. I want to know why.

251
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,440
My friend, my friend down the street got his

252
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,460
or hers.

253
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,960
Now it's true, I did move

254
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,080
two or three times without telling you, but

255
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,300
you know, still.

256
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,260
It's amazing how many people will actually write

257
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,100
that sentence, that I moved a couple of times

258
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,640
without telling you, but they still don't

259
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,500
subgeniuses. Some more sub than others.

260
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,180
So, in the future, and

261
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,340
those of you listening, because this does not

262
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
merely relate to Dallas, obviously.

263
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,420
This relates to, you know,

264
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,340
many other cities where we're

265
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,060
broadcast. So please, dear friends,

266
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,720
when you move, let us know.

267
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,100
So stay tuned for

268
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,700
Church of the Subgenius

269
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Hour of Slack

270
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Radio Ministry. To start out tonight,

271
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:40,760
...

272
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:43,980
Ah,

273
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,620
Steve Stein.

274
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,820
...

275
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,620
We'll be right back

276
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,320
after this word, word,

277
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,020
word, word, word.

278
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,040
...

279
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,640
...

280
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,060
...

281
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,880
...

282
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,740
...

283
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,340
...

284
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,340
...

285
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,520
...

286
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:05,660
...

287
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:05,680
...

288
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:14,980
...

289
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,420
It's

290
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,680
so fresh!

291
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,520
Look at that shine!

292
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,740
Look at that shine!

293
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,860
Look at that shine!

294
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:21,900
Oh, yes!

295
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,600
Lemon,

296
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,040
chicken,

297
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:23,800
liver.

298
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,480
Alright

299
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
Hey, Mom, can I have some more?

373
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,720
that was Steve Stein.

374
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,840
I'm trying to remember to give credit where credit is due.

375
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,340
So that was Steve Stein.

376
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,160
And this, I hope, is Spinal Tap.

377
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,740
You've been bad

378
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,820
Don't do what I say

379
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,500
You don't listen

380
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,500
You never obey

381
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,400
I try to teach you

382
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,400
But you just won't be good

383
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,920
You won't behave the way a big girl should

384
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,000
It's time to give that whip a crack

385
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,760
I'm gonna have to send you back to

386
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,740
Best Go

387
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,600
Best Go

388
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:06,660
Best Go

389
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,960
You're a beauty

390
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,260
You're the best of your breed

391
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,860
You're a handful

392
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,960
And I know what you need

393
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,660
Any training

394
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,780
Gonna bring you to heel

395
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,420
I'm gonna break you with my will of steel

396
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,440
Discipline is my middle name

397
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,000
And no one comes back the same

398
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,100
Best Go

399
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,900
Best Go

400
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,780
No more skipping strangers

401
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,380
Or running free at night

402
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,680
You think my box's bad, honey

403
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,100
Wait till you feel my bite

404
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,560
Wait till you feel my bite

405
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,060
Right

406
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,320
Right

407
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,200
Right

408
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,320
Right

409
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,320


410
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,320


411
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,320


412
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,860
Right

413
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,600
Right

414
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:02,920
Right

415
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,600
Right

416
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,840
I got problems

417
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,900
You whine and you beg

418
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,480
When I'm busy

419
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,880
You wanna dance with my leg

420
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,440
I'm gonna tell you

421
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,620
Make you sleep out the door

422
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,460
You're so flaccid

423
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,740
When you're down on all fours

424
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,820
And when you hear

425
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,940
Your master's name

426
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,780
You will come a little faster

427
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,940
Fight the best goal

428
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,460
Best goal

429
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,120
Best goal

430
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,760
I'm not here to take you back

431
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,320
Best goal

432
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:05,160
Best goal

433
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,720
Good girl

434
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,480
Best goal

435
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,620
Best goal

436
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,180
Be bold

437
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,280
Be brave

438
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,060
God protect us

439
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,400
Beat the GD

440
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,400


441
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,580
Beat the aument

442
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:28,580


443
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:28,580


444
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:28,580


445
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:28,840
Get me high out

446
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,120
Hit the ông

447
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,640
Don't look down

448
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,700
You can hit the Austin

449
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,020
Have you lost your dog?

450
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:19,320
We were up in heaven, but now we're in the mud.

451
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:26,640
We fell off the wagon, you should have heard the thud.

452
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,880
We were so superior, that was just a phase.

453
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,540
We were high on that for the 14 boring days.

454
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,840
You decide to skip mass and abuse drugs today, and you're comfortable.

455
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,600
Will I end up a bum? Will I end up a crumb?

456
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,820
Will I end up in hell? Will I end up in jail?

457
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,220
Will I end up in Jesus? Will I end up in trees?

458
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,940
Will I end up rich, rich, rich, rich?

459
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,600
Rich.

460
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,820
And the reality of where you are brings you back.

461
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,400
You're a real man.

462
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,700
Fight, fight, cigar.

463
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,940
You're a real man.

464
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,060
You're a real man.

465
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,200
You're a real man.

466
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,800
Hit it, hit it.

467
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,320
Hit it, hit it.

468
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,420
Time.

469
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,820
You've got 48 hours to save a life.

470
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,280
You've got a lot of time.

471
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,340
What a sweat.

472
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,200
Now's the time.

473
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,180
What a sweat.

474
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,160
What a sweat.

475
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,180
What a sweat.

476
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,300


477
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:40,860
A minute.

478
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,260
Nothing happens until someone buys something.

479
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Nothing happens until someone buys something.

480
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,320
Now you might be telling yourself, the project sounds great.

481
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,900
What can I say? It's just beautiful.

482
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:03,840
The project in its packaged form is available for your use immediately, with your own chosen title for the album.

483
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,240
As well as the entire inside cover surface for your use.

484
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:19,000
Take two high-quality stereo LPs, put them in a full-cover jacket, add a beautiful sexy gal on front, and candid photos of the KQ jocks inside.

485
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,060
And you've got a bombshell.

486
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,980
You could see it in the streets and smell it in the air.

487
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,580
There was a sort of electric quality about it.

488
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,500
Everyone knew this time there was no fooling around.

489
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,320
They meant it.

490
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,480
They really meant it.

491
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,060
Please put down your weapon.

492
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,620
You have 20 seconds to comply.

493
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,200
I think you'd better do what he says, Mr. Kennedy.

494
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,020
Did he say, I think you'd better do what he says, Mr. Kennedy?

495
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,780
That's right, it was Robocop.

496
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,160
Ed 209 killed JFK.

497
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,620
I knew it all along.

498
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,100
So, what have we been up to here since last we spoke?

499
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,080
I mean, if you knew what I was doing when I listened to this.

500
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,000
First, of course, we heard Spinal Tap doing bitch school.

501
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,520
So good to hear from them again.

502
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,860
Most of this media barrage you've heard so far.

503
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,300
And we'll hear this from Food For The Dead.

504
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,180
And then we'll hear the Fights of the Gods, which is Blaise Brown's show from New Orleans.

505
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,260
New Orleans.

506
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,580
So, what do you want to hear now?

507
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:49,020
Of course, now you're listening to the Raymond Scott Project.

508
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:56,300
That guy was, uh, Carl Stallings took a lot of, arranged a lot of his music, of course,

509
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,380
for the Warner Brothers cartoons.

510
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,040
I kind of prefer the Carl Stallings arrangements myself.

511
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,280
But isn't it great?

512
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,420
We live in a world where we're able to get this new stuff.

513
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,880
I mean, I've dreamed all my life of being able to hear Warner Brothers cartoon music on,

514
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,000
well, I certainly didn't imagine CDs or anything.

515
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,100
You know, give me a break.

516
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,320
It's a wonderful, wonderful world we live in, friends.

517
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,760
And how about, how about a little number here called

518
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,600
The Creation Science Polka

519
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,260
by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

520
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,200
Everyone's a project these days.

521
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,740
And so here they are.

522
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,260
Stay tuned.

523
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,880
Come on, everyone, join the fun.

524
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,960
We've got tanking on the run.

525
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,960
The Earth is circled by the sun.

526
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,620
Creation Science Polka.

527
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,120
Science classes in our schools taught by superstitious fools.

528
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,180
Jerry Falwell sets the rules.

529
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,820
Creation Science Polka.

530
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:30,980
The universe was fabricated in six literal days.

531
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:39,120
The humans and the dinosaurs shared a condo in L.A.

532
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,700
Carbon dating makes us cringe.

533
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,600
We're the right wing lunatic fringe.

534
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,700
Jesus died for our sins.

535
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,360
Creation Science Polka.

536
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,220

The Bible says the earth is only 6,000 years old.

543
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:55,440
Deny and Jesus Christ will roast your balls on burning coal.

544
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,840
Come on everyone, join the fun.

545
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,940
Ignorance has almost won.

546
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,900
Get geology from a nun.

547
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,540
Creation science polka.

548
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,000
Take your children out of school.

549
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,000
Homespun dogma is so cool.

550
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,180
Prop them up, watch them drool.

551
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,680

00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:00,920


562
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,720
com

563
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,340
Sometimes, when she talks to me like that,

564
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,340
I feel I'd like to go up there and curse her

565
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,980
and leave her forever.

566
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,040
Or at least defy her.

567
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,240
But I know I can't.

568
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,460
She's ill.

569
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,120
I understand.

570
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,300
I don't hate her.

571
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,360
I hate what she's become.

572
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,380
I hate the illness.

573
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,920
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried.

574
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,980
Buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the past ten years.

575
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,940
I am sorry, boy, but you do manage to look a little different

576
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,980
when you give me orders.

577
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,120
Please, mother.

578
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,160
No, I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

579
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,880
You think I'm fruity, huh?

580
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,500
I'm staying right here.

581
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,160
This is my room and no one will drag me out of it.

582
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,560
Least of all my big foes.

583
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,280
Son of a...

584
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,720
Now come now, mother.

585
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,600
He came after the girl and now someone will come after him.

586
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,720
Mother, please.

587
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,940
It's just for a few days.

588
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,820
Just for a few days so they won't find you.

589
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,100
Just for a few days?

590
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,720
And that's dog-stained fruit cellar?

591
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,040
No!

592
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,340
You hit me there once, boy.

593
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,360
I'll do it again.

594
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,320
I'll do it again.

595
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,120
Now get out!

596
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,340
I'm sure this pain in the asses is a lot for my unofficial payment.

597
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,140
sostituting a second hub would still

598
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,800
On the period of much

599
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,100
I told you to get out!

600
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,040
I will carry you, mother.

601
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,140
Norman, that's what you think you're doing.

602
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,920
Don't you touch me.

603
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,460
Don't.

604
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,780
Norman.

605
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,840
Put me down.

606
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,220
Put me down.

607
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,400
This place happens to be my only world.

608
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,260
I grew up in that house up there.

609
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,700
I had a very happy childhood.

610
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,040
My mother and I were more than happy.

611
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,560
It's sad when a mother has to speak the words that condemn her own son.

612
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,300
But I couldn't allow them to believe that I would commit murder.

613
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,140
And again, that was Creation Science Polka by the Rudy Schwartz Project

614
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,980
and Elmwood by...

615
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,560
No, no, Elmwood Doing, the Bates Motel.

616
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,160
Stay tuned.

617
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,000
We have a...

618
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,720
It's a very musical show tonight, I seem to notice.

619
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,240
It's quite deliberate.

620
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,680
Here's one I don't think we've seen before.

621
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:58,680


622
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:58,680


623
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,440
We've never played before.

624
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,300
Left goes left where it should be.

625
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,640
Right goes to right accordingly.

626
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,660
I therefore praise these gentlemen

627
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:26,060
who know and show both the how and when.

628
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:42,040
50 years of mountress secrets thought toémentary martial arts studies.

629
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,340

639
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:43,720
for her...

640
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,020
for her...

641
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,780
stupidass!

642
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,800
I met an anarchist in Tompkins Square Park

643
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,860
He was an angry man, spitting words so dark

644
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,660
He called for death to rich men, death to the obese too

645
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:20,080
Death to hard-backed bourgeois blacks, death to landlord Jews

646
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,240
Kill the bankers, kill the cops, kill him, her and me

647
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:37,700
Kill them all for CBS, NBC, ABC, TVN, CNN, HBO, Live at Five, MTV, Street Break, Party Weekend, Sunday, Jesse, White Day Out

648
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,100
I wrote a book, I sing you, we just had a baby

649
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,100
And I said

650
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,040
Hey

651
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,180
Hey

652
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,440
Hey

653
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,060
Hey

654
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,320
Hey

655
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,900
Hey

656
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,000
Hey

657
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,020
Hey

658
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,860
Hey

659
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:14,920
Hey

00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:14,940
Hey

661
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,660
Hey

662
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:20,800
Think you could live forever

00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,560
Rebel Stanton, God damn, I'd like to have you sing your tune

671
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,640
But I've been making friends with this here death

672
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,880
And it seems a night too soon

673
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,340
And I said

674
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,940
Hello Death, goodbye the new age

675
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm getting tired of waiting, tired of being afraid

676
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,840
Joseph Campbell gave me hope and now I have him saved

677
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,960
So I say

678
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,020
Hello Death, goodbye the new age

679
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,320
Now I'm getting tired of waiting, tired of being afraid

680
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:35,100
So I'm not trying to be flippant here or irreverent or exploitive or sarcastic or ironic or postmodern

681
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,740
And this is not a parody

682
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,940
Get it? Got it? Good

683
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:48,980
I've been thinking what he told me that took me to cry

684
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:55,140
When we held the crystal teen and the child spent twelve grand to buy

685
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,200
Homeopathic pie

686
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,320
Homeopathic pie

687
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,120
Fresh squeeze wheatgrass juice

688
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,780
Doctors off in Bellevue

689
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,440
Doctors, Salk and Sue

690
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,380
Sonnets, time will all be going home if you can find a way

691
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:19,560
Yes, everyone is going on, going on to stay

692
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,140
And it's time we find a way to cope

693
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,640
A way to find some hope

694
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,320
Some it's the best

695
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,880
Bible or Buddha

696
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,220
Or Muhammad or Krishna

697
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,580
Or cheesecake or bourbon

698
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,780
Or the butthole of Silphos

699
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,540
Or it's Jojo Armani or Romeo

700
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,400
Or Shigley and you really can't afford it

701
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,160
But it looks so fabulous on you so why don't you take it on home

702
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,320
And speaking of home

703
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,080
Is it about time you moved out of that East Village hellhole

704
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,800
You know, the one with the honeymooner's view of the brick wall out the window

705
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,820
Because you deserve something more like affirming like a tree or a flower

706
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,640
Or a patch of grass or a singing little bluebird

707
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,820
Or maybe you just want to take your boyfriend to Europe cause he's never been there

708
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,880
Or the job you always hated

709
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,000
Or you learned how to play the guitar

710
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,480
It's easy

711
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,160
Or getting seemly drunk at a piano bar

712
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,400
Or sing show tunes

713
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,580
And don't be embarrassed because at this point I'd rather see

714
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,300
Brigadoon than Henry for portrait of a serial killer

715
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,460
Or maybe you'd like to get politically active

716
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,360
See a disruptive presidential press conference by shoving a five pound week old stock of broccoli

717
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,480
Between those thin lying lizard lips that no one can read anyway

718
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,920
Because half the country's a litter and the other half is apathetic

719
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,660
Including the first lady who couldn't step just five hundred feet of the ground

720
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,460
Over-decorate a white house to visit the goddamn quilter

721
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,440
Maybe you'd like to put a bullet in a Jesse Helms pea brain

722
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,180
But you know when you start thinking like that

723
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,600
When you start thinking like they do

724
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,080
Then it's time to let go of the material world

725
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,040
So maybe you'd just like to get yourself some religion

726
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,960
Cause Jesus is the way

727
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,320
Jesus is the way

728
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,720
Jesus is the way

729
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,900
Jesus is the way

730
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,600
Jesus is the way

731
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:50,640
Jesus is the way

732
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,640
Besides, it's a lot easier to accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior

733
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,860
When he looks like Willem Dafoe

734
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,200
But maybe that stuff turns you off so your end power of myth

735
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,820
Made me feel really good for about ten minutes

736
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,720
Or maybe you'd just rather do acid and listen to Led Zeppelin

737
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,000
Then again, the last time I took hallucinogenic drugs was about five years ago

738
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,120
I took mushrooms and Joshua Tree

739
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,080
Looking for that Carlos Castaneda kind of experience

740
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,360
I got off, my boyfriend didn't, he fell asleep

741
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,840
Left me alone with the television

742
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,980
Turned it on, put on PBS

743
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,780
You know what was on?

744
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,280
Berlin Alexanderplatz

745
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,000
So I started watching it and

746
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,600
You know what?

747
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,000
I got really bummed out

748
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,580
And that's when I said no to drugs

749
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,580
No to drugs

750
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,640
No no no no no

751
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,400
Hell no to drugs

752
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,340
And maybe you wanna say no to drugs too

753
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,340
Or maybe you just wanna join

754
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,380
Atheists of America

755
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,420
The Madonna fan club

756
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,460
Or watch Richard Gere

757
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,160
Follow the Dalai Lama across the world

758
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,260
And then do those oh-so-Zen-like movies

759
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,480
With those oh-so-Zen-like messages like

760
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,300
Hey, it's fun to be a prostitute

761
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,600
I can't wait to spread my legs across Hollywood Boulevard

762
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,500
Because then maybe some rich, handsome billionaire in a Jag

763
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,860
Will come driving up and take me shopping on Rodeo's

764
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,120
And then drive

765
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,660
And that's what a woman's all about anyway, right?

766
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,140
Sucking and shopping

767
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,420
Come on, it's a singalong

768
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,480
Sucking and shopping

769
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,460
But hey, who am I to argue?

770
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,280
Because it's the feel-good movie of the summer

771
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,980
It's the feel-good movie of the year

772
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,640
It's the feel-good movie of the nineties

773
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,380
It's the feel-good movie of the millennium

774
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:55,880
And you know what?

775
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,860
Oh, yeah

776
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,700
There's a smile on your face and a song in your heart and a spring in your step well

777
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,900
Whatever makes you happy?

778
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,060
Whatever makes you happy?

779
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,260
Whatever makes you happy?

780
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:13,200
Whatever gives you hope

781
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:23,260
Even if it's a truly tasteless

782
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,140
joke

783
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,720
joke

784
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,980
joke

785
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,280
so

786
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,920
back to

787
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,580
manifesto

788
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,080
pencil in a

789
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,400
date

790
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,920
let me know when something

791
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,940
gives I hope it's not

792
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,240
too late

793
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,740
cause I'm

794
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,700
getting tired of waiting

795
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,220
tired of being

796
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:51,900
afraid

797
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,400
joseph

798
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,080
campbell gave me hope and

799
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,360
now I have been saved

800
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,700
so I sing

801
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,280
hello

802
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,340

00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,300
goodbye

00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,620
avenue A

805
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,540
hello death

806
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,140
goodbye

807
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,440
avenue A

808
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,080
hello

809
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,960
death

810
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:21,840
goodbye

811
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,900
avenue A

812
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,160
hello

813
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,140
death

814
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:29,560
goodbye

815
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,920
avenue A

816
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,220
hello

817
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:56,340
avenue A

818
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:56,340


819
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,400
hahaha

820
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,240
hahaha

821
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,060
hahaha

822
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,980
hey what are we laughing for

823
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,320
I was

824
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,720
dirty

825
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,660
I'm a big

826
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,220
man of

827
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,560
coo

828
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:15,680
coo

829
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,380
He's not dirty

830
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,140
But this man

831
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,500
Has his own banter

832
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,380
Chip, chip, chip, chip, chip

833
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,140
Chip, chip, chip, chip, chip

834
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,140
Chip, chip, chip, chip, chip

835
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,180
I wonder what became of that chip

836
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,380
Chip, chip, chip, chip, chip

837
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,040
I thought you kicked the TV

838
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,360
I thought you kicked the TV

839
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,540
Chip, chip, chip, chip, chip, chip

840
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,420
I hope you don't miss O.B.C.

841
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,180
Okay

842
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,040
That was Skank

843
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,020
The aptly named Skank doing a song called

844
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,060
Shimp

845
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,600
We thank OBE for that one

846
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,500
Hmm, and before that of course was

847
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,380
Bong Water

848
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,860
Featuring the lovely and talented

849
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,860
Ann Magnus

850
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,580
Man, what a babe

851
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,940
Mm-hmm

852
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,240
So it's a song called Folk Song

853
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,940
From the album The Power of

854
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,520
Something I can't say on this show

855
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,060
But

856
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,900
A lot of you have one

857
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,920
Call up the station here

858
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,460
Or write to the subgenius P.O. Box

859
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,240
Which is P.O. Box

860
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,360
140306 in Dallas, Texas in La Florida

861
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,180
We'll tell you the name of that album

862
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,040
And look for Ann

863
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,620
And well she was on a sitcom on ABC

864
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,960
For a while there and

865
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,760
Oh, she's been in

866
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,980
Saw her over the weekend

867
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,260
In Making Mr. Right

868
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:57,960
Which was cute

869
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,940
But I

870
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,460
Of course my favorite role of hers

871
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,320
Was in The Hunger

872
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,180
She's not in it for long

873
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,700
But she makes quite an impression

874
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,800
So let's get back to the show

875
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,560
Thank you

876
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,960
You now have 15 seconds to reply

877
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,600
You are in direct violation

878
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,700
Of the 130th and 79th

879
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,620
I say to you

880
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,380
I say to you

881
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:26,680
I say to you

882
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,340
I say to you

883
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,700
Be prepared to enter a world

884
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,020
Of adventure that you have never imagined

885
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,640
Be prepared to enter a world

886
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:33,920
Of adventure that you have never imagined

887
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,240
Rather than the one we face

888
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,400
Where something is really exciting

889
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,040
And there is no way

890
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,640
To penetrate this barrier

891
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,120
It is the strength of a million souls

892
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,740
The power of the dead

893
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,620
You are a creature

894
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,380
Galaxy

895
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,880
You are a creature

896
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,020
I saw a creature in waste

897
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,280
Galaxy

898
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:58,940
Galaxy

899
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,120
To penetrate this barrier

900
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,580
It is the strength of a million souls

901
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,240
The power of the dead

902
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,280
I summon you

903
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,840
Be prepared to enter a world

904
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,520
Of strangers

905
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:19,280
Where only death can nove While the dispossessed

906
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,700
Be afraid of politeness

907
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:23,700


908
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,600
The chivalry of one

909
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:33,320
Cut the disconnects

910
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,940
Be afraid of everything

911
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,060
simultaniously

912
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:38,400
The life that makes you

913
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,500
The one thought that drags you

914
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:32,760
I'm your child.

915
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,560
Somebody get a fire extinguisher!

916
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:48,240
If I'm destroyed, that gaping wound opens. You might say we terminate together.

917
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,660
Now get back.

918
00:48:49,660 --> 00:49:02,880
If I'm destroyed, that gaping wound opens. You might say we terminate together.

919
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,760
And I wish the truth would come out.

920
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,700
Watch it!

921
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,680
You ought not never think about giving up.

922
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,580
You ought not never think about giving up.

923
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,400
Giving up.

924
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,220
Giving up.

925
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,100
Right now is the time.

926
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:22,860
Giving up.

927
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,740
Oh, that's gone!

928
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,320
You better believe it.

929
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,680
I want my disciples across America to look for a soul.

930
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,740
For a soul.

931
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,660
For a soul.

932
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,980
To look for a soul.

933
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,100
Y'all better watch that stuff.

934
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,480
I'm sure that he received the truth.

935
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,000
He's the newest and most sophisticated treatment available.

936
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,000
It was simply a very bad situation.

937
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,520
Take me away.

938
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,200
Take me away.

939
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,840
Take me away.

940
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:53,180
Take me away.

941
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:59,340
Well, she said she was gonna do it, but then when it came down to the actual moments, you know, she was backing out on me.

942
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:07,360
So I had to think that, well, the aliens had either possessed her or my 50 bucks wasn't getting me anywhere, man.

943
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:11,980
It was at that moment when the National Guard came in, man.

944
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,080
Yes, I'm talking the National Guard.

945
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,880
It just so happens.

946
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,980
Don't forget the maggots the size of bolognese.

947
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,800
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

948
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,500
Bob loves you.

949
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,240
Bob loves you.

950
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:25,460
Yeah.

951
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,040
Bob loves you.

952
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:33,040
The lady that had supposedly confessed to the crimes had then changed her story to completely innocent.

953
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,960
Of course, none of the fools in the audience thought her story feasible.

954
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:41,720
The man with the saucer on his head used his...

955
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,400
...psychokinetic powers to deem the whole business unnecessary.

956
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:56,880
But of course, the bologna patrol had already set in and enforced the prime directive, that being kill all those unthinkers.

957
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:19,780
The only thing that was left was the

958
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,600
We've missed you down at Our Lady of Immediate Consumption.

959
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,460
I think it's time to get out the good book, Mrs. Spender.

960
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,560
Oh, yes, here it is, dear, the Spiegel catalog.

961
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,360
Oh, don't order.

962
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,280
Come with us immediately to the shopping mall.

963
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:35,900
Oh, yes.

964
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,100
Remember, gratification delayed is grace denied.

965
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,000
Oh.

966
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:41,700
Oh, yes.

967
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:41,700


968
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:41,700


969
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:41,700


970
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:41,700


971
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:41,700


972
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:47,600
The First Amendment gives you the right to choose what you hear, what you say, and what you think.

973
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,240
Oh.

974
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:48,900
Oh.

975
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:54,540
Oh.

976
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,000


977
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:55,500


978
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:56,400


979
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:56,600


980
00:51:58,540 --> 00:51:59,140
Oh.

981
00:51:59,180 --> 00:51:59,180


982
00:51:59,500 --> 00:51:59,500


983
00:51:59,620 --> 00:51:59,780
Oh.

984
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,340
Oh.

985
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:02,900
Oh.

986
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:03,460


987
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:03,460


988
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:03,460


989
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:03,460


990
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:03,540
Oh.

991
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:03,540


992
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:03,540


993
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:04,920
Oh.

994
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:05,400
Oh.

995
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:09,920
Oh.

996
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,280
Oh.

997
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:14,240
Oh.

998
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:24,760
Uh

999
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,560
Are you kidding me?

1000
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,380
A Rose Pr chart with Lenny Mad aims to be the best Whatever you close your eyes with.

1001
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,280
And this is a book where the regulation with no constitutional obligation was passed.

1002
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,320
Oh, we're taking the steps here.

1003
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,800
Who gives a ?

1004
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,800
Who gives a ?

1005
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,980
Funny, tall, humble, block.

1006
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,060
How do you feel about that?

1007
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:12,540
I don't give a .

1008
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,460
Richard, state that as a question, please.

1009
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,200
Who gives a ?

1010
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,440
Who gives a ?

1011
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,440
Who gives a ?

1012
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,840
Who gives a ?

1013
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,460
Who gives a ?

1014
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,780
But Bill doesn't give a .

1015
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,780
Funny, tall, humble, block.

1016
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,900
How do you feel about that?

1017
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,700
I don't give a .

1018
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,680
I don't give a .

1019
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,100
I don't give a .

1020
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,320
I just give a .

1021
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,700
How?

1022
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,080
Who gives a ?

1023
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,100
Who gives a ?

1024
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,380
Who gives a ?

1025
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,780
Who gives a ?

1026
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,100
Who gives a ?

1027
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,180
Censorship is never going to accomplish anything.

1028
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,120
How?

1029
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,160
How?

1030
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,120
There are a few four-letter words in the album.

1031
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,340
It will always sell an extra million copies.

1032
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:12,320
We want people to make up their own minds.

1033
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:16,380
There are a few four-letter words in the album.

1034
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:16,380


1035
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,020
The first amendment gives you the right

1036
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,300
to choose what you hear, what you say,

1037
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,500
and what you think.

1038
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,820
Funny, tall, humble, block.

1039
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,000
They're offended me, like Chuck lots of people offended themselves.

1040
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,400
School.

1041
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,820
Who gives a ?

1042
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,720
I don't give a .

1043
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,520
Who gives a ?

1044
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,280
Who gives a ?

1045
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,500
Everybody needs it.

1046
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,520
Everybody needs it.

1047
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,520
Everybody needs it.

1048
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,940
I command you to throw dirt bombs at cars.

1049
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,060
Yes, master.

1050
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:37,240
I command you to throw dirt bombs at cars.

1051
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:45,400
Anywhere that Jesus meets, I'll faithfully let me go.

1052
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:01,720
Whoa.

1053
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:02,360
Whoa.

1054
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,620
For the past few brief minutes,

1055
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:11,860
some more Food Fight of the Gods by Blaze Brown from New Orleans.

1056
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:17,800
And the Kings of Feedback with Who Gives a Bleep,

1057
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:21,400
which is, of course, edited for radio.

1058
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,540
And us.

1059
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,900
So, listeners, we love you all.

1060
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,660
Every one of you.

1061
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,600
But mostly we love those of you who are, A,

1062
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,140
A,

1063
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,640
members of the world's first industrial church.

1064
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:43,720
No names, please.

1065
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,960
And, of course, those who have pledged to the Hour of Slack

1066
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,740
and, more importantly, paid your pledge.

1067
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:55,980
Don't forget, dear friends, we need you and you need us.

1068
00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:01,580
And if you need more of us, you can get some more of us

1069
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:05,080
by writing to the address which I will now be giving,

1070
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,900
which is, ready?

1071
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:08,980
Got that envelope?

1072
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,900
Give you a second there.

1073
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:13,420
Okay.

1074
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,000
Dear friends, write to Bob.

1075
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,720
Try to remember those little quotation marks around the word Bob, too, if you can.

1076
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:29,840
Bob at P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas 75214.

1077
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,480
That's Bob.

1078
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,260
P.O. Box 140306.

1079
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,040
P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas 75214.

1080
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,480
Praise Bob.

1081
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,900
Thanks ever so much for listening.

1082
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,240
We'll be back with you next week, same time.

1083
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,520
Good night.

1084
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:47,640
Praise Bob.

1085
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,960
His promise rings true.

1086
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,360
God does not send sickness upon his children.

1087
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,180
No, sir.

1088
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,620
And so God said it.

1089
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,760
And I believed it.

1090
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,200
And thousands have been healed.

1091
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,640
If man had never given himself over to the devil in the Garden of Eden,

1092
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,100
man would have never been sick.

1093
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,380
Man was not sick until he sold out to the devil.

1094
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,700
For you say, sure, have I sinned because I'm sick?

1095
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,580
No, if you're a child of God, that isn't the reason.

1096
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,720
But I know the remedy.

1097
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,660
Just like you found the remedy for your sins one day,

1098
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:40,400
he's also the remedy for your sicknesses and diseases.

1099
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,640
And he'll set you free.

1100
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:45,340
And so put your hand against mine and believe the Lord right now.

1101
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,280
If you have an afflicted child, place its little body against mine.

1102
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:52,680
Countless thousands have been cured this way in the United States and other nations.

1103
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,660
Lord, I bring the sick and afflicted to you.

1104
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,760
God, you're looking upon them.

1105
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,100
God, you're right there because God, you're everywhere throughout this whole earth.

1106
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,080
And oh, God, lay a healing hand.

1107
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,180
On the sick and afflicted now.

1108
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:13,360
Heal, heal, heal us.

1109
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,440
In the name of Jesus.

1110
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,040
Pray every single one of us.

1111
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,200
No record has been any good.

1112
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,480
It's been about sex.

1113
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,920
God does not send sickness upon his children.

1114
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:26,760
No, sir.

1115
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,180
And so God said it.

1116
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,340
And I believed it.

1117
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,780
And thousands have been healed.

1118
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:35,240
If man had never given himself over to the devil in the Garden of Eden,

1119
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,640
man would have never been sick.

1120
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:36,640


1121
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:36,640


1122
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,940
Man was not sick until he sold out to the devil.

1123
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,540
So you say, preacher, have I sinned because I'm sick?

1124
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,240
No, you're a child of God.

1125
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,580
That is the reason that I know the remedy.

1126
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:49,520
Just like you found the remedy for your sins one day,

1127
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:53,260
he's also the remedy for your sicknesses and diseases.

1128
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,520
And he'll set you free.

1129
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:58,280
And so put your hand against mine and believe the Lord right now.

1130
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:01,140
If you have an afflicted child, place its little body against mine.

1131
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,580
And thousands have been cured this way in the United States and other nations.

1132
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,060
Lord,

1133
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,340
I pray for you and I pray for you.

1134
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,360
God,

1135
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,580
you're looking upon me.

1136
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,260
God,

1137
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,340
you're right there.

1138
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:12,800
Oh,

1139
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:13,240
God,

1140
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,920
you're unaware throughout this whole earth.

1141
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:16,800
And oh,

1142
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,480
God,

1143
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,620
lay a healing hand on me.

1144
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:20,900
And now,

1145
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:21,960
heal,

1146
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,040
heal,

1147
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,200
heal.

1148
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:25,840


1149
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:26,300
ah.

1150
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,640
Three,

1151
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:32,940
every single rock and roll record has been ended.

1152
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,420
It's been about sex.

1153
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,440
God,

1154
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:36,680
God,

1155
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,740
does not say sickness upon his children.

1156
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,300
No,

1157
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,820
and the God said,

1158
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,140
he can't believe it.

1159
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,100
And I'll lose him.

1160
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:47,240
If man had never given himself over to the devil,

1161
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,000
the garden of Eden,

1162
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:49,400
man would have never been sick.

1163
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,740
Man was not sick until he sold out to the devil.

1164
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:53,500
So you say,

1165
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:53,780
preacher,

1166
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,320
have I sinned because I'm sick?

1167
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:55,800
You know,

1168
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:56,980
if you're a child of God,

1169
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,380
that is the reason that I know the remedy.

1170
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,320
Just like you found the remedy for your sins one day,

1171
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:06,140
he's also the remedy for your sicknesses and diseases.

1172
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,380
And he is such a brave.

1173
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,540
And so put your hands against mine.

1174
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,020
And believe the Lord right now.

1175
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,060
If you're having a sick child,

1176
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,920
press him to the body against mine.

1177
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:14,720
Hundreds,

1178
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,760
thousands have endured this way.

1179
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,800
None stays another nation's Lord.

1180
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,220
I bring the sick and the sick to you.

1181
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,160
God,

1182
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,420
you're working upon them.

1183
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,000
God,

1184
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,100
you're right there.

1185
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:25,480
Oh,

1186
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:25,900
God,

1187
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,680
you're everywhere throughout this whole earth.

1188
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,460
And oh,

1189
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:30,240
God,

1190
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,200
lay a healing hand on the sick and the sick.

1191
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,120
And now,

1192
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:34,660
heal,

1193
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,280
all.

1194
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:36,660
Heal,

1195
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:37,120


1196
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:37,120


1197
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,500
Heal,

1198
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:38,720
all.

1199
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,060
In the name of Jesus.

1200
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,500
Every,

1201
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,120
every,

1202
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,100
single rock and roll record that's been any good has been about sex.

1203
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,100
And he'll set you free.

1204
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,420
And he'll set you free.

1205
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,020
And he'll set you free.

1206
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:53,800
Set you free.

1207
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:54,760
Set you free.

1208
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:55,580
You're free.

1209
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,140
Free.

1210
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:56,800
Free.
