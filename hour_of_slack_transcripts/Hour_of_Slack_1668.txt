week's show. Let's put last week's show away and create a whole new show just for you.
I think we should put this guy over here on the turntable where he belongs.
Oh, he didn't want to do that. Okay, there he is, break dancing.
Well, by the time you get this communicated, it'll be too late. The pigs are outside the
door. What I want to know is who speaks for Earth. Hey, here's a, here's a, here's a,
a lonesome cowboy, Dave. Michelle, down in the other studio on that box there. I'm sitting
here with a keyboard. And Dave's got his guitar. And Lisa, Lisa is over there. And the Reverend
Ivan Stang standing right behind me. And that's a dangerous proposition, boys and girls.
Praise God.
Praise God.
Praise you, God.
Princess Lisa.
The KY Jelly is ready to go.
And everyone is standing around and alive.
Look, they fell for it again. They're back again. Told you they'd do it. And they always fall for it
every time. Always will again and again. Thought you could get away, did you? Look at it. He
doesn't even remember, does he? No, no, no. Just let him guess. We'll just let him drift in and
out of reality.
When the only one who can promise anything is his auch.
Okay.
You have lavished yourself for one of these блок grating days.
We have to listen.
And I'm not части to simply do a simulation cookie.

I'm looking forward to universo 5.
He said, you know, I realized you say the same thing?

Won't I be the native your-

exist. This show will be a personal experience between you and the man with
the pipe. You are about to rip open a yawning chasm in what you thought was
your personality. You will stand on the brink of a hole deep within yourself. A pit, a pit, a stinky pit.
And in the very deepest, blackest part of the pit that is your mind, you will discover Bob.
But first, let's step back out into the real world. The real world. The real world.
Now that you have achieved trance state, come with us. Come and travel in the astral planes as we seek that which is
dark. But first you must pull loose from your own body. Yes, it's easy. Just a little tug. Close your eyes, float upward and give your
soul a little tug.
You see, you're free. You're free. You never thought your soul a little tug. You never thought it would be so easy, did you?
Then let's go upwards. Upwards. To get perspective. Upwards. Higher. Towards heaven. But we'll stop here in face, in space, first.
Just past the earth's end.
You see, we can go anywhere instantly this way. And it was all so easy, right within humanity's grasp all along.
And you know the secret. Really, you can go anywhere. Let's try something new.
Oh, it's beautiful down here. We could just float along and watch the fish. Or...
Roll on up on the pricey stuff. Come on in for the best in town. Take your pick at the finest wine.
Hey, I'll dance on the side of the mountain.
Or...
I can plunge you into this trench in the middle of this blistering hell planet and send you to sitting chained in this ditch forever.
Just waiting, waiting until the ticks come again. Yes, just waiting. The giant ticks. Will they come again?
Press the shooting.
Yants.
Don't look.
Click.
Click.
Click.
Click.
Click.
Oh.
Keep shooting. You could shoot another one in another hour and you'll never kill them all. Keep shooting. Keep shooting. Just keep shooting or they'll get you!
See, just like your job back at home, ain't it, boy?
Yep.
You just can't get away. You can't get away from them... them ticks, my friends.
So join them.
The fathers never answered one of my prayers.
I made O'Basin
Well you paid O'Basin today
But did you pay money?
Actual cash, green and gravel
Think about it boys
Don't wait till everyone in your neighborhood's got the bomb
Nuke them
Now at Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse
Hi friends, I'm Hiroshima Schwartz
Of Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse
Home of the Mini-Mag, the Pocket Thunder
The Baby Neutrino that leaves their apartments intact
And many other fine, low-range, low-rad nukes
These teeny tiny warheads actually fit in your wallet, purse or pocketbook
And what's on special this week at Hiroshima Schwartz?
It's the giant X-Day Drill Sale
Now until the wee-wee hours of July 6, 1996
We are literally giving away tons and tons of useless
And useless stuff

And useful weapons
It's the Werner Von Braumeister Party Special
That blows away 50 party pinks at a time
Leaving the party intact
Disguised as a four-gallon keg
That first draft really packs a wallop
But for paid subgenius
It's the Smart Prairie Squid Face Seeking Special
I'm sorry, I always get that wrong
It reads your mind
And literally knows where to send the warby
Finally now till X-Day
Bloodier than any golf pro
It's the exploding head of J.R. Bob Dobbs
When the pipe lights, it's armed
When launched, it zaps
Up to 100, that's 100
Useless bobbies at a time
Friends, don't wait till it's too late
Everyone will soon have the bomb
Nuke them now
From now till X-Day and beyond
We are literally
Blowing up the competition
Hiroshima Schwartz's X-Day End of the World Sale
Till a mob sent you and received 23% off
Batteries not included
Some assembly required
You know, I've been eating alien shmigma pie for almost 50 years
Since those first shoster crashes near Roswell
My sons grew up on it, his sons too
Here in Wilberville, it's as natural as pie
But many folks don't know about alien shmigma pie
Things kind of changed since we landed on the moon
Some things we didn't even know
Some folks believe in things called grey
And some folks believe in things called grey

Gramps, did you eat your pie today?
It's my daughter, always worrying
Hey Gramps, when are we going to go to the new dancer's
And worry in a massage parlor?
And that grandson of mine always keeps me running
Then forget our little appointment
Oh, nice and tidy
I've been staying in a sack with Grandma for a long time
Thanks to alien shmigma pie
All I know is alien shmigma pie
Is made of a cheesy wax from alien genitalia
It's made me sexually active again
And it tastes great
That's all I know
Building a new race in this life is hard
And nothing gets it as hard
As alien shmigma pie
Alien shmigma pie
The taste that's out of this world
Alien shmigma pie
Bob loves me
And I love Bob
I hate you
He hates you
I love Bob
And Bob loves me
No, he hates you, Dave
He hates you
Bob hates you
J.R. Bob Dobbs has answered all of my prayers
He even told me go and fling myself down the stairs
I did it on a lark
But now I'm glad
Bob loves me
And I love Bob
He hates you
You may love Bob
But I'm glad you love me
But Bob hates you, Dave
He makes you fling yourself down the stairs for fun
Oh, I love Bob
And Bob loves me
We're sweet and slimy
Just like little grapes on a tree
And Jake told me on Valentine's Day
And I've sent flowers and chocolate
And he loves me anyway
I said it
Bob loves me
And I love Bob
He hates you, Dave
What could be more pure?
It's the purest form of love













I'm a love anyone could imagine
He answers all my letters
He calls me up and leaves messages on my phone
He's always with me
He's always with me
The computer does all of that, Dave
And I love Bob
Don't be a sucker
J.R. Bob Dobbs
I love Bob
Bob loves everyone except you, Dave
I love you
Because you were so stupid as to believe him when he said he loved you

That first time
He tells that to all the boys, believe him
Bob loves me
It's not a torture kind of thing
It's pure
It's beautiful
It's just like
Oh, please
Stop
Don't
Stop telling me
You don't love me
This is what Bob meant when he said, pull the wool over your own eyes
I can't see anything
Oh, I'm going blind
I'm going blind
But you can still see Bob in your mind's eye
Can't you?
Can't you, Dave?
My mind
You never stop seeing Bob in your mind's eye
I can't stop
Such as it is
My mind?
What there is of it
What?
My
Your mind
Your mind is no longer your friend
I'm a physical person
I'm in love
I'm in lust
I'm in love with Bob
And I don't care what you say
I love Bob
And Bob loves me
Bob does love a fool
That's true
Bob loves the fools of this world
And Bob loves me






Truly the king of fools is lonesome cowboy Dave
Now performing the greatest guitar solo in the universe
Rock out, baby
Play it, Dave
I don't hear the music, but don't make me go
What do you mean, which one?
I thought there was only strings
And you see, friends
You see how the love of Bob has freed me from the bond of the soul




Dave from the ponderous
real life around him.
He pays no attention to
what other people might think
of him. Sure, they think he's a
fool, an idiot, a bad
person.
A half-janger.
But
he's happy.
You can hear the simple happiness
in his voice.
He's a former big star.
I can't express how happy
I was when I think about it.
Oh, don't think about it.
You won't be so happy if you stop
and think about it. Now, will you, Dave?
Why are my pants all wet and what's wrong
with me? And how come I
can't close my mouth or open
my eyes? And why doesn't
Barbara call a writer
and answer my letters or
leave anything on my message machine?
You're not losing
your faith now, are you, Dave?
That would be a great sin, a grievous
sin indeed.
To lose one's feet.
To lose one's faith. To lose one's faith in Bob.
I have no faith in Bob.
Bob has no faith.
He has no faith, meaning
he only has a head. He cannot
have a faith in a head.
God, John has had two faces on his
head. Neither one of them were looking
at the same thing at the same time.
And Bob can see you out of
each one of those dots on his
face, like multifaceted eyes
of the mighty insect.
The mightiest
insect.
Boing, boing, boing.
The mightiest insect
is the Dobson fly.
Little tiny pea-like
into a
magnificent, magnificent
brain. Yes.
The sucking bugs
of the
amazing northern Ohio area
include
among the order Hemptera.
I said the order
Hemptera.
The sucking bugs. The bugs who suck
things through pipes.
Such as the water scorpion
and the rantrofusia.
And the giant
water bug. Did you ever see that movie?
The giant water bug?
That was great. The giant water boatman
was the sequel.
These are lovely and interesting
insects of the northern Ohio
swamp areas.
But, aside from
the pleasant, happy-go-lucky
order Hemptera,
one also finds
the order Neuroptera.
Which includes
in the sinister
family Corridale
Day. Do you hear the
significance of that? Corridale
Day?
Salvador Dali Day?
We find a creature, yes, a living
actual bug of
the northern Ohio swamp area. It's called
the Dobson fly.
The Dobson fly?
Which is, you can go,
you can see a stuffed mounted
example of this hideous, vicious
beast in the Cleveland Natural History
Museum. The Dobson fly,
while surrounded
by lovely butterflies
and not too alien looking dragonflies,
you'll notice that the
Dobson fly has the head
of a vicious red ant.
With hideous
clicking mandibles and
the body, a body
that resembles the tail of a rattlesnake.
Then, the Dobson fly, which is a very rare species, is a very rare species.
Horrible flapping
leathery wings.
Yes, the Dobson fly.
This is not some biological freak that we're making up.
I'm afraid there are thousands of Dobson fly larvae.
Now, they are in their season,
their 50 year season.
As evolution lied,
it's evolution and life.
It was in the 40s.
In the 1940s was the last time the Dobson fly cycle reached its peak.
And thousands died as the Dobson fly


started to grow.
Dobson flies
attacked the suburbs
of Cleveland.
Oh, the days of Velikovsky,
I thought it was Wassily Kambuski.
And every time you
swatted a Dobson fly,
a million eggs would squirt out
of its ruptured abdomen
each egg
hatching into another million
Dobson flies.
And each time you tried to squash one of those,
it would hatch
a million.
Evolution has no plan.
You see, friends, man likes to
think himself the grandest thing
in all of God's great creation.
But indeed, no,
it is the great order of the
insectoride.
The great brain of all
collective insect hives and tribes
is a billion times
smarter than any single
ego-centered human brain.
Certainly,
one Dobson fly
or one tick
may possess a rudimentary
brain, but they can communicate
by radio with each other.
And the millions of each species
each forms a great brain
of that species. And those
brains get together to form brains.
And let's face it, you're outsmarted,
Mr. Earth Boy, Mr. Human,
Mr. Two-Legged, Mr.
Tool-Using Primate,
Mr. Thinksy-So-Big-Time-Smarty-Pants.
But you know,
if you took that human back into
the early Devonian
period, even here in the
lovely Northern Ohio
area, you would find that
there was no Devo.
No Devo?
No Devo, there was, but
because there was a slimy ocean
covering the Northern Ohio
plains. A filthy,
sewer-like, shallow,
but murky, muddy,
disgusting, smelly
ocean.
And in the depths
of these foul,
murky puddles, there grew
such creatures
as the Dunkelosteus.
Yes, the Dunkelosteus.
And friends, I hate to tell you this, but there is
a, it's true that there was a
ancient plant
discovered, fossil, of
this plant, and they named it, yes,
the Clevelandodendron
Ohioensis.
441108.
No, seriously,
the Clevelandendor,
Clevelandendodron
Ohioensis.
That was merely, however,
just a tube-like plant
with teeth and thousands of eyes.
From Club Moss.
Einstein's secret...
I mean, Club Moss was a great place back then.
I saw Devo at Club Moss.
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
ESO Radio, boys and girls.
Ivan Stang
in the house.
Now, as usual,
speaking of the
all themes of the insect kingdom,
we notice that through these
over-exaggerated sense of
smell, that they also keep
in a form of ESP,
extrasensory contact with each and every
other member of their community.
And as we notice here,
if I expose one of these insects
to this molasses, all of the rest
of the insects will begin to
come within the air, even if they have been
exposed, or have been
held in this container,
and are incapable of actually smelling
the molasses. All, as soon as they're
released, they all begin exploding,
because some of them have distillate charges
in the back of the vacuum.
Some of them have even approached
300 feet in length,
and some of them are well,
well over 2,000 pounds.
And I see them in my dreams.
I keep on thinking that one of them
was with Harry
that night when they went over the edge.

Watch it. Watch it. Watch it.
And confess to me.
And confess to me.

the head of JR Bob Dobbs did emerge into the lustrous as a numinous being?
I don't know but you can find out by coming to the X Day Drill,
on July 5th through 7th this year
and every year from now till X-Day.
That's right, Ivan.
That's right.
Remember to call for free information
about the amazing X-Day drill.
Yes, it's like the legendary Doc Stock Gathering.
That's right, Ivan.
That's right, Ivan.
You'll see the most hated preachers
of the subgenius church.
You'll camp out on a lovely,
fully developed campground
surrounded by geeks
you'd rather not ever spend much time with.
But by God, you'll know more
about the church of the subgenius
because, friends, you will have practiced
for that fatal day,
that glorious day, X-Day.
Yes, only two years from now, in 1998,
the sex goddesses from Planet X
shall come against the best wrestles
and rupture up the news
paying fully Dobs-approved subgenius ministers.
That's right, Ivan.
All 4,000 of us.
And...
And destroy the rest of the planet.
That's right, Ivan.
Well, not destroy it,
but turn it back into the stinking swamp
that it was before the filthy humans came along
and muddied everything up.
But, friends, you can come along
and muddy everything up.
You can wallow in the filth.
You can dance all night.
Oh, whoa, dude.
You can pull your clothes off
and county law doesn't care
because we are having the first X-Day drill
this July 5th through 7th.
Sunday, Sunday.
Sunday!
You'll see the pill.
You'll see the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.
It lives.
It bleeds for you
if you don't vomit your money back.
Friends, you will see things you wouldn't dare believe,
things you never wanted to believe
and things you'll wish you never saw.
That's right, Ivan.
Yetis will be copulating in the bushes.
Oh, dude.
The Loch Ness Monster will rise up from the little pond.
The crazed pagan drummers
will drum all night long
and keep you from sleeping.
Mosquitoes the size of dobson flies
will devour you,
but you won't care.
You won't care
because you spent your money
and came to the X-Day drill
July 5th through 7th.
And, friends, you can call for information
216-
6-
0-
3-
3-
8-
I'll give that number again.
Write that number down.
It's the free information
to Bible Hotline
at the Church of the Subgenius.
Here in Cleveland.
That's 12-6-0-3-3-8.
That's 12-6-0-3-3-8.
What do those numbers add up to?
Aha!
Now you know the secret.
Now you know what we're really trying to tell you about.
The froth.
Yes, the froth.
There's no excuse.
That's right, Ivan.
Buckets of froth.
Backtops full of froth.
Three months tired.
That's right, Ivan.
A froth.
A different ancient
Tehranian ocean full of froth.
Oh, dude.
Ancient Tibetan herbs
scrolling right up under your feet.
You won't be able to sleep.
There'll be so much froth growing
at high speed
underneath your sleeping bag
tossing you around.
It's like a giant funhouse.
Yes, it's insane.
It's crazy.
But ain't it always been
the crazy people
that were able to party
like they do now?
Yes, sir.
E-bomb.
Yes, sir.
Ma'am.
Sir.
Lady.
You will finally learn
what it's like
to be a subgenius.
That's right.
Ivan Stang
of the Church of the Subgenius
and
the
Oh, did I say that?
Well, then
pick up on it, man.
It says at the end of the world
there's coming a great flash.
I sure hope so.
Some people might go
and the other ones might last.
Will you
be the one who goes?
Where will you be
on next day, brother?
Where is your
Where will you be
on next day, brother?
Will you be
Will you be
on next day, brother?
Will you be
in the sausage
with
There's still lots of room.
Oh, will you be down
in the room?
You can have anything you want.
Will you be burning?
Will you be burning?
Will you be burning?
Will it be
perfect pleasure
for us to watch
and learn?
Perfect pain.
Which will it be?
It's up to you to choose.
Bob gives you free will.
But you can't feel anything
until you sign on the dotted line
and the next day is coming
so you better move fast
because
where will you be on next day?
I've got plenty of time
to spend my $30
on that Bob ministership.
I've got plenty of time.
It's two more years
for next day.
Why am I in any kind of hurry?
There couldn't possibly have been
some kind of a problem.
I'm a misprint
in the book of the subgenius.
I mean, just because
that first edition
from McGraw-Hill
actually did say
that next day was
on July 5th, 1996.
Well, they changed it after that.
I'm sure that, I mean,
it looked like a mistake.
I probably was a mistake.
I don't think I really have to spend
that $30 quite yet
because that probably was just,
it's probably not that the world's
going to end this year, 1996.
Probably.
Probably not.
I could probably afford
to take that risk.
I mean, I've got that $30.
That's not a problem,
but there's this
Hootie and the Blowfish CD
I wanted to get.
And, well, you know,
I wanted to go to this movie
about water spouts.
And, well, I just, I just, you know,
I mean, Bob will wait on me.
I mean, Bob's a patient man.
He ain't a wrathful God.
Now, you see,
I heard Bob would love
to, uh, they're subgeniuses
even if they never spend any money.
A patient man?
A patient man?
Man, he ain't no patient.
Bob is the doctor.
He ain't no patient man.
Bob is the surgeon
who will excise
the filthy, rotting tumor
that is America,
that is modern America today.
Yes, my fellow rebellious citizens
and untaxed players
and militia members,
all the citizens of courts,
we must come together.
We must come together.
Quick, they're coming.
They're trying to stop me from speaking.
All of us religious nuts,
we, and crazy, bright-winged maniacs,
we must band together against the man
because, oh, wait, they're coming.
I've got to get my message out.
The last, true hope is
5560338.
Call 55603.
Here they come.
No, come on!
I am God.
I am God.
I am God.
Please, I am God.
I am God.


Why not tell you what it's gonna be?
No, no, no, no, no.
I won't give you a long to live.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You're going to live more than one day.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm gonna tell you nothing.
Got a cobra snake for a necktie
Got me a church by the roadside
Made out of rattlesnake hide
Bob is gonna ask you
Who do you love?
Bob is gonna ask you
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Bob is gonna ask you
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Watch my little little
little drop dead body
Your lover man
got a man around
Hey
Bow bow
Bow bow

Lead the road
Yeah, that's how I feel
Huh
Huh
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
I love you, I fade away
I love you, I fade away
I love you, I fade away
I love you, I fade away
I love you, I fade away
Bob's love fades like one glistening dewdrop, it's gone, man.
He hates you, he hates you, man, give it up, give it up.
He don't love you, man, Bob never loved you in your whole life, man.
And he don't care one thing about you, dude.
You got to get it right, brother.
Your head's screwed on the wrong man.
Bob don't love you, he hates you, man.
You understand the meaning of the word?
Hate.
Ask yourself, are you worthy?
Are you really even worthy of his hate?
To me?
Am I worthy of Bob's hate?
Of course I'm worthy of Bob's hate.
Everybody hates me.
I'm one of the most hated men ever to walk the earth.
There's no reason why there are Bob Dobbs.
The old hate monster.
He wouldn't want to give me a few stabs with the old pole and eyeball.
I'm afraid you flatter yourself, Dave.
Oh, man, it's a form of love, Dave.
You know, like, he beats you up because he loves you.
You know, it's like a heavy thing, you know.
It's like a tough love, you know what I mean?
Watch your pulse with that.
But you know, Dobbs did love Dave.
And there have always been days.
Yes, for thousands, even millions and millions of years, there have been days.
Lonesome.
Cowboy.
Boy.
Days.
Generally ignored by science for obvious reasons.
But this month only in Cleveland Natural History Museum, there is in fact a display.
A rather large exhibit called Cleveland Before Bob.
In which one may actually see fossils of the ancient peoples.
The precursors to the modern day.
The day that we unfortunately know as the New Year's Eve.
Now.
There have been, for instance, there's quite a wonderful set of artifacts that were raised
up from the P-Dog site.
There.
That prove that even the early Dave-onians were tool using.
Not quite at the level of primates.
We can get my finger all the way up here.
They had an unusual, there were an unusually large number of stone pot shards.
As well as, oddly enough, many pot shards.
Found at this dig.
Um.
Oddly enough.
Pot shards were used, overused, probably.
Abused.
The abused, yes.
The abused pots.
They were broken all over the place.
Old clothes.
However.
We do know that the ancient Dave's had a sex life.
But sometimes.
As we can see.
As seen in this fairly well honed, um, uh, fluted point.
Carved.









Carved from stone.
And notice here.
The wooden.
The wooden foreshaft.
Of the ancient Dave piece.
Contained quite a wide groove.
So you can take that wooden foreshaft.
The ancient Dave, them old Dave men.
The old Dave men could take.
Had a wooden foreshaft with such a wide groove.
And the fluted point of it.
See now nowadays.
In modern Dave.
It's not even made of wood.
It's just limp.
Like a wooden fore.













an old Dosh rag, wash rag,
it's still got the fluted coin,
but, you know, it ain't nearly as sharp
as they used to be,
because the ancient, strangely enough,
the Neanderthals actually had
a larger cranial capacity
than the modern homo-davian.
You see here, slide three,
an ugly creature,
but yet, strangely enough,
still our ancestor.
Well, yours, maybe.
Friends, we poised on Edge of Evolution
as we stand together here today
on this historic moment
with brain much bigger than that to follow.
Must rewind now those who follow.
But even with its larger brain,
the ancient Dave men
were able to build nothing but crude pipes.
There are thousands of varieties of pipes,
shattered pipes,
found in the ancient settlement
in which they smoked
what, as far as...
We can tell, wild plant materials,
including dogwood,
the bark of the dogwood,
which was quite strong,
quite a bit stronger than the bite of the dogwood,
although it did have a good bite, too.
If he made you a dog stick,
dogwood stick,
rolled you up,
run up some dogwood,
that does have a bite to it.
It has a hell of a bite to it.
Man, brain too big today.
Come on, dogwood.
However, the ancient Dave men
had a natural,
a natural enemy,
the mammothous primigenius.
Oh my God, here they come.
The, or primigenius,
or, which is Greek for primitive subgenius.
Ironically far more intelligent
than the modern subgenius.
I wanna play all the old records.
As proved by the fact that you're listening
to this show at all right now.
I'm gonna smoke all the props.
Ah, here they come.
Unfortunately, the largest display in the museum,
showing the Dave men,
is the items of unknown value,
unknown function.
Carefully carved and intricately decorated,
bone and ivory fragments,
which, the uses of which have yet to be discovered.
They seem to be senseless, randomly created.
Perhaps some scientists suspect
they may have been used to dislodge unwanted objects
from obscure body parts.
And orifices.
The early Dave men possessed more orifices
than the modern Dave,
and made copious use of them.
And also thyroid wax collector.
And also underpinion nostril.
And also beneath both follicles of the ear.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, oh, oh.
In these ancient holographic films,
you can see the olden time Dave,
the primitive Daves,
chanting in their silly rituals.
Yes, even then, man had religion.
The Daves buried their dead.
Infant Daves,
fetus skeletons have been found,
which show signs of having been
ritually slaughtered by their parents.
For the delicacy,
the one item of diet that we know
that the ancient Dave men enjoyed
was fetus nads.
Don't quite know how to put that,
but certainly a serious delicacy.
Those things would go for
$14.95 an ounce at least nowadays,
you know, down at the...
I want you to know you're using...
Down at the Piggly Wiggly,
you can't hardly get fetus nads.
But the ancient Dave men
were able to harvest these from their...
Time, time now.
Time to go out and harvest.
And harvest.
What was it we were harvesting?
This was during the dawn of agriculture.
And these ancient Dave men
were in fact what we call skull farmers.
Ah, there they are.
300 of them.
Just waiting to be locked.
The women stay in the campground,
mating with the men from rival tribes
as the Daves were out in the fields
harvesting the skulls and the heads.
They tried to grow heads,
but generally they were so...
Such badly skilled farmers
that they were able to harvest them.
They would only grow skulls
or else they'd forget to pluck their heads
until they had become skulls.
Ah, this white, it is gleaming.
It is ready to lop.
Now what do we do afterwards?
We drink, we drink.
We carve out the skull and we drink.
And boy, these are big skulls
because we have such big brains.
But hard to drink, eh?
In a vain attempt to gain the intelligence
of the mighty mammoth,
the Dave would drink the brains of the mammoth.
To gain the courage of the mighty mammoth,
the mighty, uh, uh, cow.
And its craftiness and speed.
The ancient Dave men would drink the brains of the cows,
or rather suck them up through crude stone pipes.
Now remember, son, when you drink cow,
you imbue it with all power of cow.
Strength, beauty, sleep, fast,
quick, small, tiny, little, eh, shut up.
This is what is known as sympathetic manhood.
Sympathetic magic.
Obviously, today in today's modern world,
we know better than to fall for simple superstitions.
I drank that genius's urine just for a taste of brilliance.
That's true.
There is the one exception.
Sympathetic magic does still work
in the Church of the Subgenius.
If you will but drink of the fluids of Bob,
you will gain the wisdom of Bob,
his, his great intellect.
Intellectual acuity will be yours.
And you all know how smart Bob is.
He's from the Church of the Subgum Guys at Subgenius.
They're like all geniuses or something, right?
Isn't that what they're trying to say or something?
And, and Bob's a smart guy.
And so if you kill Bob and drink of him,
his, his, and eat of his body,
then you'll be as smart.
Nay! Nay, it's a lie, friends.
You and Bob, Bob is not smart nor,
nor intelligent, but only lucky.
So you don't drink of his brain,
you drink of his other fluids
until you have gained some of his luck.
Drink his spinal fluids for good luck.
Wear it on your head for good luck.
His armpits sweat.
If you can stand his brother Bob when he sneezes,
you will be able to gain the viruses of Bob's.
He knew this is most precious.
Oh, yes, it's milk and fluids.
If you clean up Bob's bathroom
after he has finished in there,
and I think you know what I mean.
Hey, I just came to clean up.
No, no, I wouldn't want to do anything like that.
Just trying to fix the plumbing.
You will gain his sales acumen.
I will own the plumbing business
around the rest of the world.
I will control the plumbing enterprise of the planet.
It's true, folks.
You too could be just like the modern lonesome cowboy Dave.
This paragon of manhood and manly beauty.
This confident and stalwart stud and cool guy.
All you have to do is to know Dave is to know Bob.
And to know Bob, you merely must call the secret number.
Yes, this is a secret.
Don't tell anybody.
Turn your radio down.
Get your pencil out.
Call this number.
60338.
Go ahead, kids.
Give it a try.
What have you got to lose?
A little time, maybe?
You did sign the application.
Kids, don't forget to get your special Bob Dom's decoder ring
that explodes in your face for only $49.95.
Call now.
It works.
Security is about
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I haven't thought I'd be my angel
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Little darling, tell me why
I get so cold looking in your eyes
Is it you?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, is it you?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, Earthboy, dream of angel
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Little baby, leather in place
Take a minute to wonder
Space is in its place
Yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, is it you?
That boy dreamer angel
guitar solo
Ah, little darling, show me now
Somewhere, somewhere, somehow, is it you?
Oh, baby, is it you?

Yeah, yeah, yeah
That boy dreamer angel
that boy dreamer angel
that boy dreamer angel
Who speaks for Earth?
Earth.
Who smells for Earth?
Who flies in the face of authority for Earth?
Why is none of it in the webinar?
Who's paying the rent on Earth?
That's the question.
Who's going to take care of this bill?
Who's paying to pass by the pretty piggy?
Well, who will stand for Earth?
I don't know.
Maybe me.
Maybe you.
Maybe nobody.
Is that your dog?
It's really the same song.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
No, really, down at the Cleveland Natural History Museum.
Have you been down there lately, Dave?
I had a dream I went there.
No, no, I mean, did you know that they actually had the jawbone of a Yeti?
Who had the jawbone of a Yeti?
You're proud city!
That's worth quite a lot of money.
Oh, the jawbone of a Yeti!
A gigant- They call it Gigantopithecus.
Which is, of course, scientifically inactive.
accurate name it should be referred to as Gigantanthropus. Gigantanthropus?
It's more a primitive man than just merely some animal. Gigantopithecus.
He's a misanthropus. An animal, an animalistic thing. But this is, yes indeed, the jawbone of an ancient yeti.
And how could you know such a thing? Well it says so right there on the display.
It's the jawbone of an ancient giant yeti? Yes. It is about a foot and a half long.
Looks like it weighs about seven or eight pounds at least. You lie like dirt.
It's, no I don't. It's, it is, there's a skeleton of a gorilla not far away.
It's conceivable a skeleton of a gorilla. Even with its massive lower mandible.
It is merely but less than half the size of the Gigantanthropus. The prehistoric yeti.
I had a dream about it. We call it prehistoric. Of course the yetis were keeping records long,
80 million years before humans knew how to pick their prey.
And they were keeping their noses. Well I had a dream of a yeti.
And it was a Gigantopithecus. It broke his, misanthropicus erectus.
And she was cute too. Yeah. She was awful hairy.
She was the hairiest woman I ever saw. But she was big, wasn't she?
Yes. And there was something so fragrant about her feet. Muskie.
Oh, muskie. That's too old. Get a whiff of that yeti's.
Muskie, muskie, muskie. Oh yes, muskie's a natural.
I don't know what I'm just thinking about.
Man, feel manly. Let it go yeti girls. Yes sir.
Okay, keep off her leg.
Are you man enough for the she yeti?
Are you man enough for one of her legs?
Are you? You could ride on that leg, boy. You could grab you a tight hold on that mane she's got growing down that leg and ride.
I've tried to ride her in my dreams. I've tried to ride her off into the sunset singing my Yahoo! Final Darn Year song.
But it seems to me every time I begin to mouth the love of young, whatever,
you might need to play.
I shouldn't do this.
I asked her her name and in a back-room voice she said,
Wanda.
Wanda.
Wanda the she yeti.
Oh my god.
Wanda of the jungle.
Wanda of the Himalayas.
I took a walk around in the park. She held my hand. She crushed my wrist. I ran off running. She caught me just like Batman.
It ain't no fun when a woman can outrun you and tackle you at the same time.
I never was laying on the ground in Central Park and birds twittering around and screaming in pain.
And this huge, huge female yeti, is she trying to have her way with me?
Wanda does Dallas.
Deep Wanda.
Wanda does Zane.
Behind the grill.
Wanda.
Behind Wanda's green behind.
Wanda likes schoolgirl uniforms.
Yeah, man. If you got... Did you see the latest issue of Yeti?
Big Yeti.
I think it was Big Yeti September...
B-Y, yeah, I said it.
And, man, there was some spread you there, I couldn't believe.
In fact, it was one of the largest magazines I ever bought.
We had to get a guy who had, well, he had a Volvo wagon, and we loaded up three or four of them.
It took half an hour just to get them in the back.
Oh, yeah, the fold out in the middle is like 30 yards long.
Yeah, we was gonna wallpaper that mansion over on the top of the hill there where, oh, Mr. Hippocasian had lives.
Oh, those human stroke books, Mike Shepard.

And we had to throw some pink.
Oh, those.
But you won't be seeing no pink in Big Yeti magazine.
No, no.
It is kind of expensive. They're like $8.95. It's specialty material.
And if you've seen the Yeti binaries on the news, on the internet, you can get you some...
Boy, there's some pictures out there. It takes about 30 days to download.
I downloaded them all.
They're so big.
In my dreams.
In my dreams.
Big Yeti.
Big Yeti.
Big old Harry.
Because the true women of the Yeti race, the big old Harry, were powerful.
And they could pick us men up by our parts and swing us around their heads.
And we loved it.
Oh, it hurt.
Yes, it hurt, but we loved it because they were disciplining us, you see.
We had discipline in those days.
The big women.
The bigger and hairy women.
The women taught us discipline.
And we thanked them for it.
Yes, we got down on our knees and we worshipped them.
We were polite to a woman in those days.
And I languished in my Disney's wedding.
When we exploited a woman with respect for the woman.
There was no one to blame.
When we, when we disrespected a race of gigantic yetis, we did it out of respect and discipline.
We did it on time.
Not like these slackers of today.
Yes, in the old days, the very Yeti women.
On time, always on time.
Their blood runs thin.
They have fluorine in their blood.
They're not like the Yeti of yesteryear, the yester-Yeti.
But boy, they can make a pickle when they put it under their armpit.
No, I'm sorry.
I remember that sometimes, when the Yeti women, you could take a whole cucumber and slather it.
And put it under their armpit.
And make a pickle in five seconds.
And you too can get a whiff of one of them pickles if you come to the X-Day Drill, July 5th through 7th in Brushwood, New York.
At Sherman, New York.
At Sherman.
That's right.
You'll find out all about that when you call that phone number.
Call that important phone number.
Who Speaks for Earth?
You can find out at 216-
216-0338.
Praise Jesus.
And there ain't no Chinese fire drill, is there, wherever you do stay?
Oh, hey, did you know that Jesus is now working for the Church of the Sub-Genius?
I had heard that he was not only on the payroll, but that also that he was having eye surgery from some crooked Medicare program he was running.
Uh, well, that just goes along with the job.
We like to look after our employees.
But it's true.
The Lord Jesus Christ, who is now about 26 years old in this incarnation.
26 to 52, somewhere in the middle.
Formerly the owner of the flying, now defunct, flying lemur bookstore.
Jesus is now, has moved to Dallas.
Jesus just left Chicago and has moved to Dallas.
And he's, uh, filling the, he's taking over the mail order of the Church of the Sub-Genius, friends.
He's the promotion, he who was foretold by Bob.
They said he would come wearing one sandal.
And he would buy a cherry.
And he would carry it from the Eritreans.
And they would cheat him.
And he would be screwed.
And yet, and yes, it is as the prophecy said, friends.
Praise Bob!
We were saved!
The smart money guy finally showed up.
And this time, he's got connections.
You know what I mean?
He's got family, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, the Church of the Sub-Genius has got some new friends.
What kind of friends?
It's got some new friends.
He's got some muscle.
You know, the kind of friends that if you cross Bob the wrong way,
he may just wake up with cement overshoes at the bottom of the Cuyahoga.
I thought Jesus made down missions to him.
Jesus was a Capricorn.
And is just all right with me.
But, uh, except that, uh, notice that he sheds.
Jesus does.
Now, he lives at my, at my,
especially at the Sub-Genius offices.
He works so hard.
And he's a really, really, such a martyr.
He sleeps on the couch.
But he sheds.
Now that it's summertime in Texas, Jesus is shedding all over the Church.
I can't believe Jesus deflated all over the Church of the Sub-Genius.
You mean all of these bodily hairs are laying around your area there?
Yeah, they, yes, they are.
All of the above was from ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland from the old days.
The show of the late, incredibly famous, and most famous,











really great Chaz Smith, who also played half the instruments.
Praise Chaz.
Okay, friends on the internet, where I can flog our swag legally, if you want to help
yourself and the Church of the Sub-Genius and get a pretty cool package with like 25
different nifty things in it, like pins and bumper stickers and a real preacher card,
you need to go to subgenius.com and click to become a minister.
You'll see photos and a list of all the stuff you need.


And you really do get to go to the Scrub Genius Forum, which is members only, and we talk
in ways that people don't talk on Facebook.
Much, much smarter ways, ironically enough.
Isn't that funny?
We also have things like T-shirts and damn near everything you can think of with Bob's
face on it.
That and a huge selection of other subgenius graphics on coffee mugs and so forth.
And we sell several very weird DVDs and CDs of the Bob's.

And we also have a lot of old MP3 stashes of this show.
And best of all, from our main online store, you can buy the book of the subgenius, which
is by far the greatest thing we have ever done.
It's an actual Simon & Schuster book, 22 bucks, in print for over 30 years.
And every copy that we send out is signed by yours truly.
For that matter, your address on the puffy envelope is handwritten by me also.
So, uh, yeah.
Keeps my fingers nimble.
That's subgenius.com.
And remember, it's only money.
