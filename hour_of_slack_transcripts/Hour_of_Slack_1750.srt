1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,960
And a feet core of impudent snobs.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,560
I don't know if they even listen to the show anymore.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,020
The subgenius Harry Ossoff.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,540
How surprised that never came up before.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,640
Dr. Howell, Dr. Drummond, Dr. Stang.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,860
We didn't come to borrow any money.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,800
We didn't come to borrow any dough.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,780
We didn't come to borrow any trouble.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,460
We just dropped in to say hello.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,680
Hello.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:32,880
Hello.

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,000
So we've got the music of CyberChump in the background as a rug.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,300
Yes.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,460
As we call it in the radio business.

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,700
A rug?

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,260
And Tarzan's radio station.

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,760
A platform high in Tarzan's swaying...

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:57,760


19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,340
In a tree house.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,200
In this case, a rug.

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,660
Well, people ask me, why is it called Tarzan's?

22
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,260
You can tell by looking at it.

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,940
It's made out of vines and half coconuts.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,300
And bamboo here.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,020
Shreds of wire and little rock crystals.

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,820
The jungle lord collected them on his travels.

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,400
Jungle lord.

28
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,380
From the lost city of Opar.

29
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,680
He raids periodically when he needs gold and things.

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,600
And since we can't afford digital recorders,

31
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:44,180
autistic subgenius bobbies are carving the audio signal onto rocks at a really fast pace.

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,280
They're highly trained native craftspersons.

33
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,560
And they do it entirely out of loyalty and love

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,260
and receive no wage from the subgenius corporation LLC.

35
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,080
The tricky part is converting those chip, those little ones and zeros cut into the rock

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,560
into a computer file that sounds like what you're hearing now.

37
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,720
It just means every rock has to be scanned.

38
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,000
Which is time consuming, but the biggest problem is it scratches the scanner surface.

39
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,880
You have to replace the glass every three rocks.

40
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,080
So it'll be months before you actually hear this.

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,220
And you do get perfect registration, though.

42
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,020
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,760
No frame rate.

44
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,080
No jiggle.

45
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,080
No hairs in the gate.

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,800
It's pure.

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,680
As long as those bobbies are chipping away accurately enough.

48
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,400
Don't let that one have that prop stick.

49
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,880
Don't let him get all wool gathering and looking off into space,

50
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,040
staring, not concentrating on the job at hand.

51
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,820
But yes, instead of being at one of those posh studios that we're used to,

52
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,580
we're in a tree house.

53
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,400
We're in the open air here.

54
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,080
Burning stuff.

55
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,260
Yeah.

56
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,620
Burning stuff.

57
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,260
Well, that's not for months.

58
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,220
But the tree's on fire.

59
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,720
The natives have set fire to the trunk again.

60
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,100
Quick, unzip, man.

61
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,380
A trunk call.

62
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,260
Here, take this beer.

63
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,260
Put that fire out.

64
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,600
What time does the nap period start?

65
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,520
As soon as the hour of slack recorder turns on.

66
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,580
That's when nap period starts.

67
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,400
On Napster.

68
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,720
Well, I think we're being kind of premature to look forward to that.

69
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,060
Right after that period.

70
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,860
Now, yesterday when I got tired of this,

71
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,480
I just called up the nearest audience member who I've never seen before in my life.

72
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,220
Right, right.

73
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,080
He was here and he gave some, he added to it.

74
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,900
The second Reverend X.

75
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,400
Next time I'm going to hit up Fight Seat Taj.

76
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,000
He's had more experience with this.

77
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,900
When I get tired, I'm going to call you, sir.

78
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,700
And I'll be there.

79
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:03,380
I'll go sit there and wait for somebody to finally spend a penny on a five cent button.

80
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:11,720
Well, you mean that vast panoply, that array of subgenius swag that is there on the swag table.

81
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,340
Yeah, and did you notice, Hal, that it's now a Stang Ranch Fossil Museum?

82
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,580
Yes.

83
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,840
We had rocks holding down all the many free flyers that no one ever tags.

84
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,500
Rocks holding down.

85
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,240
Rocks holding down docks.

86
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,580
Yeah, and I replaced them with treasured, more accurate free flyers.

87
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:42,300
These are fossiliferous remnants of early marine creatures from the great interior seaway.

88
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,660
People don't want that fake news no more.

89
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,680
What was that, Doctor?

90
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,160
You know, that mic still sounds really strange.

91
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,220
My mic sounds stranger to you?

92
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,280
No, no, yes.

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,740
What about now?

94
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,380
What about now?

95
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:53,880
What about now?

96
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,040
When you put your face at a reasonable distance from it, it seems to work fine.

97
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,560
Although it is louder.

98
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,900
It's still louder than me.

99
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,140
Do you want me to try a different mic?

100
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,200
I have two or three or four or five more over here.

101
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,580
Yeah, Mike, it's just fine, man.

102
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,760
What you need to try is holding your face.

103
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,140
The problem is your face.

104
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,000
Put your lip right there.

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,460
How about there?

106
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:15,980
Is that better?

107
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,880
That's excellent.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,040
No, that doesn't make sense.

109
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,440
You're right where you're just at a normal.

110
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,840
Somebody just shoot him and put him out of his misery.

111
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,220
He's just being contrary.

112
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,300
Well, it's easy for him to hear.

113
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,060
I do have more microphones.

114
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,140
No, that's fine as long as you lean into it like that.

115
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,460
But you don't have to suck it.

116
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,060
My headphones went out.

117
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,160
No, no, no.

118
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,520
Say that again with your face near the microphone.

119
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,280
I've got this one.

120
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,800
I'm having some difficulty here.

121
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,300
I can't hear a thing.

122
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,060
It's an electric voice.

123
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,660
No, let's just.

124
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,520
What's the trouble with this thing?

125
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,340
Every time we try.

126
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,720
To fix something that makes it a thousand times worse.

127
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,260
Fearing feedback.

128
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,160
Listen to that.

129
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,820
What do you think you're doing?

130
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,880
I'm getting feedback.

131
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,220
Me?

132
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
I'm just trying to reattach my severed headphone jack.

133
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,600
Or Doug, I mean.

134
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,480
I mean, Ivan.

135
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,540
Hold on.

136
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,360
Just a momentito.

137
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,340
This is simple.

138
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,640
It's just a moment, people.

139
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,980
It's just this simple.

140
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,960
I've lost it.

141
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,620
I'm not getting the music.

142
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,660
I'm not getting anything.

143
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,080
Nothing comes through.

144
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,880
Except a haunting feedback.

145
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,300
Where's my guitar?

146
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,620
Now if I push it with my fingies like this, I can hear.

147
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
Now I can hear.

148
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,780
One reason you're getting the feedback is because you're leaning your face right against that microphone.

149
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,280
That hurts my ears, Dr. Hal.

150
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:38,480
Jesus.

151
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,360
What?

152
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,980
You're the one who's doing it.

153
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,500
I'm not doing nothing.

154
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,680
Well, it's emanating from somewhere.

155
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,360
But fortunately, I can now hear through my headphones.

156
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:50,420


157
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:50,420


158
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,100
Which was a matter of concern to me.

159
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,900
I'm gonna move away.

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,560
Okay.

161
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,680
That seems to work.

162
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,120
That's not necessary, Philo.

163
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,860
I think we're all set up now.

164
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,800
All ship-shape and squared away.

165
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,160
Ready to go.

166
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,340
Yeah.

167
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,300
Eight minutes of technical difficulty.

168
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,620
Tanned, rested, and ready.

169
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,520
Now we can charge ahead.

170
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,180
Okay.

171
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,720
Let's start all over again.

172
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,540
Ah, yes.

173
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,160
Dear friends.

174
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,420
We're back at 22X day.

175
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,400
Only three days left for the huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge,

176
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,640
huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, amazing and incredible

177
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,860
human race as it remembers itself or wants to think of itself.

178
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,940
And we'll soon be aboard the saucers.

179
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,280
Reverend Stang, your voice seems to have a lot of wow and flutter in it.

180
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,640
Do you know...

181
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:34,880
Three twin-ling days.

182
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,780
Can you hear that flutter?

183
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,620
Philo, everything sounds like it's got some wow and flutter in it.

184
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,580
And I assume that that's all your fault.

185
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,300
I remember wow and flutter.

186
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,700
Yeah, listen.

187
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,420
Yeah, the Hal sounds way...

188
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,380
They were here, X-Day 14.

189
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,800
Yeah, but what sounds you get for assuming?

190
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,240
I'm assuming...

191
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,660
You're saying I sound...

192
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,080
Yes, everything sounds...

193
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,600
Everything sounds fluttery.

194
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,500
Everything sounds a little bit hinky.

195
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,300
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

196
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,560
Yes.

197
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,960
That we're not receiving a full range of audio,

198
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,480
high-fidelity sound.

199
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,180
In fact, I can sometimes...

200
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,420
What are you doing, Farr?

201
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,580
Not hear anything.

202
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,040
It sounds like electrical pulses.

203
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,100
The beat of a hypertrophied human heart.

204
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,820
That's much better.

205
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,200
I just fixed it.

206
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,740
You fixed it?

207
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,040
Hal, do me a favor

208
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,880
and don't try to fix anything anymore.

209
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,560
Hal fucked it up.

210
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,660
Don't try to fix anything.

211
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,420
Stop trying to fix it.

212
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,500
When you fixed that, you pulled that out.

213
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,900
Well, dog my cats.

214
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,340
Man!

215
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,480
I guess I have to say

216
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,700
that was a real melon scratcher.

217
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,100
Bless my buttons.

218
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,180
I won't do it again.

219
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,040
Okay, I...

220
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,480
I smell that smell again.

221
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,080
It's like cheap perfume and frop.

222
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,800
Heavens, do I offend?

223
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,860
It's frop mixed with cheap perfume.

224
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,400
The stench of frops all around you.

225
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,620
Only one joker in L.A.

226
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,960
was sensitive enough to wear that scent.

227
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,560
Ooh, that smell.

228
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,020
That's not the smell of frappy.

229
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,980
The smell of paranoid.

230
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,940
Perfume.

231
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,640
Compiled by speed freak Hindus who never sleep.

232
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,960
Oh, oh, oh.

233
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,460
I need some of that...

234
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,540
perfume.

235
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,440
Don't they have a hot and cold running coffee bar here

236
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,560
at Caffina's Palatial Luxury Hotel?

237
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,720
I believe so.

238
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,200
We...

239
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,780
Are they serving coffee?

240
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,600
A nice, uh...

241
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,320
Yeah, I gotta...

242
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,340
I gotta cup myself, Reverend Stang.

243
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,080
A towering iced coffee.

244
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,160
Frappuccino.

245
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,260
It's really good, too.

246
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,580
Topped with a mountain of swirled cream.

247
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,680
The cherry impudently perched there.

248
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,800
Served by a beautiful server.

249
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,940
That's right.

250
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,740
And a pastry on the side.

251
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,160
For the touch of old Napoli.

252
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,880
Yes, we've got it.

253
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,000
The lap of luxury here.

254
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,820
Uh, but it is, of course, only a foretaste.

255
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,180
Only a teasing preview of the pampering we may expect to get

256
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:20,040
once aboard the spacecraft that are even now en route to make that special rendezvous.

257
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,460
I think all the talk of coffee has actually influenced Reverend Stang.

258
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,680
He's going to find it.

259
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,040
Going to search for the mythical spring of, uh, reviving caffeine.

260
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,900
Turn down your output to me.

261
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,220
Flash your LARC pack.

262
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,440
You can't turn anything to...

263
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,140
I can turn all of the things down.

264
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,820
Turn down, turn up.

265
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,640
Turn on your master output just a little bit.

266
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,740
There is no master output.

267
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,380
Oh.

268
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,260
No master output.

269
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,780
How many times do I have to cite that?

270
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,420
Master output's in the cold, cold ground.

271
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,680
Besides right here.

272
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,420
All right.

273
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:57,900
All right.

274
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,700
Now, now just calm this down.

275
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,040
The osculus infundum.

276
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,440
Once on a night as black as pitch.

277
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,160
What about this headphone jack?

278
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,100
Isabel met...

279
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,460
What about this headphone jack?

280
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,060
...a horrible witch.

281
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,100
The witch's face was cross and wrinkled.

282
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,680
Hey, Reverend Stang, how about the...

283
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,000
What if we used this headphone jack as a line out?

284
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,220
The witch's gums with teeth were sprinkled.

285
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,460
It does have a modulator volume control on it.

286
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,420
Oh, ho.

287
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,680
Oh, Isabel, the old witch crowed.

288
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,580
I'll turn you into an ugly toad.

289
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:49,840
Isabel...

290
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,480
Isabel didn't worry.

291
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,560
Isabel didn't scream or scurry.

292
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,580
Yes, thank you.

293
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,800
She...

294
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,140
Now, what did she do?

295
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,400
Now that threw me off.

296
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,640
See?

297
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,400
I remember what Isabel did at this important juncture.

298
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,280
All right, I got somebody.

299
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,160
Matt Woyke.

300
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,020
Matt Woyke!

301
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,620
Yes, well, to continue to a different episode,

302
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,660
Isabel met a troublesome giant.

303
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,040
And Isabel continued,

304
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,600
self-reliant.

305
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,460
The giant was hairy.

306
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,020
The giant was horrid.

307
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,560
It had one eye in the center of its forehead.

308
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,120
Ho, ho, Isabel.

309
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,920
Glad to meet you.

310
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,320
Now, little Isabel, I will eat you.

311
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,900
Isabel...

312
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,860
Isabel didn't worry.

313
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,860
Isabel didn't scream or scurry.

314
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,420
She nibbled on some zwieback that she always fed off.

315
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,940
And when she was done, she chopped the giant's head off.

316
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,260
All right.

317
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,540
I'm gonna try something.

318
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,700
All right, now, make sure you...

319
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,620
I'm not gonna try.

320
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,540
You're gonna change.

321
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,580
Change the wiring.

322
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,780
Do just what Reverend Stang said not to do.

323
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,960
Never touch the red lead wire.

324
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,500
You pulled it right out of the board there.

325
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,460
Nothing good can come of this.

326
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,860
Now he's replugging it.

327
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,500
It's just like the switchboard.

328
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,120
Hello, Central.

329
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,160
Oh.

330
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,200
Simple thing would be to go from this plug to there.

331
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,060
Simple pleasures are worth dying for.

332
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,460
That's what Mrs. Smith's pies are all about.

333
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
I'll have a switchboard.

334
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:04,480


335
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,260
I'll have a splitter for that.

336
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,480
We're still setting up here, folks.

337
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,860
So never mind a little bit of technological double talk.

338
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,520
You're biologi...

339
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,460
You're biologi...

340
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:19,440
We don't want to bore you with a whole lot of technical specifications.

341
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,520
Okay.

342
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,460
That's that.

343
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,600
In just a moment, we'll be running like a...

344
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:25,680
Check, check.

345
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,080
Swiss watch.

346
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,580
Rolling downhill in a thunderstorm.

347
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,400
Test, test.

348
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,440
Okay, I can still hear everything in my system.

349
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,600
Test the blood of Dracula.

350
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,920
Test the blood of Dracula.

351
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,900
Now, let me see here.

352
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,000
Then there was Dracula AD 1972.

353
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,460
I don't know if you ever saw that one.

354
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,260
Then there was Frankenstein 1970.

355
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,100
That was one of my favorites.

356
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,660
Yes, which was actually made in 1960.

357
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,680
Yeah.

358
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,400


359
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,000
Frankenstein 1970.

360
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,140
Now, it's not working.

361
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,840
Frankenstein 1970.

362
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:08,760
Yeah, it's not working.

363
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,900
Actually, what do you mean?

364
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,740
I can hear you talking out of that.

365
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,720
I don't hear me talking out of it.

366
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,560
You have your mic running through some...

367
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,340
You've got your mic running through something, except it sounds real tinny, right?

368
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,940
You've got your mic running through a different system, don't you?

369
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,100
Little tiny Timmy's Tinny.

370
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,300
It's going into yours first and then mine, isn't it?

371
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,000
No, it isn't.

372
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,480
Oh, it's not?

373
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:28,900
Okay.

374
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,360
All right.

375
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,360
I don't trust any of you guys.

376
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:33,900
I don't think it sounds like it.

377
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,380
That's right.

378
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:34,380


379
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:34,380


380
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:34,380


381
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:34,860
It's all right.

382
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,280
Test, test.

383
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,140
I can't hear myself on it at all.

384
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,080
I can attest that I hear you.

385
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,780
Well, you're using headphones.

386
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,620
We're talking about the speakers.

387
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,120
Why don't you...

388
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,300
You put on headphones, you can be like me.

389
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,060
I got them.

390
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,420
Friends.

391
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:48,860
Get them too.

392
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,680
Do you see what I have to deal with?

393
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,600
Working with subgeniuses.

394
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,960
It's a nightmare.

395
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,420
Just slap on a couple of cans, Stang.

396
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,000
It's a madhouse.

397
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,320
It's a madhouse.

398
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,700
You'll hear just fine.

399
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,020
But, Philo, what have you done?

400
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,780
You've overwhelmed the system.

401
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,360
I'm sorry.

402
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


403
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


404
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


405
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


406
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


407
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


408
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,360
Philo fixed it, see?

409
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,560
Well, dog my cat.

410
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,060
He sure knew his onions.

411
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,620
I can't tell because I didn't have them.

412
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,020
That's because you had your headphones on.

413
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,320
Yeah.

414
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,380
So, also in the new...

415
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:25,320
This will sound really good on the radio because I control what goes on the radio.

416
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:33,360
I can't control Philo or what you hear, but I can control the official recording, see?

417
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,360
That's the important thing.

418
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:34,420
That's the important thing.

419
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:34,420


420
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:34,420


421
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:34,420


422
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:34,420


423
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:34,420


424
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:34,420


425
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:34,420


426
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,620
I'm going to do the same job as the sacred scribe to remove all the stupid parts.

427
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,260
So, we've started this show how many times?

428
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,720
Three times now?

429
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,680
Well, it's like starting the backyard lawnmower.

430
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,340
It starts as a new day.

431
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,080
It takes a number of firsts to get it roaring and slicing.

432
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,260
Can you all hear any of this okay?

433
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Oh, that's the kind of feedback we like.

434
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,060
Okay.

435
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,860
See, they can hear every stutter and malapropism.

436
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,380
Okay.

437
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,540
Now that Tarzan has been rebooted over and over for 20 minutes.

438
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,360
Okay.

439
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:13,840
Well, welcome to the Hour of Slut number 1730 and recorded live at 22X Day.

440
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,460
Alive, alive, oh.

441
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,320
This is not a drill.

442
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,100
This is a Phillips screwdriver.

443
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,340
I keep seeing that T-shirt with a picture of a drill and it says, this is not a drill.

444
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:26,960
Right, yeah.

445
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,140
But it is a drill.

446
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,040
Sure.

447
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,000
On the T-shirt.

448
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,200
Yeah, it's the whole thing.

449
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,280
Well, the T-shirt is a pattern.

450
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,520
Oh, okay.

451
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,360
Angry, angry.

452
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,360


453
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,360


454
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,360


455
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,360


456
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,360


457
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,360


458
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,360


459
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,360


460
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,420
I'm going to go back to the other room.

461
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,960
Philo, do you have anything against headphones?

462
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,360
I was just curious.

463
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,140
Yeah, sir.

464
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,060
Pop them on.

465
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,140
I find them very confining.

466
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,260
Uh-huh.

467
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,580
You see, now you can hear.

468
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,660
Could you put your pants back on too, Philo?

469
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,900
Yes, no one wants to see that.

470
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,300
Or they're way too confining.

471
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,880
You can hear the background track, right?

472
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,120
It's so loud.

473
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,020
You hear the background music playing euphoniously.

474
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,680
So, see, we're on the same page.

475
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,720
Yeah, I can hear that.

476
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,340
Can you turn it off?

477
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,340


478
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,340


479
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,340


480
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,340


481
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:04,340


482
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,640
Can you turn on hot in my headphones slightly?

483
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,140
Why, if I had only not been instructed not to touch this nasty wiring.

484
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,140
Don't you, either of you guys touch any of that stuff.

485
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,060
I'll kill you.

486
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,880
I'll cut your hands off.

487
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,580
I could move it so loud.

488
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,460
Slightly your way.

489
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:17,780
It's so loud.

490
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,620
And ease the painful constriction you must be feeling.

491
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,520
You knuckleheads.

492
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,660
Here, just back the headphones off a little bit, Philo.

493
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,500
I can't turn it down because then I won't be able to hear anything.

494
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,340
Or you can lean your dome forward and put your headphones.

495
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,400
This is what happens when the DJ is deaf.

496
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,120
Yes, that is.

497
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,880
It is indeed.

498
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,760
It's a shame.

499
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,080
Who can reach the deaf?

500
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,660
What are you going to do?

501
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,000
Make fun of my handicap now?

502
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,540
No, I won't make fun of your handicap.

503
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,040
I'm sad that you have a handicap.

504
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,480
I'm not making fun of it.

505
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,820
I don't think there's anything light about your handicap.

506
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,660
I think it's a bummer to be handicapped like you are.

507
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,760
I'm a victim.

508
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,600
Yeah, it's my...

509
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,640
I'd be bummed out if I had such a handicap myself.

510
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,360
Yeah, I...

511
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,380
You have one of those special parkings.

512
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,380


513
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,660
I think I've seen some of them.

514
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:03,660


515
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,980
You know, you have a parking placards that allow you to park in a special space.

516
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,760
I'd probably cry.

517
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,240
I'd probably go home and cry like a little bitty baby.

518
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,680
I self-identify as a victim.

519
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,680
Like a little baby girl.

520
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,220
That's me.

521
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,500
I'd cry like a little girl, little baby girl.

522
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,080
Well, we're all...

523
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,280
There you go.

524
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:19,840
Sorry.

525
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,160
Bob.

526
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
That sounds pretty good.

527
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,060
We have sympathy.

528
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,560
Why didn't you do that to me, Bob?

529
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,060
Yeah, why didn't you do that, Bob?

530
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,380
Why didn't you make me different?

531
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,380


532
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,380


533
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,380


534
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,380


535
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,380


536
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,380


537
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,380


538
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:33,380


539
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,060
Why didn't you do that to myself?

540
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,020
Yeah, it's just not fair that society allowed me to do this to myself.

541
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,380
Why didn't they stop me?

542
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,240
Why didn't my friends stop me?

543
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,940
I'm a victim.

544
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,980
They should have stopped me when I started to do that stupid thing that I knew was stupid.

545
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,980
When you started...

546
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,740
And they knew it was stupid, and they told me not to.

547
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,100
But why didn't they tell me louder?

548
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,920
When you started hanging out...

549
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,540
It's just not fair.

550
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,320
...in front of a 12-foot amplifier.

551
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,000
Well, actually, yeah.

552
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,380
I think...

553
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,360
I think that was part of it.

554
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,120
Filming the amino acids while standing next to the speaker.

555
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,100
It did in my right ear.

556
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,700
It always stood next to that amplifier, pointing this way.

557
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,480
My right ear, right against the amp.

558
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,500
And, uh, yeah.

559
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,840
I'm deaf too, Bob.

560
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,020
I'm deaf too, Bob.

561
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,700
Deaf to Bob.

562
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,200
But perhaps not to his message.

563
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,000
Deaf to Bob.

564
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,000
Deaf to Bob.

565
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,760
Remember...

566
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,840
Remember, uh, you...

567
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,440
I know you're chugging the nexus of, uh...

568
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,040
I can't hear you.

569
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,040


570
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,040


571
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,300
Deaf to Bob.

572
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,500
I can't hear me either.

573
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,360
Yeah, none of us can hear anything.

574
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,280
It's just a campground full of deaf old farts.

575
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,140
Hobbling around, shuffling...

576
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,280
Well, that's why they smell, so deaf people can enjoy them too.

577
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:57,720
My Android hearing aid program can hear more than any of you in its little finger from

578
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,360
here to here.

579
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,840
You're talking into the air, Mr.

580
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,340
He's talking into the...

581
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,960
He has a little finger, you say?

582
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,120
...ambient microphone.

583
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,380
Oh, yeah.

584
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,600
I'm the one that's out there.

585
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,380
Yeah, we...

586
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,880
Well...

587
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,840
Tarzan's, uh...

588
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,980
You got your ALC on.

589
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,660
We should put a mic, like an audience mic, like Joe Pine had, you know?

590
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,760
Have a mic out there that he can grill the...

591
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,400
Yeah, you can be Oprah and go running out into the audience with the mic.

592
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,620
Why didn't we do that?

593
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,460
Well, you just suck the shut-me-up.

594
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,740
Here's a likely subgenius here.

595
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,660
Well, how's your ex day, mister?

596
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,420
Say that's quite a haircut you have.

597
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:27,820
Shut up!

598
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:27,960
Shut up!

599
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,360
I have an answer for all those things, but of course I've given up on everything.

600
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,360


601
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,360


602
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,360


603
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,360


604
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,360


605
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,680
I'm never gonna...

606
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,760
What about you, little girl?

607
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,360
Did Mommy fix your hair?

608
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,420
Yeah, I have an answer, too.

609
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,840
Nobody really wants to hear what I have to say.

610
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,180
I do.

611
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,100
I wanna hear you.

612
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,420
I have an answer to your answer.

613
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,380
What's this defeatism about how nobody wants to hear you?

614
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,980
Try it out, first of all.

615
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,600
Shut up!

616
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,160
Philo, why don't you put all your mics out there in the audience and then find something

617
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,000
to connect them to here at Tarzan's Three Mic Radio Show?

618
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,180
That's the problem.

619
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes.

620
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,560
That is the problem.

621
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,420
Actually, I could connect them, but then it would cause me...

622
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,680
They would be louder than me, and that wouldn't work.

623
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,620
Well, you need wireless mics to go on out there.

624
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,880
I normally don't miss...

625
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,420
Can you imagine how loud that guy would be if he actually did have a microphone?

626
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,380
We could tackle the problem.

627
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:22,520
I have the problem of being the lone Spock on a spaceship full of Kirks.

628
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,580
Or actually more like Zap Brannigans.

629
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,720
I'm trapped in a world of Zap Brannigans.

630
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,660
What if you were on a spaceship full of Susan Oliver from that one?

631
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,940
One pilot episode.

632
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,000
No, let's not start into pilot episodes of old TV shows.

633
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,660
We're here to talk about how to beat the conspiracy.

634
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,040
The conspiracy outside of ourselves and the conspiracy inside of ourselves.

635
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,120
And you don't think Susan Oliver and her at that time could have been like...

636
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,920
It helps, but it's not a priority.

637
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:01,260
And Susan Oliver was one of those strange looking women that Gene Roddenberry always

638
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,140
wanted to hire.

639
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,360
I got no problem with that.

640
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,500
Oh no.

641
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,680
Wasn't she on the old Make Room for Daddy, Danny Thomas show?

642
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:10,980
Make Room for...

643
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,300
Turn that down, Philo!

644
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,160
Turn what down?

645
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,780
I've got my headphones on.

646
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,240
Turn down this exciting real estate opportunity.

647
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,180
You cannot accuse me of not monitoring myself properly.

648
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,320
Turn your phone sound effects button off.

649
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,400
We have monitored your broadcasts for centuries.

650
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,660
That's interfering with my ability to understand the pointless human speech that my ears are

651
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,440
being exposed to.

652
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,200
Is that better now?

653
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:37,920
Is that better?

654
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah, now I can hear the pointless words.

655
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,020
Okay, say the words that have no meaning.

656
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,500
I'm going to Star Trek!

657
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,060
Say it!

658
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,260
Say it!

659
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,240
Susan Oliver, Star Trek.

660
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,500
Susan Oliver in the Monitor episode.

661
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,520
God, you're...

662
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,500
You see these two Civil War ironclads...

663
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,980
We really need some young blood in this church.

664
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,860
We really do.

665
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,140
We're going to have to get all these somewhat slightly younger people up here.

666
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,260
Well, don't...

667
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,380
I don't see any more holding you back.

668
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,980
So what you're saying is we do need another microphone.

669
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,880
Stampede up to the stage.

670
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,500
No, we have plenty of microphones.

671
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,200
We need another radio station.

672
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,000
And new brains.

673
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,800
Well, you can't be satisfied with anything.

674
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Why don't you look around?

675
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,840
The birds of the air, are they content?

676
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,160
Yeah, let's put them on the air.

677
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,420
They can tweet, tweet, tweet all day.

678
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,700
I can hear Philo's little tweet, tweet, tweeting irritating machine.

679
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,660
When his baby comes down the street, yes.

680
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,560
It's hard to be a control freak in an uncontrolled, chaotic society.

681
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,680
A cat circus...

682
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,020
You're like a captain with no crew.

683
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,380
What's the guy that runs the circus?

684
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,600
The ring man.

685
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,120
A leader with no followers.

686
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,900
Yeah.

687
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,500
Isn't that horrible?

688
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:55,880
No.

689
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,840
Being a leader amongst leaders and everyone wants to go their own way.

690
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,140
Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.

691
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,660
And they're all Chief Wahoo.

692
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,480
Smart-out.

693
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,760
Well, he's the one that knows the magic of the super hammock.

694
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,360
Offensive.

695
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,820
Or Stellag 17.

696
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,660
They're all offensive cartoons of Native America.

697
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,000
Where all the prisoners were sergeants.

698
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,380
He's made the erection of a hammock into an art form.

699
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,280
All shouting at each other.

700
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,060
A whole camp full of sergeants.

701
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,020
It's a terrible mix-up.

702
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,880
A planet of Charlton Heston's.

703
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,680
Oh, yeah.

704
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,140
All yelling and screaming, angry.

705
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,500
Pouting and posing.

706
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,120
Yeah.

707
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,860
Well, he was right, though, all the way through.

708
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,900
Humans suck.

709
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,540
The apes were even more right.

710
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,460
Humans should be beasts of burden in the fields.

711
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,860
But they can't be allowed to run wild.

712
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,680
But given the time, the apes became just like humans.

713
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,900
Well, that's the irony.

714
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,620
The irony is the ironic, sad, satirical thing about it, isn't it?

715
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,180
It's so sad.

716
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,420
Every time you have a revolution and overthrow the conspiracy, why, next thing you know,

717
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,340
you're the conspiracy.

718
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,040
You're the conspiracy.

719
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,500
Yeah.

720
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,100
But, Philo, see.

721
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,460
We did it.

722
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:08,920
We did it.

723
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,080
We said it at the same time.

724
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,280
We could be like Tenacious D, two kings.

725
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,660
Oh, but wait.

726
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,780
The same thing happened to that one, too.

727
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,040
They ended up murdering, poisoning each other.

728
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,340
Right.

729
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:19,660
Right.

730
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,320
God.

731
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,060
See, the conspiracy always wins.

732
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,180
But we should just give up.

733
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,240
So, go ahead and buy everything you were thinking about buying right now.

734
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,460
The first time I gave up, everything came my way.

735
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,220
The house has all the advantages.

736
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,620
Use up your credit cards.

737
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,020
I don't know what to buy because there's no Wi-Fi here.

738
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,140
Max them out.

739
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,840
That's right.

740
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,880
How are you going to do it?

741
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,460
There is Wi-Fi, but no internet.

742
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,820
Isn't that ironic?

743
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,100
I can't buy without my Wi-Fi.

744
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,420
I don't know what I should buy.

745
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,200
Help me.

746
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,460
Please, help me.

747
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,200
You should, well, you've already bought the most important thing, which is the ministership

748
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:04,140
in the Church of the Subgenius, which means you will survive and to harass us and heckle

749
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,600
us after the world ends.

750
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,880
What about a chewy caramel center with plenty of nougat surrounded by milk chocolate?

751
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,180
Only the very few.

752
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,520
Great fun.

753
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,980
All right.

754
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:23,380
Well, the radio audience can't hear Mr. Sistar, who is channeling Dr. Dark.

755
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,100
He said that he was going to come through and give us a signal that there is indeed

756
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,360
a life after death.

757
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,380
We are waiting for that signal.

758
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,880
Well, we may have gotten it.

759
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,080
I think we're hearing it.

760
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,460
I'm listening again.

761
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:43,460
Yeah, he's channeling the late Dr. Dark, who was, let's face it, the greatest heckler

762
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,780
of subgenius church history, hands down.

763
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:55,400
And of course, as usual, unable to be heard by the radio audience.

764
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,840
Only the innocent radio host can actually hear that.

765
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,660
You can tell them.

766
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,640
You can transcribe what he says.

767
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,700
And the three other audience members.

768
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,780
This is the grandest ecstasy.

769
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,680
Wait a minute.

770
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,020
I see four audience members.

771
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,740
You've undercounted that audience by 73.2%.

772
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:16,760
I'm not sure.

773
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:16,760


774
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:16,760


775
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:16,760


776
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,100
I think there's six or seven.

777
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,280
All right.

778
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


779
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


780
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


781
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


782
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


783
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


784
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


785
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


786
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


787
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


788
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


789
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


790
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


791
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


792
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


793
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


794
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,280


795
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,880
And there's five people.

796
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,820
Five times as many people here as there were yesterday.

797
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,840
When there was one.

798
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,640
They're thronging, surging into .

799
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,780
And we ended up getting him to come up here and be on stage.

800
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,520
We had to.

801
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,120
Some of the other members broke down and had to go cry.

802
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,380
Some could not stay to fulfill their duties.

803
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,780
The ass of the spirit.

804
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,440
No matter how loud you yell, you can't be louder than Philo's noise machine.

805
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,200
To us.

806
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,680
To the people next to you, you're quite overly loud.

807
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,900
But to us, we're protected.

808
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,740
Philo is static.

809
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,040
I don't touch that thing for like ten minutes and then I touch it once and he goes haywire.

810
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,940
What are you, some kind of like control freak?

811
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,160
Demons of snarling noise.

812
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,880
Like that effect right there.

813
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,200
See, that buzzing sound effect is nothing that emanated here on Earth.

814
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,620
What's that guy yelling about out there?

815
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,000
I can't hear him. I'm in headphones.

816
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,560
He's trying to convey an important message.

817
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,320
And he won't get off his ass and stand close enough to be heard.

818
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,620
We can't understand.

819
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,080
I wouldn't get off his ass either if I was him.

820
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,700
No, I'd stay on his ass.

821
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,520
Dissatisfaction with things as they currently are.

822
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,980
We only hope to remedy those difficulties.

823
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,100
Ticks.

824
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,640
We'll get it all fixed up.

825
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,580
Ticks, did you say?

826
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,420
Oh, that's terrible.

827
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,020
Ticks, friends.

828
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,440
Ticks everywhere.

829
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,660
Watch out for them.

830
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,560
They're worse than ever.

831
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,260
Drop on you out of the trees.

832
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,700
That's how they get you.

833
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,820
They sense your heat signature passing beneath.

834
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,640
And they launch forth.

835
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,180
Their little arachnid bodies into space.

836
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,600
When they land, they clutch and grasp.

837
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,320
And then find a warm crevice in which to begin their work of aggression and vampirism.

838
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,860
Why, I'm crawling up through this bush of human pubic hair.

839
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,620
I'll crawl up this strangely short rod here.

840
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,600
Oh, there's a nice hole at the tip of this tube.

841
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,480
I'll nestle down in there and start sucking from the inside.

842
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:25,620
Oh, no.

843
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:32,800
And then if it gets inserted into another tube, I'll crawl out of this tube and suck from that tube.

844
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,960
Because I'm a tick.

845
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,900
The Tick.

846
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,820
Yeah, there hasn't been a horror movie called Ticks yet.

847
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,820
Yes, there has.

848
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,360
Oh, there has?

849
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,080
You see, in this movie, marijuana growers in the forest use too much hormone.

850
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,560
And it causes the ticks to grow large and terrorize teenagers.

851
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,960
And that's actually happened in real life.

852
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,440
Well, there's some nice stop-motion tick scenes, though.

853
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,020
For the most part, they are done by puppets, by Tom St. Armand.

854
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:13,860
But they also have to include the scene where the one black kid somehow turns into an enormous tick

855
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,940
through a painful process of stretching, splitting, expanding.

856
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,160
And this is a movie called Ticks?

857
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,260
It's called Ticks, yes.

858
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,420
Look in the international...

859
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,920
International movie database, and you can read all about it.

860
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,060
But the villains are caused by marijuana growers.

861
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,200
A big stupid one and a little small evil gay one.

862
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,540
It used to be radiation, then it was quantum, now it's marijuana.

863
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,780
Yeah, it's a bad...

864
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,860
It's an atomic guy.

865
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,120
Atomic this, atomic that.

866
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,720
They're growing marijuana in the forest.

867
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:53,020
And it has the unfortunate, exaptive side effect of creating monster ticks that move around pretty fast.

868
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,100
If only.

869
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:54,620
If only.

870
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,740
Well, they're about as big as grapefruits with legs.

871
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,220
Now, has anybody made a movie called Target Grade?

872
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,140
About a giant rampaging water bear?

873
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,700
No, but aren't they in the Ant-Man and the Wasp movie?

874
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,120
Yeah, but they're normal size.

875
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:10,920
I'd love to see that one.

876
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,360
They just look big to Ant-Man and the Wasp.

877
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,560
Well, size is relative.

878
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,540
I don't care how big anybody is.

879
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:16,760
That's what she said.

880
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,220
I just want to see an enlargement of those creatures.

881
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,500
That's what she said.

882
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,040
Time will tell.

883
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,480
How about...

884
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,100
Rotifer.

885
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,140
Those amazing Rotifers.

886
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,640
A new beginning.

887
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,880
Volvox, the motion picture.

888
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,400
Oh, God.

889
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,040
Figures.

890
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,180
Now, what was the thing in It Challenged the World?

891
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,480
That wasn't a robot.

892
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,020
That was a Venusian cucumber creature.

893
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,040
Oh, no, no.

894
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,240
It conquered the world.

895
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,360
You mean the monster that challenged the world.

896
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:50,560
It was supposed to be a mollusk, and yet it had a caterpillar-like form.

897
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,300
Right.

898
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,080
They had a shell, but the body could lunge forward.

899
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,680
It could grab you in its many arms, and then its pinchers at the top.

900
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,160
Yeah, pinchers.

901
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,160
Those pinchers would do some pinching.

902
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,920
Mollusks don't usually have pinchers.

903
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,780
No, they don't.

904
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,420
They were confused.

905
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,920
But the creature itself was confused, and it inhabited the Great Salt Lake.

906
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,140
Oh, it's Salt and Sea.

907
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:13,960
Exactly.

908
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,560
Oh, that's right.

909
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,900
That movie was one of the few movies that was filmed at the Salt and Sea while it was still...

910
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,180
It was a salty beast.

911
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,660
...somewhat livable.

912
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,140
Yes, well, only for these horrible slug monsters.

913
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,220
Val Kilmer?

914
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,600
No, it was...

915
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,000
No, no, no.

916
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,240
That was Salton.

917
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,460
That was the name of that.

918
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,920
But the guy, was it Robert Walker?

919
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,880
The hero?

920
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,700
He's in a uniform.

921
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,080
There's whatever marine service the Salt and Sea has.

922
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,900
He's out there with his boat.

923
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,240
Coast Guard, I think.

924
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,500
The Coast Guard.

925
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,300
Yeah, well, as if the Salt and Sea is on the coast.

926
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,740
It's saltwater, but it's surrounded by land.

927
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,880
But still, he's there, fresh from the...

928
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,860
Treasure of the Sierra Madre.

929
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:08,240
Friends, if you love to see life after people, dilapidated ruins, the way things will be after this Friday,

930
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:15,860
visit the Salt and Sea, which is just south of Los Angeles, right near the border with Mexico.

931
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,320
You can't sink in it.

932
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:22,020
There's so much salt, your bloated body floats on the top.

933
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,100
It's beautiful looking.

934
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,600
It smells like...

935
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,260
It smells like death, and the beach is made of bones.

936
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,500
Because nothing can live in it for long.

937
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,120
Not kidding.

938
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,000
It is literally made of fish bones and bird bones.

939
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,540
Well, in the movie, scuba divers go down on the bottom, and then these things come out and suck them into the...

940
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:52,780
The people who still live in Bombay Beach and Salton City are very, very, very weird people.

941
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,500
They're salty, as we say.

942
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,200
Yes.

943
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,680
It's 130 degrees in the summer, but it's cheap.

944
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,460
It's real cheap.

945
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,780
They thought there was going to be a beautiful, futuristic city, and they built the streets and canals,

946
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,040
which still show up on your GPS as if they were really there.

947
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:16,220
But what you're really looking at is these long stretches of empty streets,

948
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,540
filled in canals that never had the water in them,

949
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,620
and one house per street.

950
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,580
With a weird...

951
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,420
Weird, weird, weird person living in them.

952
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,640
Still paying their timeshare, Bill.

953
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:38,140
Yeah, it's the most atmospheric place, if you like, to think about the end of the world.

954
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,680
How this place paid off in another 130 years.

955
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,380
Yeah, it's got a real...

956
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,840
And they're letting it go.

957
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:50,680
They just recently decided to quit trying to save it, despite Sonny Bono's heroic efforts to save that area.

958
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,880
He tried to save the Salton Sea.

959
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,320
Yeah, there's a Sonny Bono wilderness area.

960
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,460
The most hideous-looking wilderness area you ever saw.

961
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,060
An unkempt mustache of nature.

962
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,480
Any subgenius.

963
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,500
You won't find any pinks there.

964
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:11,360
You'll just find other weirdos shooting pictures of the graffiti and skeletons.

965
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,100
And the way the ocean...

966
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,960
The Salton Sea itself looks like syrup.

967
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,360
It's beautiful looking.

968
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,700
It kind of...

969
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,700
It has movement, but it's very slow.

970
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,060
It's slowed down from...

971
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,420
Yeah, it's not the...

972
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,680
The free movement of water.

973
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,440
The turgid sluggishness of the salt.

974
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,300
Looks great at sunset.

975
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,660
I'm surprised they don't shoot more commercials there.

976
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,940
It's pretty in that horrible, horrible way.

977
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,400
It looks like somebody had a war there.

978
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,760
An atomic war.

979
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,920
Not a hydrogen bomb war, but an old...

980
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,480
Nature's Wonderland.

981
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,160
It's an atom bomb war, so there's still buildings standing, but they're ruined.

982
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,500
You can explore in there, but you'll probably get crushed and the roof falls in.

983
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,060
Or attacked by the cannibals that live in the ruins.

984
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,640
And the slugs.

985
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,960
Yeah, and the slugs.

986
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,660
Of course, the giant mollusks.

987
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,820
We saw it.

988
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,320
That's what got us on this.

989
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,020
Yeah.

990
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,580
But really, Salton Sea.

991
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,160
It's not going to be there forever.

992
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:19,720
Pretty soon they'll run everybody out because it's going to turn into a toxic dust bowl.

993
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,460
And I'm not exaggerating.

994
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,080
It's already making people very, very sick.

995
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,360
Oh, God.

996
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:25,380
It's going to turn into a toxic dust bowl.

997
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,380


998
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,380


999
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,400
It's already making people very, very sick.

1000
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,060
It's a toxic dust bowl amusement park.

1001
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,660
And fun for the whole family.

1002
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:38,360
The nearest towns with people in them are Mexicali and Caliexico.

1003
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,600
One is on the Mexican side and one is on the American side.

1004
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,600
It makes me feel hot.

1005
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,020
It doesn't matter which is which.

1006
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,040
It's blazing down there.

1007
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,800
It's roasting hot.

1008
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:55,000
You don't have to worry about armies of illegals that are bad people coming in because nobody wants to go to that area.

1009
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,260
Nobody.

1010
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,800
Nobody wants to cross that inhospitable stretch of desert.

1011
00:37:59,640 --> 00:37:59,840
No.

1012
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,160
With its red hot rocks and thorns, spikes, canyons, cholla cactus.

1013
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,080
And everyone who lives there has lung problems.

1014
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,000
Yes, from huffing the particulate matter which floats in vast, endless dust clouds.

1015
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:22,940
Well, all the fertilizer from the surrounding farms runs into the Salton Sea.

1016
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,040
Yes, it's powdered fecal.

1017
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,520
It's a very tropical matter.

1018
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,460
Yeah, it's an ocean of shit, you might say, friends.

1019
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,500
You can't miss it.

1020
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,760
Nice place to visit and raise your family.

1021
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,440
Yeah.

1022
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:39,100
A real nice place to raise your kids.

1023
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:49,280
Now, off Earth, though, there are supposed to be many paradises and places which we, the victorious subgeniuses, can visit.

1024
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,380
Oh, yeah. After X-Day, come to my escape vessel to see the Salton Sea.

1025
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,020
And the Grand Canyon.

1026
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,820
The Grand Canyon and the British Museum.

1027
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,660
Just keep them separate. Don't mix them all up.

1028
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,080
Why not? That's all fun.

1029
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,060
That's the fun of it.

1030
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,460
The British Museum of the Salton Sea.

1031
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,060
Hmm. In the Grand Canyon.

1032
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,960
In the Grand, yeah.

1033
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,180
That would kind of, uh, that would be a weird combination.

1034
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,000
Why not all three?

1035
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,180
Why not?

1036
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,520
You have room.

1037
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,880
Why not? Yeah, I'll have a whole planet.

1038
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:34,020
It would be a blank planet for the most part, because even though I'm going to rupture up half of the national parks and most of the world museums,

1039
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:40,740
before Legume gets to them, to wreck them, because he just doesn't want me to get my hands on them.

1040
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,660
He doesn't care about them.

1041
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,460
He just wants to wreck them.

1042
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:50,380
Somebody said, is there going to be a service or any memorial for Dr. Legume?

1043
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,860
It's like, what?

1044
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,940
Well, I'm sure something will erupt.

1045
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,600
Nervous in the service.

1046
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,160
Leonard the Committed has something in a brown bag, and that's the Legume Memorial.

1047
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,760
Uh, are we doing anything?

1048
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,940
He would approve, I'm sure.

1049
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,880
What about the Bulldada auction? Do we do anything for Legume there during that event?

1050
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,740
Well, we'll have to think of something.

1051
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,860
We could just call everything the Dr. Legume Memorial product.

1052
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,760
Yes, auction off these Dr. Legume dish towels that we have.

1053
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,780
That sort of thing.

1054
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,680
Okay.

1055
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,260
Well, I mean, there are a lot of people who are going, I'm glad he's dead. He was mean.

1056
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,540
Yeah, he was mean, but here's the thing, kids.

1057
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,000
He was also right.

1058
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,540
That's the horrible thing about it.

1059
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,120
Well, actually, he wasn't right all the time.

1060
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,620
Sometimes he got really goofy ideas in his head.

1061
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,500
How that can happen to a subgenius, I don't know.

1062
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,600
I don't know either.

1063
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,220
It certainly wouldn't happen to me.

1064
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,540
Goofy ideas, butt hurt.

1065
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,340
Come on.

1066
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,340
That's for lesser types.

1067
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,960
Yeah, well, that's for sensitive kids, you know.

1068
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,120
I've been through it all. I've got a tough hide.

1069
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,960
I've got a shell a mile thick.

1070
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,320
What'd you say? What'd you say about me?

1071
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,340
Just speculating aloud.

1072
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,420
I'm triggered again.

1073
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,460
Like Roy Rogers' horse.

1074
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,840
Stuffed and mounted.

1075
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,320
Yeah, my PTSD from being turned down.

1076
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,540
For dates is acting up.

1077
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,760
Has the record reached the end of the room?

1078
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,220
I have PTSD from girls not dating me.

1079
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,820
What's that shuffling sound?

1080
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,260
Philo.

1081
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,500
If there's an irritating sound, you can just assume that it's philo drumming.

1082
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,640
Look at that. He thinks it's funny.

1083
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,920
No, I don't. I think I'm taking it very seriously.

1084
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,460
He's taking umbrage.

1085
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,480
It's not too loud to me this time.

1086
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,960
It sounds like chicken scratching.

1087
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,980
Yes. Chicken scratching with its tridactyl claw in rhythmic fashion.

1088
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,860
I don't know. I take it all back.

1089
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:06,440
It's obviously some avant-garde musical presentation.

1090
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,800
Now it's too loud.

1091
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,280
What other subgenius tourist attractions are there?

1092
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,400
Nearby, there's Point Pleasant.

1093
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,340
It's West Virginia, right?

1094
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,680
Well, there's the Woodstock Mystery Hall.

1095
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,860
The Mothman Museum.

1096
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,260
Oh, yeah. That's right.

1097
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:30,500
John Peel set his mostly made-up stories about people seeing the Mothman in Point Pleasant.

1098
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,700
So it's in Athens?

1099
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,880
No, it's in West Virginia. It's real nearby, though.

1100
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,780
I've never been there, but I've seen lots of pictures.

1101
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,500
They have a statue of the Mothman right in the middle of town.

1102
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,540
And a store full of Mothman memorabilia.

1103
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,480
Wow. The Mothman souvenir shop.

1104
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,160
Wow.

1105
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,860
Did you ever get little statues of Mothman?

1106
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,980
Everybody suggests, dang, you've been to Roswell, right?

1107
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:01,780
No, I've avoided Roswell because I got sick of that alien stuff years ago.

1108
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,760
And so did all the shop owners in Roswell and outside of Roswell.

1109
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,380
They've admitted it to me.

1110
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,800
But it's a living.

1111
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,160
Where's the little Ale Inn?

1112
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,260
That's in Rachel, Nevada.

1113
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,860
Oh, yeah. That's in Rachel, Nevada.

1114
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:19,780
Okay.

1115
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,940
The roadside attraction that has a crashed flying saucer sticking out of its roof.

1116
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,980
Yeah, and they've seen plenty of UFOs in that area.

1117
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:38,920
Now, what is that place that was shaped like a giant flying saucer with stairs going up to it?

1118
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,120
And there's a tourist trap now.

1119
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,740
It was originally going to be a casino, but it was all a rip-off.

1120
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,620
They never had a permit for it.

1121
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,820
The mob built this whole thing.

1122
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,280
And then it turned into nothing.

1123
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,680
Then it was a tourist trap.

1124
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,420
I don't know.

1125
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:59,340
And he's got little crash saucers all over the place and rockets embedded in the ground.

1126
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,460
What happened to my cup?

1127
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:07,320
It's where that famous photograph is of Doug, Gary, and Paul underneath a giant pipe falling out of the sky.

1128
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,480
Oh, yeah. I remember that place.

1129
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,460
I remember the place.

1130
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,240
Yeah, I was driving through the desert one time.

1131
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:13,840
It was like, weeeee!

1132
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,520
That's that place!

1133
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,780
We have to stop here!

1134
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:17,940
We're here!

1135
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,720
Kind of like The Thing on Interstate 10.

1136
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,320
You should dare to see The Thing.

1137
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,300
When you pass all those billboards saying, do you dare to see The Thing?

1138
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,300
Is it still there?

1139
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,760
As far as I know, I can't imagine it not being.

1140
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,540
That they would remove The Thing?

1141
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,180
The Thing is, it's only a dollar, and there's thousands of things.

1142
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,500
Yeah, it's worth a dollar.

1143
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,020
It's probably worth two dollars.

1144
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,740
It's full of curios and weird, weird, weird art and Hitler's car.

1145
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:47,760
And I don't know.

1146
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:53,100
I've seen crudely carved wooden figures illustrating a medieval torture chamber.

1147
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:58,220
Hey, Reverend Stang, did you ever go in Harold Warp's Pioneer Museum in Menden, Nebraska?

1148
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,020
No.

1149
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,860
Well, you really missed it.

1150
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,120
They have covered wagons.

1151
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:08,040
By the way, if you want the cover blown of The Thing, I took pictures of it.

1152
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:08,800
I did, too.

1153
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,280
I don't think anybody here is going to go see The Thing.

1154
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,080
Why?

1155
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,660
It's worth a dollar.

1156
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,680
It's just a feeling I have.

1157
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,460
If you want to drive all the way across the country, it's worth a dollar.

1158
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,780
But doesn't everybody have to drive to California from Texas every year?

1159
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,040
Remember, they have to get value for their money by coming to Ex Day.

1160
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,300
Not anymore.

1161
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:34,780
And one thing you can do is to blow the cover of The Thing, which is part of the exclusivity of the East.

1162
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,880
But it's a mummy of an old Indian woman.

1163
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,020
These things make my ears sweaty.

1164
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,300
If it's even real.

1165
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:47,760
You see, they frown on mummies of Native Americans and where they used to have them in museums now that they're gone.

1166
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:47,760


1167
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:47,760


1168
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:47,760


1169
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:47,760


1170
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:47,760


1171
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,200
They don't.

1172
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,280
And now, sometimes they even deny that there ever was a mummy there before.

1173
00:45:54,460 --> 00:46:00,580
Yes, I've gone to museums which were once the haunt of excavated mummies.

1174
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:07,500
And when I inquire, they are very kidgy and defensive and deny that there was ever such a mummy.

1175
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,420
We never kept a...

1176
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,780
That would be a sacrilege to the...

1177
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,500
And natives.

1178
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,020
Apparently it would be.

1179
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,740
But then they come out of their office and look at me just because I asked about the damn mummy.

1180
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:17,740


1181
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:17,740


1182
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:17,740


1183
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:17,740


1184
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:17,740


1185
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:22,540
No, I'm not going to make trouble, but I'd like to know what happened to it.

1186
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,100
What happened to that mummy?

1187
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,000
It got up and walked.

1188
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,320
It got up and walked off by itself.

1189
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,620
It's going to a tea party.

1190
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,400
He went for a little walk.

1191
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,900
You should have seen his face.

1192
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:37,920
Is that what it was?

1193
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:38,580
Yes.

1194
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:43,720
My ancestor, Bramwell Fletcher, was the one who was terrified to death by the mummy.

1195
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,100
Really?

1196
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:44,540
Yes.

1197
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,600
And the first mummy?

1198
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,420
Yes, yes.

1199
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,500
He's the one who said...

1200
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,000
He went for a little walk.

1201
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,420
You should have seen his face.

1202
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,800
Wow. Can I touch you?

1203
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,360
You've got an ancestor in the mummy.

1204
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,600
Yeah, a relative.

1205
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,140
A relative.

1206
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,500
Not necessarily a direct progenitor of me, but one who is of my blood.

1207
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:14,080
Other tourist destinations for subgeniuses would be commonly used movie locations like...

1208
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,580
Old Tucson, outside Tucson, Arizona.

1209
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,600
Yeah, Alabama.

1210
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:22,440
Alabama Hills, which is not in Alabama and doesn't have anything to do with Alabama.

1211
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,360
The Vasquez Rocks outside of Los Angeles.

1212
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,740
Yeah.

1213
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,400
The Alabama Hills, it's like...

1214
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:34,340
Everywhere you look, you know you've seen an Indian jump off a rock onto a stagecoach there.

1215
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,060
Oh, there, okay, there's a picture of Mothman.

1216
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:37,820
Mothman.

1217
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,160
Brought to us. I wish we had a projector.

1218
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,600
For am I not Mothman?

1219
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,920
Gorgeous looking creature.

1220
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,000
Gigantic.

1221
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,320
Life-size.

1222
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,700
It's worth, definitely worth going through and looking at it.

1223
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,500
All based on a hoax.

1224
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,440
No bowing or cringing to this obscene idol is required.

1225
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,400
What's the, uh, the Velazquez Peaks?

1226
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,860
Velazquez, yeah, that's what it's called, Velazquez Peaks, right?

1227
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,920
You mean the Vasquez Rocks?

1228
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,960
Vasquez Rocks, yeah.

1229
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:17,720
Every movie and every Star Trek episode, every Twilight Zone has been, had the Velazquez Peaks.

1230
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,060
Planet of the Dinosaurs.

1231
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,320
Yeah, sure.

1232
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,540
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure number two.

1233
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:23,800
Oh, you name it.

1234
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,100
And what about Bronson Canyon?

1235
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:34,760
Well, and, what, giant cyclops has come stomping out of that every three motion pictures.

1236
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,940
But also, Roman has his cozy little cave down there.

1237
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,080
Oh, right, right, yeah.

1238
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,300
Well, that's right, in LA.

1239
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,720
And Eegah hung his, uh, Paleolithic hat there.

1240
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,700
Yeah, there's some of these places, when you see them, you go, oh, that's a great place.

1241
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,800
It's like I've been here.

1242
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:56,840
And, no, all of your famous bad monster movie directors have been there.

1243
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,000
And you saw what they found.

1244
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,500
It's hard to find a location that is unentailed.

1245
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:09,800
They don't like you shooting, you know, they'll report, they'll snark on you if you're trying to set up your pathetic independent cameras and things.

1246
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,760
Any of these spots, making it even harder to get those shots.

1247
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,540
I almost got busted at Vasquez Rocks.

1248
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,680
Really? They, uh,

1249
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,600
got you making a, um...

1250
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,220
No,

1251
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,360
some good citizen who

1252
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,460
we didn't suspect might be

1253
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,020
up high looking down on us

1254
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,780
probably called

1255
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,660
the park service and said

1256
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,860
there's this

1257
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,240
old man

1258
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,280
and his cute blonde daughter

1259
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,920
down there smoking a pipe.

1260
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,360
I'm sure it's driving...

1261
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,180
He's obviously a pedophile.

1262
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:43,860
He'll smoke anything in the state park.

1263
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,260
And, uh, cause when we came out,

1264
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,660
Princess Wee suddenly had her spidey sense

1265
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,680
and said, I just got a feeling we gotta get out of here.

1266
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,980
So I'm like, okay, let's go get some pictures

1267
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,620
of me in the bob mask

1268
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,320
in front of the famous rock.

1269
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,660
And when we went to

1270
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,260
the car, there were two cops,

1271
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,380
park cop and a city cop,

1272
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:04,900
watching us.

1273
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,740
And I had a bob mask on.

1274
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,580
And I stood there and waved at him

1275
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,320
and held my plastic

1276
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,400
pipe and she took

1277
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,580
pictures of me with the rock

1278
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,480
in the background and they

1279
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,880
just kept looking at us

1280
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,400
and we got in the car and headed

1281
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,500
for the exit

1282
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,360
and they kind of herded us

1283
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,680
out. They went left

1284
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,680
and we went right. I'm pretty sure

1285
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,380
what happened was

1286
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,600
they got this report and said

1287
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,560
oh boy, let's bust somebody. And they go and look

1288
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,580
and it's like, well yeah, there's a guy

1289
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,700
with a pipe, but it's a fake pipe

1290
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,320
and a stupid mask and

1291
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,060
I think this is a bug hunt.

1292
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,500
And it's lunch time and I don't want to fill out that

1293
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,560
paperwork. So Bob

1294
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,620
saved us. Those sumbitches

1295
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,420
are trying to sting us. A really bad

1296
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,300
bob mask saved us.

1297
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,740
Nobody would do something that stupid.

1298
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,560
The full over the head

1299
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,800
vinyl bob mask. It wasn't

1300
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,500
the modern bob

1301
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,100
mask made by Sick Rick.

1302
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,380
How come we don't have any of those here?

1303
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,520
I thought we did.

1304
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,740
Didn't you bring some?

1305
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,520
Mine are in Texas. I think

1306
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,640
Princess Wee has one. Might as well be on

1307
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,780
the dark side of the moon.

1308
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,620
So Princess Wee brought one along.

1309
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,700
Well I thought there was one in Cleveland.

1310
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:20,980
They're really good.

1311
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,320
They aren't pricey. They're about

1312
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,580
80 bucks or 100.

1313
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,900
Would you say they were lifelike?

1314
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,120
No, I wouldn't say they were.

1315
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,780
Bob's not lifelike.

1316
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,500
They're Bob-like, although kind of

1317
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,700
more evil than we're used to seeing him

1318
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,580
look. Well, a lot more

1319
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,600
evil. I'd say

1320
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,460
frighteningly more evil.

1321
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,660
Both the

1322
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,380
black and white version

1323
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,640
is the worst. Bob Ferracchi

1324
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,540
got two, I call it.

1325
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,380
That was the first one I got.

1326
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,420
We get them for... Philo and I get them

1327
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,440
for free. The thousand year old

1328
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,860
Bob that lives in the basement.

1329
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,380
Every ten that he sells, we get

1330
00:51:59,380 --> 00:51:59,920
one free.

1331
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,620
He said he was only going to make 40 of them.

1332
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,500
Well, you should get in touch

1333
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,840
with Don Post Studios.

1334
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,520
He also makes a bunch of other really cool

1335
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,020
obscure characters.

1336
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,700
Some are so cool, I don't know who the hell

1337
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,380
they are, because they're from video games.

1338
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,640
How about the ones where you do

1339
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,040
know which ones they is?

1340
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,500
What are the ones

1341
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,620
you do know? He needs to have a

1342
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,560
Boing Boing article written

1343
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,480
about his mask company, and

1344
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,660
a special deal for subgenius masks.

1345
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,840
What are some of the

1346
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,540
entities represented? And then we'll get some free ones.

1347
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,720
No, then he'll be swamped

1348
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,600
with orders and he won't be able to fill them for a

1349
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,000
year. That'll fix him.

1350
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,560
Let's see what other characters... Do they have the

1351
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,720
creature from the Black Lagoon?

1352
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,400
Frankenstein's monster?

1353
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,120
More obscure.

1354
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,300
Sick Rick Masks.

1355
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,140
They call him Sick Rick, eh?

1356
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:55,720
Yeah.

1357
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,640
But are they from movies?

1358
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,320
Or just from popular

1359
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:01,800
folklore?

1360
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,360
A little of everything.

1361
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,040
I should be able to get it quick.

1362
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,600
Here we go. Masks and more.

1363
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,660
SickRickMasks.com

1364
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,540
Sick and Rick are spelled

1365
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,880
with just a K, no C.

1366
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,980
What am I doing? There's no internet here!

1367
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,340
Not Wi-Fi, but no internet!

1368
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,100
So,

1369
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,520
you're not able to look at

1370
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,880
the masks or even a list of...

1371
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,540
If I leave this here long enough, it may

1372
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,100
show up in about 10 minutes.

1373
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,220
Then we'll be

1374
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,440
surprised. Oh, there's the evil

1375
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,940
clown mask and...

1376
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,520
Horror monster.

1377
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,440
Several murderer types.

1378
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,020
Is there the gorilla?

1379
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,020
The mask?

1380
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,540
No, no. It's all stuff. Like I

1381
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,100
said, it's cool

1382
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,740
characters. You and me wouldn't know about them.

1383
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,200
We only know old things.

1384
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,620
Sixty million year old

1385
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,100
things.

1386
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,080
And, uh...

1387
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,880
Well, you can get dinosaur masks

1388
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,760
on the internet.

1389
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,380
Some

1390
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,760
of fairly good quality.

1391
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,420
Boy, I'm tired of doing this radio show.

1392
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,240
I just want to go play on the internet.

1393
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,320
But there is

1394
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,480
no internet, Doctor.

1395
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,060
I understand.

1396
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,260
But we're at a campground. Aren't you supposed to spend

1397
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,540
all day on the internet or playing

1398
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,300
board games?

1399
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,100
I'm supposed to have a weenie roast at the fire.

1400
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:27,700
Watching TV?

1401
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:30,520
Cook marshmallows on sticks.

1402
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,960
Doing anything except go out in the woods?

1403
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,420
Go out in the woods and knock off ticks

1404
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,100
with a stick.

1405
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,660
Yeah, I'm not going to do that. Not this year.

1406
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,060
Well, uh...

1407
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:43,360
Yeah, they are. They do festoon

1408
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,400
the branches and bushes

1409
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,400
and are angrily

1410
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,360
I mean, eagerly waiting for

1411
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,340
human blood.

1412
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,260
Well, remember that X-Day drill

1413
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,580
about three years ago when

1414
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,420
apparently Bob showed up and was

1415
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,760
on a rampage

1416
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,180
in the woods.

1417
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,120
That little dog was exsanguinated.

1418
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,800
Oh, he killed a little dog. He raped a car

1419
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,360
with people inside it.

1420
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,180
No, he killed a car and raped a dog.

1421
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,460
Well, it was very distasteful.

1422
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,780
And, uh...

1423
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,520
Oh, he killed Reverend Bastard or something.

1424
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,620
He did something. There was nothing left but his clothes.

1425
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,560
Reverend Bastard?

1426
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,360
Yeah, and then Bob kidnapped you.

1427
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,000
Nobody thought you were even there.

1428
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:25,280
We hunted Bob in the woods.

1429
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,680
I had been building up to this

1430
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,500
for weeks. I just wanted to see

1431
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,360
how many subgeniuses

1432
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,600
can I get off of their asses

1433
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,340
and off the road

1434
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,820
and down that little trail into the woods.

1435
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,360
It's like a scavenger hunt.

1436
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:39,640
It was a challenge. I said to myself.

1437
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,580
And it's like, sure enough, out of 40 or 50 people

1438
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,120
there, almost

1439
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,680
20 manly men

1440
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,500
managed to

1441
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,460
heave their vast

1442
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,480
huge butts off their chairs

1443
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,380
and go down that yellow trail

1444
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,520
about 40 paces.

1445
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,000
And sure enough, there was a scene of the crime.

1446
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,500
A broken and half pipe.

1447
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,880
A bunch of cotter pins and jello.

1448
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,720
A high-heeled

1449
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,100
shoe with Connie's name

1450
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,560
engraved in it.

1451
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,840
And a bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

1452
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,080
But, of course, Bob got away.

1453
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,780
And we all came back with lots of

1454
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,560
ticks. You've got to get up.

1455
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,340
Pretty early in the morning.

1456
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,520
They had good diseases that year.

1457
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,380
They were beneficial

1458
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,120
diseases.

1459
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,200
This year they're all deadly, horrible,

1460
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,520
crippling. Lyme disease

1461
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,800
is the least of them.

1462
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,880
Now they carry leprosy.

1463
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,720
And insanity.

1464
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,340
Yeah.

1465
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:38,780
Bubonic plague.

1466
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:44,040
And crotch rot.

1467
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,700
Well, actually, that just comes

1468
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:45,980
with

1469
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,480
the outdoors.

1470
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,080
With the outdoorsy life.

1471
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,020
So, uh,

1472
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,000
yeah,

1473
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,420
you'll need

1474
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:57,880
your

1475
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,340
Them Kind Pills.

1476
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,720
Oh, Mr. Sistar,

1477
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,380
you weren't here yesterday. You didn't see.

1478
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,700
We've got to have a whole bag of pills.

1479
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:08,660
You want one of these?

1480
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,460
Prescription bottles of Them Kind Pills

1481
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,240
from Bob Dobbs Pharmacy.

1482
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,520
If you want them, we got them.

1483
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,240
Take only as needed

1484
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,720
or whenever you want.

1485
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,300
Boy, I could take some right now.

1486
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,940
Oh, you'll like them because

1487
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,200
they're full of sugar.

1488
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,960
They're sure to make a diabetic

1489
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,280
just a little ill.

1490
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,080
Well, yeah, more Kind Pills.

1491
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,080
Anyone is welcome

1492
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:39,900
to come up.

1493
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,160
Have some

1494
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,420
Them Kind Pills.

1495
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,540
One per customer.

1496
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,020
One pill per customer?

1497
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,360
No, no, one per...

1498
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,580
Take as needed or as often as you want.

1499
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,640
Now there's a run on these pills.

1500
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,260
That's the thing about these pills.

1501
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,100
They're all purpose.

1502
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,420
Yeah, and they work for everything.

1503
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,040
These are expired pills.

1504
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,740
You can save them for a special occasion.

1505
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,560
Yeah, they did expire in 1998.

1506
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,340
But that hasn't come yet.

1507
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,220
So they're not technically...

1508
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,800
These pills have every kind of

1509
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,220
prescription imaginable. You take them, you're like,

1510
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,940
you can take them as often as needed.

1511
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:19,680
They're not bad.

1512
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,400
Anytime you want. You can take them for an over...

1513
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,720
You can overdose on them.

1514
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,800
And then take them...

1515
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,100
You can use them just for special occasions.

1516
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,700
Like, as if they were acid.

1517
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,080
What do you mean, as if they were?

1518
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,740
Well, they're a type of acid.

1519
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,280
Acetic acid.

1520
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:40,260
Nitric acid.

1521
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:41,720
Hydrochloric acid.

1522
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,020
So am I too loud for you guys now?

1523
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,720
Neither one of you said shut up in about

1524
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:47,720
a minute, so...

1525
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,060
He's got vitamin A and vitamin B.

1526
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,300
No, you're okay so far.

1527
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,280
Vitamins L-O-V-E.

1528
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,100
For once. Finally.
