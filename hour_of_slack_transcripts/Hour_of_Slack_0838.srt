1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,100
It's chaotic.

2
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,740
Yowl Slack.

3
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,080
But let's leave things of this world behind

4
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,740
and walk now down the path of Bob

5
00:00:59,740 --> 00:00:59,980
and his crew.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,580
For this brief minute of Slack

7
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,220
from the Church of the Subgenius.

8
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,240
Ah, yes, dear friends.

9
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,780
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,980
And I know some of my listeners

11
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,020
are going to think I'm crazy

12
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,180
for what I'm about to say.

13
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,820
But you know what?

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,320
I don't care.

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,360
Because I have Slack.

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,400
And you don't even know what that is.

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,560
I've got Bob Dobbs in my life.

18
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,000
Bob Dobbs, the living avatar of Slack.

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,840
So I know I'll be safe

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,000
on the pleasure vessels

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,960
of the sex goddesses from Planet X

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,080
when that day of judgment comes.

23
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:29,900
Ah, yes.

24
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,900
And you unbelievers

25
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,800
will fry in a hell of your own making.

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,500
And how do I know this?

27
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,240
Why am I so sure?

28
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,640
Because I have faith, my friend.

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,480
Faith in Bob.

30
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,240
You don't use your mind

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,940
to think about your religion.

32
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:44,800
Nay, nay.

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,840
You let that Bob signal from space beam

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,120
straight into your skull.

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,660
Unfeatered by your stupid notions

36
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,560
of good or evil or job or free will.

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,480
For the word of Bob is a direct word.

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,460
It is not written in some roundabout symbolic manner.

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,380
You don't try to figure out what it means, my friend.

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,020
You just do what it says.

41
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,920
Because Bob said it.

42
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,480
I believed it.

43
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,980
And that settles it.

44
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,540
Let there be Slack.

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,720
Today.

46
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,720
We ain't got enough Slack.

47
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,080
We ain't got enough Slack.

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,840
Slack is what gives us breaks.

49
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,000
Breaks on the car.

50
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,020
Breaks on the train.

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,820
Breaks to make you go insane.

52
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,060
And Slack is what brings you life.

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,580
Life.

54
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,620
Life takes away your Slack.

55
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,860
Life takes away your Slack.

56
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,900
Push the waitresses.

57
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,600
Pushy.

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,740
Take away your Slack.

59
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,120
Take away your Slack.

60
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,480
Arrogant cashiers.

61
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,620
Arrogant cashiers.

62
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,820
Take away your Slack.

63
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,500
Insensitive employers.

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,820
Take away your Slack.

65
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,220
Insensitive employers.

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,180
Take away your Slack.

67
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,880
Withholding tax takes away your Slack.

68
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,160
Withholding tax takes away your Slack.

69
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,500
What gives you back your Slack.

70
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,900
What gives you back your Slack.

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,680
Can I get a ball.

72
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,080
смерuard to��라

73
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,440
That's what gives you back your Slack.

74
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,180
That's what now.

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,880
Gives you back your Slack.

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,500
After I found Bob,

77
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,420
I knew that everything was gonna be alright from now on.

78
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:09,980
You see, the aliens had been tampering with my brain and been making me think that Negi was the only way back.

79
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:23,920
Oh, but dear friends, you know, once the slack was given to me, the ropes of life should no longer rip my brain asunder and twist the very air from my throat.

80
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:42,040
Yes, dear friends, you found nothing like it till you find Bob, because the peace that Bob has told me one day that unless I free myself from Negi, they said, doctor, they said, physician, heal yourself!

81
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:05,380
Perhaps this is as good a time as any to take a few minutes to repeat a message that seems frequently lost in the hustle and bustle of our daily activity.

82
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,780
Sunday morning, do you feel it, boo? You're hurt all over and you're moving so well.

83
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,480
People, here's something that you should know.

84
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,860
Tune us in on the radio dial. We got charisma, we got style.

85
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,780
Well, people, we'll make you feel.

86
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,560
We've been through for a while.

87
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,160
Put your hand, put your hand on the radio.

88
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,420
Put your hand, put your hand on the radio.

89
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,020
All right, we're hoping to make a lot of money real fast.

90
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:48,820
And if we can wake up ten more people out there in the listening audience tonight, we will have achieved our goal for the evening.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,460
What is the church's priorities? What's important to you guys?

92
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,900
Mainly the quest for...

93
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,360
The quest for slack.

94
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,280
The casting out of false prophets.

95
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,560
And controlling time. Those are our three main goals, I guess.

96
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,220
Slack.

97
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,080
Slack is something we all need.

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,820
And I know that lots of people out there listening right now are feeling a terrible shortage of slack.

99
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,160
Slack is something you can't get enough of.

100
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,160
That's right, that's right. And we can help them to get slack, George.

101
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,700
Man, the world is filled with a bunch of kooky ideas and concepts about the Bible.

102
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,860
I predict...

103
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,380
I predict that flying saucers will officially land on the lawn of the White House.

104
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,500
That's what I like about the Word of God. There's nothing fakey about this thing, man.

105
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,680
You talk about telling it like it is.

106
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,080
It hangs the dirty wash right out the front bay window.

107
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,360
For everybody to see.

108
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:48,400
That's right. And we want, when 1998 comes, we want subgeniuses to be in positions of power so that this alien technology is not abused.

109
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,460
And Bob tells us what we need to know to get into that position.

110
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,620
I hope you realize your demographics were aged 35 to 54.

111
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,920
The average consumer makes about $45,000 to $145,000 a year.

112
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,340
A tax bracket neatly fit in between the twine and the westerner.

113
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,300
And lives somewhere in some willful heights.

114
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,100
He smiles when he's not supposed to.

115
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,960
He drinks when he's supposed to.

116
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,660
He drips. He drips. He drips.

117
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,060
There he goes.

118
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,680
Don't touch that dial.

119
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,900
He was about to touch that dial.

120
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,680
Don't touch that proboscis.

121
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,240
He was going to stroke it suggestively.

122
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,920
And then stroke the proboscis.

123
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,340
Please, gentlemen, do not stroke the proboscis erotically.

124
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,640
Do not fondle the tubes.

125
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,040
The proboscis should not be touched.

126
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,380
It's the end times.

127
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,800
Even the jungle wanted him dead.

128
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,100
And that's who he really took his orders from anyway.

129
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,180
Yeah, Kurtz.

130
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,160
No.

131
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,520
He was a madman.

132
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,780
I'm not talking about Kurtz.

133
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,620
I'm talking about Legume.

134
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,700
A snail crawling along the edge of a straight razor.

135
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,100
Even the jungle wants Legume dead.

136
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,880
I'm a little man. He's a big man.

137
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,640
He's a big man.

138
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,740
The only cameras allowed in Tranquility Base is...

139
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,680
The only person allowed in Tranquility Base with a camera this year

140
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,480
is if it's Dennis Hopper.

141
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,620
What about girls with no shirt on?

142
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,600
Oh, they can come in, yeah.

143
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,320
Yeah, because they're...

144
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,620
Yeah.

145
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,280
How about the only guy...

146
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,740
And they take pictures of each other.

147
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,820
Yeah, yeah, that's all right.

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,240
How about...

149
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,140
But the only guy allowed in with any camera device

150
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,520
is if Dennis Hopper happens to show up

151
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,500
with all kinds of cameras all over.

152
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,200
How about Meow Tribesmen?

153
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,340
Those dressed as Meow Tribesmen.

154
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,060
Otherwise, Legume's going to take care of business.

155
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,080
Shrunken heads on their laps.

156
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,400
Enjoying the carnage

157
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,440
with some Velveeta cheese,

158
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,220
just like Mom does here.

159
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,220
Mom!

160
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,260
Mom!

161
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:53,580
Mom!

162
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:53,800


163
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:53,900


164
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:53,900


165
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:53,900


166
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:53,900


167
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:53,900


168
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:53,900


169
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:53,900


170
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:53,900


171
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:53,900


172
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:53,900


173
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:53,900


174
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:53,900


175
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,540
To Velveeta!

176
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,420
We're dad's head comedy again!

177
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,680
I know how the addition is.

178
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,400
The end's coming soon.

179
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,640
We're less than 80 days from next day now.

180
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,080
That's right.

181
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,860
We're like 70 days now or something.

182
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,460
That's right.

183
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,700
We're going to party like it's the end of time.

184
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,260
They're coming up on like two months or so.

185
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,520
You know, May, June, July.

186
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,700
Aren't you excited?

187
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,020
I can feel the drizzle.

188
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,940
I'm way behind.

189
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,460
I'm way, way, way, way, way behind.

190
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,040
I've sold all my earthly possessions.

191
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,780
You know, and why do we hurry for X Day?

192
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,300
Why do we care about our earthly possessions?

193
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,980
Yeah, that's right.

194
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,360
X day is coming.

195
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,500
Just get in the car and go to Brushwood and don't worry about anything.

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,080
Yeah, all this rumble roil is a bunch of filthy fall.

197
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,980
It's all going to end anyway, and you're going to be transported into a different dimension.

198
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,700
Well, leave your door open, though, so your cats and your dogs can go find new homes.

199
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,220
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,680
While you're gone.

201
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,660
I stopped the chin-chuttering.

202
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,200
Yeah, don't lock your animals in your house.

203
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,560
Let them loose before you come the next day.

204
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,580
Okay.

205
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,440
Put little bands on their heads, little red ribbons, and let them go.

206
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,760
Set your chickens free.

207
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,280
Let the red and blue loons flush your fish down the toilet.

208
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,020
Goodbye, Napoleon.

209
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,980
I'll see you on X day.

210
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,040
He waits for me when I go to school.

211
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,740
Let the cat finally get at that damn parakeet.

212
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,260
Hey, hey, but what about the parakeet, man?

213
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,400
Ah, finally enjoy that parakeet with some nice brown-rendered gravy.

214
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,300
I would.

215
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,540
And do it.

216
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,900
Didn't you ever really wonder what a ferret and a snake would do if they were in the same cage together?

217
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,200
Now's your chance to try.

218
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
No one cares.

219
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,480
Just do it.

220
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,320
What would the animals do if no people were left?

221
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,020
What if the X's took everyone?

222
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,320
And the whole planet was just piles of clothes everywhere.

223
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,780
One minute there were people standing there, the next minute piles of clothes.

224
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,460
Empty.

225
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,760
Size M's laying on the freeway in the M1s.

226
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,080
Naked bodies floating up towards the heavenly spacecraft.

227
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,380
Pounds of pubic hair floating skyward like little drips of water.

228
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,820
Gracefully floating away.

229
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,420
Such tumbleweed.

230
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,780
Blissfully floating away.

231
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,560
And so geniuses on the ground shooting them before they get to the escape vessel.

232
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,040
I was at Brushwood last weekend already preparing my rocket ship, my escape vessel.

233
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,160
Oh, how is Brushwood out there?

234
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,280
I hear the...

235
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,120
The meteor crater pond is completely full and glowing at night.

236
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,440
Have there been more sightings of the monster of crater light?

237
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:43,640
Yeah, when I was there late at night after everybody had gone to sleep, I walked over to crater lake and there was a strange dim greenish glow in the woods.

238
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,180
I was...

239
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,360
I set the garbage.

240
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,980
It turned out that there was some Armenian hunters in the area.

241
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,600
Putting the pimentos in the ground.

242
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,140
Is it Armenian hunters?

243
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,620
Are they Armenian seas?

244
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,520
It's open seas, not Armenians?

245
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,840
Yeah, apparently.

246
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,320
It's open seas, not Armenians, man.

247
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,120


248
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,760
Sounds to me like the Lakeview Man.

249
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,940
The Lakeview Man is a wild man.

250
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,440
Lives in the woods outside of town.

251
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Howls at the moon, listen if you can.

252
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,960
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

253
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,460
Some say he was a soldier who came home from war.

254
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,640
All in one piece but with emotional scars.

255
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,140
We own the story, argue about the days.

256
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,420
Vietnam or the war between the states.

257
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,520
And the Lakeview Man is a wild man.

258
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,140
Lives in the woods outside of town.

259
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,360
Howls at the moon, listen if you can.

260
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,500
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

261
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,080
I took the shortcut to the river last night.

262
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,400
A beard and a blur in the long, deep lights.

263
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,720
We drank a few beers, skipped a few stones.

264
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,980
And I drove a little faster on the way back home.

265
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:45,900
Music

266
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,440
A dog is a deer, a cow is found dead.

267
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,760
A chicken is missing, found missing its head.

268
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,080
Shotgun gone, print in the sand.

269
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,260
Two toes shy, the Lakeview Man.

270
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,440
The Lakeview Man is a wild man.

271
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,020
Lives in the woods outside of town.

272
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,280
Howls at the moon, listen if you can.

273
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,440
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

274
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,600
The Lakeview Man is a wild man.

275
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,100
Lives in the woods outside of town.

276
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,460
Howls at the moon, listen if you can.

277
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,660
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

278
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,980
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

279
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,220
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

280
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
You might hear the Lakeview Man.

281
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,780
Things are strange out there at Brushwood.

282
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,360
There's...

283
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,240
It was.

284
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,020
It was a strange weekend.

285
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,340
Energy emanating from the ground itself.

286
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,900
I told you I've seen flying beings there.

287
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,780
And you laughed and scoffed on me staying.

288
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,660
You said, ha ha.

289
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,820
I look down at my shoes when you say this, Dave, to make you mad.

290
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,960
No, everybody sees UFOs out there except me.

291
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,480
Well, the strange thing is, some people believe that if you hallucinate someone there,

292
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,280
that this is a result of the crater meteor lake.

293
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:23,980
It will appear.

294
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,640
That if you hallucinate somebody there, a few hours later,

295
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,600
it doesn't happen immediately, but a few hours later, they'll appear.

296
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,460
Those are called tulpas in Tibetan tradition.

297
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,040
Really?

298
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,340
A tulpa is a...

299
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:43,900
A thought form that is brought to life by a person's belief or obsession with that.

300
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,120
But you must perform necrophilia with them to get them going.

301
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,300
It's like the lung gong pa.

302
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,400
You can make them run for miles just by making love to their corpse.

303
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
Only you have to do that, Dave.

304
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,100
That's what the llama told you, right?

305
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:56,940
Right?

306
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,640
Llama ding ding.

307
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,460
Yeah, he always...

308
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,520
Llama ding ding has been defrocked.

309
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,500
And did he have a little chant that was like, oh, wah, tay goo, sayam.

310
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:04,860
Yeah, right.

311
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,320
Yes.

312
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,960
He had his...

313
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,540
Did he take you on a hunt for these creatures called snipe birds?

314
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,140
He made me choose between two vessels.

315
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,560
One, if I were to touch, I was the ancient master himself at a new incarnation.

316
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,440
If I touched the other one, I would get rigor mortis of my toe.

317
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,420
And he had you rub his snake with snake oil, right?

318
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,160
Of course.

319
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,000
Strain snake.

320
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,260
And by the power of Wee Watami.

321
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,860
So he took them from me and tore his dick off.

322
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:47,860


323
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:54,900
Damn.

324
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,680
Let me slog around your neck.

325
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
Let me draw.

326
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,220
down your chest off. I'm not prejudiced I don't care if he's a Jew, a black, Italian,

327
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:18,660
Chinese. If he messes with me I'll shoot him. He's got complete equality as he drops to the ground.

328
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,180
The helicopter which plucked the re-entry capsule out of the water had a big 6-6.

329
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:37,460
After a while it moved up, took off at a fantastic speed at the at least 45 degrees angle and they

330
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,600
just disappeared between the stars. During the debriefing which we always get after each

331
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:52,880
combat mission, the officer who was receiving this made a joke of it how many beer I had.

332
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,620
I don't believe you J.R.

333
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:01,340
Well I did benefit from it of course but so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.

334
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,240
In other words you want to know you want the government to know that you're in there

335
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,620
to make money and to pay taxes. Well we're already treading a pretty thin line Bill and

336
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:18,100
I'm sure there's plenty of other things they'd love to get us for just be you know well I don't

337
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,100
know whether we want to talk about the conspiracy on the air but uh oh yeah go right ahead.

338
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,500
The one

339
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,000
that's really interesting is the conspiracy behind the conspiracy.

340
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,600
Ah the the conspiracy to end all conspiracies maybe.

341
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:36,700
Well part of part of the church's goal is to wake people up to the fact that our lives are

342
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,340
being controlled by forces uh that that most people are completely ignorant of.

343
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,980
It gets really complex when you get into conspiracies and we believe um

344
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,480
I'm a student there.

345
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,160
He's a student there.

346
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,160


347
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,160


348
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,240
I'm a student here.

349
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,300
I'm a student here.

350
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,680
So where's the next voyage when is the next voyage?

351
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,160
Uh, that's the one the voyage that we're going on to uh the finally the little crinkly trees?

352
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,400
The ancient trees.

353
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,960
They look like little trees, the aluminum foil, where everything sounds like

354
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,160
only the city people that make you hear conversations and pieces of music

355
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,360
while you're trying to sleep out there because your mind starts

356
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,020
trying to filter out all this crazy sound out there in the middle of the night. Yeah.

357
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:31,240
Because I've been lying there on the ground, and I'll hear people talking and think, and then think, there's nobody out here.

358
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,920
You'll hear them talking, and they'll be going,

359
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,680
Doug.

360
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,240
Philo.

361
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:50,120
You don't hear anything distinctive except once in a while they say your name in a loud enough way for you to know that there's somebody talking out there.

362
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,480
It's not a suspicion anymore.

363
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,220
It's an absolute fact.

364
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:00,080
The question now becomes is how long will it take for them to get to you, and how fast will they kill you?

365
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:09,540
Will they kill you slowly, or will they roast you over some kind of a spit, or will they just take a bludgeon and just hammer your head into a bloody pulp?

366
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:15,160
So all they find is this stumpy thing laying on a cot in the morning by the camp.

367
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,900
You know, the park ranger will come around and say, oh, my God.

368
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,200
The park ranger.

369
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,200


370
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,380
The park creature struck again.

371
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:25,920
Okay, the truth.

372
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,820
It wasn't biohazard.

373
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,400
It's a warning sign.

374
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,800
You have granted yourself three slimy wishes.

375
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:44,300
You know, speaking of weird superstitions and strange events, I'm supposed to speak to the skeptics group of Northern Ohio tomorrow night.

376
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,120
Wow.

377
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,880
Yeah.

378
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,480
Yeah, they.

379
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,960
Are you sure?

380
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,080
Yes, I am.

381
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,040
Well, as sure as a true skeptic can be.

382
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,600
You know.

383
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,580
Now, what is supposed to happen?

384
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,200
Actually, I decided to call this lecture.

385
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,780
It's not really a lecture.

386
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,640
It's just a, you know, a trance channeling.

387
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,660
But I decided to call it Unbelievable Gullibility.

388
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:14,600
And that's tomorrow at the Earth Science Building at, what is that, the university?

389
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,860
She doesn't even know where it's at.

390
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,380
Did you read your copy?

391
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,480
Did you reread your copy of Demon Haunted World to bone up on?

392
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:22,900
No.

393
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,200
No.

394
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,460
Some good shtick?

395
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,660
Oh, all I have to do is tell them what I have seen believed.

396
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,340
You know, I've seen some things believed that I can't believe people believe.

397
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,880
I can't believe it myself, Fielder.

398
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,760
In 1922, I saw one of them coming from behind that shark there.

399
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,720
And it was just a little boy.

400
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,940
I guess you could call me a little boy.

401
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,800
And I swear to God, it was the hairiest thing I ever saw.

402
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,020
I was wearing a big old pair of bottles.

403
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,820
I was wearing black glasses.

404
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,740
And I had a big sandwich.

405
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,500
And he looked like he was crying.

406
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,320
Sometimes.

407
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,080
I never liked it.

408
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,300
I just thought it was funny.

409
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,720
Drop it or I'll break your arm.

410
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,100
And there are the plantages that grow on this horrible planet.

411
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,880
And there.

412
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,780
Oh, look.

413
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,100
There is one of the alien creatures.

414
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,040
That lives on the planet.

415
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,180
He's tugging at his head like it's in pain.

416
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,540
Ridiculous.

417
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,820
She was terrified and now she doesn't answer the door.

418
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,320
But her car is sitting in the garage.

419
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,400
She was out.

420
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,660
Or in bed with the flu.

421
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,200
Or maybe she was abducted by aliens for all we know.

422
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,920
You're going.

423
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,240
The alien pees.

424
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,960
In the bushes.

425
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:02,080
He reaches in and signages all.

426
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,860
His world is empty of negative.

427
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,260
What does he want to say to us?

428
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,260


429
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,260


430
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,260


431
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,260


432
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,360
Ridiculous.

433
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:06,380


434
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,860
sinners and white walt содержes one or more in the Lord.

435
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,700
It uses bride Maria.

436
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:10,700


437
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,280
Focus.

438
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,920
Yes, he is.

439
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,840
Negative art man.

440
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,140
And that is the mountain from hell.

441
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,100
And the sky of orange in the place of the doomed people.

442
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,040
And there are the plantages that grow on this horrible planet.

443
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,100
And there...

444
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,700
Oh, look!

445
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,920
There is one of the alien creatures that lives on the planet.

446
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,000
He's tugging at his head like it's in pain.

447
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,180
We're lucky to have the benefit of this long-range zoom.

448
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,480
We can zoom in on the hideous, hideous, foul demon that he is.

449
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,820
Like some movie, horrible, horrible movie creature.

450
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,980
There he is, just sort of walking.

451
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,920
Yeah, I think they walk.

452
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,140
And then they creep.

453
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,240
Creepily creeping away.

454
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,500
This is a winner.

455
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,540
Take a look at this now.

456
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,060
What we're looking at here...

457
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,780
Let's see.

458
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,980
Now, I want to make sure I have the right...

459
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,580
Do I have the right one?

460
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,540
Here we go.

461
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,460
Here we go.

462
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
This is it right here.

463
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,700
Here we go.

464
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,560
It is really one of the most beautiful places on Earth.

465
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:34,960
And if you don't know that much about Andalusia or Lusha, I think it's Lusha, in Brazil.

466
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,600
And that's...

467
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,800
So very rare and so very special.

468
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,040
Chameleon.

469
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,980
It stands up a good quarter of an inch.

470
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,140
And it tapers to one-sixteenths.

471
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,680
And when you talk about color, you're talking about, you know, again, you know, that has just a little bit of pink in there.

472
00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:02,440
It's actually in Sri Lanka and Brazil, Spain, Canada, Russia, Australia, and here in the United Chameleon.

473
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,080
If we can...

474
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,120
Just gonna pop.

475
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,920
Look at this.

476
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,060
Hello.

477
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,580
Chameleon.

478
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,540
Hello, dog.

479
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,000
You unlock this door with the key.

480
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,280
Beyond it is another sound mind.

481
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,040
You're moving into a land of sub-mind.

482
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,340
Sub-mind.

483
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,760
Sub-mind.

484
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,940
Sub-mind.

485
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,560
You've just crossed over into...

486
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,220
And the Lusha's...

487
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,200
Lu-si-a?

488
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,700
Ah, get yourself a filter.

489
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,300
Miki-na.

490
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,680
L-U-S-E.

491
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,260
Miki-na.

492
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,360
Miki-na.

493
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:02,880
Miki-na.

494
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,060
Miki-na.

495
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,180
Miki-na.

496
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,520
Miki-na.

497
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,100
Miki-na.

498
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,160
Miki-na.

499
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:05,900
Miki-na.

500
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,940
Miki-na.

501
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:07,600
Miki-na.

502
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:07,680
Miki-na.

503
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,100
Cats ask for it by name.

504
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,220
Paint, grease, tar, carbon, ink, plain dirt.

505
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,160
And so will you.

506
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,280
Without water.

507
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,900
Miki.

508
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,120
Miki.

509
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:19,540
Miki.

510
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,340
Miki.

511
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,600
Miki.

512
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,020
It's all vegetable.

513
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,800
It's digestible.

514
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,020
Oh, yes, dear friends.

515
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,640
A little bit of Limur there.

516
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,440
Fernanda Nende Limur.

517
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,260
The song we heard was, of course, The Rainmakers.

518
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,880
And we've heard some ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland.

519
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,780
And I've been slowly working my way through Media Barrage No. 5,

520
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:05,820
the old subgenius tape, which I've been remastering for you.

521
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,440
We heard some KPFA Berkeley sub-show puzzling evidence.

522
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,500
And Dr. Philo Drummond.

523
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,620
I should mention that the Media Barrage sequences in this show

524
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:25,720
were largely edited by old Reverend Stevie Hambone.

525
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,660
Ah, yes, friends.

526
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,640
And that new title, Hour of Slack title that we heard at the beginning,

527
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:38,340
was, in fact, by the El Queso All-Stars, or Interbulator.

528
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,740
And this is, in fact, an X-Day show.

529
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,140
We're building up to that marvelous subgenius holiday.

530
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,020
Perhaps it will be the end of the world this time.

531
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,200
We'll find out on July 5th at 7 a.m.

532
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,260
But in the meantime, now,

533
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,520
back to WCSB Cleveland for ESO Swamp Radio.

534
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,280
I just want to know that if you're an American

535
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,580
and you believe that the rapture is a good thing,

536
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,300
doesn't that mean that you end up driving a better car

537
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,500
rather than that you're removed from your car?

538
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,600
A red, white, and blue rapture, my friend.

539
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,280
If that's your...

540
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,080
I will suddenly be in a really good car.

541
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,600
If that's your thought form, man.

542
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,220
If that's your pleasure vessel, if that's how you envision your...

543
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,340
Yeah.

544
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,900
That's your pleasure wave, dude.

545
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,620
I mean, you're on it.

546
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,780
You've got a weird planet, baby.

547
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,860
Well, you get your own planet.

548
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,500
I mean, you can populate it with whatever kind of cars you want.

549
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,480
If you want to depopulate the planet,

550
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,800
first you can use cholera blankets like we used to do back in the old days,

551
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,780
or you could just, like, drop a neutron bomb there, for Christ's sake.

552
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,260
What if you want someone else's planet?

553
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,040
What if I want Korob?

554
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,860
Well, I'm saying you fight for it.

555
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,680
You depopulate it with your own stuff,

556
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,780
and then you move on down there and settle in for an easy life on a hammock.

557
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,260
Or a hummock.

558
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,120
Depending on your taste, butch.

559
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,780
Do you understand what you're saying now?

560
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,580
Or not?

561
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,220
Um, yeah, butch, butch.

562
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,700
He said taste, butch.

563
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,120
I want Korob, and Jehovah's got that one right.

564
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,920
Taste, butch.

565
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,540
You sit on that hamburger to taste it?

566
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,160
Jehovah, he said taste, butch.

567
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,080
Is that how you use your taste, butch, Dave?

568
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,060
Do you think maybe Jehovah has no planets?

569
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,820
He's just a slate of hand and ham artists, right?

570
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,580
Wouldn't you say, Sting?

571
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,520
I mean, Stingian?

572
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,900
You old Armenian hunter, you.

573
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,560
Wouldn't you say Jehovah's just kind of like a...

574
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,360
Tricky wiki slate of hand artists?

575
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,000
How would you explain the Armenian hunter in the freezing night in the middle?

576
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,560
By this pond that's created by a crater that everybody's saying is now glowing at night.

577
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,220
Our lord and master blaster, of course.

578
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:47,660
Weird green lights in the woods, and all of a sudden some guy approaches, you know, and comes out of the woods.

579
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,540
Why couldn't it have been a supine woman's?

580
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,920
I don't, actually, I don't see anything at all weird about any of that myself.

581
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,260
Just between you and me.

582
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,680
Did you look at these shoes, my friend?

583
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,320
No, are you sure?

584
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,200
You weren't in, like, the B-hole or the K-hole or the A-hole or something when this was going on?

585
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,540
No, the thing is to say, you could say it like that, but...

586
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,960
You see, there's one thing you're missing out on here.

587
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,920
There's one thing you're just not, you're not catching the obvious.

588
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,300
The Turks beat him, Jack.

589
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,860
Because you're not one of them.

590
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,920
Do you know any true outdoorsmen?

591
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,420
Me?

592
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:20,840
Yeah.

593
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,520
Of course.

594
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,140
Okay.

595
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,280
I'm sure those guys have all those signs that say, we'll drink for food or whatever.

596
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,120
No, no, no.

597
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,820
I mean, real hunter-fishermen.

598
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,760
Oh.

599
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,820
Men that hunt and fish.

600
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,020
Not just, just hunt.

601
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,880
Full-time, those leathery-looking characters.

602
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,440
Yeah.

603
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,180
Those guys with the baseball hats that...

604
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,240
Well, my brother's a cattle rancher.

605
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,860
...have a $20,000 product on them.

606
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,100
And looks like he's made of clay.

607
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:45,540
Okay.

608
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,400
Weathered leather, so...

609
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:53,320
My brother worked for the railroad, and they're all, like, real outdoorsman type.

610
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,320
The hunter-fisher type.

611
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,020
I do know those types, yeah.

612
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,680
And the thing that, the obvious thing that the story is, people miss on that story...

613
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,260
They are a degenerated race.

614
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,340
Their minds have become pieces of cabbage.

615
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm sorry.

616
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,260
...is that those kind of people are out there in January...

617
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,320
February.

618
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,180
...in February, in March, in April.

619
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,420
No weather that winter in Ohio can whip up will keep those men in their four-wheel drive vehicles

620
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,220
and their weapons or their fishing lures from...

621
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,520
...what they need to do to make their lives full.

622
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,100
No, but it's not the wild men.

623
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,860
Those wild men things, that's whole crap.

624
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,760
...a bone-legged man with a crossbow and a 55-48.

625
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,240
People should be taken out and just shot in the woods, actually.

626
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,200
I think so, a la Deliverance.

627
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,440
They ought to just, like, let loose a bunch of these psychopathic...

628
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,120
A bunch of pigs.

629
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:46,960
...shoot guys.

630
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,540
Yeah, with the big curly dicks and go rape them.

631
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,380
Curly dicks.

632
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,560
Is that true that pigs actually...

633
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,360
...the raping of the wild men from Cleveland.

634
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:56,780
You know, um...

635
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:56,980
...the raping of the wild men from Cleveland.

636
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:56,980


637
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,000
...the raping of the wild men from Cleveland.

638
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:03,060
I have had direct contact with people from other planets

639
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,740
and have spoken with them on many occasions.

640
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,400
...to the moon in an Apollo spacecraft.

641
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,940
The Apollo has six letters.

642
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,240
Each of the astronauts' names has six letters.

643
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,540
Lovell, Anders, Borman.

644
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,640
Six, six, six.

645
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,000
From space, six televisions.

646
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,420
And transmissions were made.

647
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,200
The moon trip was a six-day journey.

648
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,700
The spacecraft was in six sections.

649
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,760
The astronaut section plus the escape system was 66 feet tall.

650
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,120
On occasion, an unidentified flying object has been reported by witnesses

651
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,080
to be the source of the sound.

652
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,680
Oh, no.

653
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,000
Oh, Bob, what's that?

654
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,400
What?

655
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,040
What?

656
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,300
What?

657
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,260
What is it?

658
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,940
Hello?

659
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,700
Carol, you fucking whore!

660
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,080
Hello?

661
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,860
Hello?

662
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:13,540


663
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,180
Oh, you really got the action.

664
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:27,000
Oh, you really got the action.

665
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,020


666
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,380
No!

667
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,000
No!

668
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,720
That was really a good reaction.

669
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,120
I'm not happy with that either.

670
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,120


671
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,120


672
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,120


673
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,460
But I was really excited not to be in it.

674
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,440
So I didn't want to answer any questions.

675
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,000
That was what I wanted to be.

676
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:53,340
Oh!

677
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:53,920
That's really funny.

678
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,900
That's why this got me very excited.

679
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:54,900


680
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:54,900


681
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,160
Out of my way, hey

682
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,480
Out of my way

683
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,260
Hot rocket on record today

684
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,160
And I feel like picking a fight

685
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,740
With anybody who claims they're right

686
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,160
All the preachers, men, the politicians

687
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,680
All the critics and the things they write

688
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,080
Out of my way

689
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,560
Out of my way

690
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,980
Out of my way

691
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,860
Hot rocket on record today

692
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,920
And this is the call of arms

693
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,120
This is the call of hands

694
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,440
This is the call of the muscles and the minds

695
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,260
Of the people in every land

696
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,600
Out of my way

697
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,940
Out of my way

698
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,400
Out of my way

699
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,140
Out of my way

700
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,540
Out of my way

701
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,360
Hot rocket on record today

702
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,660
And we're taking the history test

703
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,280
Of who's baddest and who is best

704
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,040
Lenin the brother

705
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,420
Lenin the sisters

706
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,720
Lenin the communist

707
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,620
Out of my way

708
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,880
Out of my way

709
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,100
Out of my way

710
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,280
Out of my way

711
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,500
Out of my way

712
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,340
Hot rocket on record today

713
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
With the money in the mattress

714
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,780
Put your pennies where they count

715
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,600
Nothing left to believe in

716
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,220
Nothing left to wait for

717
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,140
And getting them to tell the truth

718
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,580
Was like pulling the wisdom tooth

719
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,520
And knowing never would have needed

720
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,860
Everybody knew we did it

721
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,660
When it burned down before it could move

722
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,080
Out of my way

723
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,560
Out of my way

724
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,240
And we are the immigrant flock

725
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,380
The sheep of the sheep

726
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,680
Rest on splintered rock

727
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,240
From the monitor

728
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,680
And the mirror mat

729
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,200
From the pressure and the quibble

730
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:56,980
And the Titanic

731
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,360
Wrecking in day

732
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,820
With the money in the mattress

733
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,860
Wrecking in day

734
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,140
Put your pennies where they count

735
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,360
Wrecking in day

736
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,000
Nothing left to believe in

737
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,580
Nothing left to wait for

738
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,860
Out of my way

739
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,440
Get out of my way

740
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,880
Get out of my way

741
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,200
Out of my way

742
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:23,880
Out of my way

743
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,640
Get out of my way

744
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,120
Out of my way

745
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,200
Out of my way

746
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,320
Get out of my way

747
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,100
Out of my way

748
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,780
You know when a flag like that touches the ground

749
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,120
the only way to make it healthy again

750
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,540
is to have naked women

751
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,280
And kiss the ground

752
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
on the flag hill

753
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,180
For a pawn.

754
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:49,820
Yes.

755
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,960
Kissed it with your tiny little mouth.

756
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,040
That's right.

757
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,160
Get down and kiss.

758
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,680
French kiss the ground.

759
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,720
While the flag have touched the ground.

760
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,400
Get that money home.

761
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:58,400


762
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,240
This flag has been so bloody from so many war and fighting.

763
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,220
Look, it's red already and white and blue like you.

764
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,640
Oh, this flag.

765
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,820
I would like to wrap my body in here and stay warm the rest of...

766
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,460
How long is this going to last?

767
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,720
It hasn't even begun.

768
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,300
It's gone.

769
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,580
Yeah, well, everybody's been taken off the grid now.

770
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,800
You're not even at the birth stage yet, Dave.

771
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,100
You're not even on the grid yet.

772
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,460
You're not even conceived.

773
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,340
You're not even a naval man.

774
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,520
You've got nothing down there but a smooth thing.

775
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:28,580
None of you.

776
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,660
If you can hear my voice, you haven't even been conceived yet.

777
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,340
They don't even have any ear canals to listen with, pal.

778
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,320
Just think of it that way.

779
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,640
You're in that limbo.

780
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,560
It's meta hearing.

781
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,100
You know what I mean?

782
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,260
Meta, meta, meta, meta, meta.

783
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,180
But it's okay.

784
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,040
Well, time will come.

785
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,380
Luckily, Dave is the only one who...

786
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,560
really can hear your voice.

787
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,460
Until then,

788
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,580
then all will awaken.

789
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,360
He is the only one.

790
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,280
And truly see for the first time

791
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,300
where they have actually been

792
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,440
since they were quote

793
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,740
unquote born.

794
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,280
See the canker sores on their mind, the festerings

795
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,240
they have created in this past evil life

796
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,220
which must be eliminated.

797
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,380
It's coming

798
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:10,740
soon.

799
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,480
I've got everything backwards. You're in hell now.

800
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,560
You're about to die and be reborn

801
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,080
into real life.

802
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,580
Then the before life, that's like heaven.

803
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,480
This is hell, man.

804
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,760
This is hell, man.

805
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,140
Welcome to hell.

806
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,100
Oh, save my life.

807
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,720
Yes, sir,

808
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,460
dear friend.

809
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,060
I'm living in Arnold Palmer.

810
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,620
He's the one for me.

811
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,060
I'm happier than the morning sun.

812
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,940
That's the way it'll always be.

813
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,880
Ever since the day you came inside of me.

814
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:05,560
Me.

815
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,060
Oh my.

816
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,700
Yeah.

817
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,440
Johnny could only sing one note

818
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,980
and the note he sang was this.

819
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,760
Die!

820
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,940
If you want to,

821
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,280
you misguided

822
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,980
Martha!

823
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,700
Not me.

824
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,100
Not me.

825
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,440
I won't grow up.

826
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,820
I won't grow up.

827
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,360
I don't want to wear a tie.

828
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,860
I don't want to wear a tie.

829
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,280
And a serious expression.

830
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,700
And a serious expression.

831
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,140
In the middle of July.

832
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,460
In the middle of July.

833
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,840
I'm going to be a little bit more

834
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:48,840


835
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,100
Come, come, baby.

836
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,460
So you come out

837
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,820
and you draw

838
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,540
and you say,

839
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,540
bam, bam.

840
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,100
Stop.

841
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,080
And a guy doesn't stop.

842
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,720
Then you move up to the head

843
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,120
and you put one right there

844
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,980
and that's usually final.

845
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,840
Get that spear away from me.

846
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,300
Get it away.

847
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,540
It exploded.

848
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,540
It hit people

849
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,960
that had not been hit in months.

850
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,680
Some began to dance in the spirit.

851
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,460
Others threw up their hands.

852
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,380
And exclamations of praise.

853
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,080
Others began to dance up and down the aisles.

854
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,540
Others fell like they'd been hit

855
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,600
by a proverbial chainsaw.

856
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,280
I was entranced.

857
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,300
I walked in and there sitting at the piano

858
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,600
and playing was a man who later introduced himself

859
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,060
as someone from the planet Saturn.

860
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,720
Ridiculous.

861
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,720
Absurd.

862
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:40,880
Ludicrous.

863
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,340
Yes.

864
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,180
But they couldn't help it.

865
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,440
And I've got a...

866
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,140
An idea when we step across

867
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,060
that portal of glory

868
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,500
and our feet are upon solid gold

869
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,780
and we see the King of Kings

870
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,120
and the Lord of Lords

871
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,060
and the troubles and trials are past

872
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,780
and we are home at last.

873
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,780
Thank God I'm going to have

874
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,060
an old-fashioned heartfelt Holy Ghost

875
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,300
heaven sent devil chasing jubilee

876
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,180
in my heart and soul

877
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,740
and give vent to the God of glory

878
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,080
that saved my soul.

879
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,200
Well, I'll bet the next two years

880
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,460
brings a total collapse.

881
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,640
A collapse of world civilization

882
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,160
and the next three years after that

883
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,320
will be more or less the pot boiling

884
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,860
and it'll be total absolute chaos

885
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,900
except in places like this.

886
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,900
Here it'll be just like a Shangri-La,

887
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,920
barely touched from the outside.

888
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,860
No, wait a minute.

889
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,200
No, wait a minute.

890
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,000
I love that area and...

891
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,500
Get off the air!

892
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,940
I just can't face it.

893
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,460
The King of Kings

894
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,180
wanted to kill...

895
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:46,960
So why should...

896
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,760
If I was listening to this broadcast,

897
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,980
why would I want to go to

898
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,420
Sherman, New York

899
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,200
on July 5th weekend?

900
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,240
It's a funny name, Sherman.

901
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,640
There's no particular reason

902
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,600
for...

903
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,880
to go there.

904
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,580
I mean, we tell people, you know,

905
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,680
come to Brushwood.

906
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,980
It's, it's, uh...

907
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,720
Well, you'll find out why...

908
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,640
I staple your mouth.

909
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,460
When it happens,

910
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,420
when it starts...

911
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:14,900
When it starts happening,

912
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,420
you'll be...

913
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,500
Then you'll be going,

914
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,340
God, I wish I was at that place

915
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,660
those guys were talking about.

916
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,460
I guess this wouldn't be happening there.

917
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:23,880
And actually,

918
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,340
it's not that this wouldn't be happening there.

919
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,160
It's that there won't be there.

920
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,720
There will be in another place

921
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,460
where we will go away to.

922
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,820
Next day is the day that those who know

923
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,900
get to get away.

924
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,580
Can't we watch it drift into the...

925
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,360
Now it's possible.

926
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,000
We'll admit this could be

927
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,340
just another accident.

928
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,440
Next day drill,

929
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,720
because perhaps the great lesson

930
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,680
Bob taught us is

931
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,480
that 1998 has not yet come.

932
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,340
Well, issue a call-out for a big...

933
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,120
We don't even know what year it is, really.

934
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,620
Issue a call-out for a big Wotan jam.

935
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,840
...high out from our coins.

936
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,580
Tell, tell...

937
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,080
You're the man connected.

938
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,960
Tell the musicians coming

939
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,040
to bring instruments.

940
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:06,980
Until Wotan.

941
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,000
That's always understood.

942
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:08,700
Yeah.

943
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,200
There's usually the Wednesday

944
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,060
or Thursday night,

945
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,580
there's a big Wotan jam.

946
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,140
Yeah.

947
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,400
But anything can go by election day.

948
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,400


949
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,400


950
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,400


951
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,400


952
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,400


953
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,400


954
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,400


955
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,400


956
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,400


957
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,400


958
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,400


959
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,420
at attention time

960
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:31,420


961
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:31,420


962
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,100
että jest det's okay

963
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,880
to say that,

964
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,120
let that go,

965
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,120


966
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,120


967
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,780

Viktor III Cott 요즘

972
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,440
oft umher in Re warrior H THAT'S.

973
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,660
I was thinking it would be fun to have the Celebrity Square thing,

974
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,580
the subject be esoteric subgenius concepts.

975
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,300
Yeah, yeah.

976
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,420
So like the story of Bob being shot could be part of that.

977
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,220
Well, so many things could be.

978
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:15,700
I mean, that's a great idea because it's reminding the ancient depths of subgenius,

979
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,700
some of the origination myths rather than these newer church things.

980
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,820
But they would be brought out in a playful, fundamental way.

981
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,200
And we could really dig, as I do sometimes when I find these old tapes

982
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,320
and listen to some of the old jokes of the old church,

983
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,240
and I think they're just fun to dig up again.

984
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,320
That was P. Bicker Flemel.

985
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,560
Find new jokes in that church.

986
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,040
And I just want to throw in some of the old jokes

987
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,940
so people know there was.

988
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,200
A little bit.

989
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:41,780
A little old church.

990
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,300
And these little guys limped around the little campfire at night.

991
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,660
By cracky, it was better back then.

992
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,480
Did their religious thing.

993
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,680
And said, as people always do universally,

994
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,540
it was better back then because, you know, folks, it was better back then.

995
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:54,820
Sure it was.

996
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,280
No matter who you were or where you were in history,

997
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,980
it was always better back then.

998
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:04,320
Because there was more youth and less withering from time,

999
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,360
being blasted by grief and ill usage.

1000
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,320
That's right.

1001
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,000
So now let the myrmidons of,

1002
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,260
of chicken, infuse energy into the show

1003
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,760
while we, the elder archons,

1004
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,680
simply lap up the cream provided on the occasion

1005
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,320
by the creamettes and the other performing groups.

1006
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,340
They are also referred to as naked fire goddesses by chicken.

1007
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,660
I don't know what the deal is there.

1008
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,900
I mean, he's claiming that that...

1009
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,100
They'll just fit in just fine to the subgenius mythology

1010
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,980
of sauce and...

1011
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:41,540
They're just like, you know,

1012
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,280
pleasure guides and...

1013
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,260
All that, uh...

1014
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,120
All that stuff that they paid 10 bucks to come see.

1015
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,480
That's right.

1016
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,840
Dinosaurs of slack.

1017
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,220
All your favorites doing all the same things over and over again.

1018
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:56,440
That's 13 bucks.

1019
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,120
I don't want one.

1020
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,640
What about furniture on next day?

1021
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,160
Will we be needing lots of furniture?

1022
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,820
Will we be needing lots of household accruements

1023
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,240
where we're going in Sherman, New York?

1024
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:05,860
Bring lamps.

1025
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:06,540
Yeah.

1026
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,060
Where you're going in Sherman, New York,

1027
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,080
is where you're going...

1028
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,440
You got a pit group, Dave?

1029
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:10,960
...beyond the...

1030
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,000
A pit group.

1031
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,500
A real nice, comfy pit group.

1032
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,280
A pit group.

1033
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:14,720
Yeah.

1034
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:15,660
What's a pit group?

1035
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,160
Like a living room pit group.

1036
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,380
Oh, yes, an assemblage.

1037
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:18,960
Oh, okay.

1038
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1039
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,320
Yeah, I see what you're talking about.

1040
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,660
Bring that.

1041
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,560
Yeah, bring it.

1042
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,720
It's got giraffes on it and stuff and like...

1043
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,500
Wait, yours has probably been eaten by the dog.

1044
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,100
No, it's been urinated and defecated on by the old man himself.

1045
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,600
He comes back again now.

1046
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,700
I don't know what to do about it.

1047
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,080
Oh, the dog humps it.

1048
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:34,760
Sure, he does.

1049
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,320
Oh.

1050
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,180
He puts his...

1051
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,260
But, uh...

1052
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,600
Well, yeah, you can bring lamps or...

1053
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,940
Ceiling fan would be nice.

1054
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,240
Do you have a ceiling fan?

1055
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:44,680
Yeah.

1056
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,840
I'm sure I'm wearing one right now.

1057
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,160
Can't you tell?

1058
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,280
It's not a real ceiling fan.

1059
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,420
Not everyone can wear that, Dave.

1060
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,660
Just bring that, then.

1061
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,260
Ceiling fan.

1062
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,140
Oh, my God.

1063
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,700
Oh, yeah.

1064
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,380
Oh, my God.

1065
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,900
Oh, my God.

1066
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:13,900
Oh.

1067
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,660
Oh.

1068
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,060
Oh.

1069
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:20,420


1070
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:20,700
Oh.

1071
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:25,360
I'm living in Arizona

1072
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:29,980
I'm living in Arizona

1073
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,960
I'm living in Arizona

1074
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,980
I'm living in Arizona

1075
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,920
I'm living in Arizona

I'm living in Arizona

I'm living in Arizona I'm living in Ashtabula

1078
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,700
Come on Bob!

1079
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,860
Come on Dad!

1080
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,900
We gotta win this face now, Bob!

1081
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,780
We gotta get in a tune again!

1082
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,740
We gotta win this face, Bob!

1083
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,220
Bye Bob!

1084
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,120

00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,440
It might be a little scary at Brushwood, I have to admit.

1093
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,220
I'm not at X-Day!

1094
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,340
Look at their breasts!

1095
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,340
Especially at X-Day!

1096
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,840
Giant witch titty!

1097
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:14,920
Oh my God!

1098
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,520
That's not a titty!

1099
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:17,760
It's a titty!

1100
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,200
I don't want to see anymore!

1101
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,060
It's a useless vessel of pain and hatred!

1102
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,280
Dr. Shemton!

1103
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,460
Sit down!

1104
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,380
Please!

1105
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,140
I don't want to see anymore!

1106
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,040
I'm sorry.

1107
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,460
I'm sorry.

1108
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:36,680
Well, you know there's not going to be any kind of wriggling around in paint on the ground.

1109
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,400
Yes there will!

1110
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,240
Oh yes.

1111
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,580
There was last time.

1112
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:46,660
We had to leave first, but there was an oobleck bathing orgy sort of.

1113
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,620
What the hell was an oobleck?

1114
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,760
That's the wriggling.

1115
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,900
The wriggling actually can happen.

1116
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:51,100
Porn starch.

1117
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,760
Oh, porn starch.

1118
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:58,300
Food colored porn starch dribbled like a big tub, a vat of it.

1119
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,820
Was this after the Elvis Prozac performance?

1120
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:01,500
Right.

1121
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,160
The guy that fell asleep in the throne?

1122
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,160
Right, and I had to take him to the hospital.

1123
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,140
That's why I missed it.

1124
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:06,940
But there's pictures from it.

1125
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,200
What was the animal bag about?

1126
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,760
I was kind of confused about it.

1127
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:10,700
Was that part of the animal?

1128
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,040
The elbow bag?

1129
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,800
Yeah, I guess they call it that now.

1130
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,860
That goes with the side vagina.

1131
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,640
The elbow bag.

1132
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:16,920
The side vagina.

1133
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,200
The elbow bag holds the elbow.

1134
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,120
Like the electronic bed.

1135
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:20,460
The penis.

1136
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,800
Watch it.

1137
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:25,300
It's like when you get the elbow penis up against the side vagina.

1138
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,560
This sort of.

1139
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,380
I'm Bill Burrows and I'd like to shoot an apple.

1140
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,740
Princess, we are dozed head.

1141
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,800
I think I'm going to have to doze.

1142
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,640
Ah, yes friends.

1143
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:46,180
Past ex days were so weird and exciting.

1144
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:51,920
As heard in the background here, this is the ex day Wotan jam.

1145
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:53,200
God.

1146
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,220
What a surprising guitar player.

1147
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,740
Somebody named Reverend Illuminatrix showed up and did that.

1148
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,940
Anyway friends, ex day, ex day.

1149
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:13,920
Whether the world ends or not, well actually I guess that does impact quite a few things.

1150
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,900
But it's still a great party.

1151
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:26,520
And you can figure out how to get there and why more on the internet from www.subgenius.com.

1152
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,680
Or you can call the toll free number 1, got that pencil ready?

1153
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:38,640
1-888-669-2323.

1154
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,220
That's a real phone number.

1155
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,900
888-669-2323.

1156
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:53,160
You can also write to the post office box that will be presented in the new Modemac post office box recording coming up.

1157
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:59,460
And meanwhile friends, here are some sounds from 4 ex day drill 2001.

1158
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:04,540
We'll be hearing Andrew the Impaled walk on broken glass.

1159
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:12,080
But first friends, the voice of Jesus himself.

1160
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:35,160
I want to thank you for watching the video.

1161
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:35,200
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you next time.

1162
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,200


1163
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,440
.

1164
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:35,440


1165
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,340
.

1166
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:41,340


1167
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,460
.

1168
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:43,460


1169
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:43,460


1170
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:43,460


1171
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:43,460


1172
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:43,460


1173
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:43,460


1174
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,140
Subgenius, don't forget to register at noon today.

1175
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,800
Why is there still time?

1176
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,600
There's a new rule for the pagans this year.

1177
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,080
We like to call them pay and pay again.

1178
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:05,600
All pagans must pay twice to get into the Subgenius Festival.

1179
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,480
Please don't feed the pagans.

1180
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,200
I like when you're walking by the pagans

1181
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,700
and they're like peeing or like jacking off,

1182
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,340
just in their cage.

1183
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,480
Just meee.

1184
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,440
Throwing their shit.

1185
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,400
Eating their own shit.

1186
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:18,920
Throwing their own.

1187
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,040
But I wanted to ask you a question.

1188
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,920
What do we all come to X-Day for?

1189
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,400
What are we here for?

1190
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,980
The naked chicks!

1191
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:28,760
Precisely.

1192
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,260
We are here to seek out and to have sex

1193
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,880
with as many other yetis as possible.

1194
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,140
I have to ask a question.

1195
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,180
What are you up to?

1196
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,120
What are you all doing here?

1197
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,780
Why aren't you people out there banging your hips together?

1198
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,800
Now come on.

1199
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,420
Why aren't you?

1200
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:51,340
Anybody?

1201
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,860
Can anyone tell me why they're standing here

1202
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,280
instead of out in the field somewhere copulating?

1203
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,840
You first!

1204
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,300
Are you inviting me?

1205
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,380
No, no. You tell us why you're not.

1206
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,560
Oh, what are you?

1207
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,400
Oh, that's a good question.

1208
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,120
Yeah, sternoposis.

1209
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:11,160
Yeah.

1210
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,080
I was just going to ask you the same question.

1211
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,320
Somebody in the audience said,

1212
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,760
well, how come you're not fornicating as if you're very life dependent on it?

1213
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,380
So now you can tell us.

1214
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,380
The reason I'm not is because I'm standing here videotaping you.

1215
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,580
Well, the fact of the matter is,

1216
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,260
as I'm standing here, I'm fornicating.

1217
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,100
You'll notice my hand is in my...

1218
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,800
Praise fucking Pastor Pressure!

1219
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,180
Praise Pastor Pressure!

1220
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,300
I am in a constant state of stimulation.

1221
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,320
Okay?

1222
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,420
And I want to know why you all...

1223
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,260
I mean, I see various genders out there.

1224
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,560
I see male, female, and everything else in between.

1225
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,280
We got hands in pockets. I mean, come on.

1226
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:54,000
I want to know why you guys talk all the time

1227
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,840
about coming out to X Day and having sex,

1228
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,420
and you're standing here listening to me.

1229
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,200
Amen!

1230
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,320
Woo!

1231
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,780
I want you to think about that for a while.

1232
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,300
It looks like Reverend Stang is getting ready to take my hand.

1233
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:09,540
I don't know if you can hear my advice.

1234
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,160
I suggest that you all pair up and do the same.

1235
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,340
Praise Bob.

1236
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,760
Praise Bob!

1237
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,500
Praise Bob!

1238
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,340
My glass is all steamed up.

1239
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,860
Easy for you to say.

1240
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,340
Can we turn to something better?

1241
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:34,040
I see last weekend, Ed Strange made the first step in building his own escape vessel.

1242
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,400
He started the first...

1243
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,100
He started gathering rocks.

1244
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,120
That's what Ed did.

1245
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,960
He starts with rocks?

1246
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,460
Yeah, he started with going and gathering rocks.

1247
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,760
Big stones.

1248
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,920
A man who gathers stones together is my kind of strange man.

1249
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,980
So that was the first step.

1250
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:55,660
Actually, I should be documenting this with photography while he does build this thing,

1251
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,920
because he's starting from nothing.

1252
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,580
Now, right now, he just has the rocks gathered for whatever reason.

1253
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,960
I have no idea how he's going to build his spaceship.

1254
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,820
Everything starts with a cross.

1255
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,080
Is he going to allow himself to use, like, stones?

1256
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,620
Or does he have to barter with the Amish?

1257
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,460
He'll do whatever it takes.

1258
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,640
Andrew the Impaled, walk on broken glass.

1259
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:19,300
Uh...

1260
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,280
Dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba...

1261
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,460
First of all, you!

1262
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,800
Give me a number between one and four, now!

1263
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:26,520
Three.

1264
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,240
Three!

1265
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,000
You bastard.

1266
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,280
You people, watch your eyes.

1267
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:29,640
Move back.

1268
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,380
Cover up your eyes.

1269
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,080
Cover up your eyes.

1270
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,280
Watch out there.

1271
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,340
The magic number from the cruel bastard in the second row is three.

1272
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,120
Shut up and count with me.

1273
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,540
One.

1274
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,480
That's before me, not with me.

1275
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,500
Thank you, product of the American Education Society.

1276
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,480
Shut up!

1277
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,360
Four.

1278
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:56,920
Two.

1279
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:58,920
Three.

1280
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,120
Hold your applause. Hold your applause. Hold your applause.

1281
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,300
For we are not done yet. We are not done yet by far.

1282
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,960
Because, first of all, we have to see that we're successful.

1283
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:17,380
Success is, of course, determined by whether or not I'm losing most of my blood out of the bottom of my feet.

1284
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,560
I mean, any asshole can jump up and down a bunch of broken glass, if you think about it, really.

1285
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,400
It's a matter of surviving it.

1286
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,200
Anyway, brave guy, how are we doing?

1287
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,100
Am I bleeding on that foot?

1288
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,060
I'm bleeding on that foot, sir.

1289
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:32,460
That's right.

1290
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,040
There's no pain in the world.

1291
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,220
Shut up. We're not done yet.

1292
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,900
I've been doing this for a long time now.

1293
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,060
It doesn't quite get me up.

1294
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,840
I need to step it up a little bit so I get the same appreciation that you people do.

1295
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,660
And I know who you people are.

1296
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:56,160
You're the people that go to the football game to see the guy's knee get bent way back the wrong way over some other guy's face.

1297
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:04,180
You're the people that go to hockey fight after hockey fight and boxing game after boxing game just to see a little bit of blood.

1298
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,840
You're the people that go to the racetrack to see the car slam.

1299
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,600
You're the people that go to the wall and its transmission fly up into the waiting arms of the hot dog vendor.

1300
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:20,640
You people are sick bastards and I appreciate it greatly because you are my bread and butter.

1301
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,500
Oh, yes!

1302
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,240
Once again, no explanation is really necessary.

1303
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,560
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1304
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,860
Andrew the Impaled.

1305
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,540
Walk on.

1306
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,560
On broken glass.

1307
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,820
What else is going on?

1308
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,200
Life and Earth Science.

1309
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,960
The Death Fest 2002 is happening.

1310
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,480
Look at these great band logos.

1311
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:52,460
Putrid.

1312
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,540
Disgusting.

1313
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,760
Corpse mutilated.

1314
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:55,740
With Mark.

1315
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,240
Ardvush.

1316
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:56,740
Lignant.

1317
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,600
Skanky Arabica hole.

1318
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,200
Penis carnage.

1319
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,300
I love that band.

1320
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:02,960
Hemmed.

1321
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,360
Skinless scrotum.

1322
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,840
Skinless scrotum?

1323
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:06,720
Yeah.

1324
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,480
They're my favorite.

1325
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,200
Misery.

1326
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,880
Morticians disembowelment's gonna be there, dude.

1327
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,160
I got it set for you.

1328
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:16,500
Fleshbrite.

1329
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:17,780
Sinister flesh hole.

1330
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,900
Get your next thing cued up there.

1331
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,520
We're all ready to roll here.

1332
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:24,820
We're all ready to rock and roll out of here, boys and girls.

1333
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,220
Rotting Bob will be there, dude.

1334
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,280
Rotting Bob.

1335
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,460
It's time now, my friend.

1336
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,700
The Misery Man.

1337
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,360
Till next week.

1338
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,800
Put your hands up in the air.

1339
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,200
That's right.

1340
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,680
Keep your hat on tight.

1341
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:35,920
Keep your hat on tight.

1342
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,260
You're back to the wind.

1343
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,520
And you're sack in the saddle.

1344
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,340
Yeah.

1345
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:58,240
The number you have reached.

1346
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:59,680
P.O. Box.

1347
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:04,400
1-4-0-3-0-6.

1348
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,760
Has been changed.

1349
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,280
The new number is.

1350
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,460
P.O. Box.

1351
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,000
2-0-4-2-0-6.

1352
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,320
Austin, Texas.

1353
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:20,000
7-8-7-2-0.

1354
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,660
Please make a note of it.

1355
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,920
They need to munch us together, hunch us together.

1356
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,220
Yeah.

1357
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,260
Bring the big bags of money up to the main pavilion.

1358
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,360
You're gonna have to send someone to carry them.

1359
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,780
We're gonna need about three people.

1360
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,600
Look at these space people trying to tell them where to go.

1361
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,800
They're gonna run right into that stage.

1362
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:46,220
Man, I'm just glad that I moved to Jesus and staying in Drummond.

1363
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,540
I feel like Elvis.

1364
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,480
You feel like Elvis?

1365
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:52,080
Yeah.

1366
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,340
Makes me feel like Elvis.

1367
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,400
You feel like Elvis, you chauffeur.

1368
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:58,140
I always feel, whenever I hang around with staying in Drummond, I feel like Elvis, too.

1369
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,200
You should feel like Elvis every night.

1370
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,760
You should feel like Elvis every night.

1371
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,280
You should feel like Elvis every night.

1372
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,840
You should feel like he isn't right.

1373
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:29,840


1374
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:29,840


1375
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:29,860
You said in a nice way.

1376
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:29,860


1377
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:29,860


1378
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:29,860


1379
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,060
So I did this journey so that I could achieve a higher level of success.

1380
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,440
What Galbraith..

1381
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:32,440


1382
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:32,440


1383
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,840
Thank you.

1384
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,120
Thank you.

1385
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,340
Thank you.

1386
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:20,800
Thank you.

1387
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:51,620
Thank you.

1388
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,880
Thank you.

1389
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:40,520
Thank you.

1390
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,480
Thank you.

1391
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,620
Thank you.

1392
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,960
Thank you.

1393
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,640
Thank you.

1394
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,560
Thank you.

1395
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:31,740
Thank you.

1396
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,960
Oh, this is your room.

1397
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:40,900
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

1398
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:45,260
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

1399
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,960
You think that's air you're breathing?

1400
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,860
So you're here to save the world.

1401
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,360
I know you're out there.

1402
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,260
I can feel you now.

1403
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:57,580
I know that you're afraid.

1404
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,560
You're afraid of us.

1405
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,520
You're afraid of change.

1406
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:04,460
I don't know the future.

1407
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,520
I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end.

1408
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:10,860
I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.

1409
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,260
I'm going to hang up this phone.

1410
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,380
And then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.

1411
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,000
I'm going to show them a world without you.

1412
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,200
A world without rules and controls.

1413
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,620
Without borders or boundaries.

1414
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:28,100
A world where anything is possible.

1415
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,500
Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.

1416
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,160
A world where everything is possible.

1417
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,020
A world where everything is possible.

1418
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,780
A world where everything is possible.
