1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Hello, hello, how are you?

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,120
One minute.

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,100
Hello, hello, my mom's one-on-one utilities.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,380
Hello, hello, likely from a toxic force of the ball.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,240
Hello, hello, thank you.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,480
Teaching a parakeet to talk is fun,

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,880
but the old method took too much time and patience.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,020
This record is specially designed to teach any healthy, normal parakeet to talk

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,340
by using...

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,840
The subgenius power of...

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:42,860
And now we behold the miracle of Bob Park.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,920
Once the headquarters of the Knight's Topler,

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,680
where the people of London gather again to praise Bob,

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,280
or merely enjoy the perversions of Bob,

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,040
standing upright completely bowed out.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,380
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,820
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,020
Wally?

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,280
Yeah?

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,920
Coursing around with girls.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,620
Girls?

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,360
Well, sure.

23
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,000
They start foaming at the mouth.

24
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,460
Boy, that sounds neat.

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,040
Uh-huh.

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,640
What's up?

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,160
Hey, look!

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,920
The subgenius power of...

29
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,420
Yeah.

30
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,600
I say it's great.

31
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,860
Supposed to be the biggest in the whole world.

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,620
First it starts real slow.

33
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,020
Yeah.

34
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,460
Then it goes faster and faster.

35
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,840
And everybody starts yelling and screaming.

36
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,640
Supposed to scare the socks off you.

37
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,980
And they even got this guy in a white coat standing around in case anybody faints.

38
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,460
It sounds pretty neat, all right.

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,560
Well, see ya.

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,080
Okay, bye.

41
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,180
So long, fellas.

42
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,400
What's the matter with me?

43
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,380
I'll tell you what's wrong with you.

44
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,860
Dad cut off his knees.

45
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,340
He was sick for three days.

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:46,820
Uh-huh.

47
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,020
Yeah.

48
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,640
Don't tell me something like that.

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,700
I just had supper.

50
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,460
Praise Bob!

51
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,160
Bob!

52
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:52,680
Bob's...

53
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,400
Name!

54
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,220
I know.

55
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:55,700
Well,

56
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,000
You know.

57
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,300
I know.

58
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,980
Yeah!

59
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,680
You know.

60
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,100
I know.

61
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,760
Well, don't you know?

62
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,160
I know.

63
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,040
Why, that'd be like, you know.

64
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,440
I know.

65
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,120
I know.

66
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,420
I know.

67
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,300
I know.

68
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,300


69
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,720
I don't know why the wind blows.

70
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't know why the wind blows.

71
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,260
I don't know.

72
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,260


73
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,260


74
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:40,480
Really, you know, you can't explain the sea, I only know that something's wrong and current

75
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,480


76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,800
And I wonder what it can be.

77
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:55,860
So, here in my heart, I'm waiting for my little rosemary...

78
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:55,980
And you'll end up running a flavored...

79
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980


80
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980


81
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980


82
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980


83
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980


84
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980


85
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980


86
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980


87
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980

00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980

00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980

00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980


93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,720
And as I wonder where you are

94
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,900
I'm blue as I can be

95
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,220
Someone's knocking on my door

96
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,380
I hear a voice call my name

97
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,620
Your girl has just been run over

98
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:42,280
By a great big steamroller

99
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,920
To this I reply

100
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,980
With tears in my eyes

101
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,640
I'm taking a shower now

102
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,240
Just slide her under the door

Stangville in Texas, in Stang County.

And he's

164
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,220
the unspoken mayor of Stangville

165
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,620
actually.

166
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,820
I heard from those speed

167
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,020
He preaches that the

168
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,800
Methodist Church

169
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,960
the most ludicrous

170
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,720
and horrendous parts of the Bible

171
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,000
and then starts asking people whether

172
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,780
they really, you know, how do they know

173
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,040
there really was a Jesus?

174
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,100
What a horrible man

175
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,520
to break through some lady's heart.

176
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,740
Well, you know, the funny thing is

177
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,920
they keep coming back

178
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,820
for more. Oh, Captain Stang

179
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,260
you know more about this?

180
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,820
She goes, no, well, Captain

181
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,700
Stang, you know more about the Bible than

182
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,160
any of our regular preachers

183
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,900
and what you have to say is just so

184
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,000
it has me thinking. It really gets

185
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,720
me to thinking sometimes and you know

186
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,660
it actually makes my faith stronger.

187
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,140
Unfortunately, that's the problem, Stang.

188
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,660
You have seeded all these women.

189
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,480
You're making people's faces stronger

190
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,740
by seeding them.

191
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,400
I've always wanted to spunk in the face

192
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,620
of

193
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:17,720
you.

194
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,540
Of trouble,

195
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,700
shall we say, in the form

196
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,900
of a red-headed Mormon

197
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,660
babe who is in for

198
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,540
it if we ever get our hands

199
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,600
on her. Part Indian and part

200
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
refugee. I'm sorry, it's this

201
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,380
Devo, it's the unreleased Devo music

202
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,440
in the background that had made me say that.

203
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,640
When the way you said, I don't

204
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,420
know your attitude, the way you say unreleased,

205
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,740
it sounds like it's a bowel movement or something, right?

206
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,580
Is that what you got out? Yeah.

207
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,700
Unreleased. You have to

208
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,620
Did I say that? No, you have to say it more like

209
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,360
yet to be released. I don't know.

210
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,180
Well, if I didn't say that and pick up on it, dude.

211
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,020
Okay.

212
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,580
Dave, I have some American

213
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,620
Indian related music that I think you're

214
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,880
going to love to just hear.

215
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,500
One is a song called Octopus

216
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,520
Woman by Dick

217
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,140
Kent, which

218
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,340
has me puzzled because I can't think which

219
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,460
tribe was dealing with octopi.

220
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,640
But you'll see what I

221
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,360
mean when you hear the song, and that's followed by

222
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,740
a rendition of a song about Mighty Mouse

223
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,420
by the Black Lodge

224
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,380
Singers. Get out of here.

225
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,420
The Black Lodge Singers do a thing

226
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,200
by Mighty Mouse? No, we've

227
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,240
played Mighty Mouse on this show.

228
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,680
That's what you told me, Dave.

229
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,040
No, this one is Mickey

230
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,280
Mouse, but first we have to listen to

231
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,200
a commercial. Do you push the caffeine drink

232
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,300
alarm in the morning? Do you drink more than

233
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,980
one caffeine drink during the day?

234
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,160
Do you feel like you need a caffeine drink

235
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,180
in the daytime? It's because you're

236
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,800
tossing an old-fashioned Swedish

237
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,180
soft yet supportive gravity defying

238
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,400
weightless certified amazing caffeine.

239
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,300
drink developed by NASA at night.

240
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,460
You deserve a good

241
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,360
caffeine drink, and that's just what you'll

242
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,760
get with the good caffeine system.

243
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,320
And now I don't sleep at all.

244
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,320
You'll never get the good

245
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,380
night's sleep. I can wake him up or

246
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,340
disturb him. Try that with a metal

247
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,420
spring. Look how the caffeine drink doesn't

248
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,220
tip over as Kelly moves billions of

249
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,400
uncomfortable metal springs.

250
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,320
So call now, and we'll rush

251
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,000
you this free sample of the amazing

252
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,100
unheard-of 20-year limited warranty.

253
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,120
Free. So call

254
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,900
13013 now.

255
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,740
So call 13013

256
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,340
now. That's 13013.

257
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,280
Bob.

258
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,100
Okay, here's

259
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,320
Octopus Woman by

260
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,800
Dick Kent.

261
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,420
What happened

262
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,640
at Fort Bragg

263
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,780
on the beach

264
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,760
of the sea?

265
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,040
An octopus

266
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,700
woman

267
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,280
reached out and grabbed

268
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,500
for me.

269
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,640
Octopus

270
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,380
woman, please let

271
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,540
me go. Octopus

272
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,300
woman,

273
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:03,760
please

274
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,140
let me go.

275
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,560
The

276
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,200
octopus

277
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,340
woman

278
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,260
lives out in

279
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,020
the sea.

280
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,020
She found her

281
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,240
a darling.

282
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,120
The day

283
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,680
she captured me.

284
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,420
Octopus

285
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,720
woman, please

286
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,940
let me go.

287
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,480
Octopus woman,

288
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,060
please

289
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,860
let me go.

290
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,880
It's very pretty music.

291
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,060
Octopus woman.

292
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,240
I should not have gone fishing.

293
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,340
So he could be maybe...

294
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,700
Down by that old Fort Bragg.

295
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,560
Fort Bragg on the ocean.

296
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,260
Fort Bragg? Well, Fort Bragg is on the ocean, isn't it?

297
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,320
No, Campo G.

298
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,240
Where's Fort Bragg?

299
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,180
That's not in Oklahoma.

300
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,880
He said that green-eyed octopus hag, and yet

301
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,940
he had her.

302
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,900
This isn't a bland prairie squid.

303
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,900
This is a half-woman, half-octopus

304
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,020
Lovecraftian thing.

305
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,360
Lovecraftian.

306
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,000
That's what it is. It's kind of like

307
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,840
the Shadow over Innsmouth.

308
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,240
The trot Fort Bragg.

309
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,000
Near Innsmouth,

310
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,620
Massachusetts, where...

311
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,500
Octopus's

312
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,260
children.

313
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,420
The octopus hunt

314
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,580
was quite a...

315
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,380
Quite a thing. Thousands of people

316
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,680
competing for various...

317
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,540
Was it a film of prairie squid?

318
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,200
She just had five more octopus

319
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,340
children. She's had hundreds.

320
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,980
She's had thousands.

321
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,580
She's like the goat with a thousand titties.

322
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,940
Yeah.

323
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,560
And orange.

324
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,520
That's a real goat, right?

325
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,440
Orange.

326
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,620
Dick can't...

327
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,120
I think he's speaking metaphorically of perhaps

328
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
white culture or European culture

329
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,540
if he's a VV corporate state.

330
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,220
Oh, man. Can't you believe in magic, dude?

331
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,300
Okay, well, okay. He's having a nightmare.

332
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,260
And the beauty of the octopus people.

333
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,200
Oh, phew.

334
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,960
As you say, the beautiful bureaucracy.

335
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,720
The mer-octomites.

336
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,720
Okay, here, listen to this.

337
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,320
The famous bird of death!

338
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,060
Yeah!

339
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,020
They are always

340
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,700
fantastic!

341
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:45,740
They are always fantastic!

342
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,380
They are all movie stars

343
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,580
at Disneyland!

344
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,580
Yeah!

345
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,320
Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse,

346
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,280
Pluto 2!

347
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,240
Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse,

348
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,400
Pluto 2!

349
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:58,940


350
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,440
They are always fantastic!

351
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,680
Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse,

352
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,820
and Pluto 2.

353
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,560
They're all movie stars

354
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,220
at Disneyland.

355
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,740
I think that might be perhaps

356
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,840
the Sistine Chapel to me.

357
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,200
This...

358
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,560
Hello?

359
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,600
Well-ha.

360
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,400
You know, I mean, jeez.

361
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,000
How else could you say it now?

362
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,760
I'm certainly not going to say,

363
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,920
here I come to send you

364
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,900
without, you know,

365
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,920
some zoom!

366
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,880
Right.

367
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,040
I mean, I wouldn't.

368
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,520
At least if I wasn't, you know,

369
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,680
throwing my own feathers.

370
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,680
Dave, are you sick?

371
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,440
I'm sick of life.

372
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,660
I'm sick of this

373
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,620
rare earth that we're forced

374
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,580
to tread daily.

375
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,400
I'm sick of the smell

376
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,440
of my own uterus

377
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,060
as I stumble blindly

378
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,280
from one garbage tiller.

379
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,320
Oh, my God.

380
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,320


381
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,760
into another, barking at the chickens

382
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,660
and making noises and causing...

383
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,300
Turtles!

384
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,040
See, they can keep...

385
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,160
That is shocking.

386
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,040
Eyes out, open.

387
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,500
That is absolutely shocking.

388
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,120
See, I heard the time he had taken a cigarette

389
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,760
and put it in his mouth and then, like,

390
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,460
pulled on his finger and then the other finger

391
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,240
and then the cigarette.

392
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,920
And then the mouth exploded?

393
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,260
Or the cigarette?

394
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,420
I don't know.

395
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,400
Well, how could you not know?

396
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,380
You said you were there.

397
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,160
I don't know.

398
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,160
You said you were there.

399
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,020
You must have seen what happened.

400
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,160
I was just only listening.

401
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,180
I didn't really see.

402
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,120
The last time somebody smoked Bob Fingers

403
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,800
while he was trying to pull his pipe,

404
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,720
they exploded in his own head.

405
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
There was no problem after that.

406
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,520
They cleaned it up pretty good.

407
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,640
Bob was dead.

408
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,900
For a while, as he was trapped

409
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,440
wrapped in...

410
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,560
Plastic.

411
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,240
For a while, as usual.

412
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:57,840
The muslin shrouded body of Bob J.R., J.R., J.J., J.R., J.R., J.R., Bob Dobbs

413
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,940
spring bought here to the muslistic orientum.

414
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,360
There's thousands of people out there.

415
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:02,680
Why?

416
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,680
None of them want to see this miscreants.

417
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,620
They are crying because apparently they've been overcharged for parking.

418
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,320
Now some of them are holding signs saying,

419
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,400
Bring Bob back.

420
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:14,820
Why?

421
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,500
The three B's of occult ritualism.

422
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,620
I want to scratch his back.

423
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,500
Some of them wanting to perforce his organs

424
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,880
or perhaps move into other realms of his body.

425
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,200
The orifices have been sealed shut by the Monsignor himself

426
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,780
under a three-year plan also agreed to by the United Snakes of...

427
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,580
I'm sorry, the United Nations Secretary himself.

428
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,860
I'll take a message.

429
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,380
I'll take this, please.

430
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,740
It's been a tough delay, but some of the toughest stay.

431
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,180
Who killed Bob?

432
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,540
Bob.

433
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,360
Who killed him?

434
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,620
It is what we must find out.

435
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,620
And those responsible for Bob's death must be brought to justice.

436
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,320
Yes, bring them to justice.

437
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,460
We all loved Bob.

438
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,760
Everyone in town loved Bob.

439
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,100
There wasn't a kid in town...

440
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,400
The little woodchopper woman to the big quilting man.

441
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,840
What was there not to love?

442
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,940
I think it doesn't stink because of him.

443
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
It's not my...

444
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,480
It's not my problems.

445
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,200
He's...

446
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,520
He's created all of mine.

447
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,680
Someday he'll come back.

448
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,280
It was our barber, our bloodletter, our leecher, and our salesman.

449
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,100
A feces slinger.

450
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,900
And what a barbecue ape.

451
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,700
Oh, what a feces slinger.

452
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,920
What a man, woman, anything.

453
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,540
I wanted...

454
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,200
But...

455
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,420
But...

456
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,240
Look, he's back.

457
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,900
Now...

458
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,940
Now we must kill him.

459
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,940
Yes, kill Bob.

460
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,700
All right.

461
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,260
I'm Prettier, I just killed Bob.

462
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,620
We've got these guys.

463
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:54,640
Yep.

464
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,200
I'm Pet me, that was lucky.

465
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,200


466
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,300
Broke the head on us, died from the 같은 on.

467
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,300


468
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,300
We had all kinds of ineffable suspense trap through the whole�

469
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:07,340
The one who's prepared books...

470
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:07,340


471
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:07,340


472
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:07,560
oppne blah stuff.

473
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,600
Uhh!

474
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,460
I did it.

475
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,020
You were covering tape with me before.

476
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,360
No.

477
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:22,720
Tennessee. I know it's a Texas, probably Tennessee. This is Fool Me Once. Shame on you. Shame on you.

478
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,720
It's Fool Me, Can't Get Fooled Again.

479
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:47,460
Fool Me, Can't Get Fooled Again. Shame on, Shame on, Shame on, Shame on. Fool Me What? Armageddon!

480
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,940
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.

481
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,820
Fool me once, I'm a ganker.

482
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,280
Fool me, can't just fool again.

483
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,960
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.

484
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,100
But I was only trying to retrieve the gerbil.

485
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,040
So you look here now.

486
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:11,960
Now.

487
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,800
Got the rippy rhyme being blow.

488
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,660
Being blow.

489
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,160
Get the line straight, man.

490
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,060
Dapper, man.

491
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,580
You're dapper like peanut butter on the pan.

492
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,700
Yeah, man, that shit is good.

493
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,340
Come on, W.

494
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,360
Get the line straight.

495
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,080
You're disgracing my home state.

496
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,500
Shame on you.

497
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,780
Cut out, Hank.

498
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,500
In Nashville, the president tried to keep up the pressure.

499
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,660
Shame on you.

500
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,820
Ready?

501
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,660
In Nashville, the president tried to keep up the pressure.

502
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,920
He ain't doing a fucking thing.

503
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,680
It's just shame on you.

504
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,600
In Nashville, the president tried to keep up the pressure.

505
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,780
Shame on you.

506
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,580
Now, this is Dean Martin.

507
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,880
Fool me, we can't get fooled again.

508
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,340
And Jerry Lewis with him.

509
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,040
We will save the world, you cunt.

510
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:07,640
Fucker.

511
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,120
I pushed a cardboard cube.

512
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,420
His rectum had slipped.

513
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,580
The ragged, our durable end, he explained.

514
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,280
As usual, Kinky shouted out, Armageddon!

515
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,620
My cue.

516
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,460
He didn't have enough.

517
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,280
In Nashville, the president tried to retrieve Raggett, but he wouldn't come out again.

518
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,860
So I peered into the tube and struck a match, thinking the light might attract him.

519
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,800
Shame on you.

520
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:52,500
At a hushed press conference, a hospital spokesman described what happened next.

521
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,140
There's an old...

522
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,300
...saying in Tennessee.

523
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,040
I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee.

524
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,200
This says, fool me once.

525
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,180
Igniting Mr. Tomaszewski's hair and severely f***ing his face.

526
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:03,940
Shame on you.

527
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,740
It also set fire to the gerbil's fur and whiskers, which in turn ignited a larger bucket of gas.

528
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:10,880
Yeah!

529
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:11,780
Yeah!

530
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,300
Hey!

531
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,620
Hey!

532
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,400
Hey!

533
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:19,420


534
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:20,240


535
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,020
Hey!

536
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,200
Hey!

537
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,560
Ow!

538
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,520
Ow!

539
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,500
Ow!

540
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:23,840
Ow!

541
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,080
Ow!

542
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,180
Ow!

543
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,180


544
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,300
Ow!

545
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:24,380


546
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:24,620
Ow!

547
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,460
Ow!

548
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:26,880
Ow!

549
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:26,880


550
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:26,880


551
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,240
Hey!

552
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,140
Ow!

553
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,360
Ow!

554
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,660
Ow!

555
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,680
Ow!

556
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,260
Ow!

557
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,240
Ow!

558
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,880
Ow!

559
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,820
Ow!

560
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,760
Ow!

561
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,120
Ow!

562
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,600
Ow!

563
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:37,620
Ow!

564
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:37,900
Ow!

565
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,060
Ow!

566
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,140
Ow!

567
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,140


568
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,160
Ow!

569
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,160


570
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,160


571
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:45,400
If you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're, if you're.

572
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:45,920


573
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,480
If you're, if you're, if you're, if you're.

574
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,220
If you're, if you're, if you're.

575
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,880
If you're, if you're, if you're.

576
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,400
If you're.

577
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,900
Fool me, we can't get fooled again.

578
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,040
See how it is?

579
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,580
That's the line of the show right here.

580
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,780
Don't make a shit.

581
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,860
That was the ornamental thing.

582
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:25,040
The Work Shoppe Radiophonic is the name of the group that did that fool me once thing.

583
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,600
Work Shoppe.

584
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,460
Spelled W-O-R-K-E.

585
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,140
Shoppe.

586
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,060
S-H-O-P-P-E.

587
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,420
Radiophonics.

588
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,660
Phonic.

589
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,040
Phonic with a K.

590
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,340
That was a lovely, simply lovely piece.

591
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,640
I enjoyed the voting.

592
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,740
What is this horrible thing?

593
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,320
George.

594
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:53,980
Backforce image against the contrast with the sitcom audience.

595
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,960
I loved it.

596
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:56,600
Oops.

597
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,960
Me too.

598
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,220
It was a beautiful exercise in futility.

599
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,820
I remember I think it was 1997.

600
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,240
We took all the victims down to the river before we drowned them.

601
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,640
And we made each one of them pray to Jesus.

602
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,160
We laughed until our shoes filled up.

603
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,620
Then we went back and counted our money.

604
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,360
And counted yours. Remember that?

605
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,120
Oh, yes.

606
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,100
Yes, you had the...

607
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,660
What's it?

608
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,660
What kind of damn money did you have?

609
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,580
I can't remember.

610
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,380
It was red and had funny queens on it and things.

611
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,420
And people with elephants and strange eyes.

612
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,940
I remember it so much better.

613
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,640
Yes, but it was beautiful money.

614
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,440
Then we drowned all the...

615
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,420
We drowned all the victims.

616
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,640
And went back and had a sandwich.

617
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,420
Remember that?

618
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,480
Yes, right along with the meals.

619
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:46,840
Yes.

620
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,220
I remember.

621
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,960
It's great running this planet.

622
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,840
I enjoy the making the money as we can count

623
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,760
and taking the victims down to the river.

624
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,520
That doesn't solve my prostate problem, so...

625
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,560
I've noticed that.

626
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,120
It's the size of a 400-pound watermelon now.

627
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,500
Do they make you drink that stuff for yours?

628
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,900
I have to carry it in a small cabin device

629
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,320
that has a little motor on the side.

630
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,020
And I can make it go low,

631
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,220
low,

632
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:16,930
high,

633
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,010
or in between,

634
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,450
which is the speed I choose.

635
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,810
Yes, in between is best.

636
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,170
But it doesn't help drowning the victims

637
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,270
or counting the money.

638
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:25,510
No.

639
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,490
No.

640
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,170
No.

641
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:32,890
Loving the feeling of submission to me.

642
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:37,470
Loving the feeling of submission to me.

643
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:37,710
Loving the feeling of submission to me.

644
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:42,650
Loving the feeling of submission to me.

645
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,490
Loving the feeling of submission to me.

646
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:44,490


647
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:44,490


648
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,590
The state is your third nostril.

649
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,570
Not some image of the past or future.

650
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,430
The state.

651
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,530
The state.

652
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:58,090
The state is your third nostril.

653
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,830
Can you smell it yet?

654
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,090
I'm loving the feeling.

655
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,290
I smell so obedient.

656
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,630
I love it.

657
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,010
I love the smell.

658
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,570
I feel like I could do anything I am was told.

659
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,790
I feel like I could do anything I am was told.

660
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,290
Tell me something.

661
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,210
Make me do something.

662
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:26,210
You can do anything that you want as of this moment.

663
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,150
Old lady and old man, yes.

664
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:35,150
Because you have entered the church of the subgenius.

665
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,710
I'm not going to put them on, mister.

666
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,830
Get back.

667
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,610
Come one, come all.

668
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,410
Come on in.

669
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,490
You too.

670
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,890
You can be like the freaks.

671
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,050
Look at the freaks.

672
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,630
Look at their insane eyes.

673
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:56,750
Hear the insane things they have to say to you.

674
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:01,430
Here at the church of the subgenius.

675
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:07,470
The zealous shall not be permitted past level four.

676
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,250
The overzealous shall not be allowed to play with the commode.

677
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:20,050
And those who have passed level five will be forced to evacuate the body.

678
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,110
Where's the evacuation chamber?

679
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,350
I think it's down there.

680
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,250
We just lost two people when we came here.

681
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,010
And they said they want to see it.

682
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,210
There's a long line.

683
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,190
I'm not going there, but that's where it is.

684
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,370
There's a long line there.

685
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,210
Nobody will vacate the evacuation chambers, man.

686
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,690
You get lost in that line.

687
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,170
We're all on evacuation.

688
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:42,770
Vacation.

689
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,970
I keep walking this way for a year.

690
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,390
Who can help us?

691
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:54,730
Who can help us to find the place, the final place where we can let loose, where we can achieve achievingness?

692
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:01,710
Your movements, your eye movements, your body's relaxation continues.

693
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,290
Just hold it up and down.

694
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,090
Was that for that potato?

695
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,430
Was that for that potato?

696
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,510
No.

697
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,070
What?

698
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,510
I thought he was here.

699
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,650
I thought he was here.

700
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:22,850
You know, this Marshall music reminds me of the days way, way back when.

701
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,510
Notice this tooling scar?

702
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:27,170
I got this from that chair pop.

703
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,370
Oh my God.

704
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,130
Look what he did to me.

705
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:30,730
Disgusting.

706
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:38,130
We were both students together at and went to the right cellar and smoked.

707
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,050
And then he said it to me.

708
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,210
What's your name about my mother?

709
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:47,090
She was short of lip and long on tooth and I laughed and then he kicked me in the groin.

710
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,410
And so we do it.

711
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,410
He won.

712
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,690
Well, you know, boys will be boys.

713
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:55,770
Yes, they will.

714
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,310
But what about, what about becoming men and stopping this?

715
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,930
It's gone on too long.

716
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,030
Well, I know.

717
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,810
It rips daily.

718
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,310
Look, it's still oozing now.

719
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,790
I hate bubs.

720
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,550
Bubs will be bubs.

721
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,030
What?

722
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,030


723
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,030


724
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,030


725
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,030


726
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,030


727
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,030


728
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,030


729
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,030


730
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,030


731
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,030


732
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,030
And bubs will be bubs.

733
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,830
Praise Bob.

734
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,110
Praise Bob.

735
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,710
One person blowing himself and smacking his head.

736
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:28,290
If only, if only Bob would truly return.

737
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:28,610
What?

738
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,670
Oh no.

739
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,830
It's a, wait, wait, you guys, the president's coming.

740
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,730
Cool it, cool it, man.

741
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,450
It's Rick, it's President Stang.

742
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,090
President Stang is coming.

743
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,890
Oh my God.

744
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:39,390
Shh, shh, shh.

745
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:39,930
Oh my God.

746
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:39,990
Oh my God.

747
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:39,990


748
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:39,990


749
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:39,990


750
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:39,990


751
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:39,990


752
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:39,990


753
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:39,990


754
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:39,990


755
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:39,990


756
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:39,990


757
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:39,990


758
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:39,990


759
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,350
Oh man.

760
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,530
I'm so nervous.

761
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,350
God, that guy's ugly.

762
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,530
I wonder what he looks like underneath that microphone.

763
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,790
Oh man, you can smell him walking by.

764
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:46,350
Just keep, keep.

765
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,090
He's sweating.

766
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,910
Don't, don't look.

767
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,210
Oh man.

768
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,530
What is that?

769
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,830
It, it smells like there's a decaying turkey.

770
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,430
Is that a woman with him?

771
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,890
No, that's, yes.

772
00:38:58,090 --> 00:38:58,370
Yeah.

773
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:58,650
Yeah.

774
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:59,850
Look, no, no, don't look.

775
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,790
Keep your eyes down on the ground.

776
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,390
Keep, keep looking at your shoes, man.

777
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,290
He's looking at me now.

778
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,370
He's like, oh my God.

779
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:06,570
Shh.

780
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,550
Yes, my children.

781
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,010
I'm sorry.

782
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:10,010


783
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:10,010


784
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:18,510
You have gathered unto me and I shall lead you to the new way, the way of the new Bob

785
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,850
who speaks only through me.

786
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:28,010
Yes, from now on in the Church of the Subgenius you may only achieve achievingness and slackdomness

787
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:31,270
by hiding from that J.R.

788
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:36,570
Bob Dobbs and sending all your money to me, the new Dobbs, Reverend Ivan Stang.

789
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,010
Forget the, that old talk, that slackdom.

790
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,030
But you got to get this done.

791
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,890
That's silly.

792
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,570
Silly superstition.

793
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,130
I'll try.

794
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,410
You must put your nose to the grindstone now, my children.

795
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:47,770
I got to get my shoes on.

796
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,150
I got to get my shoes on.

797
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,030
Relent.

798
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,330
Daddy, watch this.

799
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,050
Secret, I got to go.

800
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,390
Stop slacking off and get a second job.

801
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:56,870
Yes.

802
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,270
That's the new Church policy.

803
00:39:59,450 --> 00:39:59,950
What is it?

804
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,670
Is there some sort of dissidence?

805
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,170
Why, we're happy to hear.

806
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,190
Are there, pardon me, kids.

807
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,650
Was I hearing some sort of a dissidence?

808
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:14,250
We certainly would love to hear from any, anyone who seems to have a critique of the

809
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,250
new regime.

810
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,370
No, no, no.

811
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,830
No, no, no.

812
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,650
Paying attention, sir.

813
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,810
The new election of the subgenius.

814
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,050
I didn't do it.

815
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:21,970
Yes, I think we'll call it that.

816
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,730
We'll change the name of the whole organization.

817
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:24,730
It was silly before.

818
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,590
No one likes religious crap.

819
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,590
We like what you want.

820
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,650
And no one cared about Bob.

821
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,670
He was old fashioned.

822
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,650
We need a cool new savior.

823
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,550
Like me, yes.

824
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,170
That would do.

825
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:34,790
Yes, sir.

826
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,230
Yes, sir.

827
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,230
That would be, that would be.

828
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,930
Reverend Darth Stang.

829
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,470
That would be beautiful.

830
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:38,630
That would be beautiful.

831
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:38,630


832
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:45,010
I am the future king of all the subgeniuses and owner of all the copyrights and gender's

833
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,650
wills to trademarks.

834
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,030
As onerous as anyone has ever been.

835
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,930
Yes, I shall own slack.

836
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:56,010
I shall own the very slack itself of every individual subgenius.

837
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,910
I will define slack for them.

838
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,090
Bob, that fool, he didn't know how to make money.

839
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:07,510
Salesman of the gods with kind of a pathetic, pitiful idiot.

840
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,630
Did he take me for a fool?

841
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:08,630


842
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,550
A subgenius?

843
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:15,010
Nay, for I, Reverend Stang, am the first subgenius.

844
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:16,010
Genius!

845
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:24,030
No one can ever stop me now.

846
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,030
You die.

847
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,830
Guards, seize him.

848
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:30,890
Ow.

849
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:31,490
Ow.

850
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,490
Oh, Christ.

851
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:33,650
What is happening?

852
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,630
I'm beating a big guard.

853
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,450
That is good.

854
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,610
My guards are beating this silly old man.

855
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,610


856
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,610


857
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,610


858
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,610


859
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,610


860
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,610


861
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,610


862
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,610


863
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,610


864
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,610


865
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,610


866
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:38,610


867
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:43,310
And they're making shoes out of meat and pants and hats and hair chests.

868
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,570
Wait, wait, what's going on?

869
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,370
The old man, he's casting off his rotten clothes and his bad smell.

870
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,410
He's standing up straight.

871
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,430
A pipe has sprung out of his mouth.

872
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,310
Why, that's not so simple, old man.

873
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,770
But J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

874
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:56,890
Oh, my God.

875
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,290
He has come to take revenge.

876
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:02,870
Revenge against I who would usurp his great church.

877
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:03,890
Oh, no, Bob.

878
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:04,930
No, Bob, no, please.

879
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,190
They're biting the arm, Bob.

880
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,330
No, Bob, please.

881
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,190
No, Bob.

882
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,610
No, Bob, please.

883
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:15,650
I'm sorry.

884
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:16,330
I'm sorry.

885
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,090
I was just kidding.

886
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,270
It was on part of the set.

887
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,210
It's all right, Bob.

888
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:19,750
Please.

889
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,590
You will.

890
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,050
Yes.

891
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:21,530
Oh, no.

892
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,150
Do you have any of the dog eat downers?

893
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,270
Do you have any of the pills for this damn dog?

894
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,950
He's beat on my leg.

895
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:30,950
I'm sorry, Bob.

896
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:31,610
I...

897
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:37,930
Mr. Cornhusker, I hate to interrupt your dream time now, but you're a...

898
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,170
I'm sorry, Bob.

899
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


900
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


901
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


902
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


903
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


904
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


905
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


906
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


907
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


908
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


909
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


910
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


911
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,170


912
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,310
You've exceeded the limits.

913
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:45,430
You've gone three points over and I'm afraid the credit roll is a Danish.

914
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,770
You know what I'm saying?

915
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,450
Let's take a hike.

916
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,250
Pal, you.

917
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,990
Hey, Longshorthair, whatever your name is.

918
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,050
Let's go.

919
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,330
Time's up.

920
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,730
You've used up your dream time.

921
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,150
These guys get in here, they can't get out.

922
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,850
Look at what's happening to his feet.

923
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:04,530
Oh, my God.

924
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,790
He must have been in here for a year.

925
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,430
Oh, man.

926
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:12,090
He has not been using the facilities they've been using.

927
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,370
Jesus Christ.

928
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,250
We'll have to get somebody.

929
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,590
Can you get these Z's over here?

930
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:20,190
Can you get a couple Z's to clean this mess up?

931
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:20,770
Oh, man.

932
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,530
The guy had a stag dream there.

933
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:27,830
He thought he was king of the universe or something and he's been here a while.

934
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,310
No, no.

935
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,090
He's gone on the floor for crying out loud.

936
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:36,450
We need something to get rid of the smell and de-bacterialize the place somehow.

937
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,410
I mean, crying out loud.

938
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,410


939
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,410


940
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,410


941
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,410


942
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,410


943
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,410


944
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,410


945
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,410


946
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,410


947
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,410


948
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,410


949
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:40,650
He's on the console and now he's drooling over there.

950
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,690
That started it.

951
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,130
Poor thing.

952
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,430
Man, this is stuck right on here.

953
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,410
I have to put this on.

954
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:01,510
Oh, man.

955
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,410
I've got to go to the bathroom.

956
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:12,790
When they see Lincoln's ghost just running around, they're going to see George Washington

957
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,830
and other presidents.

958
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:21,650
Aren't we a wild house?

959
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:26,630
This year they're watching from their house.

960
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,350
Let me get my glasses.

961
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,350


962
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,350


963
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,350


964
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,350


965
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,350


966
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,350


967
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,350


968
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,350


969
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,350


970
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:27,350


971
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:27,990
home above.

972
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,070
They're watching all

973
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:31,630
the

974
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:35,070
messes going round.

975
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,270
There's

976
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:40,970
gonna be a

977
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,530
friend of old

978
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,710
Gaddafi

979
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,370
that is found

980
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,450
in our White House.

981
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,770
Gaddafi's

982
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:52,950
going to flare

983
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,210
up his ugly face

984
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,130
again. And with

985
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,130
what he does, his people

986
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,630
are gonna hold him down.

987
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:03,110
So he won't

988
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,970
cause havoc

989
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,870
to their land again.

990
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:08,370
Havoc.

991
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:10,790
There's gonna be some

992
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,290
changes made

993
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,950
when all the lights begin

994
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:17,030
to go out and blackouts come

995
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,250
from all around.

996
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,110
All the governments

997
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,670
are gonna have a

998
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,810
visit from the

999
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:28,930
Ahabonessah.

1000
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:31,710
Ahabonessah.

1001
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:32,750
Friends,

1002
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,570
I should explain that this song

1003
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,930
by Fran

1004
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,270
Baskerville, as in

1005
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,810
Hound of Thee.

1006
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,350
Fran Baskerville

1007
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:44,390
in this song called Lincoln's Ghost

1008
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,770
is doing psychic predicting,

1009
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,310
I believe. She's a psychic.

1010
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,890
She's telling us what's going to happen

1011
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,650
in, well, I think it's the

1012
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,510
future of the 80s.

1013
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:56,610
Now, you said this

1014
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,630
was one of those time traveler

1015
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,670
CDs or those tapes that were sent.

1016
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,470
Well, she can see

1017
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,550
the future somehow. Spirits tell

1018
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:06,490
her the future. But this is a woman

1019
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,550
from the actual future.

1020
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,550
From the sound

1021
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:11,990
of the music, I would say yes.

1022
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,730
But her predictions

1023
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,570
for the 90s turned out not to

1024
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,290
be correct.

1025
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:20,190
This was done in the

1026
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,730
80s, I think. Well, which stringy 90s

1027
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,250
are we talking about? You know, all the string

1028
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,450
theories, like string theory edition. I'm a

1029
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,310
hologram and I'm actually Jesus in another

1030
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:29,890
dimension. There's 12 of me.

1031
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,610
You know, like Pew, Paul, Larry, Moe

1032
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,330
and so forth. The multiple reality,

1033
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,190
multiple nostril theory.

1034
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,370
Well, we've all, you know, we've tried to tap

1035
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:40,350
in and what's happened, you know, we've been losing

1036
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:42,390
precious water, gouging it,

1037
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,450
you know. The next thing you know, we'll be

1038
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,390
having lovely, we'll be heaving

1039
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:47,490
lovely water.

1040
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,390
I had an operation so I could

1041
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,250
get to it easier. I had them

1042
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,330
ream out the hole bigger so I could get

1043
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:56,090
to the gold.

1044
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:57,190
How did that affect?

1045
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,010
It worked great.

1046
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,270
It's not banging against the cyst on your bundle?

1047
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,390
I talk better now. I say

1048
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,270
things better.

1049
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:07,950
This is a bigger

1050
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,330
echo chamber. Because

1051
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,430
the cyst is gone or the cyst is

1052
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,450
like just changed in shape like an amphitheater

1053
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,350
or something? Oh, I'm not talking. I had, I kept

1054
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:17,810
it. I had them keep the cyst.

1055
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,410
Well, just so long as it doesn't keep you, if you

1056
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,350
know what I mean. I mean, you keep on

1057
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,290
trying to keep that thing alive

1058
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,310
on its own. How do you know it's not

1059
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,410
actually controlling your mind instead of

1060
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,450
you controlling the cyst on

1061
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:32,330
your bung holes? Don't

1062
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,290
knock it until you've tried it. That's all

1063
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:36,430
I can say, man. Oh, by the way, here

1064
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:38,170
we've got some recordings coming up.

1065
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:40,470
Elvis in a box!

1066
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,290
Elvis in a box, man! This guy

1067
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:44,410
played at the Foundry in, uh, at

1068
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,690
the Devival in England.

1069
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:48,170
This is Elvis in a box.

1070
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,150
On Elvis's birthday. It is Elvis.

1071
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:52,150
He's in a box. He's a, um,

1072
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,530
an Indian Elvis, I believe.

1073
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:55,610
A Bollywood Elvis.

1074
00:47:59,110 --> 00:47:59,590
Listen.

1075
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,350
You couldn't see Elvis

1076
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,370
because he was in a box. He sounds pretty good

1077
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:14,330
from inside that box.

1078
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,990
Finally, at the end of the show, he did

1079
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:21,410
come out of the box. This is the song

1080
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:22,610
when he removed the box.

1081
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:23,670
It was

1082
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:25,490
Bollywood Elvis.

1083
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,270
He did a little dance here.

1084
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,730
I liked the little kind of hieroglyphic

1085
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,830
hand moves and stuff like that.

1086
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:35,970
He's a friend of Reverend Error.

1087
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,070
That's a falsification.

1088
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,030
There is no

1089
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:40,870
Reverend Error.

1090
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,930
I could be wrong, but I think it was Reverend Error.

1091
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,070
It's a magnification of a falsitude called an error.

1092
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,230
See, Elvis loves Bob now.

1093
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,310
Elvis in a box loves him like

1094
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:55,110
Windaloo. There's no tomorrow

1095
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,110
talking about that.

1096
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:56,770
Somehow.

1097
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,250
Rainbow!

1098
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,970
What I want to ask you was he spicy or mild?

1099
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:02,990
Spicy.

1100
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:04,010
He was spicy.

1101
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,530
He's a very spicy Elvis.

1102
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,730
Did it take long to come out of the box?

1103
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:11,030
Did he have to be refrigerated?

1104
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:15,750
He sprang from the box like the wisdom sprang from Krishna's brow.

1105
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:16,110
Oh!

1106
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,790
And like this music springs from Bollywood.

1107
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:22,770
Lika, lika, lika.

1108
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:23,850
Lika, lika, lika.

1109
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,510
Lika, lika, lika.

1110
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,330
Lika, lika, lika.

1111
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:27,790
Lika, lika, lika.

1112
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,150
Lika, lika, lika.

1113
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,150
You get a lot of mileage on it.

1114
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,670
Laka, laka, laka, bosh!

1115
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:33,970
Rump a bosh.

1116
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,670
Rump a bosh, rump a bosh.

1117
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:36,970
Rump a bosh, rump a bosh, rump a bosh.

1118
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,570
I would say, defying this cat, I would say,

1119
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,110
Papa Dumb, you know what I'm saying?

1120
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,450
Papa Dumb.

1121
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:44,990
Papa could be smarter, do his thang,

1122
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:46,010
but no, Papa Dumb.

1123
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:46,830
Papa Dumb, man.

1124
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,130
Papa one dumb, was back

1125
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:49,950
pulling this kind of thang.

1126
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,310
Well, isn't dumb, though, a value judgment?

1127
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,250
Not among the dumb.

1128
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:55,490
It's more of a thang.

1129
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,730
worthy symbol of praise,

1130
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:59,550
perhaps a eunuch's way

1131
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:01,510
of letting himself out of the crisis.

1132
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,270
But you know, Papa Doom

1133
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,410
is even better.

1134
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:06,910
He is a bang-bang drummer.

1135
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:07,510
He's more delicious.

1136
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:09,390
And he is quite a dentist, too.

1137
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,150
Yes, I know, a dandy dentist.

1138
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,670
Falsa Doom was also a fine drummer.

1139
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:14,890
That was the uncle,

1140
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:16,970
and he implanted the decay in the teeth,

1141
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,010
and the cousin, or nephew,

1142
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,970
and both, would remove the teeth

1143
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:21,550
and the decay.

1144
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:23,710
Just like we are removing the decay.

1145
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,410
No, I thought we were the decay.

1146
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,030
Well, that can be true, too.

1147
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:30,730
That is our only way to attack the conspiracy,

1148
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,310
you see, is we are the decay.

1149
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,830
We're the yeast, the mold, the termite.

1150
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:35,810
We're the bleeding rock.

1151
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:38,130
We're the pop in the Papa Doom.

1152
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,810
We're the bloody, slimy rock.

1153
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:40,450
We're the Papa Dumb.

1154
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:44,390
We're the rust to the conspiracy's iron cage.

1155
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,350
We're the little poopy handle

1156
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,150
on the back of the caboose.

1157
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:50,130
We're the elf people

1158
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,570
that have no future and no limbs.

1159
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:53,690
Ah, but...

1160
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:54,250
But because of that,

1161
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:55,650
we are free little elves.

1162
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,750
We don't need arms or legs

1163
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:01,190
or tree trunks or branches.

1164
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:03,090
We can just be

1165
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,150
because we have slack.

1166
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:06,890
The subgenius is not something

1167
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,030
that must get slack.

1168
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,410
The subgenius is one who already has slack.

1169
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,770
It is whether you are able

1170
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:14,650
to recognize

1171
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:18,230
the slack you already have.

1172
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:19,190
Friends,

1173
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:21,390
and I know that you're a winner

1174
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:23,570
because you listened to this.

1175
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:23,670
I did.

1176
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:23,670


1177
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,390
I'm looking for radio ministry.

1178
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:26,090
I'm looking for slack.

1179
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,650
He's won the whole prize, hasn't he?

1180
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,590
It looks like the carrot's coming down

1181
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:30,410
and there it goes.

1182
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:31,170
Oh, wow.

1183
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,070
What a lucky man.

1184
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,890
Oh, look, the color's big now.

1185
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,070
Looks like he's going to go all the way.

1186
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,350
They're going to probably take him

1187
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:39,870
into another dimension entirely.

1188
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:40,910
And there's the strings.

1189
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:42,730
They're all dropping down like a fishnet.

1190
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:43,950
Oh, boy.

1191
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:46,330
Well, there's nothing else for us to say

1192
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,610
other than, oh, what a lucky man he was.

1193
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:53,250
And friends, you too can be

1194
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,130
lucky as lonesome here

1195
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,790
and as loathsome as lonesome

1196
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,510
if you want to know more

1197
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:02,310
about Church of the Subgenius.

1198
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,970
Yes, that would prove your luck

1199
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:05,310
if you wanted to know.

1200
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:08,290
If you actually learn anything,

1201
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:09,890
I'm not sure what that would say,

1202
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,770
but why don't you try your luck?

1203
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:15,590
Friends, give Lady Luck a look out

1204
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,530
and join us.

1205
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,210
Pull back your lever

1206
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,250
and start banging and banging

1207
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,070
on that old...

1208
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,490
If you need to know,

1209
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:25,910
and you do,

1210
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:29,770
then check out www.subgenius.com.

1211
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:33,010
Subgenius is spelled without an O,

1212
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,150
by the way, for you.

1213
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:35,770
Subgenius.

1214
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:39,630
I'd like to ask each and every one

1215
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,750
of my friends out there.

1216
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:43,910
I had a...

1217
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:46,930
Well, he was in the service with me.

1218
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:48,370
I was on Guackle Canal,

1219
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:50,290
Bukitville,

1220
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:51,550
and...

1221
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:54,650
Well, to make a long story start,

1222
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,850
I know that it's my dime you've got there,

1223
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,610
so I won't go on too far.

1224
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:01,670
But anyway,

1225
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:04,010
I won't call him a Jap

1226
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:05,910
because that's not a real name.

1227
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:07,470
He was a member of the enemy,

1228
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:08,270
so he...

1229
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:08,970
Well, anyway,

1230
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:10,590
the hair was growing on the inside,

1231
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:12,810
and we took him back

1232
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,790
to where we all was there,

1233
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:16,770
and we interrogated him,

1234
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:19,950
and he said it was Bob Dobbs.

1235
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,070
Now, if you don't...

1236
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:24,190
I swear, I swear on a stack of snakes,

1237
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,590
that's the name he gave.

1238
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:26,430
Now, here he was,

1239
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:28,490
a member of the 3rd Imperial,

1240
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,210
what you call it,

1241
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:31,790
Sapper Battalion,

1242
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:32,650
or whatever they call themselves,

1243
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:34,930
and he had the pipe right there

1244
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,570
tattooed on his titties.

1245
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:39,550
And we were going to take the samurai short

1246
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,430
and shoot him,

1247
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,470
but the commandant said,

1248
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:46,070
we've got to interrogate him some more.

1249
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:46,950
What are we supposed to do?

1250
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:49,090
Well, there wasn't enough estrogen to go around,

1251
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:49,590
because...

1252
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:52,030
From PR News in Washington,

1253
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:55,310
I'm nursing the first of three pregnant women

1254
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:56,950
pulled out of the mud in Washington.

1255
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:01,190
Just the first of three that released gas Thursday.

1256
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,750
Rescue workers thrust head-on

1257
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,350
on the flashy public PR news.

1258
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,270
A federal grand jury in Los Angeles

1259
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:11,890
could trigger PR news in remote Washington.

1260
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,610
And now...

1261
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,450
That guy is good, whoever does that.

1262
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,390
Wait a minute, which button am I pushing here?

1263
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:23,550
Who does that? That guy is good.

1264
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:24,830
You're pushing my buttons, man.

1265
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:25,390
What's that guy's name?

1266
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,810
Don't be pushing my buttons, okay?

1267
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,190
The guy who does the NPR thing, you know?

1268
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,170
That's pretty good.

1269
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,790
That was Limerland Fernando.

1270
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:36,450
That guy's funny.

1271
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:37,730
Yeah, he's a funny,

1272
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,010
he's a pretty funny kind of guy.

1273
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,130
He's an old cutter.

1274
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:41,570
He's an old...

1275
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,430
An old cutter.

1276
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:43,490
He's a yuck cutter.

1277
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:45,830
You know, I have to cut the yucks out of this show

1278
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:49,290
for the public radio airwaves.

1279
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,530
When we do the edited shows,

1280
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,450
the ones on the internet,

1281
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:54,910
you leave the yucks in there,

1282
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:56,370
but you gotta take the yucks out

1283
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:57,410
and the yits.

1284
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:59,950
We call it yuck cutting and yit cutting.

1285
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,110
Cutting the yucks and yits out of the shows,

1286
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:05,310
you know, for the nice people

1287
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,150
and the nice broadcast stations.

1288
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:08,010
Some of them are nice.

1289
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:08,690
In America,

1290
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,690
the broadcast stations in the Canadias,

1291
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:14,630
they don't care about the yits and the yucks.

1292
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:16,230
They don't have the same problems up there.

1293
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:16,750
Nah.

1294
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:19,570
They ain't got much of nothing up there.

1295
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:19,570


1296
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:19,570


1297
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:19,570


1298
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:19,910
Yeah, actually.

1299
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,070
Not like here, for crying out loud.

1300
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:21,370
Yeah.

1301
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,890
We got a lot of everything here.

1302
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:23,910
You gotta take the nits,

1303
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:25,010
the yucks,

1304
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:26,390
the yucks and the yucks out,

1305
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:28,050
and you gotta take those little,

1306
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,070
you know,

1307
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:31,070
squat sounds they got in there, too.

1308
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:31,510
Yeah.

1309
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:32,430
You know, for crying out loud,

1310
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,850
it takes you three afternoons

1311
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:34,570
to add it to one show.

1312
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:37,210
I gotta turn every squat backwards.

1313
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:37,630
They go,

1314
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,330
ta-quack,

1315
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:38,630
wah,

1316
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:39,930
ta-quack,

1317
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:40,810
ta-quack,

1318
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:41,050
wah.

1319
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:42,070
And, you know,

1320
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:43,310
that's got more humor value,

1321
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:43,670
maybe,

1322
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,070
to some of these creeps out there,

1323
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:45,550
but, you know,

1324
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:46,550
the average person that's gonna listen

1325
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,370
is gonna turn right off.

1326
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,410
Yeah, yeah.

1327
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:48,710
Yeah, yeah.

1328
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:50,150
This show sucks.

1329
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,990
This show's full of fish.

1330
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,610
That's your problem, right?

1331
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:54,550
That's why, you know,

1332
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:56,650
I want you to be on, uh...

1333
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:56,730
I say cuff him

1334
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,170
if they can't take a joke.

1335
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,370
The Dumpy Cummel Show

1336
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:00,250
or something like that.

1337
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:01,490
Oh, no, he can't travel.

1338
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:02,530
You know, the open house,

1339
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,830
you know,

1340
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:03,470
the next thing you know,

1341
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:04,630
he's bleeding all over the floor.

1342
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:05,450
Cuff that stuff.

1343
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:06,770
Cuff him, cuff him, you know.

1344
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,150
Cuff him.

1345
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:07,630
Cuff him.

1346
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,790
That's a bunch of fish.

1347
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:10,930
Yeah, a bunch of fish.

1348
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,070
What is it?

1349
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:14,850
The fish thing.

1350
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:15,730
I always forgot that.

1351
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:16,110
You know, like,

1352
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,130
I remember Maury Henders

1353
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:18,350
and a couple of those guys

1354
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:18,950
who come in, you know,

1355
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:19,490
and they start talking

1356
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:20,270
to the, uh, you know,

1357
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:20,810
the fish.

1358
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,170
I don't know about the fish,

1359
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:22,470
but, uh...

1360
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:23,210
What the hell was it, you know?

1361
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:23,770
You smoked...

1362
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:24,770
The few drink in there

1363
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:26,090
have fish cuff in it.

1364
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,490
A fish coffin?

1365
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:29,410
I didn't know they had coffins

1366
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:31,550
for a gosh darn fish.

1367
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:32,370
There you go.

1368
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,250
See, I would have had

1369
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,210
to cut the gosh.

1370
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:34,710
Didn't you?

1371
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:36,470
I have to cut the gosh

1372
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,130
and make it just say,

1373
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:38,430
dang.

1374
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:39,030
How long does that take?

1375
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:39,590
Three hours.

1376
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:40,110
That's to go straight.

1377
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:40,770
Three hours.

1378
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,030
Just for each time you say,

1379
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,250
gosh dang,

1380
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,430
I gotta cut the gosh

1381
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:45,470
and make it...

1382
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:47,130
Yeah, gosling tapes in me.

1383
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:47,810
I go through

1384
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:49,770
a yard of gosling tapes.

1385
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:50,930
I'm cutting one,

1386
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,110
one yit out of this show.

1387
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:54,230
One freaking yit.

1388
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:54,850
One yit.

1389
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:56,510
And you gotta say freaking

1390
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:58,070
instead of yucking.

1391
00:56:58,190 --> 00:56:59,030
Because, you know,

1392
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,270
because you don't want to yuck.

1393
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:01,690
How many days is that?

1394
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:03,130
Oh, for crying out loud.

1395
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:03,910
The last time I,

1396
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,970
I forgot to pull a yuck.

1397
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:06,790
Yeah, it was like a...

1398
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:09,310
I think this is one of the most

1399
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:11,110
highbrow shows I have ever had.

1400
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:11,670
It's the most,

1401
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:12,690
it's cuffed up.

1402
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:14,630
It's the most cuffed up thing

1403
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:15,430
I ever heard.

1404
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:16,710
It's wonderfully highbrow.

1405
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:17,710
It's very, very much.

1406
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:17,790
It's very, very much.

1407
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:17,790


1408
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:17,790


1409
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:18,370
It's the dementia.

1410
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:19,430
You know,

1411
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,290
and the worst thing...

1412
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,350
You ain't like a bad

1413
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,170
vacuum cleaner.

1414
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:23,490
For this one,

1415
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,190
I gotta,

1416
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:25,190
for the internet shows,

1417
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,010
I gotta go and turn them

1418
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:27,850
all backwards

1419
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:30,190
to make them into cuss words again.

1420
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,450
And so then the next thing you know,

1421
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:33,290
you get arguments from your pope,

1422
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:33,810
you know,

1423
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:35,210
your lobsang rampa,

1424
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,490
your Dalai Lama,

1425
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:36,970
hey,

1426
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:37,790
back words,

1427
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:38,270
you know,

1428
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:38,990
hey, right, right, right.

1429
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:40,250
Get that enough profanity

1430
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:41,490
in my internet copy.

1431
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:42,170
Like I'm a stylist,

1432
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:42,510
you know.

1433
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:43,750
When Bob's let me down,

1434
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:45,470
I ain't get no slack from Bob.

1435
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:46,490
Yeah, they know,

1436
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:46,830
they know.

1437
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:47,210
Hey,

1438
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:47,930
no,

1439
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:48,290
yeah.

1440
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:49,010
Hey, Bob.

1441
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,010
Last time they got slapped

1442
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,170
by me,

1443
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:52,510
of course.

1444
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,870
They didn't get no slack

1445
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,250
off of no Bob.

1446
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:57,390
Bob,

1447
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:57,890
well,

1448
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:58,570
I know,

1449
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,290
it's Jesus.

1450
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,230
It didn't have

1451
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,910
any disciples named.

1452
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:02,930
Don't be...

1453
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:07,150
He did have one named Jim.

1454
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,570
And he had one named Bob.

1455
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:09,990
Yes.

1456
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:10,930
And one named Tom.

1457
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:12,790
Jesus' disciple Bob.

1458
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,730
The Fisher of Wallets,

1459
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:16,510
friends.

1460
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:18,810
And like Jesus,

1461
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:19,890
he could walk on the water.

1462
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:20,790
But unlike Jesus,

1463
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:21,870
he could also fly.

1464
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:22,950
Yes,

1465
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:24,470
the child Bob could fly.

1466
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:25,210
We've covered this

1467
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,050
in previous lessons.

1468
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:26,710
We have spoken,

1469
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:27,730
he could fly underwater,

1470
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:28,690
as a matter of fact.

1471
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:29,290
He could,

1472
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:29,530
yes,

1473
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:30,370
he could fly

1474
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:31,330
through outer space.

1475
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,730
And perhaps Bob came from space,

1476
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:35,170
but that's to be decided

1477
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:36,390
by scholars, friends.

1478
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:38,870
Because it's only up to us

1479
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:39,810
to worship Bob.

1480
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,090
We owe him not,

1481
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:42,870
not just fear,

1482
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:44,170
but awe.

1483
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:45,710
But I think it is

1484
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:46,850
empathizing

1485
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:47,190
and, you know,

1486
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:47,870
it's so natural

1487
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,290
to present

1488
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,110
some of the childhood stories

1489
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,030
of Bob

1490
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:53,590
and saying the wonderment

1491
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:55,690
of his village folk.

1492
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:56,950
He could see

1493
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,430
that Bob was flying

1494
00:58:58,430 --> 00:58:59,450
through the water,

1495
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,350
that he was passing urine

1496
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:02,170
and mustard

1497
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,170
through thousands

1498
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,110
of octopus-like orifices.

1499
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,310
And I'm telling you right now,

1500
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:09,750
as long as I'm on this television

1501
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:10,850
telling you,

1502
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:12,770
that's the way...

1503
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:16,070
Bob can fly right into your life,

1504
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:16,610
too, friends.

1505
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,250
Bob can fly right in,

1506
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:20,690
right up you,

1507
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:22,250
up your pant leg.

1508
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:23,310
He'll sneak right up there

1509
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,070
and tickle you.

1510
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:25,410
Because he was a child

1511
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:27,750
that had wings like a dove.

1512
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:29,730
Wings like an eagle.

1513
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:30,150
So beautiful.

1514
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:32,210
Nostrils, all three,

1515
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,090
like a hockey thing.

1516
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,470
He could spurn magnificent ideas

1517
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:39,850
and put his face into the fire

1518
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:41,430
and come back

1519
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:43,450
just as red as that pumpkin.

1520
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:45,570
That's your dad out there.

1521
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:47,170
The father of...

1522
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,290
The father of...

1523
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,530
The father of...

1524
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:50,810
Bob's...

1525
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:51,930
We...

1526
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:53,210
We hate...

1527
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:54,790
Hate, hate, hate.

1528
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:55,170
And...

1529
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:55,570
Hate!

1530
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:57,210
We love hate.

1531
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:57,970
And friends,

1532
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,350
we hate to leave.

1533
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:00,130
And we hate love!

1534
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:01,230
And we love hate.

1535
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:02,230
We hate to leave,

1536
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:03,030
but we must.

1537
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:03,870
We hate to leave.

1538
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:04,730
And somehow,

1539
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,210
the show must come to an end.

1540
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:10,450
And I guess this must be it.

1541
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:11,750
Or almost here.

1542
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,750
You've got to think of the past

1543
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:14,490
and the future of the show

1544
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:15,350
and the mo...

1545
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,430
We could just fade it out.

1546
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,850
This isn't really ending music.

1547
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:20,190
That's like an illusion fading in.

1548
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:21,590
I'm like, oh, where it comes...

1549
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:24,650
This show's full of shit.

1550
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:25,930
That's your problem.

1551
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:27,130
That's why, you know...

1552
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:29,130
I say fuck them

1553
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,690
if they can't take a joke.

1554
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:31,910
The Jumpy Cummles show

1555
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:32,770
or something like that.

1556
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:34,030
Oh, no, he can't travel.

1557
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,050
You know, the open house,

1558
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:35,990
you know, the next thing you know,

1559
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:37,150
he's bleeding all over the floor.

1560
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:38,270
Fuck that stuff.

1561
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,270
Fuck them, fuck them, you know.

1562
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:40,990
That's a...

1563
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:42,430
That's a bunch of shit.

1564
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,590
Yeah, a bunch of shit.

1565
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:45,690
What...

1566
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:46,570
What is it?

1567
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:47,050
Shit.

1568
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:48,270
I always forgot that.

1569
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:48,630
You know, like,

1570
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:49,690
I remember Maury Henders

1571
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:50,910
and a couple of those guys

1572
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:51,450
who come in, you know,

1573
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:52,010
and they start talking

1574
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:52,770
and they, you know,

1575
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:53,650
the shift and then...

1576
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,650
I don't know about the shift.

1577
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:55,550
What the hell was he?

1578
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:57,370
I think this is one of the most

1579
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:59,150
highbrow shows I've ever had.

1580
01:00:59,150 --> 01:00:59,710
It's the most...

1581
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:00,830
It's fucked up.

1582
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:02,950
It's the most fucked up thing I ever heard.

1583
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:03,510
It's fucked...
