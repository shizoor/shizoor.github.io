1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,440
All right.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,920
Oh, are we okay?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,100
I think you had a subgenius in the studio.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,360
No, I had a subgenius.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,840
I'm sorry, we're going to spray for those things next week.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,380
We call the exterminator.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,080
Don't watch that!

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,360
Watch this!

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,900
Shaker tag!

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,120
Look, it's 3 a.m.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,660
These guys are running on bad coffee.

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,860
They have about four hours of sleep.

13
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,660
Maybe you could think about cutting them some slack.

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,080
I can't afford slack.

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,000
Hey, who's that?

16
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,580
Bob?

17
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,160
Totally lacking in sympathy or imagination.

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,260
The modern racketeer.

19
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,980
Psychologists say that such character can frequently be traced back to...

20
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,580
The subgenius.

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,920
Power of Slack.

22
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,700
Hey.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,040
Arkansas?

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,200
Hey!

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,280
What did you say?

26
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:18,660


27
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,620
Watch this.

28
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,280
This is John's

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,240
job at Shaftesbury Park building.

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,240


31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,320
That guy.

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,320


33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,840
ë¹ˆ

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,880
and then unpacking them and placing them back on the shelf.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,860
This is not the way the Jehovah One has designed you to act.

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,920
Unless you are willing to admit that you are a gnome,

37
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,800
a pink boy, a nini, a twig.

38
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,720
Only then can you decide where your path shall lead you.

39
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,860
But we know inherently that we are all created good

40
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,100
by Jehovah One.

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,100
Some of you got such bad luck sometimes in your life,

42
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,320
you couldn't hang yourself with your own necktie.

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,380
This is when you should look to Bob.

44
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,860
When you look to Jehovah One and say,

45
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,400
Bob, come into my life.

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,400
And you should see one set of footprints in the sand.

47
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,080
And that is when you will know that Bob has charged you

48
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,840
five dollars and not nine cents.

49
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,480
To carry you to the nearest taxi.

50
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,380
Praise Bob and his divine ways.

51
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,940
You got to know that life is like a vanishing twin.

52
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,460
A baby inside of a twin, inside of a woman's belly.

53
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,300
That's how confusing this wiggly world can be.

54
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,320
You gotta rise up above this wiggly world

55
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,160
and grab the hand of Bob.

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,480
Praise him.

57
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,980
and all that blows from Bob.

58
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,840
I knew Bob for over 30 years.

59
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,420
Some mouth content who has just enough information

60
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,760
to sound knowledgeable and do serious damage.

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,140
He drove too fast.

62
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,400
And what happened to Bob?

63
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,860
Disappeared.

64
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
Were you and Bob close?

65
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,700
I'd nod to him in the morning.

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,900
Bob, breaking my heart.

67
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,060
Do you think that you miss him?

68
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:24,980
Bob?

69
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,800
No.

70
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,160
I don't miss Bob.

71
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,180
I just wonder if there might be some connection

72
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,460
between Bob and your attack in the elevator.

73
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,980
What happened to Bob?

74
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,380
You think Bob is my rosebud?

75
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,340
Actually, I think this precedes Bob.

76
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,780
Do you have some sort of psychological antihistamine?

77
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,660
Hello.

78
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,360
J.R. Bob Dubs.

79
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,440
J.R. Bob Dubs.

80
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,880
Orange Bob.

81
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,020
Aside from the church declaring war on God

82
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,960
and trying to change all human nature,

83
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,720
which is also what every peacenik wants, I guess,

84
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,060
is to change human nature and make us so we're not chimpanzees

85
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,260
or even primates anymore.

86
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,540
Good luck on that.

87
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,280
But actually, Bob promises the end of warfare

88
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,060
for all who have become ordained subgenius ministers.

89
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,820
On X Day, July 5th, 19...

90
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,260
1998.

91
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,580
If the real 1998 ever gets here.

92
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,700
That's how big the conspiracy is.

93
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
That's how insidious it is.

94
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,240
You think this is, what, July 29th, 2008,

95
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,540
if that's what it's supposed to be.

96
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,320
But we don't really know what year this is.

97
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,280
We don't even know what planet this is.

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,580
If I could tell you that Earth was switched with Mars

99
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,760
and World War II was nothing but a diversion

100
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,780
to hide that slight of planet,

101
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,400
and you would laugh, some of you, if it were that funny.

102
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,760
But it's true.

103
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,160
That's the horrible thing about it.

104
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,020
And if you don't believe me,

105
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,280
the evidence is in our new book, the Bobliography.

106
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,800
I'm sure the evidence is also in the Bible.

107
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,200
As far as I can tell, the evidence for anything is in the Bible.

108
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,580
And our books are the same way.

109
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,100
They're vague.

110
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,780
They're...

111
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,180
Um...

112
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,660
Um...

113
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:24,860
Um...

114
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:24,860


115
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,020
full of generalizations and terrible wrathful things

116
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,920
which suddenly turn into peacenik nice things.

117
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,380
And there's a lot of sex and killing.

118
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:42,020
So, you know, and what we have that the Bible doesn't, pictures.

119
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,060
That's a selling point.

120
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,240
Our books have pictures.

121
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,720
You see, as Onan said, once again, see, he's my script writer.

122
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,060
God forgot to make stupidity painful.

123
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,620
We're here to change that.

124
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,500
This is the 11th X Day, and I'm getting tired of you.

125
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,620
Bob didn't come through this time.

126
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,540
And please, folks, don't say,

127
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,180
Where'd we stand? How come the X's didn't show up?

128
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,880
I've gotten real tired of that.

129
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,940
I'm not Bob.

130
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,260
Do you see a pipe in my mouth, man?

131
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:47,620
Do you?

132
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,880
Not right now. I mean, sometimes, yeah, sure.

133
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,300
But not, you know what I mean.

134
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,060
Do you see Bob on my face?

135
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,580
Yeah, but you know what I mean.

136
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,180
It's funny when you put your glasses on.

137
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,680
But then Bob proved himself on July 5th when Ken Lay died.

138
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,600
I heard that news on the way home on the radio, and I was just like, what?

139
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,300
I was, you know, that bastard died in his vacation home in Aspen, Colorado.

140
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,500
But he died on July 5th.

141
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,840
Surrounded by luxury.

142
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,960
You know, every imaginable luxury he was surrounded by.

143
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,160
And, you know, that's a much better fate.

144
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,400
That, you know, what, did he die in his sleep, too?

145
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,580
I mean, that's a much better fate than the lives of the people he...

146
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,420
Well, he had a heart attack. I imagine that would wake you up.

147
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,440
Well, you...

148
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,340
No, a lot of people sleep right through heart attacks and never wake up.

149
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,180
And any other day, any other day if Ken Lay had died, we would be angry and grumpy.

150
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,520
But he died on July 5th, so that proves that there is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

151
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,980
Well, you know, I hate to...

152
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:54,020
I will not relax my intellectual standards for even for this program and not even for Bob.

153
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,400
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,940
That just doesn't flow.

155
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,660
It just doesn't follow logically that it proves there's a Bob.

156
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,700
Well, he got...

157
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,260
I know there's a Bob because I saw him and we burned him alive, remember?

158
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,060
Well, we always burned him alive.

159
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,960
Right, but this...

160
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,760
He keeps coming back for more.

161
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,000
Praise Bob.

162
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,080
These are dark times.

163
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,480
These are dark times.

164
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,720
These are dark times.

165
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,000
The end times predicted by Bob.

166
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,880
Stupid idiots.

167
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,740
Dressing up in...

168
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,580
Stupid clothes.

169
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,600
Preaching whatever it takes to get you to buy.

170
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,040
These are dark times.

171
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,420
These are dark times.

172
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,660
These are dark times.

173
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,360
The end times predicted by Bob.

174
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,200
In the holy book, the book of the subgenius.

175
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,680
And what did Bob say would come at the end of the end times?

176
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,500
What will come next?

177
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,540
Intervention from higher beings, ladies and gentlemen.

178
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,380
These aliens are coming.

179
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,140
You think time's a duck now.

180
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,480
Just wait until these aliens arrive.

181
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,440
But as soon as we're gone, you folks who are here unsaved,

182
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,520
you folks listening by radio, you folks listening by record,

183
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,560
who know not Jesus Christ, once the church is gone,

184
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,300
there is going to be a cataclysmic judgment.

185
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,080
And millions will die in those next few years.

186
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,240
They'll be glued to their sets, watching rockets and jets,

187
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,320
blowing up schools and factories,

188
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,280
putting an end to the birds and bees.

189
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,160
It's worth every penny to tune in and see

190
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,840
who wins the Emmy at the root of the academy.

191
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,060
Watch World War III on pay TV

192
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,980
before your television melts away.

193
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,860
It's the end of the world as we know it.

194
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,420
It's the end of the world as we know it.

195
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,980
It's the end of the world as we know it.

196
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,020
I feel fine.

197
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,480
A-O, let's go.

198
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,260
Shoot them in the back now.

199
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:03,580
Shoot them in the back now.

200
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,760
Tried a man, broken in the dark again.

201
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,420
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, dear friends.

202
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,380
The civilization of the normals,

203
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,300
any minute now will be destroyed by Bob's friends,

204
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,060
the aliens, that's right, the exes.

205
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,400
Yeah, yeah, on July 5th,

206
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,880
if you hadn't gotten,

207
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,900
enough of that date

208
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,340
in those various clips there.

209
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,900
Ah, yes, X-Days are coming, my friends.

210
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,740
And that's...

211
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,720
Did you get that July 5th?

212
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,120
You did get that, right?

213
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,000
And the pinks are bumming.

214
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,820
And who was that we've been listening to?

215
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,960
Just before the X-Day pop songs collage there,

216
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,620
we heard a cut-up by Reverend Sweetness McGee

217
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,840
of Reverend Sweetness McGee.

218
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,560
And there's a young priest preaching in London.

219
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,300
There's also going to be an X-Day gathering in London,

220
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,960
as well as in the U.S.

221
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,740
The one in the U.S. is at Brushwood in Sherman, New York.

222
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,940
The one in London is at a club called the Rhythm Factory.

223
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,440
And you can get all that information at subgenius.com.

224
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,620
Before that, we heard a little cut-up by The Large,

225
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,800
a...

226
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,760
I don't know who did the Mongoloid chorus,

227
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,080
but we heard some preaching by yours truly,

228
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,380
Reverend Stang from Winter Star.

229
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,980
I should mention that Starwood comes up two weeks after X-Day

230
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,040
at the same location in Brushwood.

231
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,860
That's a clothing-optional campground, folks.

232
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,120
And...

233
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,580
But don't worry.

234
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,260
Most of them keep their clothes on.

235
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,560
Collages there also by Norrell Preff.

236
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,720
There were two by Norrell Preff,

237
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,400
the song at the beginning, All Praise Bob,

238
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,480
was by Raymond Lafferty.

239
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,120
And Fernanda Nettily-Murr did our titles, friends.

240
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,040
And I think that's it for the credits.

241
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,880
I've got some more X-Day songs and collages

242
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,440
that I could play and probably will.

243
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,400
We're expecting Lonesome Cowboy Dave to call in pretty soon.

244
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,000
And, in fact, Princess,

245
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,960
you might kind of help me keep an eye on this.

246
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,520
These little flashing lights over here.

247
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,420
That would be my pleasure, Reverend Stang.

248
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,300
Princess Wee is here with me.

249
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,020
And, strangely enough, we also have a video crew here.

250
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,060
They're doing a documentary about Devo.

251
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,300
Our old friends, the Devos.

252
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,000
And they were in Cleveland, of course,

253
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,000
because the Devos were hatched here

254
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,920
in Northern Ohio.

255
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,940
I see somebody trying to call, but it's not Dave.

256
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,300
Friends, until Dave calls at the appointed moment,

257
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,620
I'm going to read to you about contraception in ancient Rome.

258
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,740
A couple of weeks ago, we read from this book,

259
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,720
Sex in History, by Ray Tannehill.

260
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,240
Not to be confused with history of sex.

261
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,940
This is Sex in History.

262
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,500
It's a great book.

263
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,840
But contraception in ancient Rome.

264
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,500
We'll do this quickly here.

265
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,520
The indefatigable Pliny, a moral man,

266
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,920
could not bring himself to approve contraception

267
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,220
except for women who were overproductive.

268
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,360
His solution was to try to diminish the desire

269
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,200
for sexual intercourse.

270
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,940
And his recipes must have been quite effective,

271
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,240
even if not always for scientific reasons.

272
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,560
Quote,

273
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,120
Mouse dung applied in the form of a liniment

274
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,480
was one suggestion.

275
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,920
Another involved swallowing either snail excrement

276
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,600
or pigeon droppings mixed with oil and wine.

277
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,020
A third required the testicles and blood

278
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:46,000
of a dunghill cock to be secreted under the bed.

279
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,320
That's a type of rooster I was referring to.

280
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,360
Further, he pointed out that if a woman's

281
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,840
loins were, quote,

282
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,860
rubbed with blood taken from the ticks

283
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,260
on a wild black bull,

284
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,320
she would be inspired, quote,

285
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,000
with aversion to sexual intercourse.

286
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,200
So first you catch your bull, friends.

287
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,440
Pliny's contemporary, Dioscorides,

288
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,500
whose works were still being consulted

289
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,780
and relied on as late as the 16th century,

290
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,020
had some equally interesting suggestions.

291
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,840
After intercourse, he recommended

292
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,260
inserting pepper, quantity unspecified,

293
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,240
into the mouth of the uterus.

294
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,620
Ow, ow, ow.

295
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,240
It is not clear whether, like his predecessors,

296
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,640
he still attributed curative qualities to this pepper,

297
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,460
or whether it occurred to him that,

298
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,360
since sneezing was often recommended

299
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,500
as a way of expelling semen,

300
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,580
it would be a good idea to take the sneeze

301
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,120
closer to the source.

302
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,240
And with that, we'll see, let's see if we,

303
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,960
if we can pick up anything on the air.

304
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,260
I just returned from Dobbstown.

305
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:58,920
It was.

306
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,540
The Malaria Fest.

307
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,840
So it was Dave all that time.

308
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,400
It was Dave.

309
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,800
And I just came back from the Malaria Fest.

310
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,760
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,700
In which Dobbstown?

312
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,220
Dobbstown South.

313
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,040
Oh, South America.

314
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,720
Down in South America.

315
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,620
Uh-huh.

316
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,880
And I discovered all kinds of different things

317
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,920
that I didn't want to know.

318
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,380
One was that the original,

319
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,240
the,

320
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,280
that they were putting too much strontium-90 in the milk.

321
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,820
In Dobbstown?

322
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
No, previous to that.

323
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:32,780
And that's why all of Bob's so-called children

324
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,480
have those defects.

325
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,780
Well, you know, the only one of Bob's kids

326
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,760
where it's really obvious is Bub,

327
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,100
who has no eyes or nose.

328
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,180
He's just a mouth with a pipe.

329
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,600
And the hairdo.

330
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,480
I know, it's a horrible sight.

331
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,260
But the other ones, as far as I,

332
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,080
you know, I mean, how do you even tell

333
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,380
with one of the Dobbs's,

334
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,100
how do you know if they've got birth defects?

335
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,140
Well, you know,

336
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,580
and there could be macroconvolutions in the brain.

337
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,360
They could be extremely, you know,

338
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,300
telekinetic or psi-influenced or something like that.

339
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,620
Or they could just be constantly humming

340
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,280
this weird buzzing tune in their head all day

341
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,780
and can't get it out of their minds.

342
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,560
Strontium-90.

343
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,900
I was writing that down for my recipe.

344
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,660
I'm thinking of trying to recreate

345
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,140
the diet that gave me my birth defects.

346
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,880
You probably were raised similar

347
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,280
in the 50s when we were growing up.

348
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Kraft cheese products.

349
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,080
Right, TV dinners.

350
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,200
Banquet is still my favorite.

351
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,800
Although we shouldn't spam.

352
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,880
Oh, spam was good, too.

353
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,400
You can spam for spam.

354
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,620
Nanospite was a good one.

355
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,880
It gave you the instant rejection.

356
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,460
Yeah, boy.

357
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,460
And just sitting real close to the television.

358
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,600
The TVs in those days were different.

359
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,480
They put out more rays.

360
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,680
Yeah, the electronic fire really meant something then.

361
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,340
Yeah.

362
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,300
Now it means you just go in there

363
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,300
and grab those ganglia and charge you for it.

364
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,480
Kids take so much for granted these days.

365
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,660
Yeah.

366
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,940
They think they...

367
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,820
And they take their dads for granted.

368
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,660
It's Father's Day, kids.

369
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,020
Did you remember to call your poor old dad?

370
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,620
Who, me?

371
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,100
You listening by radio with that joint in your mouth.

372
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,280
Drinking that beer.

373
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,080
Did you remember to call your pa today?

374
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,140
Your poor old pa.

375
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,100
You that lined the children up according to their size

376
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,800
so that their feet all touch the water in the same places

377
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,780
and put the barbecue sauce directly on the grill.

378
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,780
You should have called up somebody's dad today.

379
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,180
It could have been anybody's probably related to somebody

380
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,820
and just said, happy Father's Day.

381
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,400
Right.

382
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,500
If you've already murdered,

383
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,500
your parents call somebody else's parents.

384
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,380
You call my dad.

385
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,120
Call Pappy Stang down there.

386
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,540
Just look up Pappy Stang in the phone book

387
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,420
for Stangsville, Texas.

388
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,700
Stang County.

389
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,100
Go ahead and call him up.

390
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,720
Say, Pappy.

391
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,480
Happy Pappy's Day.

392
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,000
What's the area code?

393
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,080
I forgot.

394
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,520
254.

395
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,580
254.

396
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,240
So just 254 and dial any random number and say, happy Pappy.

397
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,600
That's right.

398
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,100
Happy Pappy's Day.

399
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:19,520
Happy Pappy.

400
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,780
Because there's only one...

401
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,800
Stangsville, Texas has a population of one,

402
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,680
except when I'm there.

403
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,240
Then there's...

404
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,140
Or in Princess We, then there's three of us.

405
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,760
But mostly it's just Pappy.

406
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,840
There's the ergot plant.

407
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,020
I mean, not the actual plant.

408
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,560
The factory.

409
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,340
The factory.

410
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,960
There's the ergot plant, yes.

411
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,120
And so there's a lot of transient labor.

412
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,440
Well, that's technically in Stephenville.

413
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,860
Well, they still have to pay taxes.

414
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,560
Now, this was the strangest thing.

415
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,520
I was...

416
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,180
Watching TV the way I do, which is by downloading.

417
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,340
And it was that show, Bizarre Foods.

418
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,480
And I thought, gosh, which episode should I download?

419
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Korea for Bizarre Foods?

420
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,520
You know, Malaysia, where they eat monkey brains?

421
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,320
No, I downloaded Texas.

422
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,880
And what should they...

423
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,100
You haven't seen this yet.

424
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,760
The stuff I grew up eating was being described as weird foods.

425
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,020
This guy was, like, you know, daring to eat an actual Texas meal.

426
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,940
Is this like moon pies and squirrel or...

427
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,520
Scorpions and tarantula, you know, tacos, that kind of stuff.

428
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,280
I mean, it's Tex-Mex, basically.

429
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,400
But it was the strangest thing.

430
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,960
It was supposed to be, here's the weird, strange, exotic land of Texas.

431
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,160
And here's the weirdest part of Texas.

432
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,240
And where did it happen to be?

433
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,080
Stanksville.

434
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,700
Actually, the next town over.

435
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,220
Did they have theremin music in the background?

436
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,660
Yeah, to show how weird.

437
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,340
How weird it was.

438
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,520
The local denizens here who munch on scorpions daily.

439
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,020
And we're going to take a walk up to his door right now.

440
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,960
Or was it like more...

441
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,660
There was a big build-up and stuff.

442
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,960
And then suddenly, there was all the food arrayed in front of everybody.

443
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,340
Well, I'll tell you what.

444
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,100
When that show was over, I ran downstairs and made me a...

445
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,460
Some kind of food.

446
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,900
I don't remember what the basis was.

447
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,920
It didn't really matter.

448
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,640
Because it was mostly halibut.

449
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,500
Jalapenos and hot sauce.

450
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,240
Mayonnaise and peanut butter.

451
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,400
No, not mayonnaise and peanut butter.

452
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,480
With jalapenos on the side.

453
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,600
Tarantula, venom, and scorpion pee.

454
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,260
Well, that's maybe one of the reasons why Texans are so hardy is eating scorpion flesh and tarantulas.

455
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,220
You better believe in horny toads.

456
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,300
Or also known as horned lizards.

457
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:49,200
People used to literally think we were talking about toads, amphibians that were sexually aroused.

458
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,140
But the horny toad is a lizard that looks like a toad and has little horns and is pretty much extinct.

459
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,300
I used to think they were extinct because of 12-year-old boys like I was.

460
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,180
But I later discovered that it was because of fire ants.

461
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,020
And Strontium-90.

462
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,820
Right.

463
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,260
Well, Stainesville is the home of the big nuclear power plant that serves Dallas and Fort Worth.

464
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,060
Well, they process that stuff.

465
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,180
They don't just...

466
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,400
You can't get it pure or uncut, unstepped on anymore.

467
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:28,880
When you go out and try to score some Strontium-90 these days, you got to deal with some guy in a back alley.

468
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,420
It's probably going to be half talcum powder and baby laxative.

469
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:33,900
Yeah.

470
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,940
Yeah, mannitol.

471
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,680
Totally stepped on.

472
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,020
Right.

473
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,380
So your half-life is going to be maybe five years, not 90 years.

474
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,520
And so you can't hardly get...

475
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,860
You know, you're not going to be mutated.

476
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,080
Your kids might...

477
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,180
Have to wear glasses or be kind of short or something.

478
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,780
It's not going to do any more than being a regular smoker or something.

479
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,120
Right.

480
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,240
It'll skip a generation.

481
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,420
If you have to go through like a spectrographic hall or something like that,

482
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,380
you're not going to really make any needles jump and stuff unless you're already wearing some.

483
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:13,260
And most of those people who consume too much Strontium-90 live to regret it.

484
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,780
Well, for those who can't get enough Strontium-90,

485
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,000
there's always X-Day at Brushwood.

486
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,140
And as usual, Bob won't be there.

487
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,940
Well, we don't know that.

488
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,280
We've never known with old Bob.

489
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,820
We never know that.

490
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,640
Reports.

491
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,180
Reports from Doddlers and Dingy Belts.

492
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,780
Reports and omissive misstatements from Whizwangs.

493
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,340
Speaking of Whiz, I can tell you some Whizwangs that will be there.

494
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,800
What Whizwangs will be there, Reverend Sting?

495
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,460
Whizwangs.

496
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:47,760
Whizwangs.

497
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:47,760


498
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,180
I think that Lonesome Cowboy Dave will end his lonesomeness.

499
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,000
The real Lonesome Cowboy Dave?

500
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,960
Yeah, not this guy we're talking to on the phone.

501
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,140
Anybody could imitate Dave.

502
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,220
Oh, man.

503
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,260
Dave's the easiest guy in the world to imitate.

504
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,620
We should get a lot of people coming just to see him.

505
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,120
Anybody could talk like Dave.

506
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,380
But the unreal one, the one I've been waiting to see for a long time.

507
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,060
The popular Lonesome Cowboy Dave is going to be there.

508
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,740
And Reverend Susie the Floozy and her two friends that are so famous.

509
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,520
Her friends.

510
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,100
Yeah, the ones that live on her chest.

511
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:26,000
And, by the way, when we end the show, we'll have some Susie collage that's really good.

512
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,400
But Dr. Katahdin Leguim will be there.

513
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,640
He's the most, you know, he's the world's smartest subgenius.

514
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,700
That's his official.

515
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,520
His name is the most mispronounced.

516
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,200
Well, maybe.

517
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,240
Probably just too smart for anybody to be able to say it.

518
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,440
Yeah, he got an award for smartest subgenius.

519
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,640
And, you know, that really ain't saying all that much.

520
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,760
But, now, I'm going to leave out somebody important.

521
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,260
Now, the Cuijibo cartel is going to be there.

522
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,160
That beatnik Reverend Chris Lee.

523
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,420
Oh, and there are bands.

524
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,060
I might mention the bands.

525
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,700
Ernest Tubb won't be there.

526
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,560
Ernest Tubb won't be there.

527
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,100
No, Flatt and Roy Acuff won't be there.

528
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,120
But the amino acids will be there.

529
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,760
And John Deere tractor beam will be there.

530
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:17,760


531
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,680
In fact, there's going to be a beach party on Friday night.

532
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,380
Even though there's not a beach for 50 miles.

533
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,980
Or 100 miles.

534
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,560
There will be a beach party Friday night.

535
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,120
A subgenius beach party?

536
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:29,560
Yeah.

537
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,640
And Fat Free, the band, not the coffee creamer.

538
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,400
Or the idea.

539
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:38,780
Right.

540
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,220
Dr. Dark's drive-in will be showing movies Wednesday and Thursday.

541
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,360
Great and bad.

542
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:47,920
And the B-films.

543
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,260
The B-films.

544
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,180
Those are wonderful.

545
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,100
You know, they're not really B-films.

546
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:59,780
The kind that we're into, that kind of bulldata, is what you'd more like call Z-films.

547
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,920
Zontarian.

548
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,200
Yeah.

549
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,060
Oh, by the way, anybody on YouTube, check out Zontar on YouTube.

550
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:09,680
Zontar.

551
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,760
You know, I've used that phrase so long, and I don't know what it means.

552
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,240
Is it perhaps a hostean of some great power?

553
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,460
Or is it like a guru?

554
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,240
A Mr. Genie, Swami type guy?

555
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:27,200
In the middle 60s, in Dallas, Texas, the great unsung film director, Larry Buchanan,

556
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:34,740
did a movie called Zontar, The Thing from Venus, for a budget of about $10,000.

557
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,540
It was in color, and it was 70 minutes long, and it had John Agar in it.

558
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,260
And my old boss, Brownie Brownrigg, played...

559
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,440
He was small enough to wear the Zontar costume.

560
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,760
He was small enough to wear the Zontar costume.

561
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,080
So I can actually say that I know Zontar Thing from Venus.

562
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,840
And he didn't pay very well.

563
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,340
He paid minimum, actually.

564
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:02,380
He was like a real, a mean little guy with a cylindrical helmet that had antenna, but he had teeth too, right?

565
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:02,940
That's right.

566
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:03,980
Yeah.

567
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,980
He was a little guy.

568
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,660
He was like a little buzzing doll-shaped thing.

569
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,600
He was a different kind of Jesus, like no other Jesus you've ever seen.

570
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,780
He was a really different Jesus.

571
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,740
We need more different Jesuses.

572
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,320
We have...

573
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,340
How many do we have right now?

574
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,040
13, right?

575
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,460
Or is that a mystical number I'm not supposed to say?

576
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,900
Well, we try not to talk about that because of that child custody case where they took Jesus' child away.

577
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,740
So I don't know if Jesus is going to be at X Day or Magdalene.

578
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,980
I haven't heard from them.

579
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:41,740
They may very well be steering clear because of, you know, the New York family judge taking their child away

580
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,140
because they were members of Church of the Subgenius.

581
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,420
And just because they did that takeoff on the...

582
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,720
The Passion of the Christ at 1X Day naked with those dildos and things.

583
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,120
Yeah.

584
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,500
Wouldn't...

585
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,540
Don't you think if you were Jesus and Mary, you'd have at least the right, as far as royalties

586
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,280
and collection would go, to do such a thing?

587
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,600
I mean, I don't see what the problem is.

588
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,840
Jesus is not suing himself.

589
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,240
The water balloons of blood didn't help either.

590
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,720
Not the other one, but the one of the third, maybe the fifth Satan.

591
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,160
It's his fault.

592
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,540
I think.

593
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,420
Well, why blame him?

594
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,220
Why blame things on Satan when you can blame them on Bob?

595
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,620
That's true.

596
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,380
That's what I...

597
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,200
You know, I often ask myself that.

598
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,100
And it's the same thing with church names.

599
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,820
You know, everybody...

600
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,360
The subgenius ministers all have these cute, funny names.

601
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,640
Those are their true names.

602
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,560
They're subgenius church names.

603
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,920
But they're born with their human street name.

604
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:46,300
And I've often wondered why anybody would ever use a human street name if they had a subgenius name.

605
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:47,660
True.

606
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,440
Yeah, why use your slave name?

607
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,140
Right.

608
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,800
Like, the first time I saw somebody called Dr. Legume, Kenny,

609
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,660
I wanted to puke.

610
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,640
And the time that people started calling Pope Sternodocs instead of saying,

611
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,860
Oh, hey, Pope Sternodocs, Pope of all Arkansas.

612
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,020
They go, Hey, Mike.

613
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:09,980
Why?

614
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,480
It certainly does take a lot of nerve slack off of it, doesn't it?

615
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,180
No kidding, man.

616
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:14,880
I mean, why?

617
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,400
You know, why blame...

618
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,980
Same things on Satan when you can blame him on Bob.

619
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,600
And you can also...

620
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,300
You know, with Bob, you got Satan and Jesus rolled into one.

621
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,720
You can thank Bob for good stuff and blame him for the bad stuff.

622
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,060
Same thing that one guy's blaming him for, another person be thanking him for.

623
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,020
It's like a Braxis, as bold as a love wrench.

624
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:43,120
The same kind of handle we used to put on our animals, not the children, not our actual offspring,

625
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
but our kind of offspring and stuff like that.

626
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,520
It's like they're pet names.

627
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,360
They're Oogly.

628
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,720
They're the Oogly names that we give them.

629
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,960
Maybe that's not right.

630
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,860
Did you just say Oogly Googly?

631
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,500
Yeah, you know, like...

632
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,080
You know, when you're talking to a small child, like,

633
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,820
and trying to stick your thumb down their throat.

634
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,280
I thought it was like that Barney Google with the Googly Eyes song.

635
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,520
Well, that was not a real song.

636
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,060
That was just a transmission from outer space that everybody in the 40s...

637
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,860
They think it was the SS was doing it.

638
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,400
But you're not going to let that happen.

639
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,240
It was the OSS.

640
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,080
The progenitors of the CIA let anything like that.

641
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,380
That Barney Google was just a transmission.

642
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,560
Ah, okay.

643
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,760
I was thinking of the great Oogly Boogly from that wonderful movie that we saw.

644
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,580
Zontar.

645
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,220
Yeah, that's right.

646
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,020
It was Zontar.

647
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,640
It was made by that guy Tarsier something.

648
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,120
What's the...

649
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,060
The wall or the face or...

650
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,340
What's the name of that movie?

651
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,240
That's a great movie.

652
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,760
Oh, well.

653
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,880
Oh, well.

654
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,040
Yeah, oh, well.

655
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,400
Oh, God.

656
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:47,820
Better forgotten.

657
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,840
Oh, well.

658
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:48,940
Dead air.

659
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,600
Names that don't emerge when they're supposed to.

660
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,180
It's like a misdirection.

661
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,980
It's like being unable to procreate at the correct response time.

662
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,240
Maybe.

663
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,920
Well...

664
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,140
I'm sorry.

665
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,860
I know what you mean, man.

666
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,520
When you're under pressure, sometimes that's...

667
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,060
It's like...

668
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,120
Then you can't do it.

669
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,280
You know, if everybody...

670
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,580
It's like they're looking at you and they're waiting for you.

671
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,440
And you just...

672
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,080
You get all pee shy is what happens.

673
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,740
Yeah, pee shy.

674
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,080
You know, pity.

675
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,420
Pity the pee shy.

676
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,860
It's as if everyone in India was suddenly starving and staring right at you with big, big eyes.

677
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,240
Right.

678
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,700
You can't finish that sandwich.

679
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,300
You're in the end.

680
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:27,960
I'm starving.

681
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,720
Right.

682
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,120
That should put you off your food.

683
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,300
Yeah, at least you got some.

684
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,000
Right.

685
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,940
You thank Bob for that.

686
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,440
You can blame Bob that others don't have it.

687
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,400
That they don't have it.

688
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:37,720
Right.

689
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,000
Or you can thank Bob that they don't have it.

690
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,900
That's the whole point.

691
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,980
It's good, bad, bad, good.

692
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,180
That's the beauty part.

693
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,180
Or the ugly part, as some would count.

694
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,500
The beauty.

695
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,520
Yeah, the sandwich could have the air get.

696
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,740
Who could sandwich?

697
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,360
Yes.

698
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,700
That guy's goofy.

699
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,860
Don't listen to him anymore.

700
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,300
He's listening to invisible transmissions at all times, too.

701
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,700
He's sequestered and quartered.

702
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,440
Just check his underwear sometime.

703
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,180
Reverend Sandwich.

704
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,260
They have all the proof right there.

705
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,360
Everything you need to know.

706
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,740
I'd actually rather not check his underwear, but...

707
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,660
Reverend Earl Sandwich.

708
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,380
That'd be a good church name for somebody.

709
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,320
He's the guy that invented the colloquialism in the drive-in movie, I think.

710
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,960
Isn't he?

711
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,340
Here's a good church name somebody could use.

712
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,820
Reverend Franklin I. Dengivadam.

713
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,080
Hmm.

714
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,340
A little too lackadaisical.

715
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,120
Reverend Don Quixote.

716
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,060
How's that?

717
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,500
A little more romantic, perhaps, but still, you know, he's full of wind.

718
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,000
Like those windmills.

719
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,120
And aren't we all like Don Quixote friends, tilting away at the impossible dream?

720
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,860
Of getting paid to sit around doing nothing?

721
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,100
Getting the hell off this planet.

722
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:58,220
Well, yeah, but in the meantime, until X-Day, the impossible, the dream.

723
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,200
What is the dream?

724
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,220
To get paid for sitting around doing nothing.

725
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,000
Right?

726
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:03,820
Right.

727
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:09,440
Now, I know some people who the government pays them to stay home and take their medicine.

728
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,100
How do I get in on that?

729
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,060
Just go in there and say you need some medicine.

730
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,480
They'll be glad to hook you right up.

731
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,520
That has never worked for me, and believe me, I've tried it.

732
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,040
Maybe I'm trying the wrong doctors.

733
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,260
You are, because you have to understand that America's based on money.

734
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,960
And somebody's going to make money off you getting a prescription for being crazy and staying home and getting another check.

735
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,700
America's based on money?

736
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,360
Yes.

737
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,660
I thought it was based on the love of country and freedom and...

738
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,200
And liberty and all that stuff.

739
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,420
Yeah, and liberty fries.

740
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,880
No, well, liberty fries are a very integral, important part of it.

741
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,140
And burgers.

742
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,040
Burgers.

743
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,380
Burgers are in there, too.

744
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,860
Apple pie.

745
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,340
Apple pie, too.

746
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,600
All the comestibles are involved, but the conglomerates control that, too.

747
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,440
That's why our diets were so bad when we were little in Texas.

748
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,820
It's their fault, even though we can blame Bob for it.

749
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,300
You can blame Bob and the conspiracy.

750
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,000
But you can't thank the conspiracy for very much.

751
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,660
You can thank it for us having something to hate.

752
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,980
I mean, where'd we be if it weren't for the conspiracy?

753
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,780
We'd just be...

754
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,080
Perfectly happy.

755
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,220
We'd be normal.

756
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,000
Everything would be regular.

757
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,200
No gritting your teeth, no slamming your hand against the driver's wheel,

758
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,460
screaming at the person in front of you and blaming Bob and the conspiracy for it.

759
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,240
And it is the conspiracy's fault that you grit your teeth and bang the wheel.

760
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:34,900
Isn't it?

761
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,120
It is.

762
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,600
Princess, we would know.

763
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,840
She's the one who does all the teeth gritting and wheel grabbing.

764
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,260
Because she's the designated driver most of the time.

765
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,660
Shout obscenities and pull out a Tech-9 and fire it in the air.

766
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,200
Only if I'm sitting in the passenger seat.

767
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,580
I throw invisible bombs at the other cars and imagine that they're blowing up.

768
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,240
Now, have you ever tried to use the secret mind death ray?

769
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:09,260
You strap that baby on the back of your head and you just like stare at the car that you want to blow up in front of you or to evaporate.

770
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,780
I like that.

771
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,060
You get those in Ohio?

772
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:11,900
Yeah.

773
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,500
They take a little bit longer than the ones from Texas.

774
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,960
Sometimes you have to wait a whole week.

775
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,940
You have to follow the guy.

776
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:23,800
I thought Texas and Florida were the only places where those were legal for civilians.

777
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,000
Well, they haven't made a law against them yet.

778
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:40,000
So the police can stop you and ask you if you have the invisible mind death ray and point the flashlight around the back of the car and stuff like that and go, you know, and check your license for a real long time.

779
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,240
And then that car just disappears, right?

780
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,460
It just makes them out of reality.

781
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,760
It's like a neutron.

782
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,400
It's like a neutron bomb thing.

783
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,920
The person is left there bare naked, but the car and the clothing and everything else is gone.

784
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,420
Uh-huh.

785
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:58,400
Dave, did I tell you that Princess Wee and I both got pulled over by the cops on our own street?

786
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,960
In fact, I got pulled over in my driveway.

787
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,220
She got pulled over for speeding.

788
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,000
Were you speeding in your driveway?

789
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,740
She was speeding out of the driveway and I was parking in the driveway, but I was doing it with a car that was out of registration.

790
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,920
And you know what?

791
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:24,320
When a car is out of registration, it's like the picture jumps all over the place and you see the frame lines and sometimes the sprocket holes.

792
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,180
It jumps right out of the gate sometimes.

793
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,400
So you were backing out and conveniently...

794
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,780
The county law was right behind me.

795
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,240
The man.

796
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:35,820
Yeah.

797
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,580
And he just turned on his...

798
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:44,340
He did not have to go to the coffee shop and try and think of what he was going to do today.

799
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:44,920
No.

800
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,660
No.

801
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,920
He didn't have to go very far.

802
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:46,920


803
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:46,920


804
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,380
No donuts for him.

805
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,100
Neither did I.

806
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:57,940
So I have to go get my car registered tomorrow and pay $100 or, you know, go to jail for...

807
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:03,560
Think of the old days when Dobbs would provide you with a car when anything would happen just like that.

808
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,440
Those were the real old days.

809
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,740
Everything changed after 9-11, man.

810
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,480
Man, where did he go after 9-11?

811
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,480
I'm not saying he was involved in any way, but there's a conspiracy theory.

812
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,200
If nobody's really seen him...

813
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,680
I mean, nobody's really seen him for a long time, but nobody's really, really seen him since 9-11.

814
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,800
Well, except the...

815
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,860
No, let's not go there.

816
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,720
That's not funny.

817
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,780
Wait a minute.

818
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,720
Is it funny yet?

819
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,120
It's been how many years?

820
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,940
That was 2001.

821
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,180
It's been eight years.

822
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,440
Can it be funny yet?

823
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,700
I don't know.

824
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,960
If we assume the aliens were involved, we can get out of whether it's funny or not.

825
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,440
People can make up their own minds whether it's funny or not.

826
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,280
Oh.

827
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:46,920
You know what this...

828
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,080
You know what I mean?

829
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,180
Like a free floater?

830
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,700
I don't even think the aliens are funny anymore.

831
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,440
I've been doing this too long.

832
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,520
Well, they haven't treated you very well, so I can see...

833
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,040
I think my neighbors are funny.

834
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,940
They could be aliens.

835
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,400
The aliens seem almost normal to me.

836
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,440
I can almost understand.

837
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,360
It's the humans shopping around me.

838
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,040
Yeah.

839
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,500
The great...

840
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,020
The great homo...

841
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,220
Those are the greys.

842
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,780
If you ask me,

843
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,460
the aliens...

844
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,540
The aliens are kind of greenish.

845
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,940
My neighbors are grey.

846
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,240
What did Mr. Sister said something about...

847
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:30,160
Cleveland is usually kind of grey in the 50s.

848
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,960
Much like most of its inhabitants.

849
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,040
Yeah, real funny.

850
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,580
Speaking of Cleveland inhabitants that are grey and in their 50s,

851
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:46,180
Harvey Pekar will be a speaker at Starwood this year.

852
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:46,240
Oh, cool.

853
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:46,600
Yeah.

854
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,620
And they had me call him up to invite him.

855
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,980
And oddly enough, he recognized the Church of the Subgenius name.

856
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,660
And we have friends in common.

857
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,300
You should have told him you played bass for Bugs Bixby in 1942.

858
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,140
That's the thing, though.

859
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,400
See, I can't talk that jazz, that old-timey music stuff.

860
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
I'm not up on that.

861
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,480
And I wanted to say...

862
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,460
I wanted to say...

863
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,100
I think I got the first issue of your comic,

864
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,520
but I couldn't remember the name of American Splendor

865
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,200
right when I was talking to the guy.

866
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,060
So I didn't say it.

867
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,460
And here's the other thing.

868
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,480
Then I would have had to say,

869
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:32,200
but I don't think I have many of the other issues after the first one.

870
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,620
Which would be like what we hear all the time, Dave.

871
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,700
Where they go,

872
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,960
oh, yeah, our slack.

873
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,500
I used to listen to that when I was in high school, man.

874
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,040
And the guy who's saying it is 35 years old.

875
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,880
Has grey hair.

876
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,800
And looks 50.

877
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,300
Yeah.

878
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,020
And we go, it's still on.

879
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,880
And my back hurts.

880
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,580
You can still listen to it.

881
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,680
It'll be almost like high school.

882
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,420
What you're supposed to do is wipe away a tear and go,

883
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,420
oh, them were the days, kid.

884
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,620
Them were the days.

885
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,860
Who else is going to be at X-Day?

886
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,820
Priestess Pisces will be ranting at X-Day.

887
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,600
Reverend Carter LeBlanc.

888
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,160
The...

889
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,560
The...

890
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:15,840
The...

891
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:15,860
The...

892
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:15,880


893
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,840
Who's like the new Pope David and Meyer type preacher.

894
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,240
He will be at X-Day.

895
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,600
Will you be at X-Day, my friend?

896
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,820
Or will you pink out and go,

897
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,420
well, I'll just go next year.

898
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,320
I know it's only two hours away from Cleveland or wherever I live.

899
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,320
I know it's only a thousand,

900
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,800
a few thousand dollars worth of plane trips away from me,

901
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,300
but I'll go next year when the economy's better.

902
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,020
Friend,

903
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,700
this is going to...

904
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,860
There ain't going to be any more X-Day.

905
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,120
There's going to be no more X-Days if, if, if this is,

906
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,100
if this year happens to turn out to have been 1998.

907
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,480
We've got our toes crossed.

908
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,820
We've got our knuckles crossed.

909
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,520
And believe me, there's a lot of psychic energy

910
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,260
in making sure that this year things really get off the ground.

911
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,560
Andrew the Impaled will be at X-Day.

912
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,160
Andrew the Impaled is an actual sideshow marvel

913
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,740
who impales himself.

914
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,660
He sets himself on fire.

915
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,460
He breathes fire.

916
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,780
He eats glass.

917
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,380
He eats, yes, he eats light bulbs.

918
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,280
And I've, we, we went on tour with Andrew the Impaled

919
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,400
on Circus Apocalypse,

920
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:29,000
and not one show happened that somebody didn't faint

921
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,760
watching Andrew impale himself.

922
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,700
It's pretty painful to watch.

923
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,620
And Dr. Hal will be at X-Day.

924
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,960
Dr. Hal Robbins?

925
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,340
Dr. Hal Robbins, famous of the show,

926
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,460
the Puzzling Evidence Show and AskDrHal.com.

927
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,870
Will be there, ranting and answering.

928
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,750
And a file I can't make it.

929
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:59,630
Did I mention that Princess We Are Doe will be there?

930
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,850
You certainly did not.

931
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,110
Did I mention that Reverend Ramona Backitonup

932
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,630
and Sifu will be there?

933
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,110
Reverend Backitonup is the big boss of this area.

934
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,630
She sure is.

935
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,890
You know that.

936
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,570
Doc Frop and Sister Decadent.

937
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,070
The parents acted like they were gonna come.

938
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,990
We're just concentrating positively on that.

939
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:24,410
Yeah.

940
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,270
So it's gonna be, you know,

941
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:29,490
and I've gotten quite a few pre-registrations

942
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,390
from complete and utter strangers.

943
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,650
And they are pretty strange.

944
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:36,030
And I think we've managed to run off

945
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:39,950
most of the really obnoxious jerks over the years.

946
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,090
And we may get some new obnoxious jerks this year.

947
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,310
Sure, of course.

948
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,210
We were bound to.

949
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,390
There are rumors and speculation

950
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:50,630
that some of these obnoxious ne'er-do-wells,

951
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,810
these fidens...

952
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,330
I'm talking about the kind that aren't funny.

953
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:56,350
Obnoxious jerks that are funny, that's X Day.

954
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,170
That's Church of the Sub-Genius.

955
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,370
We roll on the red carpet.

956
00:42:59,550 --> 00:42:59,850
Right.

957
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,970
But I'm talking about unfunny obnoxious jerks.

958
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:05,710
But the rumor is that some of these unfunny,

959
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,370
unregistered jerks are gonna be having their own anti-X Day,

960
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:13,770
perhaps a Y Day or some other letter-name thing.

961
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,690
And that they're going to be having anti-devivals,

962
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,470
anti-rants.

963
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,090
That's fine with me.

964
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,510
Well, I was just hoping they would go over

965
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,050
and beat the crap out of some of them.

966
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,670
They can do whatever the hell they want.

967
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,270
Let them anti-Sub-Genius all they want.

968
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,710
I'm tired of it.

969
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,230
Go and pick me up one of them pitchforks

970
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,130
and go on over there and whoop some hiney.

971
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,590
We'll be having hayrides.

972
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:43,750
I mean, this is...

973
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,930
This is a campground that used to be an apple farm or something.

974
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:51,070
Pre- and post-coital hayrides.

975
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:51,590
Right.

976
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,350
And there's a...

977
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,210
Well, we'll be doing the naked baptism

978
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,010
where we baptize everybody.

979
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,490
No frog watchers.

980
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,950
Pursuit shavings for those on the hairy side,

981
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,390
those who like to sleep on the left.

982
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,970
Right. Free shavings.

983
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,110
Free shavings.

984
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,910
Healings and sickenings of any...

985
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:16,150
She's pretty much any malaisement or maldemage you might have.

986
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,950
Oh, and there'll be the Buldada auction

987
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:23,230
where strange things of all kinds are auctioned off

988
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,490
for the good of the church.

989
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:27,830
The church of the sub-genius, friends.

990
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,610
That's the religion we're talking about

991
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:32,550
if you just tuned in and never heard of any of this stuff before.

992
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,990
It's the one true religion.

993
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:39,370
It doesn't rely on a stone edifice to create truth.

994
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:39,890
No.

995
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:43,310
It is, well, I don't know if it's true or not, but...

996
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,590
It doesn't matter if it's true or not.

997
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,870
In fact, it's not true.

998
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,310
We admit right up front that it's a bunch of hogwash,

999
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,890
which makes it the one true religion.

1000
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,390
The only honest one.

1001
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,830
The only one that's telling the truth.

1002
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,230
It's the only one that's tipping the scales.

1003
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,490
It's a bunch of hooey.

1004
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:02,610
Yeah.

1005
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:06,130
And it's Bob and it's Slack.

1006
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,710
And that's why we have Slack,

1007
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,870
is because it's a bunch of hooey.

1008
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:11,130
And hogwash.

1009
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:12,210
And bunkum.

1010
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,210
BUNKUM, I tell you!

1011
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:16,850
Where would we be without such bunkum?

1012
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,670
This bunkum is no vice.

1013
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,250
This bunkum is a virtue.

1014
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:25,710
In the form of heroism, in the old classical way.

1015
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:31,910
We look to a rather distant future where things kind of almost shut up.

1016
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:39,870
Well, you know, Dave, I'm thinking that we have ten minutes left.

1017
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:40,730
Ten minutes left in the show.

1018
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,130
And there's a couple of lovely songs that I should play.

1019
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:48,210
And a wonderful Suzy collage that should pump them up too.

1020
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,010
Are they dirty enough?

1021
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,030
Mmm...

1022
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:52,950
Well, you...

1023
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,650
You know, Suzy the floozy did them, so, you know, take it from there, Dave.

1024
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:57,990
No, they're not dirty.

1025
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:58,490
They're clean.

1026
00:45:58,570 --> 00:45:59,090
They're pure.

1027
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,590
It's the pure...

1028
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:01,110
It's Suzy the floozy.

1029
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:01,730
It's filthy.

1030
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:03,470
Pure flooze.

1031
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:04,710
It's filth.

1032
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:06,810
It's filth.

1033
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:08,870
And if any good patriotic...

1034
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,170
Patriotic...

1035
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:14,530
Illiquid or bonsai native...

1036
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:19,450
Any eluge or eskimos...

1037
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:24,050
Please, please report to the third floor.

1038
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,890
Because Suzy the floozy is filthy.

1039
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,030
At subgenius.com.

1040
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:35,790
Yes, you can experience the filth of Reverend Suzy the floozy.

1041
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:36,350
Actually...

1042
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:43,430
Listeners of WREK.org in Atlanta...

1043
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:44,650
Those lucky listeners.

1044
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:52,050
Can hear the weekly Bob Slacktime Funhouse show online.

1045
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:54,770
And I would...

1046
00:46:54,770 --> 00:47:04,190
Can I strongly urge people to listen to another nonprofit station?

1047
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:05,770
If it's nonprofit...

1048
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,490
I don't know if that's...

1049
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:08,510
I don't know if it...

1050
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:14,550
You could say we support all nonprofit on college and alternative stations around the

1051
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:14,690
country.

1052
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:15,530
But that would be a lie.

1053
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:18,870
Because we only support the ones that runs a genius program.

1054
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,730
Well, so what's so difficult about lying?

1055
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,650
If you've done it once, you can do it again.

1056
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,630
That's only about 25 stations.

1057
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:32,970
Now, there's probably several hundred college stations, but most of them are little imitation

1058
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:33,770
conspiracy stations.

1059
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,180
They're learning how to play classic rock in a drive time mode.

1060
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,520
You know, that's what they teach kids these days.

1061
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,960
That's what they teach them in school.

1062
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:48,500
They don't teach them about evolution or creationism or where Bob came from.

1063
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,080
They just teach them how to be little conspiracy FM DJs.

1064
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,440
That's all they teach them in school nowadays.

1065
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,080
And sex.

1066
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,500
Rock it away to the ID.

1067
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:56,980
All sex.

1068
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,620
That's the other thing they teach them in school.

1069
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,180
That's what I heard on the radio.

1070
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,200
They teach them that?

1071
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:02,900
No.

1072
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,640
They teach them that the media is controlled by liberals.

1073
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,480
That's all I've ever heard on the damn media.

1074
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,780
As a matter of fact, every time I turn on the radio, that's all they're saying.

1075
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,680
Well, then those guys that are saying that are the media.

1076
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,720
Never mind.

1077
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:24,020
Well, Dave, the point is I'm going to we're slowly working our way.

1078
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,920
Well, maybe I don't need to cut you off.

1079
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:32,040
I was going to read about castratos and eunuchs tonight, but I'm I decided not to.

1080
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:32,880
I couldn't miss that.

1081
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,700
You know, considering my condition.

1082
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,740
Yeah, I didn't want to rub it in, so to speak.

1083
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:43,800
Well, I could make like a thing in the background once in a while.

1084
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,900
There was in in the movie Baron Munchausen.

1085
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:56,240
There's a wonderful song called A Eunuch's Life is Hard that a folly the Sultan plays.

1086
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:02,880
He has a special organ that it pokes prisoners when he hits the ground.

1087
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:07,840
And when he hits each key, a different prisoner is poked with a sharp stick and screams at

1088
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,600
a different pitch.

1089
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:16,800
And he and he's written this opera called A Eunuch's Life is Hard, which is kind of

1090
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,880
ironical, you know.

1091
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:25,900
Although the point of my eunuch article that I was thinking about reading was that it's

1092
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:30,500
not exactly that it grows back, but sometimes they can still do stuff.

1093
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:35,240
Even if you remove the sack.

1094
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:42,500
Well, because so much of it is in the mind, you know, it's the brain is the dirtiest,

1095
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,520
filthiest organ, even filthier than Susie the floozy.

1096
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:53,260
Your brain, anyone's brain is filthier than everything except Susie the floozy's brain.

1097
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:59,120
As long as we can keep our brains from being castrated, then we can stay right in there,

1098
00:49:59,200 --> 00:49:59,800
so to speak.

1099
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,140
Is that what you're saying?

1100
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,180
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

1101
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,680
But it doesn't really matter.

1102
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,280
Chinese generals were unique eunuchs.

1103
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,700
There must be something to this eunuchism.

1104
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:20,960
Well, and also there is subgenius.com.

1105
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:26,700
And that's where you can find out everything you need to know about Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1106
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,920
who has just called in.

1107
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,520
Dave, you weren't playing.

1108
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,140
Your band, the Mondo Retardo band, hasn't rehearsed in five years, so you're not going to be playing,

1109
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:36,540
are you?

1110
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,680
Not five, it's three.

1111
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,700
But jamming may happen.

1112
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,100
Well, I would hope so.

1113
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,440
And yeah, everybody jams at Exeter.

1114
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,960
I'll have to pouty this time.

1115
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,080
Maybe that will work.

1116
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,320
That's what the real big stars do.

1117
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,120
That's the secret to success in Hollywood, acting pouty.

1118
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,220
But we have to have the subgenius anthem.

1119
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,360
And we can't have that without Dave.

1120
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,340
So it's going to have to happen.

1121
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,840
We need the antlers, too.

1122
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,860
We need all the whole getup and everything.

1123
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,280
Yeah, the antlers, right.

1124
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,200
The horns, the tail.

1125
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,260
The hooves.

1126
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,540
The wings.

1127
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,160
Don't forget the hooves.

1128
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:11,540
Right.

1129
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:11,920
Yep.

1130
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,860
At least that's the way I'd like to do it.

1131
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,500
I could be quiet now while you're playing Shoozy the Floozy as a Chinese.

1132
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,700
Oh, do you want to just listen?

1133
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,860
You want to just listen in the background here?

1134
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,940
We'll pull down this wonderful music, which was wonderful.

1135
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,580
My music, by the way.

1136
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,780
I actually made that using stolen loops.

1137
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,680
And you can see little music videos of those on my YouTube channel, Rev Stang.

1138
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,040
Heh.

1139
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:46,900
But here, speaking of the filthy Shoozy the Floozy, is the work of the filthy Shoozy the Floozy.

1140
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,120
So we're living in a real crazy world, my friends.

1141
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:54,440
We're living in a world where everyone is crying out for deliverance.

1142
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,920
Now, many times you will see the people who are crying out for deliverance.

1143
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,360
I remember the first president standing there in the Rose Garden with two of these smiling

1144
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,760
men from the East on each side.

1145
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,400
One has got a table cloth on his head, and he poses, they smile, and then they put the

1146
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,060
newspaper, uh, peace.

1147
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,600
I've got no problem with the peace treaties that they sign.

1148
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,180
I have a problem with the people who sign the peace treaties.

1149
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,600
Uh, that's reality.

1150
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,600
George, you should be ashamed of yourself.

1151
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,160
And how.

1152
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:24,900
Recently, another 400 scientists, scholars, businessmen, and political leaders met in

1153
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,900
Texas to ponder the problems of the world.

1154
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,480
They said, it is a gloomy world indeed.

1155
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,680
The energy crisis, famine, the financial problems of New York City, drug abuse, and other unrelated

1156
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,220
problems are all portents of the present darkness.

1157
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,980
And the Bible says, I am the God of hell fire, and I bring you fire.

1158
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,220
Certain destruction cometh upon them, and they shall not escape.

1159
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,600
That's what the Bible says here.

1160
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,660
There shall be famine, pestilences, and different places.

1161
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,460
And I don't have to tell you these things.

1162
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:01,840
You know, if there ever is a time that Bible prophecy is confirmed right before our eyes

1163
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,940
have met, places, pestilences, and things like that.

1164
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,620
Yeah, now the boss says this is a very bad thing for the country.

1165
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:12,980
See, because this contract starts after the war.

1166
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:21,320
Now, the boss has got an idea with all this Nazi and Jap money that, uh, well, I haven't

1167
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,600
got it quite straight, but anyway, the boss says it's a bad thing for the country.

1168
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,440
So far, you've told me what I'm supposed to do.

1169
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,460
Well, I'm going to tell you what the boss has found out.

1170
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,500
What did you find out?

1171
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,780
I don't need the terrorists.

1172
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,860
Boy, you're hotter than a firecracker on the 5th of July.

1173
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,000
Who is it?

1174
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,120
All right.

1175
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,240
Listen up, everyone.

1176
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,540
I want you to calmly file towards the exit.

1177
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,560
That's it.

1178
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,360
That's it.

1179
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,580
Nobody runs.

1180
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,280
Just walk.

1181
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,500
Single file.

1182
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:46,840
That's it.

1183
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:51,780
Now, if we just stay calm, no one's going to be harmed by the huge bomb that's going

1184
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,860
to explode any minute.

1185
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:53,780
Oh, yeah.

1186
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:54,800
Oh, yeah.

1187
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,420
Oh, yeah.

1188
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:56,420


1189
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:56,420


1190
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:56,420


1191
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:56,420


1192
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:56,420


1193
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:56,420


1194
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:56,420


1195
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:56,420


1196
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:56,420


1197
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,000
Now, the world is getting out of hand.

1198
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,240
Yes?

1199
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,380
Excuse me.

1200
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,840
I believe I left a pipe and, uh, some books.

1201
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,120
Oh, they're right here.

1202
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:14,120
This is my lucky pipe, and I didn't want to leave it behind.

1203
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,240
I understand.

1204
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:15,900
You're going away.

1205
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:16,620
That's right.

1206
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,980
I've got to start banking right now.

1207
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,360
You're a blithering coward!

1208
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,500
Bigä»”, F*** your ass up.

1209
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,900
Is all the sire discussing my departure?

1210
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:26,400
The fuck?

1211
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:30,820
The secret won't keep for long, of course, but at present it is, I think, known only to us conspirators.

1212
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,920
And we're not going to let you escape so easily.

1213
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,080
But I must go. It cannot be helped.

1214
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,380
You're lying.

1215
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,660
Maybe he's not.

1216
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,280
I know him. Look at his face. He's lying.

1217
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,860
All right, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think.

1218
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,620
All right. This place is going up.

1219
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,080
Well, if I'm going out, I'm going out happy.

1220
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:54,500
Before we're all blown to bits, mind if I pull the underwear out of my crack?

1221
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,220
The man's got to go comfortable.

1222
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,340
All right, but that's it.

1223
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,340
God, I hate that guy.

1224
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,880
I don't believe it.

1225
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,640
You want the truth or not?

1226
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,680
Didn't the police mention it? Say anything about it?

1227
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,940
Bob, no.

1228
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:08,920
No?

1229
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,020
What did he look like?

1230
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,660
Looked like what?

1231
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,220
He looked like a man, of course. What do you suppose?

1232
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:15,860
Uh-huh.

1233
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,180
Oh, yes, yes.

1234
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,940
He looked like a man.

1235
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,800
He's a queer bunny.

1236
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,100
Nobody believes me.

1237
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,400
Even my cobbler.

1238
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,220
My colleagues wouldn't believe me.

1239
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,480
Poor man. Poor man.

1240
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,020
He's insane, that's what he is.

1241
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,080
He believes it. He must be insane.

1242
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:40,600
The fools. Can't they understand me?

1243
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:44,720
Tell me something. Am I mad? Tell me.

1244
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,660
X-Day is here. The mountains fall.

1245
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,160
I cringe and hide.

1246
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,660
I hide my head.

1247
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,300
I never send in my 30 bucks.

1248
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,900
My soul is filled with dread.

1249
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,080
Oh, Bob, just let me live.

1250
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,820
And all that is mine I most surely will give.

1251
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,680
Oh, lift me away on your bright saucership

1252
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,560
to my subgenius home.

1253
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,920
Oh, Bob.

1254
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,860
Oh, bear me away on your bright shining ship

1255
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:32,320
to my subgenius home.

1256
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,640
I laughed at Bob.

1257
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,700
Ah, woe is me.

1258
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,440
I thirst for slack in vain.

1259
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,180
Now he still grins and smokes his pipe.

1260
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,360
I must have been insane.

1261
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:55,140
Oh, Bob, just let me live.

1262
00:56:55,160 --> 00:57:00,600
And all that is mine I most surely will give.

1263
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:04,860
Oh, lift me away on your bright saucership

1264
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:08,280
to my subgenius home.

1265
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,620
Oh, bear me away on your bright shining ship

1266
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:17,100
to my subgenius home.

1267
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,600
I saw the pinks and normals flee.

1268
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,140
The dreadful heartless men of the world.

1269
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,160
They were the first to harvest from the sky.

1270
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,140
They perished like the melting snow.

1271
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:35,100
Yet not a one knows why.

1272
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,040
Oh, Bob, just let me live.

1273
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:44,600
And all that is mine I most surely will give.

1274
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:49,020
Oh, lift me away on your bright saucership

1275
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:52,280
to my subgenius home.

1276
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,120
Oh, bear me away on your bright saucership

1277
00:57:55,140 --> 00:58:00,960
to my subgenius home.

1278
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:06,060
The towers of the proud did fall.

1279
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,600
There was no shelter from that storm.

1280
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:15,240
While far above subgeniuses watched

1281
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,620
in comfort safe and warm.

1282
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,540
It was a dream.

1283
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:25,120
But then I woke the ruptured sun.

1284
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,120


1285
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,120


1286
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,120


1287
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,120


1288
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,120


1289
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,120


1290
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,120


1291
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:33,740
And I realized that it was just a dream.

1292
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,660
And I thought,

1293
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:40,120
Oh, Bob, I'm going to be a hero.

1294
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,240
And I thought,

1295
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:51,820
Oh, I'm going to be a hero.

1296
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,240
I was a hero.

1297
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,100


1298
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,900
I am a hero.

1299
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,280
I know my idols.

1300
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:00,600
I am a hero.

1301
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:00,620
I'm a hero.

1302
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:00,620


1303
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,460
I only represent it as a dream.

1304
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,180
Irock commentator ...

1305
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:06,180


1306
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:10,500
the Dasby owned and established

1307
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,680
Thisfang expects to be a genius.

1308
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:13,680


1309
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,300
Â¿CÃ³mo ë‚´ê°€ un singer de mon genio?

1310
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:15,960
y este ,

1311
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,900
even my rebirth in the dark?

1312
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,020
So, so, so, so, so.
