1
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,100
I see the greed.

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,660
I see the self-centeredness.

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,200
I see the avarice that brought them down.

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,500
And now, here they come, our hosts and hostess.

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,660
Take off your jacket, your tie, loosen any belts you might have.

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,020
Take off your shoes.

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,220
Make yourself really, really comfortable.

8
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,800
If there's anything at all in your clothing that's tight, loosen it up.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,820
Select a floor that has a rug and spread it.

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,480
.

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:57,480


12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,180
.

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,180


14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,180


15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,180


16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,180


17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,180


18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,180


19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,180


20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,600
Bob will begin to move onshore, though, again tonight and spread with it lots of rain,

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,020
up to seven inches of rain for the folks in the Carolinas.

22
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,580
For Saturday, a better day.

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,260
Sunday, a better day still.

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,740
Bob will begin to move onshore, though, again tonight.

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,560
.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,400
Take him with that pin.

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,180
.

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,960
Hey, guys, you big ol' bull butters.

29

and home

38
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,540
I tell you to listen to the subgenius hour of slack with your ascended host, the cyborg

39
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,580
handyman, Reverend Ivan Stang, the lovely Robert Bob Dobbs, and an ectoplasmic cast

40
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,200
of billions.

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,500
This lively little ongoing saga features exotic humor and skull-powering music that was not

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,220
only banned in Boston, but noobs in Newark.

43
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,600
You'll be down on your hands and knees looking for your lost brain after just one cat-sterilizing

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,580
dose of...

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,840
The subgenius hour of slack.

46
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,880
It's time for God's people to come out of the closets, out of the churches, and change

47
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,640
America.

48
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,280
That I endorse you and what you are doing.

49
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:51,340
And so the world continued to dance through another war, and with a murderous song in

50
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,860
its heart.

51
00:02:51,860 --> 00:03:00,200
Accompanied by the propeller blades, this benevolent mankind used his greatest intellectual

52
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:07,400
invention of the airplane to deliver one of my greatest, boldest, most spectacular

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,980
triumphs.

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,440
Subgenius Radio Ministry.

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
Hour of Slack.

56
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,820
Subgenius Radio Ministry.

57
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,760
Welcome, human.

58
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,220
Welcome, human.

59
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,720
To the hour...

60
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,100
Of Slack.

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,060
Of Slack.

62
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,980
Of Slack.

63
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,680
Of Slack.

64
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,100
I'm glad you could all make it.

65
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:59,540
I'd like to now introduce the man who came to host our show.

66
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:08,920
His illustrious career is known by everyone here, and we're so glad he could make it.

67
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,780
Ladies and gentlemen, Ivan Stang.

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,880
Ah.

69
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,840
Ah.

70
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:16,780
Ah.

71
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,740
Ah.

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,840
Ah.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,240
Ah.

74
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,460
Ah.

75
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:19,620
Ah.

76
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:19,620


77
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:19,880
Ah.

78
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,040


79
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,040


80
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,160
Ah.

81
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,540
Oh, the old remarkable man.

82
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,500
Oh, what aquijole.

83
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,040
I can do anything with this.

84
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,040


85
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,040


86
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:48,080
I know that man값tugas rocks packages.

87
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,620
I'll take your time,

88
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,080
aroo.

89
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,080


90
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,680
I do. I do indeed.

91
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,200
Continue, and without interruption.

92
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,100
Man was created in the image of God, but there the similarity ends.

93
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,680
And Jim Baker's PTL television ministry was the fastest growing phenomenon in religious broadcasting.

94
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:20,600
I'm sick and tired of hearing about all of the radicals, and the perverts, and the liberals.

95
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,060
And the leftists, and the communists coming out of the closets.

96
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,700
It's time for God's people to come out of the closets, out of the churches, and change America.

97
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,960
And change America.

98
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,680
And change America.

99
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:42,300
Yeah, we want your back, Bob.

100
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,020
Bring some of that crap here with you.

101
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,700
Come on.

102
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,060
I said this.

103
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,440
The next time you come back, bring more pills.

104
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,060
Mortal, not immortal, are we.

105
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,300
Of the flesh, not of the spirit, are we.

106
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,240
Human, not godlike, are we.

107
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,880
But whatever our sins, whatever our shortcomings,

108
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,380
we believe the good deeds done by man on earth far outweigh the bad.

109
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,760
Thereby earning him the right to survive.

110
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,180
Objection.

111
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,820
Okay, that's it for stupid human tricks.

112
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,300
Boy, what a curious assortment tonight.

113
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,500
That's not Bob.

114
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,200
No, it's Bob.

115
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,380
Where's Bob?

116
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,160
There's Bob.

117
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,660
He's hiding.

118
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,340
Let's go up.

119
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:32,960
Let's go up to Bob.

120
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,780
Go on up there.

121
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,420
He's not dead.

122
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,500
Aw, not again.

123
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,900
Every one of them!

124
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,400
Oh!

125
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,740
That could get too lame!

126
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,920
and touching him.

127
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,240
You have to look at the job

128
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,280
and saying that this dead man

129
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,680
is going to be a half an hour late.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,380
Are you sitting comfortably?

131
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,180
Ah!

132
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,300
Ha ha ha ha ha!

133
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,720
What's your problem?

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,020
What's your problem?

135
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,060
What's your problem?

136
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,400
What's your problem?

137
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,620
What's your problem?

138
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,860
What's your problem?

139
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:16,900
What's your problem?

140
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,660
I'm trying to scratch my

141
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,180
problem.

142
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,100
I just can't reach it.

143
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,060
I just can't reach it.

144
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,440


145
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,340
I said I'm going to stretch

146
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,360
my problem.

147
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,120
I enjoyed the hell out of that.

148
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,360
You know, the doctor music

149
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,000
trend and anti-music

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,280
has a lot to do with noise, not music, too.

151
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:46,860
Hey!

152
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,320
Bye.

153
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,280
I know, but the problem with doctor bands

154
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,780
and anti-music bands is sooner or later

155
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,680
they learn how to play those instruments.

156
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,200
Ha ha ha ha ha!

157
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,300
All right.

158
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,900
You're going to wake yourself up.

159
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,120
Oh!

160
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,920
Yes.

161
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,220
It's when the person gets on stage

162
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,060
and lets Bob speak through it

163
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,420
and just,

164
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,220
it cuts loose.

165
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,140
It's the living tongue acting on him.

166
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,680
Exactly.

167
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,220
It's the undirected energy of Bob

168
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,300
spewing forth through the human carcass.

169
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,380
Satanic cult.

170
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,240
Police have found no proof.

171
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,560
Made no arrest.

172
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,260
But that's no surprise.

173
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,700
For nationwide,

174
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,620
police are hearing strikingly similar horror stories.

175
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,040
And not one has ever been proved.

176
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,960
But she kept getting nastier

177
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,160
and nastier and nastier.

178
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,380
And I finally just went,

179
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,040
I just had had enough.

180
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,340
And I just started going,

181
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,980
well, I'll just have to control your soul then.

182
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,920
Ha ha ha ha ha!

183
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,860
What have you done to it?

184
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,040
What have you done to its eyes?

185
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,400
What have you done to him, you maniac?

186
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,840
Ha ha ha ha ha!

187
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,420
People come first.

188
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,300
It's the way some people interpret the Bible.

189
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,980
The book of Revelations,

190
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,820
where it's written,

191
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,300
Satan can be identified by the number 666.

192
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,820
Bob's 999 is not enough.

193
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,080
It's not enough to be identified by 666.

194
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,260
It is the opposite of 666.

195
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,540
So...

196
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,920
Or not exactly the opposite.

197
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,700
It's not...

198
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,620
He ain't, you know,

199
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,640
Bob ain't Jesus.

200
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
He's just, uh...

201
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,100
But he is certainly the anti-Antichrist.

202
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,420
There was a routine inquiry which didn't discover what was going on here.

203
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,560
B-O-B, Bob.

204
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,280
We inherited the Earth.

205
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,960
And we're blessed with certain rare gifts.

206
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,140
An opposable thumb.

207
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,040
With which to build tools and weapons for survival.

208
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,980
The capacity to speak, to think, to reason.

209
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,840
The ability to walk erect on two solid arches.

210
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,060
We were fruitful.

211
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,160
We multiplied.

212
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,280
We were resourceful.

213
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,100
We replenished the Earth and subdued it.

214
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,260
These were the kinds of things that we were blessed with.

215
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,260


216
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,920
Covenants.

217
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
These we fulfilled.

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,080
Unfortunately for me, you broke all of the Ten Commandments doing it.

219
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,960
Order in the court.

220
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,960
There is one piece of evidence already referred to which has not been placed on exhibition.

221
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,820
The Bible.

222
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,060
Objection.

223
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,980
That book has no place in this trial.

224
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,540
And no bearing on its outcome.

225
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,280
Objection overruled.

226
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,440
Proceed.

227
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,140
The Wiki.

228
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,020
The book is a work of the deceitful work.

229
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,820
But to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.

230
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,400
My lords, I rest my case.

231
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:13,840
In the matter of the story of mankind, this high tribunal has weighed most carefully the good of man against his evil.

232
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,260
And finds that man is as evil as man.

233
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,800
And as evil as he is good.

234
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,260
Did you hear what he was saying?

235
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,600
Did you hear what he was saying?

236
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,600
I don't like that last sound.

237
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:37,840
The Lord is my Shepherd.

238
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,220
No, that won't do.

239
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,140
All right. Close your eyes, please.

240
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,040
Now, please, and repeat this prayer after me, right out loud.

241
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:57,040
Ng, Ng, Ng, Ng, Ng, Ng, Ng, Ng, Ng.

242
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,740
Beach party, beach party, it never stops.

243
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,460
I'm tired of this nightclub.

244
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,100
This band is so bad.

245
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,980
Why do I have to pay $5 every night to stay alive?

246
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:24,640
Well, how many times do we have to play this worst song over and over and over again?

247
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,080
Today we have found Satan is alive and thriving.

248
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:35,700
I'm alive?

249
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,560
Yes.

250
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,660
You're alive.

251
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,360
Or at least plenty of people believe he is.

252
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,380
I'm alive.

253
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,320
I'm alive.

254
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,880
I'm alive.

255
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,100
I'm alive.

256
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,620
I'm alive.

257
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,220
Bob is dead.

258
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,280
Or at least plenty of people believe he is.

259
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,780
We have all types of perversion going on.

260
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,000
America is being affected.

261
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,800
I am not a piece of...

262
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,040
What are you smiling about?

263
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,820
Order me that six more demerits.

264
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:17,500
All of them were investigated by police, but usually without much result.

265
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,860
I hate that old demon.

266
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,040
But just yesterday I went to the store to buy shoes for my children.

267
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,500
And I was driving home and it seemed like a force that came over me.

268
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,040
And when I woke, the shoes were gone.

269
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,240
And there was three empty wine bottles in the back of them.

270
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,260
The vaccine.

271
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,040
We stress it's perfectly legal.

272
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,340
And these are typical commercial outlets you'll find just about anywhere.

273
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,920
Ha! Ha! Ha!

274
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,140
Probably given a lot of people the idea to listen to records backwards.

275
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,440
They've never had the idea before.

276
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,000
I think it is pretty sick in America when they're selling this junk over the counters.

277
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,100
And it's doubly sick when Christians give their kiddies money to buy the stuff.

278
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,800
What would you do if Jesus walked into some of those homes of all the Protestant movies?

279
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,140
I think it's a good idea to have a little bit of a movement.

280
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,920
And lo and behold, guess what's in the bedroom, friend?

281
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,780
The rapture is not going to be overcrowded.

282
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,040
I don't think we're going to have a traffic jam getting up to heaven.

283
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,080
What we need is to get them played through down here. Amen?

284
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,260
When they're crawling through their radioactive rubble with their fingers falling out,

285
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,320
looking for some battery for their tape decks or their flashlights.

286
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,060
Oh, then they want to get back to Bob.

287
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,480
Then they're going, oh, I got my $20 record stag.

288
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,780
Where's my $20 record?

289
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:42,780


290
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:42,940
I'm going to get my $20 record stag.

291
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,800
Oh, there's that book of the stroke genius that tells me what to do at a time like this, eh?

292
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,680
If you start listening for something, you're likely to hear it.

293
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,400
The symbolism is all there.

294
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,220
Shout. Shout.

295
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,520
Oh, oh, oh.

296
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,500
What?

297
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,320
Shout, which will be out in about a month.

298
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,880
Shout. Shout.

299
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,440
In a bookstore, my friend hit the shelf and a book fell out and I caught it.

300
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,980
And it had a pretty weird looking guy on the back.

301
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,400
It might be like the smile face of the 90s.

302
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,020
The baptism of the mighty fist face of Bob.

303
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:28,940
The face that can pile through eight foot thick titanium steel conspiracy fort knocks doors.

304
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,940
The face that can burn through metal with that mighty pipe.

305
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,380
And I believe that that had a lot to do with it.

306
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,960
We can get a glimpse of his theories and his rituals in this 1970 documentary.

307
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,800
This is a world of the future.

308
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,920
World of the future.

309
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,880
Yes, this bustling world of a thousand moods reflects the dreams of its ambitious inhabitants.

310
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,420
Dreams already realized of man's triumph over nature.

311
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,940
First of all, just on their face value, they sound so good.

312
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:16,260
And then they're so unusual or bizarre that most people hearing that message really don't think that it's true.

313
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,920
If you start listening for something, you're likely to hear it.

314
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,980
He listened to the tape backwards too.

315
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,680
Yeah, we'll turn the thing on.

316
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,040
Everybody up in the balcony sing.

317
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,120
Good bro friend, Neil and his hopes, good bro sleep.

318
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,600
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

319
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,700
I might have heard different things if you've given me different phrases.

320
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,060
That's not how they're describing it.

321
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,760
They're just happy around me.

322
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,960
We want Bob! Where's Bob? We want Bob!

323
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,940
Right now! We want Bob!

324
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,880
And experts say they were lucky to escape.

325
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,480
Many youngsters are into it, teenagers and younger.

326
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,560
It could be harmless. It could just be a diversion.

327
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,600
But it could also be deadly serious.

328
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,300
Oh, we're dead serious. This is all too real, George.

329
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,720
Uh-huh.

330
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,500
Our fans collect a lot of negative energy that was meant for us.

331
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,280
Nothing new perhaps, but then, what is?

332
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,520
The spuds just keep trickling down.

333
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,660
Oh, how hard it is.

334
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,140
We're regressing then.

335
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, absolutely.

336
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,620
At a dangerous rate?

337
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,540
Not dangerous enough. It just, you know, things go...

338
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,100
I told you the dopes are going to inherit the earth anyway.

339
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,860
Here's to bigger and better dopes.

340
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,660
I know.

341
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,500
I know.

342
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,020
I know.

343
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,860
I know.

344
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,540
I know.

345
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:56,460
I know.

346
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,580
I know.

347
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,380
I know.

348
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,660
I know.

349
00:17:59,700 --> 00:17:59,700


350
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,340
I know.

351
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,200
I know.

352
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:03,560
I know.

353
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,420
I know.

354
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,100
I know.

355
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,740
I know.

356
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,040
It's a good thing he's not here.

357
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,040


358
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,040


359
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,040


360
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,040


361
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,040


362
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,040


363
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,960
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

364
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,820
Self-preservation came first.

365
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,100
Kill or be killed was the fundamental law.

366
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,760
after an infinity of groping in the darkness man was beginning to find some answers

367
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,000
to understand the values which lay in group living and mutual assistance

368
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,460
you do what you do

369
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,700
but bobby's bigger than i think he's caught it doctor give him something for his car all right

370
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:10,240

371
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,440

372
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,700
take over it's all right you'll be yourself again in a minute

373
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,380
i'm so sorry everybody now you just drink this

374
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:29,360
sin is never satisfied and as time went on so increased the perversion second timothy

375
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,340
three and verse three the apostle paul warned that people would become without

376
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:40,340
natural affection therefore i withdraw my statement that man is a shaman

377
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:46,700
and a fool and submit instead that man is a fool and a charlatan same objection

378
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:54,020
objection sustained mr scratch you are out of order perhaps out of order but not necessarily

379
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,820
incorrect

380
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,980
i know what you're thinking that didn't make any sense

381
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:21,320
and you think it makes sense you're under someone to side with you

382
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,380
and adjust to the day without their permission either i know what you're doing and have a

383
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,920
interest in testing at all enhaba whoever

384
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:30,140
that you were Blogaku

385
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:35,960
subscribe to ghi for exclusive video for any features my matching is free

386
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,580
was talking about well you don't have your subgenius decoder ring why not how can you

387
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:47,820
get a subgenius decoder ring well there are two ways you can get a subgenius decoder ring

388
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:55,100
of course you can get it in a box of sugar bobs cereal that's one way but you can also get it

389
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:02,540
in a box of that non-nutritious carcinogenic snack food substitute cracker bobs

390
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,340
or whatever other things that are sweet to your stomach so just go out and buy one of these fine

391
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,200
dobsian products and you can get your decoder ring free as a bonus inside and eat the stuff

392
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,160
that it's packed in too because it's real good for you oh now okay i know what you're saying

393
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,160
now you say you can't get sugar bobs or cracker bobs why because you can't find it at your local

394
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,900
supermarket why can't you find it at your local supermarket i'll tell you why you can't find it

395
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,520
at your local supermarket because there's a blockchain of decoder rings in the city of

396
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:32,520


397
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:38,420
supermarket this is evidence of conspiracy deprogramming on the part of

398
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:44,520
your so-called friendly neighborhood grocer who refuses to stock sugar bobs

399
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,580
and cracker bobs

400
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,980
that's precisely the point I mean to make no one villain can affect mankind

401
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:14,520
unless mankind itself supports and encourages his villainy here is a case

402
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,960
in point this man could and did commit the souls of a million men to the devil

403
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,660
because they wanted to be committed well I knew I wouldn't know I wasn't gonna

404
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,720
drink today but well since I already had this damn case

405
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,520
I guess I'll drink it.

406
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:39,280
I might as well do something with it and well I could take it back but well they

407
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,520
usually don't like you to do that and well I wouldn't want the grocery store

408
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:51,060
to get mad at me I you know I've been trying to win their bingo game and you

409
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,620
know if I take a bunch cans back well they don't like that kind of thing and

410
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,120
you know well I could probably just pour all the beer out of it but well

411
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,520
it probably kill me

412
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,980
my grass and yeah I don't want to do that and I could trade in for the aluminum but yeah they

413
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:15,100
wouldn't be really worth the price of the gas of driving down to the aluminum recycling plan

414
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:22,720
they're probably probably worth is you know it then yeah that's what I take them in for the

415
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,640
aluminum now because if I drank them well it'd probably be worth more if they were just the

416
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,240
aluminum is no one no recycling plants gonna buy aluminum with beer in it so I probably would have

417
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:41,900
to drink it and well it you know helps wash down my food and it's probably you know it's five you

418
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:48,940
know didn't drink any today well five more days from now it'd be Sunday and I might want some and

419
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,660
wouldn't be able to drink any so at least I can say well hell I got blowed off my ass last Monday

420
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,480
and you know with these pop-tarts

421
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,440
well some little kid could step on them or you know even though they are still full beers and

422
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:11,180
well yeah they are in my refrigerator but you know by some twist of the imagination is the little

423
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:19,020
boy's foot could conceivably I'm not saying that it's impossible but it could probably come into my

424
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:24,740
refrigerator and he could you know cut his foot open and well if he sued me or something like

425
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,620
that the hospital bill would be far greater than that and I think that's a good thing to do and I

426
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:36,300
think that that sounds pretty clever and you know it Leo would give me pretty much any quarterback

427
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:50,200
would for his little kid now put this one on his power now the strength of the relatively

428
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,160
affectionate good cause I think that's pretty cool better than this pics and 마� mountain

429
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,480
can profit you though even though you know well I'm not saying there's anything more better than

430
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,600
this pier pocket for still also very helpfulooooo

431
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,160
and say a trash can along with a beer can.

432
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,920
Oh, yeah, but I was going to send him, take him to the recycling plant

433
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,240
so I could get the money for him.

434
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,480
That was another reason.

435
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,980
Well, you know, they went to all the trouble

436
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,560
to paint the red, white, and blue Budweiser label on here.

437
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,280
Well, I'd hate to, you know, I like to support the arts.

438
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,700
I'm a patron of the arts.

439
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,280
I'd like to, you know, support them.

440
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:28,240
This man, in his confusion, worshipped many false gods.

441
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,900
And as a result, the people were enslaved and oppressed.

442
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,240
Most people drink to escape problems and reality.

443
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,760
Multifarians, conversely, drink to create problems

444
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,320
for those normals around them

445
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,520
so they can indulge in the holy hour of party, hearty.

446
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,220
But nay, nay, I must not be working.

447
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,520
I must, yet I cannot.

448
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,820
I must have.

449
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:52,960
Slack.

450
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,640
And in the heavens that stretch across the endless wastes,

451
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,260
he found the secret of life.

452
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,300
And he welcomed a new and more dignified god.

453
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,660
I am the Lord thy God,

454
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,220
which hath brought thee out of the land of Egypt,

455
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,040
out of the house of bondage.

456
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,340
Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

457
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,260
Thou shalt not make unto me...

458
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,660
any grave of the image,

459
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,500
or any likeness of any man.

460
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,320
And out of the thunder the voice of God

461
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,700
gave mankind the Ten Commandments.

462
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,940
And the good prevailed.

463
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,740
Ah, but it didn't last.

464
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,860
Man soon forgotten strayed from the path of Moses

465
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,500
and broke all of the Ten Commandments at once.

466
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,140
May I remind you of the endless wars

467
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,560
and plundering and rape of the ancient world.

468
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,080
May he go back to...

469
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,360
farm them skulls?

470
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,980
He will pull his pants down,

471
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,400
you see.

472
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,040
And then he...

473
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,480
He'd jump down into one of them furrows.

474
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,520
An educational service

475
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,900
of the Lone Gene Whitmore watch company.

476
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,360
All the signs point to serious health damage.

477
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,160
I have a wonderful free gift waiting for you now.

478
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,920
Alert, alert, alert.

479
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,260
Alert, alert, alert.

480
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:30,780
done to me? Where have you led me? One of my most talented disciples, evil and depraved,

481
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:37,400
whose debauchery and perversion surpassed even the wildest and wickedest dreams of the most deluded,

482
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:44,280
nursed on a witch's venom, twisted by endless orgies, this madman knew no end to violence,

483
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:50,880
no limit to lunacy. He arranged the suicide of most of his closest friends, had his mother

484
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:58,100
clubbed to death, and poisoned a lot of the people he knew, and sought out other similar amusements.

485
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:04,000
Well, I'm not amused, and I'm certain mankind wasn't either. Oh, but you're wrong. Look at the

486
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,980
merriment all about you. They don't look unamused to me.

487
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,760
Oh, is that good.

488
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,300
Oh.

489
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,580
Oh.

490
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:35,680
These are great days, the greatest our country has ever lived, and we must all thank God that

491
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,820
we have been allowed, each of us according to our stations, to play a part in making these

492
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,820
days memorable in the history of our race.

493
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:45,760
Yeah!

494
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,800
Praise God! Praise God! Praise God! Praise God!

495
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,560
Praise God!

496
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,000
Praise God! Praise God!

497
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,860
Praise God!

498
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:11,760
My God, it's the rupture. Jesus Christ, I mean, white shapes are rising up from little areas in the graveyards.

499
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:18,320
That's where the graveyard is. There's these, white...figures spinning up towards the sky,

500
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,000
and there's these huge,

501
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,620
huge, glowing, silvery ships and... and...

502
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,480
Bob!

503
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,980
It's... it's Bob!

504
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,240
Bob!

505
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,720
Striking and striving, striving...

506
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,580
Free fall, free fall...

507
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,520
Full of love and love...

508
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,000
And...

509
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,760
You lose the war, you lose the war...

510
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,700
That's where you're going...

511
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,140
Down the dice...

512
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,960
And...

513
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,660
Sailing down the...

514
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,080
The...

515
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,700
The...

516
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,200
The...

517
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,380
The...

518
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,180
You can shamelessly pamper yourself by listening to...

519
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,560
The Subgenius Hour of Slack!

520
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,040

The show that makes God himself giggle out loud!

522
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,700
He transmits his sick mind by electrical waves into a box in your personal home!

523
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,400
How convenient!

524
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,420
George Romero wants to make a special zombie movie about him...

525
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,440
And he's been a repeat guest on Knox Landing!

526
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,860
There must be a connection there somewhere...

527
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,500
He likes to play blank tapes at full volume...

528
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,820
At home to annoy the neighborhood mimes...

529
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,440
And he knows how to sneak into grocery stores...

530
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,220
And suck the filling out of hosted Twinkies without disturbing the cellophane rappers!

531
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,640
Watch him shake hands with the devil himself as he roars through the gates of hell...

532
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,780
On the radio station that drops a toaster into the bathwater of mediocrity!

00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
And remember...

537
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,080
Bob can promote or retard hair growth with a wave of his pipe...

538
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,020
So tune in...

539
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,200
It's very good for you...

540
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,480
Let's go!

541
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,100
Thank you very much!

542
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,100
Hey everybody, look who's here!

543
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,560
Murderer, maniac, rapist, pervert, matricide...

544
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Arsonist, bigamist, and sometimes accomplished musician and singer for all social occasions...

545
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,780
We're the team that hag up people's RNA networks...

546
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,020
Those who have abused our brains to hope to stop the breeding process and kill at the

547
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,020


548
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,360
See what I talk about...

549
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:01,360


550
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:01,820
There is Banks or B.?

551
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,200
At this time you will lose a lot of things not known about the history of the entire

552
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,200


553
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,420
But if I give you this method, by that you will be大概used from that modern age with

554
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:03,420


555
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:03,420


556
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:03,420


557
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,580
When thecio Bomb-it would have tough, deep egautry.

558
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,060
To hell with yoga.

559
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,820
True, this is called the Utopia.

560
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,260
Bob networks and ніpاe, no Cassano's.

561
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,840
QueRock to gun bio.

562
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,400
of heaven.

563
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,460
You've made it.

564
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,180
You've made it.

565
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,760
And we've made it to 1984.

566
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,700
A secret report within the guild.

567
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,500
I see him walking down the road now.

568
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,920
I see that smile lighting up the street.

569
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,820
I see him walking down the road now.

570
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,280
I see a trail of smoke behind him.

571
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,180
And a trail of money too.

572
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,820
Yeah, he'll be back someday.

573
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,120
To the Church of the Subgenius.

574
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
P.O. Box 14036.

575
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,080
Now Texas 75214.

576
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,760
Once again.

577
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,680
P.O. Box 14036.

578
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,720
Now Texas 75214.

579
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,240
Send a dollar.

580
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:46,540
Send a dollar.

581
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:46,860
Send a dollar.

582
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,480
Send a dollar.

583
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:47,780
Send a dollar.

584
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,120
Send a dollar.

585
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,260
Send a dollar.

586
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,540
That's partially correct.

587
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,260
How can we tell

588
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,300
whether a Gospel

589
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,620
is the true Gospel or not?

590
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:22,120
Now we come to the next gift, diverse different kinds of tongues, the Old Testament.

591
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,780
And that, of course, is just not true.

592
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,540
That is not true at all.

593
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,280
We are running the risk of blaspheming the Holy Spirit.

594
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:43,540
In verse 22, or in verse, in verse, yes, in verse 22.

595
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:51,720
I haven't really made up my mind if one way or the other is acceptable or not.

596
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,180
We better trust the Bible and not the note in the margin.

597
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:02,500
With absolutely no biblical validation and with a total mistrust of what the Bible teaches.

598
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:10,100
And everything begins to feel very holy and I would see what I thought was the Lord Jesus

599
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,260
and he would begin to speak to me from the Bible.

600
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,460
What could that be?

601
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:22,320
We know this, that this happens through Ouija boards and tarot cards and haunted houses and that kind of thing.

602
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,600
Coming, coming to the Lord Jesus Christ this and the Lord Jesus Christ that.

603
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:39,440
It may be simply that we're hallucinating or that we had the, have the, have the, you know, our minds are very tricky

604
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,640
and it may be playing tricks on us.

605
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,860
Because he,

606
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,140
comes,

607
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,600
he,

608
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,640
comes,

609
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,800
uh,

610
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,520
uh,

611
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:47,920
break?

612
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,340
Uh,

613
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,120
we want to be,

614
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,600
we want to have no interest in that kind of activity.

615
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,000
Or,

616
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,900
or,

617
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,500
uh,

618
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,020
and,

619
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,580
and,

620
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:57,980
or,

621
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,620
uh,

622
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,420
uh,

623
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,260
let me,

624
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,720
let me give a modern day illustration.

625
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:04,840
57,

626
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,540
or,

627
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,260
or 40,

628
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,140
what is that,

629
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,800
Luke 9?

630
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,180
57 to 62.

631
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,240
Verse 57.

632
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,240


633
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,980
Or, or 40,

634
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,540
what is that, Luke 9?

635
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,860
57 to 62.

636
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,240
Verse 57.

637
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,760
Or, or 40,

638
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,300
what is that, Luke 9?

639
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,640
57 to 62.

640
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,140
Verse,

641
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,680
by and by in the sky,

642
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,680
we'll maybe get there someday.

643
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,000
Now this,

644
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,180
as we have said,

645
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,040
is one of the,

646
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,240
uh,

647
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,180
one of the more interesting,

648
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,520
uh,

649
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,140
and wide range,

650
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,240
uh,

651
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,240


652
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,240


653
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,240


654
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,240


655
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,240


656
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,240


657
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,240


658
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,240


659
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,240


660
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,240


661
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,240


662
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,060
forms of musical induction.

663
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,040
Another one,

664
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,020
known to the ancients,

665
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,720
is the application of hot irons to the,

666
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:50,960
uh,

667
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,920
the area of the back.

668
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,640
Now,

669
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:53,960
uh,

670
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,120
science has since shown that,

671
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,300
uh,

672
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,560
heat is an accelerated motion of the molecules.

673
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,660
And someone with hot irons on his back goes through accelerated motions.

674
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,640
This is also worked with,

675
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:07,820
uh,

676
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,880
people's rheumatism.

677
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,380
The most rheumatic victim becomes spry.

678
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,520
He does,

679
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:12,520


680
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:12,520


681
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:12,760
uh,

682
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,220
be treated by doctors,

683
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,620
or doctors,

684
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,420
and bobbed for doctors.

685
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,720
Let's go bobbing for doctors.

686
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,800
Put the doctors in the can here,

687
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,060
fold,

688
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,180
stick your head under,

689
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,180
and keep it there.

690
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,640
Well,

691
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,640
you can't get doctors.

692
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,360
The Boston Celtics are the ones that have Boston.

693
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,380
And,

694
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:27,580
uh,

695
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,720
if you find a piece under your,

696
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,140
uh,

697
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,040
under your bed,

698
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,920
then there must be something wrong,

699
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,360
because,

700
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,560
the person who stole them didn't put them under,

701
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,680
under anyone's bed.

702
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,860
Although these stones are rumored to be,

703
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,120
uh,

704
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,340
semi-alive,

705
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:42,500
uh,

706
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:42,500


707
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:42,500


708
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:42,500


709
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,480
and to move around,

710
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,920
and just turn up in the oddest places you could imagine.

711
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:47,960
Like,

712
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,100
uh,

713
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,400
folks at WFME Newark.

714
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,620
And it's only 20 minutes before 6 o'clock.

715
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:55,960
But not,

716
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,680
but,

717
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,160
you know,

718
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,360
that is sort of a contradictory statement,

719
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,940
because it might not actually be 6 o'clock.

720
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,240
I mean,

721
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,900
look at your watch.

722
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,360
I mean,

723
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,420
Magazine of the Year,

724
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,700
which is very hard to read,

725
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,360
because it just sort of floats away,

726
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,980
and you can't print on it,

727
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,120
and,

728
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,620
you know,

729
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,460
it's really no,

730
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,080
really no point in doing it.

731
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,000
But what do they care?

732
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,640
Yee-haw,

733
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,540
that's what they say.

734
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:19,940
Yeah,

735
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,200
yeah,

736
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,700
yeah,

737
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:20,980
yeah,

738
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,340
yeah,

739
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,200
yeah,

740
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,480
yeah,

741
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,880
yeah,

742
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,200
yeah,

743
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:23,400
yeah,

744
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:23,480
yeah,

745
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:23,540
yeah,

746
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:23,600


747
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:23,720


748
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:23,780
yeah,

749
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:24,880
yeah,

750
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:24,920
yeah,

751
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:30,840
yeah,

752
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:30,960
yeah,

753
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:31,800
yeah,

754
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:38,720
yeah,

755
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:38,980
yeah,

756
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,420
and,

757
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,040
yeah,

758
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,480
it's good,

759
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,340
but you know what we're really mad to you about?

760
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:52,560
And,

761
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:52,940
unbelievable,

762
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:52,940


763
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:52,940


764
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:52,940


765
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:52,940


766
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:52,940


767
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,980
I-a-a- х-as-,

768
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,020
hello is,

769
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,460
Did kids even notice that I've gotaruss with now?

770
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:56,460


771
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:56,460


772
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:56,460


773
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:56,460


774
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:56,960
Disgusting.

775
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,060


776
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,500
I did look like some rap show host to the exact same seu-

777
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,200
Yeah.

778
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,480
Yeah.

779
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,560
Yeah,

780
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,900
that was you know,

781
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,180
ату.

782
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,780
Hmm.

783
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
I,

784
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,220
Every yard a kingdom.

785
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,740
My friend, every dog and child a circus.

786
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,920
This allows for diversity from conservatives to the most frightening perverts like Bob and Seth.

787
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,800
Gee, I can't wait till that Bob time train comes around the bend.

788
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,800
Oh, look out, son. Here it comes now.

789
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,440
Shut up!

790
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,120
You two, get up.

791
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,600
To other people, it's a big joke.

792
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,340
We're back to people now, and the other half of the butt, son.

793
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,380
So, so much of history.

794
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,100
And it is a mystery to me.

795
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,520
I don't know what's going on in our community anymore.

796
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,740
We don't know.

797
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,360
All I know is that Bob said some mighty important things.

798
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,300
Most importantly, he said that I don't practice what I preach.

799
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,240
Because I'm not the kind of person I preach to.

800
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,980
You couldn't tell him because he's a million and one things.

801
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,360
He's Mr. Big and Mr. Small.

802
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,660
He's simple and he's wise.

803
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,440
He's inherently honest, but he's got a streak of larceny in his heart.

804
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,480
He seldom walks up to a public telephone without shoving his finger into the slot to see if somebody left a nickel there.

805
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,760
Something else happened over here.

806
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,740
Where are you going? You're supposed to be at the park.

807
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,540
I'm not done, the greatest.

808
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:33,860
Yes, you are.

809
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,360
I want to find out what's going on and you won't let me.

810
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,480
No, the president's passing.

811
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,680
I'm not going to let you pass.

812
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,160
You fool.

813
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,180
Beach party.

814
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,340
The pro-fan proves I'm genius P-Dog Healy after event confirmation rally.

815
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,200
Thank you for your durolagical participation.

816
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:55,400
As far as this flesh is concerned, it doesn't matter whether we are slaves or free men.

817
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,780
We are to obey the masters over us.

818
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,920
We have no rights.

819
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,160
The Bible is quite clear with that.

820
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,680
We have no rights.

821
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,120
We are to honor them.

822
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,280
We have no choice.

823
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,140
This is God's word.

824
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,960
Like it or not.

825
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:19,760
Spiritually speaking, too, since the preceding three chapters in 1 Timothy have to do with elders,

826
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,160
qualification of elders and deacons, leaders, overseers in the church,

827
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,960
and how to rebuke them, how to work with them, how to be under them,

828
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:36,720
then spiritually speaking, we are also to honor those masters over us.

829
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,800
We are servants of God.

830
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:46,300
Spiritually speaking, we are to count our own masters worthy of honor, worthy of all honor,

831
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,640
so that the name of God and his doctrine may not be blasphemed.

832
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,540
Sometimes we need a big dose of it.

833
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,000
Some little thing will happen and we will suddenly become frantic.

834
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,080
We'll lose our heart and act in ways we never thought we would.

835
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:06,700
I know I've been there.

836
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,020
I have.

837
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:14,880
Sometimes we need a big, big dose of it to understand that we're dealing with it all the time, actually, though in a smaller degree.

838
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:22,160
Sometimes we need a big dose of the trembling, the tightness of one's stomach as it keeps working us over,

839
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,860
week in, week out, year in, year out.

840
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,520
Sometimes we need a big dose of it.

841
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,660
I told you the dopes are going to inherit the earth anyway.

842
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:36,120
I wonder, dear, if this Don Quixote hasn't got the jump on all of us.

843
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,920
I wonder if it isn't a curse to go through life, wised up like you and me.

844
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:41,800
Now look here, kid.

845
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,360
If you're going to wonder, let's go down and do it over a hump of steak, huh?

846
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,240
Come on, snap out of a drinker.

847
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,700
Here's to bigger and better dopes.

848
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,720
We're concerned Christians for Reagan.

849
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:55,980
Oh, Hunter!

850
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,100
You're the only one who can do it.

851
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,040
You're the only one who can do it.

852
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,240
You're the only one who can do it.

853
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
You're the only one who can do it.

854
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,260
Wake up, Fyler.

855
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:06,940
Here you go.

856
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,700
Get your mouth real close to the microphone.

857
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,440
Really close.

858
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,900
Now listen.

859
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:23,000
Oh, here's something.

860
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,220
The gods, by definition, are crazy.

861
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:26,780
Hmm.

862
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,840
That's what I say.

863
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,080
Here come the Bob-yons and the Lotrons.

864
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,500
Oh, here's something you've heard sometimes, just marked out with horizontal lines.

865
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,920
Let's look at the record.

866
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,980
Groovy, isn't it?

867
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,660
Your holy words didn't do much good, did they?

868
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,780
Oh, yes, they did.

869
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:09,860
New hope had come into a world where hope had been dead.

870
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,480
Mankind was reaching out for the light.

871
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,100
And all he found was darkness.

872
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,480
Darkness and Attila the Hun.

873
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:30,300
Attila swept across the known world, destroying everything that thousands of years of progress had achieved.

874
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,760
He burned in pillage, trampling cross and blade beneath his hordes of men.

875
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,640
Everything withered before him.

876
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,040
Death.

877
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,260
Faith.

878
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:38,520
Learning.

879
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:39,100
Medicine.

880
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,500
The arts and sciences of something he feared, for a long time he lived in.

881
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,960
Huromatito or the dark ages of that dark era, until nothing was left below him anymore

882
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,400
except misery, fire, and blood.

883
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,480
Idiots!

884
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,720
Idiots!

885
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,780
treating the Ai.

886
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,720
I'm Reverend Cleve, the best son of Blondfly, Dr. Rudy Ray Moore, and Mama Steve Dolomite.

887
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,900
I ain't the next, I know what's what.

888
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,140
Babe, I like the shape and size of contour of your butt.

889
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,200
So come on over here and give up the gas.

890
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,300
Whip some scum to me, babe.

891
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,500
Oh, give me all of your cash.

892
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,480
Return you wanted to worry about your soul.

893
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,680
Cause when the X's come, you'll be right on my pole.

894
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,700
To Dops Town, Malaysia, we will go.

895
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,980
When you drink the cool air to go ho, ho, ho.

896
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,880
Well, maybe it wasn't always fun.

897
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,480
But he developed something else, too.

898
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,040
Because one day, after hundreds of years of lawlessness,

899
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,760
he brought back the basic principles of law

900
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,660
at Runnymede.

901
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,320
Indeed, in England, when the barons forced King John

902
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,580
to sign the Magna Carta,

903
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,360
the provisions of which were to become the cornerstone

904
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,460
of law, order, and civil liberty.

905
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,720
Triumph of blithering idiocy,

906
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,360
coupled with a criminal cruelty

907
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,180
even I couldn't have surpassed.

908
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,000
Human rights, eh?

909
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:21,160
Noble sirs, may we look at what mankind did to that young woman.

910
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,980
God is with us.

911
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,260
My man.

912
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:27,700
My man.

913
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,300
Drop in Spangold, now.

914
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,360
Whose powers come from the B dang bird Make she be realised.

915
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,340
Hoje.

916
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,940
His mother, Elida.

917
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:37,780


918
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,100
I say했어요 this.

919
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,580
John.

920
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,060
ouch.

921
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,060


922
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:49,400
Me, my son who recommended 拜拜

924
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,140
I am the best doctor

925

Giga

926
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:15,240
You're here to serve humanity

927
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:24,200
Here to reappoint gentility

928
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:31,620
Right away from fear and vanity

929
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:39,960
Carefully promote tranquility

930
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,960
Become pure attitude

931
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,660
And help me to see

932
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,180
That I am the best doctor

933
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,020
Giga

934
00:47:55,020 --> 00:48:00,160
You're here to serve humanity

935
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,260
Here to reappoint gentility

936
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:05,260


937
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,360
Make me feel like I'm alive

938
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:14,260
The monitors are your friends

939
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,540
Depend on the monitors

940
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,860
Work for peace

941
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,140
Work for peace

942
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,200
Work for peace

943
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:26,200


944
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:26,200


945
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,500
We solve nothing

946
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,900
implants

947
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:32,240
braительous

948
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:33,220
best

949
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,200
Wheat

950
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,200
W

951
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,700
ез

952
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:49,700
Great

953
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,260
Help! Help!

954
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,720
James, stop this crazy thing!

955
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,820
Trouble, I'm getting out!

956
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,760
And out of the same chaos came the breathtaking architecture of the Lombardos,

957
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,460
the dazzling art of Titian and Michelangelo,

958
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:35,880
and the free thought of the individual, as so beautifully expressed by Tilesio, Machiavelli and Campanella.

959
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:43,320
Is it to mankind's credit that he enshrines this alleged genius who envisioned atomic destruction?

960
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,100
Can my colleague answer that?

961
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:53,180
Furthermore, can you deny the great influence that such daring dreamers exerted on...

962
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:56,460
on venturesome people like... like Christopher Columbus?

963
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,360
Boom! No more ship.

964
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,780
Columbus showed the way, and mankind followed.

965
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,380
I concede the point.

966
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:05,840
But to what?

967
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,280
To what end?

968
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,360
Murder? Pillage? Rape?

969
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:13,960
Does my noble colleague remember what happened within thirty years

970
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,680
after Columbus showed benevolent mankind the way to the New World?

971
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,440
Have you too quickly forgotten the slaughter of the Aztecs by Cortes?

972
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:28,860
This violent pattern set by the bloodthirsty Cortes, all in all,

973
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,680
turned out to be one of my better jobs.

974
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,100
The slaughter of the New World was endless.

975
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,720
But delightful.

976
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,840
They begin creeping up on you.

977
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,620
Trying to sell you something.

978
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,560
They get long claws.

979
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,060
And they get a stranglehold on you.

980
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,380
And you squirm and you duck and you holler and you try to push them away but you haven't got a chance.

981
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:50,960
They gut you.

982
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,500
First thing you know, you own things.

983
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,020
A car, for instance.

984
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,300
Now your whole life is messed up with a lot more stuff.

985
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,180
You get license fees.

986
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,440
And number plates.

987
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,460
And gas.

988
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,380
And oil.

989
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,360
And taxes.

990
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:04,920
And insurance.

991
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,360
And identification cards.

992
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:07,640
And letters.

993
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,300
And bills.

994
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,100
And flat tires.

995
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,760
And dents.

996
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,680
And traffic tickets.

997
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,880
And motorcycle cops.

998
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:12,680
And courtrooms.

999
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,140
And lawyers.

1000
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:13,860
And fines.

1001
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,880
And a million and one other things.

1002
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,540
And what happens?

1003
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,660
You're not the free and happy guy you used to be.

1004
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,600
You gotta have money to pay for all those things.

1005
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,280
So you go after what the other fellas got.

1006
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,000
And there you are.

1007
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,680
You're a helot yourself.

1008
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,840
You win, Colonel.

1009
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,860
Here, take the fifty.

1010
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,540
Go out and get rid of it.

1011
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,620
You bet I will.

1012
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,020
Just as fast as I can.

1013
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,440
I'm gonna get some canned goods, a fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.

1014
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,720
Give away?

1015
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,540
Hey, get me a pitcher's glove.

1016
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,580
I gotta get some practice.

1017
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,260
Say, he's giving it away.

1018
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,300
I'm gonna get me some of that.

1019
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,260
Hey, come back here, you helot.

1020
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,300
Is that you going through the muskrat?

1021
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,740
Now, why in the world would I be going through that?

1022
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:03,840
You're a muskrat.

1023
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:03,840


1024
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:03,840


1025
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:03,840


1026
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:03,840


1027
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:03,840


1028
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:03,840


1029
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:03,840


1030
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:03,840


1031
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,300
You want to see where he keeps his car while I don't get hit by any of that bull?

1032
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,900
Your ears areACHE scripture brought to your mourning.

1033
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,460
These are here.

1034
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:11,460


1035
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,660
And that's the bittebails.

1036
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,780
Her buns aren't sure what Auspice二つの値札 parte in that tough bus low-key, and

1037
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:17,780


1038
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:17,780


1039
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,300
But ,if you might wear she's just gonna food truck with just some Stuffing anybody

1040
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:18,300


1041
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:18,920
Honey potluck is free.

1042
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:19,100


1043
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:19,100


1044
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,720
Hey, you make products.

1045
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,400
Yeah.

1046
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,700
And you pay the fuck for that innereletian evaluation.

1047
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,020
Guys...

1048
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:29,580
Come on now.

1049
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,100
I just don't understand the values of young people nowadays.

1050
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,700
Hello, this is your Smith show.

1051
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,460
I am Jim.

1052
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,720
Oh, man.

1053
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,380
Next time you shouldn't do that.

1054
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,360
You shouldn't do that.

1055
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:54,340
Even though it feels good, but still don't do it next time, okay?

1056
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,780
Stop hooking up.

1057
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,220
Stop your boogers.

1058
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,220
Stop your boogers.

1059
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:02,100
Tomorrow is my day for a morning for it.

1060
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,500
For a morning for it.

1061
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,200
What if, hold it, hold it, Taylor.

1062
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,820
What if Bob came to the door right now and rang the doorbell,

1063
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,180
and you opened the door and Bob himself was standing there with his pipe hanging out of his mouth?

1064
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,340
You wouldn't let him in?

1065
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,260
If he was shivering out there in the cold?

1066
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:23,860
If Bob came to hand you a check for a million dollars, would you let him in?

1067
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:24,320
No.

1068
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,080
Why?

1069
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,840
Because I hate him.

1070
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,200
I hate him.

1071
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,180
I hate him.

1072
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,080
It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood.

1073
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:33,640
Hi.

1074
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,900
Hi, Mr. Rogers.

1075
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:36,880
Hi.

1076
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,160
Hi, Mr. Rogers.

1077
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,580
Look at my new panties.

1078
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,440
Mr. Rogers, what are you going to talk about today?

1079
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,140
Mr. Rogers, what's hanging out of you?

1080
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,980
Oh, forget it.

1081
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,220
I'm not supposed to talk about that on TV.

1082
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,120
Mr. Rogers, Mr. Rogers, that's your wife, Tracy.

1083
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,540
You're putting down on Mr. Rogers.

1084
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,340
No, no, no.

1085
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,940
You got the wrong thing out of the closet, Mr. Rogers.

1086
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,640
Mr. Rogers spanked me in that special way.

1087
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,480
Together.

1088
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,580
Ha, ha, ha.

1089
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,740
Greasel Bob.

1090
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,100
Greasel Bob.

1091
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,060
Greasel Bob.

1092
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:14,580
Greasel Bob.

1093
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,760
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1094
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,820
What do these people really believe?

1095
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,020
And what does their message mean for the rest of America?

1096
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:25,560
Hey!

1097
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,700
It's a ball.

1098
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,300
Hey!

1099
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:41,560
Originally, Jim Scarrsten dropped a ball on a baseball team against the

1100
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:41,560


1101
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,080
Until a time and time and time again, they needed to be playing baseball.

1102
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:43,840
But it didn't work.

1103
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,420
When they agreed on the call forcussion, the next time he was there for the boot

1104
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:44,420


1105
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:44,420


1106
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:44,420


1107
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,300
Seement to have a continual a game more folders and drug addiction for

1108
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,860
at least ten years.

1109
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,660
The great thing about our fairway were all different.

1110
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,200
But there is unity in our diversities.

1111
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:58,200


1112
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,580
my hand

1113
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,860
and my foot are different

1114
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,880
but they belong to the same body

1115
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,420
and as long as my hand and my foot

1116
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,120
are coordinated by my head

1117
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,100
this body of mine is a wonderful thing

1118
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,280
and here tonight

1119
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,560
I'm believing that the Holy Spirit

1120
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,280
is going to allow the hand and the foot

1121
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,060
and the mouth

1122
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,820
just to begin to speak

1123
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,200
and to minister and to heal

1124
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,580
coordinated by the head

1125
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,620
the actual bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

1126
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,480
is alive and bleeding

1127
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,040
it speaks

1128
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,420
it's a name

1129
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,800
for you

1130
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,200
no one under 18 and 80

1131
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,480
this is the real head

1132
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,360
this is the actual head of Arnold Palmer

1133
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,340
this mind changing psychedelic church

1134
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,500
disguised as the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

1135
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,820
and now control your life

1136
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,600
control your mind

1137
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,500
that's right come on in

1138
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,580
ladies and gentlemen

1139
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,980
good good

1140
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,140
healing is bad

1141
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:56,920
Lord

1142
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,340
choose the way you want to get through

1143
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,660
choose the way you want to get through

1144
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,780
stop and raise your eyes

1145
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,520
good

1146
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,760
I don't like it

1147
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,600
I don't like it

1148
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,540
I don't like it here

1149
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,580
I don't like

1150
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,740
barometer is holding steady

1151
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,800
and those skies for us clear

1152
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,900
but to the sky for us

1153
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:26,900


1154
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,140
then the sunday our

1155
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,600
next destination is

1156
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,320
The Blue Coin

1157
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,480
where the Sahara goes

1158
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,640
yes

1159
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,260
finding her

1160
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:49,120
and that knife

1161
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,500
still full

1162
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:50,540
sharp meat

1163
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:56,740
but I feel pity for get to leave this island

1164
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:56,900
in my mind

1165
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,160
Madam, I must make my meaning clear.

1166
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,580
Peace or war?

1167
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,460
Yes! That's it!

1168
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:11,340
The only way to control you is to put the brain of this chicken in your head!

1169
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:21,300
I have just received word that the warring armies have moved against each other on the planet Earth.

1170
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:30,880
And in accordance with the destiny of time, the great Super H-bomb will explode at exactly 11 o'clock.

1171
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:36,500
I direct your attention to the great clock of outer space.

1172
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:44,940
When the clock strikes 11, the bomb will go off and bring an end to mankind.

1173
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,360
Unless, as such decisions are entrusted to us,

1174
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,280
we decide that...

1175
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,040
the bomb shall not go off,

1176
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,360
and that mankind shall survive.

1177
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:01,180
Therefore, speak quickly, Mr. Scratch, and make your summations brief.

1178
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,700
For we must make a decision before the clock strikes 11.

1179
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,800
Speak, Mr. Scratch.

1180
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:15,300
My distinguished colleague rests his entire case on the so-called man of tomorrow.

1181
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,180
By inference, he almost acknowledges that mankind deserves no better end,

1182
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,760
than annihilation by the Super H-bomb.

1183
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:29,760
And yet, weak and sentimental, as is all mankind,

1184
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,200
he introduces a sentimental trick,

1185
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:41,520
and hopes to gain the mercy of the court by introducing a pathetic last witness, a child.

1186
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:50,100
I accept the challenge, and I shall use as my final summation the very witness brought here by man.

1187
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:56,000
I call your attention to the witness, innocently playing with his toys.

1188
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,700
This is mankind's bright hope of tomorrow.

1189
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:04,680
The hope of peace and virtue.

1190
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,480
Have you seen the toys with which the child plays?

1191
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,440
A toy gun and a toy sword.

1192
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,320
Who cares?

1193
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,540
Show the child the Brady Binken interact.

1194
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:45,240
You have all you need is patience, patience, and Ingles's smile.

1195
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:46,940
The ball will come in the right direction if you throw it.

1196
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:46,940


1197
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,180
You'll just have to expect a season the price of pampering,

1198
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,080
but now, look over at the results by seeing if the향 author..

1199
00:59:54,820 --> 01:00:01,980
In order to allow man more time to set his house in order at the earliest possible date.

1200
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,140
Take heed and listen well.

1201
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,540
The time runs swiftly.

1202
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:13,340
The fate of man is now laid at the doorstep of man himself.

1203
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,360
By the villains you encourage.

1204
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,280
By the heroes you create.

1205
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:25,060
You shall soon achieve eternal life or oblivion.

1206
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:30,120
Therefore, it is the decision of the High Tribunal of Outer Space.

1207
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,340
This court shall soon convene again.

1208
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:43,580
To determine finally whether mankind shall continue or be destroyed by the Super H-bomb.

1209
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,060
This choice is entirely yours.

1210
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:50,980
It is entirely up to you.
