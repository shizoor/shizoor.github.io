1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
That word, come, is an invitation.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,260
Getting stoned on sunshine, getting high on air.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,960
Getting to it naturally, really getting there.

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,960
Getting such a high on loving what I do.

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,720
I'm so full of happiness, hooked on something new.

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,020
Life is such a thought to be thing.

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,460
Hello birdies, hello spring.

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:52,300
Each day on earth, each day on earth, each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering.

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,680
The hunger and thirst that the human heart has is satisfied by coming.

10
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,940
Coming and believing.

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,400
These words are used interchangeably.

12
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,380
The come is to believe.

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,120
It means to forsake ourselves and turn to trust in the words of 9,700.

14
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,340
7th edition.

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,760
Post-end times, end times.

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,260
Einstein's secret orchestra.

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:21,360
7 million, billion, billion, trillion, billion, trillion, billion, trillion, billion, trillion, billion, trillion.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,860
7 million, billion, billion.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,520
Billion, billion, billion, billion, trillion, billion, trillion, billion, billion.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,840
Different little brain cells, of all those other people who are out there doing the same thing that we are, only different, present.

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,120
The subgenius.

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,480
Our, own.

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,600
Splash.

24
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,880
We are not.

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,420
Men.

26
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,500
Come to me all you who labor.

27
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,940
And are heavy laden.

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,960
The word labor refers to an exhausting endeavor, exasperating.

29
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,240
That's where Ken was. He couldn't find that fulfillment of life.

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,920
He tried drugs. He tried relationships. He tried slack.

31
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,060
It looks more like the instruction manual for building a machine.

32
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,660
God knows what the machine is supposed to do.

33
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,040
Coming in on a wing and a prayer

34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,160
Coming in on a wing and a prayer

35
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,940
Though there's one more gone, we can still carry on

36
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,600
Coming in on a wing and a prayer

37
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,980
People, I implore you

38
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,880
to go out in the wilderness

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,120
and build your own pleasure ships.

40
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,080
Seek out, seekers, the knowledge

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,080
and the magic of free return traditions.

42
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,140
Seek out, seekers, the knowledge

43
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,360
and the magic of free return traditions.

44
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,620
Build your own.

45
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,920
and j-

46
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,140
and j-

47
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,140


48
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,260
and j-

49
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,820
and j-

50
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,200
and j-

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,520
and j-

52
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,660
and j-

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,560
and join us, boys and girls,

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,140
as we wallow happily through the most beautiful

55
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,140


56
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,200
as we wallow happily through the most beautiful

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,900
muck and mire of guidance systems,

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,180
solid rocket boosters, liquid-fueled engines,

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,060
and the ever-important

60
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,360
and dubiously sacred

61
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,160
deep space network.

62
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:34,540
deep space network.

63
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,900
Are you one of the frightened?

64
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,440
Oh, we hate all right.

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:40,760
Oh, we hate all right.

66
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,980
We hate you.

67
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,880
But it just isn't flipping the right circuits for us.

68
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,240
For some reason, it can't come out

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,620
like the hot kiss at the end of a wet fist

70
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,140
unless it's a real one.

71
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,260
Unless we're slugging ourselves.

72
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,640
Yes,

73
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,380
we're the walking wounded

74
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,240
of this brutal pink society.

75
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,520
So shell-shocked from our very existence

76
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,060
as if we're too damaged

77
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,340
to channel our resentment

78
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,520
into proper bob-scent hatred.

79
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,200
Oh, but soon,

80
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,940
Oh, but soon,

81
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,160
soon, like next July soon,

82
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,060
soon, like next July soon,

83
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,480
our shattered fragments will be swept

84
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,360
aboard the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

85
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,120
and, yay, we shall be

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,720
ruptured up into the heavens

87
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
by the redeeming excess horn

88
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,400
because subgenius is my tribe

89
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,300
and as Bob teaches,

90
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,540
and as Bob teaches,

91
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,720
if you can't whoop it,

92
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,780
go down.

93
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,860
After a while, after a while,

94
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,040
after a while, she started going

95
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,360
down, down, down.

96
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,020
down, down, down.

97
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,600
And you know when you're traveling

98
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,360
the road of sin,

99
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,260
ain't no other way to go but down.

100
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,060
Come a travel to Broadway,

101
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,480
the road of sin,

102
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,420
and went down to decadence,

103
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,800
down to degradation,

104
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,160
down to derogatoryism,

105
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,980
down to nothing,

106
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,440
down to the bottom of the bucket.

107
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,540
Oh, this is a gas!

108
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,580
Oh!

109
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,060
Oh!

110
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,240
Oh!

111
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,520
An endless orgy

112
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:14,600
An endless orgy

113
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,160
to the goddess of perversion.

114
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,220


115
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:48,200
to the goddess of perversion.

116
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


117
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


118
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


119
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


120
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


121
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


122
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


123
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


124
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


125
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


126
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


127
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


128
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,200


129
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,860
Anything you want to about this shepherd,

130
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,660
but don't touch my sheep.

131
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,660
but don't touch my sheep.

132
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,860
That's your Bible lesson for today.

133
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,860
Sometimes before you speak out,

134
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,840
it's best to have knowledge before you start

135
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,900
trying to correct someone.

136
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,020
Have a good day.

137
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,020
Thou shalt not slack,

138
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,220
it would be sin in thee.

139
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,140
it would be sin in thee.

140
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,980
Always remember this.

141
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,060
And holy, and holy,

142
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,820
and holy loyal men

143
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,960
will pitch, will probe,

144
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,520
below the abdomen,

145
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,700
for in a very, very problem

146
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,180
thy word by new fact

147
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,020
will always be firm,

148
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,680
will never be slack.

149
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,840
We spruce, we spruce,

150
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,640
we spruce an island of field

151
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,600
in front or behind

152
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,400
until we have to yield.

153
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,820
The sins that caused the escapism

154
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,200
still remain.

155
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,160
And now that I have graduated

156
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,460
to the Christian sins,

157
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,300
I find

158
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,680
I really find these much more difficult

159
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,160
than the sins of the flesh.

160
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,240
Every single group

161
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,860
has eternal sin.

162
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,540
It is something we get on

163
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,720
to run away

164
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,600
from our responsibilities

165
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,220
in this ugly world.

166
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,600
Someday you'll find

167
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,020
that the world left you out

168
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,560
No true love

169
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:14,800
is the only thing

170
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:14,800


171
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,280
that you know nothing

172
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,160
just roaming about.

173
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,780
While parties rub people

174
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,860
and a cold heart within.

175
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,520
And each time you're dancing

176
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,240
you're walking within.

177
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,800
You're taken,

178
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,920
made over,

179
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,960
in perfect disguise.

180
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,660
Unfaithful, unworthy,

181
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,620
and go so unwise.

182
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,020
I pity the heart

183
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,300
of the next guy you've been.

184
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,520
Like me,

185
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,540
he'll be losing.

186
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,240
I pity the heart

187
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,240


188
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,740
What the hell do you think

189
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,340
you're doing?

190
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,220
Dragging your butt through the day,

191
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,480
selling body and soul

192
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,620
to a bunch of bland normals?

193
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,880
Acting stupid so they'll think

194
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,960
you're one of them?

195
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,320
Tired of getting all of the guilt

196
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,780
but none of the sex?

197
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,820
There is a simple answer, dear friend.

198
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,800
A glowing beacon of slack

199
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
amidst the turmoil and darkness.

200
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,420
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs,

201
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,300
the black master

202
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,520
in the Church of the Sub-Jesus.

203
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,760
Bob brings a new destiny

204
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,720
for the abnormal.

205
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,860
For Bob comes to justify our sins,

206
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,720
to unmask the conspiracy

207
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,200
and to get us back.

208
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,220
The slack they stole away.

209
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,980
It's us versus them.

210
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,460
Are you gonna cry in hell on earth

211
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,100
alongside the pink boys?

212
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,780
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes

213
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,000
and accept Bob into your mind?

214
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,840
Repent, quit your job,

215
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,660
slack off, and praise Bob!

216
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,380
The Church of the Sub-Jesus

217
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,320
eternal salvation will triple your money back.

218
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,880
I hope you don't take that

219
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,940
as a crude joke.

220
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,400
I mean, it is a joke,

221
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,920
but I did not mean to be offensive about it.

222
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,480
We have nothing to hide.

223
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,980
Even though to you

224
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,460
we are a dangerous cult.

225
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,780
We understand that.

226
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,820
Why dangerous?

227
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,900
Because we threaten the family.

228
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,260
We threaten

229
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,820
the established norm

230
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,880
of family values.

231
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Normal is

232
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,860
as normal does.

233
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,700
I wanna be normal!

234
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,380
All my friends run away from me

235
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,640
away from me

236
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,860
away from me

237
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,400
I don't know why they run from me

238
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,260
I'm normal as I can be

239
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,740
His production is geared to his wants.

240
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,640
He's doing what the other fellows are doing

241
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
and as a result feels that he belongs.

242
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,680
And that since the majority is traveling along this road

243
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,480
it must somehow be the right road to follow.

244
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,880
He doesn't think about this,

245
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,440
he simply feels this way.

246
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,480
What he lacks is knowledge, information.

247
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,120
He's not thinking simply because he does not have to think

248
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,260
and it's easier not to.

249
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,020
You're Pete,

250
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,200
and we're here to help.

251
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,620
He continues to follow along with the crowd

252
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,640
His chances of any real success in life

253
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,680
in any phase of life

254
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,000
are 95 to 5 against him.

255
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,840
He needs to know and understand

256
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,680
that the human race has historically divided itself

257
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,340
into two groups.

258
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,440
Those who lead rich, rewarding, interesting, and exciting lives.

259
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,360
and largely unrewarding lives,

260
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,060
and that every field of human endeavor is led by about 5% of the people.

261
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,700
He needs to be given a new group to which to belong,

262
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,380
the top 5%, who know more, do more, live more, and have more,

263
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,280
the elite of the world, the leaders, the contributors,

264
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,640
as opposed to the feeders.

265
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,400
When you hide the wild, the pink.

266
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,700
Hey, Bob!

267
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,480
What about me? I ain't no butterfly!

268
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,380
Take the boy out of the pink, but you can't take the pink out of the boy.

269
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,900
There's a magic pink eraser

270
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,120
that can work a very special kind of miracle.

271
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,240
Sorry, Bob, but your dream has become my nightmare.

272
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,260
My sixth dream was a nightmare!

273
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,520
Gradually, I began to make out the outlines of a boat in the early mist,

274
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,740
and luckily for me, a houseboat.

275
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,620
As I drew alongside, I saw that it was a very special type of river home.

276
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,720
It was a pink houseboat.

277
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,620
I've been haunted by this weird and painful dream.

278
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:28,920
It comes to me every night and it just makes me scream.

279
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,560
I wake up sweating with a feeling that I'm going to die.

280
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,700
Ramblin' rain can explain.

281
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,140
Of course we need to use an American pie.

282
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,660
I'm forced to live on the porch of a pink house.

283
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:02,740
Oh, please, please, save me from the pink houses.

284
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,240
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

285
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:21,600
Wake up, brush your teeth, wash your face, comb your hair, eat your breakfast, go to work. Wake up, brush your teeth.

286
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:33,720
Come into my house and see I'm 24. They're watching me with every breath and mission. Take attention, lose my galaxy.

287
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:44,480
I just wanna be normal. I work at being normal. I just wanna be average. I work at being average, average.

288
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:02,560
Come into my house and see I'm 24. The TV's turned on me with every step. Competition takes the devil's fears.

289
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,700
He's on the fence.

290
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:13,980
I just wanna be normal. I work at being normal. I just wanna be average. I work at being average, average.

291
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:31,000
Why can't I be like these clever guys? I wanna be normal, normal, yeah, normal.

292
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,060
I wanna be normal.

293
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,840
Normal, yeah, normal.

294
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,080
You look around and tell me I'm a good man.

295
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,680
Normal, normal.

296
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,480
You're up beside me when I turn my head.

297
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,620
Normal, normal.

298
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,020
Tell me what to do. I wanna be just like you. I wanna be normal.

299
00:13:50,080 --> 00:14:00,640
He must be pried out of his long habit of being socially directed by showing him the wisdom of becoming more inner-directed, of swinging his allegiance from the big average 95% group to the small, uncommon 5% group.

300
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,440
Drinking in the hvis.

301
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,860

Are we live?

314
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,400
Huh?

315
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,080
Are we live?

316
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,180
No, we're live.

317
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,120
Are we recorded?

318
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,660
We're recorded.

319
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,140
What was I talking about just then?

320
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,840
I don't really know.

321
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,620
Who the hell cares?

322
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,800
Well, see, a lot of people do care, as a matter of fact.

323
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,440
I don't.

324
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,600
And what I really wanted to get to in my little gist here

325
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,300
is that people will follow anyone.

326
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,160
Who has an idea?

327
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,060
Who has a plan?

328
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,280
I don't.

329
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,940
Oh, I thought you were asking.

330
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,920
Who is the case?

331
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,860
Who is an exception to the fact?

332
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,820
So, you future cult members,

333
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,680
you future wannabes,

334
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,920
if you ever think about the possibility of being a joiner,

335
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,220
for Bob's sake,

336
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,220
don't join.

337
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,860
Don't join.

338
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,220
Just...

339
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,460
Hey.

340
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,660
He's not a joiner.

341
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,200
He's a rebel.

342
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,240
Yeah.

343
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,220
He's a man without a cause.

344
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,900
He's a man who would not kill himself

345
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,700
just because some guy told him that there was a UFO hiding behind a comet.

346
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,020
No.

347
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,280
He's a man of sensibility.

348
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,640
A man of his own direction.

349
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,280
A man of no direction.

350
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,340
A man of English conquering.

351
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,480
A man who leads to spam.

352
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,040
And that's all we can hope to be.

353
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,660
Just hotels.

354
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,840
But...

355
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,660
That's all we can be, my friends.

356
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,780
All we can be.

357
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,300
Just...

358
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:20,980
...unquiet.

359
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,940
...in the path of non-followingness.

360
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,740
Yeah.

361
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,440
Follow Pope Fred there in the path of non-followingness.

362
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,580
Jehovah Hates Fred played there on Susie the Floozy Show.

363
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,700
Well, we've been there.

364
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,960
We've been listening to Sister.

365
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:49,460
Beautiful Sister Susie the Floozy's Bob's Slack Time Funhouse 200th Show Anniversary Slack Special from last November.

366
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,940
You see?

367
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,700
But the predictions for X Day coming up are still good.

368
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,440
That's the amazing thing about this church.

369
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,100
We can still keep using all the old tapes.

370
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,300
All we have to do is cut out the year.

371
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,340
Or just dull down the specificity.

372
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,280
We just need to...

373
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,780
Yeah.

374
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,200
Let me regroup now as the music changes.

375
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:25,520
Dear friends, you may wonder why we haven't been playing tons and tons of recordings from our giant X Day gathering.

376
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,000
It's because I've been editing those in videotape.

377
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,220
It's all on videotape.

378
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,520
The best sound is on videotape.

379
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,840
So I'm editing the video first.

380
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,940
And then we'll feed it bit by bit onto our Slack.

381
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,280
But I'll tell you, there's so much cuss in, friends.

382
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,720
It's just so, so cuss-worthy.

383
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,200
And so coming up, we'll have more radio.

384
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,000
Some genius radio from Sister Susie the Floozy.

385
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,460
Edited media barrages from Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

386
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,500
And...

387
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,580
Uh...

388
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,320
Uh...

389
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,560
Uh...

390
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:01,800
Um...

391
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,000
Benenzlo!

392
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,920
The mighty Benenz...

393
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,220
Master Benenzlo made a great new song.

394
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,960
And...

395
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,480
And...

396
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:16,560
And Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence returned from the grave to shamble forth against the Morlocks.

397
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,360
And this music in the background is Ego Plum, friends.

398
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,700
And you can know more of Ego Plum from...

399
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,560
On the World Wide Web at www.ebola-music.com.

400
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,500
That's ebolamusic, one word, dot com.

401
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,580
As in the disease, Ebola.

402
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,800
This is Ego Plum is the name of the individual band.

403
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,960
An anthology of infection.

404
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,280
And, uh, let's...

405
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,420
I just wanted to let you know, folks, that I am alive.

406
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:55,800
We're struggling onward with video editing and a bunch of computer business that you don't even want to hear about.

407
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,540
The...

408
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,060
The...

409
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,180
The Jesus just came back from Amsterdam.

410
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,340
And I don't have to talk to the kooks and the crackpots anymore.

411
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,740
Listen, listen, oh, listen, listen.

412
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,500
Both phones are ringing.

413
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,060
They're two phones ringing at the same time.

414
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,880
Two different lines in this office.

415
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,580
And now...

416
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,000
Friday Jones.

417
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:26,060
Ladies and gentlemen, every year, tens of thousands of children die in senseless, pointless accidents...

418
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,120
that could have been avoided.

419
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,060
Thousands are kidnapped by family or by strangers.

420
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,820
And many are later killed or hideously mutilated, destroyed and scarred for life.

421
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:48,380
This year alone, over 300 children will die by tripping and falling face first into the little cutlery tray in a dishwasher, puncturing their brain.

422
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,280
Ladies and gentlemen, don't have children.

423
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,480
OK, well, it's coming up here soon.

424
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,740
That's some...

425
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,540
I'll just here...

426
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,120
Mix it out, kind of.

427
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,520
There we go.

428
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:06,980
Massaged...

429
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,880
I'm massaging the board right now in the studio here.

430
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,720
And it's kind of pulsating.

431
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,000
It's not hard at all.

432
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,640
OK, that's...

433
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,940
I've got to pulsate it up.

434
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,820
Oh, you have one of those flesh-a-pod boards?

435
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,420
Yeah, where you have to sort of massage...

436
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,820
With the really soft, jiggly parts?

437
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,300
Yeah.

438
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,760
Oh, that is so nice.

439
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,740
They're really high-tech.

440
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,040
Those are so comfortable, and they're really...

441
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,040


442
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,040


443
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,040


444
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,040


445
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,800
They're really warm, and they pulsate, and they glow.

446
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:28,800
Right.

447
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,480
And if you please them, they have this whole thing with the pleasure center in the board.

448
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,400
They do have that.

449
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,840
When you find the pleasure center in the board, oh man.

450
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,640
The whole thing just drops and vibrates.

451
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,280
OK, here we go.

452
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,440
You've got to do the violin part.

453
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:41,940
OK.

454
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,400
OK.

455
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:43,800
OK.

456
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:46,340


457
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:46,840


458
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:47,980


459
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:48,500


460
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,420
OK.

461
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,360
OK.

462
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,040
OK.

463
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,040


464
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,040


465
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,040


466
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,040


467
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,880
OK.

468
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:09,380


469
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:09,380


470
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:09,480


471
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,020


472
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,060


473
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:21,880
Oh, that's a nice little...

474
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,220
You've got to do the violin part.

475
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


476
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


477
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


478
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


479
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


480
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


481
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


482
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


483
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


484
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


485
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


486
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


487
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


488
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


489
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


490
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


491
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,240


492
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,320
OK.

493
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,320


494
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,320


495
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:22,520
OK.

496
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,560
OK.

497
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,840
Astral intercourse and universal force

498
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,800
And galaxies that number in the billions

499
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:39,480
They're all there for you

500
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:47,100
If you've the balls to see it through

501
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,100
If you've the balls to see it through

502
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,780
And light the pipe of truth

503
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,300
Of truth, light the pipe of truth, brother

504
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,940
Will you ever say no to your instinct bonobo

505
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,820
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob

506
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,800
Will you escape on the date, July 5th

507
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,460
Soon

508
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,500
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob

509
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,600
I know the world is humming

510
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,260
I know the world is humming

511
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,080
Cause I know

512
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,060
Connie is coming

513
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,660
Astral intercourse and universal force

514
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,680
And galaxies that number in the billions

515
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,760
They're all there for you

516
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,380
They're all there for you

517
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,680
If you've the balls to see it through

518
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,980
If you've the balls to see it through

519
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,680
And light the pipe of truth

520
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,780
Yeah-ho, roll on!

521
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:20,900
Give me a match

522
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,660
Give me a match

523
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:21,720
Give me a match

524
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,060
Give me a match

525
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,180
Give me a match

526
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,960
Give me a match

527
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,920
Give me a match

528
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,240
Give me a match

529
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,160
Give me a match

530
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,040
Give me a match

531
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,360
Give me a match

532
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,880
Give me a match

533
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,380
Give me a match

534
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,400
Give me a match

535
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,280
Give me a match

536
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,200
Give me a match

537
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,460
Give me a match

538
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,540
Give me a match

539
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,000
Give me a match

540
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,120
Give me a match

541
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,820
Give me a match

542
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,760
Give me a match

543
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,760
has a message for you and me, even down here in this year in which we live.

544
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,480
And he said, take up your bed and walk.

545
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,480
And I believe that Saint Jesus is present through the power of the Holy Spirit,

546
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,840
right here in this room, right now, right now, right now.

547
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,740
And he wants to meet every need.

548
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,660
Now what's wrong with a withered hand?

549
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,060
Why would Jesus bend wrong to a withered hand?

550
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,300
Why would Jesus bend wrong to a withered hand?

551
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,900
Wrong to a withered hand of a man that was in the synagogue.

552
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,060
Wrong to a withered hand of a man that was in the synagogue.

553
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,940
Well, a withered hand can't hold on to anything.

554
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,440
Jesus coming.

555
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,760
Jesus moved.

556
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,860
Jesus moved about when he signed a point.

557
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,400
Jesus is here and this place is.

558
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,060
It ain't unpredictability.

559
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,120
That's right.

560
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,180
High unpredictability, brothers and sisters.

561
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,920
Another thing that we can say about the acquisition of slack

562
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:52,220
and our fight against conspiracy is that

563
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,880
if they get it,

564
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,500
they get you to conform to the conspiracy of normalcy.

565
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,100
And your abnormality lands away.

566
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,680
It goes away, never to return.

567
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,140
You'll never know it.

568
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,940
You'll never know it.

569
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,960
You'll be a normal dude thinking you're cool

570
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,040
because you listen to Frank Zappa CDs,

571
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,180
thinking you're cool because you might do a little butt,

572
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,280
but in reality you're a goddamn dude

573
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,520
on his way to see Jehovah One and mad alien space gods.

574
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,000
So it's not how much money you spend.

575
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,220
It's how you spend your time, Frank Zappa.

576
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,440
Come to me all you weak labor and our heavy laden.

577
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,160
It means the end of effort.

578
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,960
It means the removal of that which wearies the mind and the body.

579
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,360
It means that the exhausting, exasperating search is over.

580
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,560
He gives us rest.

581
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,600
Our search is over.

582
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,480
Yes, dear friends.

583
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,020
Remove.

584
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,860
Remove.

585
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,640
The terrible burden of the weight of the future.

586
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,260
Yes.

587
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,740
Close your eyes.

588
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,060
Go to sleep.

589
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,860
And dream pleasant dreams.

590
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,840
And leave the future for the other people.

591
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,100
I'm going to launch rockets from Canavero.

592
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,180
Canavero.

593
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,360
Canavero.

594
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:22,520
Canavero.

595
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,760
I'm going to launch rockets from Canavero.

596
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,500
Watch earth go tumbling down.

597
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,240
I'm going to launch rockets from Canavero.

598
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,520
Canavero.

599
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,660
Canavero.

600
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:31,960
Canavero.

601
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,720
I'm going to launch rockets from Canavero while earth goes tumbling down.

602
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,880
When we're seeking direction for life, when we're seeking light in the midst of darkness.

603
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,280
Children, when you're seeking light in the midst of darkness.

604
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:52,040
Simply stick that little fuse in the bottom of the solid rocket booster.

605
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,340
Let's build it.

606
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,940
and light it, baby.

607
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,540
Our ionization layer is failing rapidly.

608
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,020
We may need transportation.

609
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,780
Are you prepared to leave?

610
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,420
It's time for you to wake up, subgeniuses.

611
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,840
Awaken and feel the fire of Bob.

612
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,440
Feel it burning within your veins.

613
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,180
Feel it roaring within your heart.

614
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,260
Feel it thundering through your loins.

615
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,840
It's time for you to reach out and take the slap

616
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,760
that Bob is all but shoving into your face.

617
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,300
Take that slap and use it to burn a path through your enemies.

618
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,460
Burn a path through the city.

619
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,260
Burn a path through the face of the Earth itself.

620
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,080
Carve your initials into the very granite of the planet

621
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,140
and leave it as a twisted ember burning in space

622
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,760
as we leave it far behind on the pleasure saucers.

623
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,040
It's time for you to make your list.

624
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,420
Who's been naughty and who's been nice?

625
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,820
Because you're wiping them both out.

626
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,240
Killing all the pinks.

627
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,060
Killing all before you.

628
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,740
Killing all upon your left and on your right.

629
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,520
Trample them under your feet.

630
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,220
Hear the lamentations of their women and children.

631
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,020
Crush their homes.

632
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,180
Smash those tiny pink puppet toys that they so adore.

633
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,900
It is time for you to become a fire.

634
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,400
To burn for Bob.

635
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
With Bob.

636
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,980
And in Bob.

637
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,060
And be the light of Bob.

638
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,080
And burn.

639
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,020
Burn.

640
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,120
Burn.

641
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,320
Yes, down below the Morlocks continue to operate their machinery.

642
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,980
Gleaming stainless steel boilers or pumps.

643
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,640
Venting steam.

644
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,620
Constantly maintained by their Morlock servitors.

645
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,960
There we go.

646
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,600
All right, now the adjustment's been made.

647
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:50,900
And we're...

648
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,320
We're now moving on.

649
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,700
Moving backwards, actually, over the Earth.

650
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,000
Yes, I suppose we should get back into earlier eras.

651
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,540
As we prepare to lower the show back down into the parking space.

652
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,580
Back down into the low comedy preserve of Howard Stern and others.

653
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,980
And now the connection's been made.

654
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,560
Again.

655
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,620
Okay, that's your cue.

656
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,040
Whose cue?

657
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,920
Not mine.

658
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,460
No, no, the gong caller.

659
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,360
The gong caller?

660
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:17,960
Yep.

661
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,780
Gonged away by the Daughters of the Moon.

662
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,300
Picks up on a groovy, lost, and unheard of tune.

663
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,300


664
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,300


665
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,300


666
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,300


667
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,980
It's a journey, man.

668
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,320
It does, no, really.

669
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,600
Well, what is this?

670
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,040
The turkeys are laughing at us.

671
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,500
Is there some little thing you didn't tell us about your plan, Lieutenant?

672
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,160
Is there a...

673
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Do I have a line here?

674
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,080
Oh, it says, uh...

675
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,400
Throw this axe at...

676
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,200
I think it's missing him.

677
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,120
Oh, yeah, okay, right.

678
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,660
I thought we did that axe thing earlier.

679
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:43,840
All right, well...

680
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,100
Yeah, that was a stunt that was photographed separately, so now we go to...

681
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,480
Oh, all right, all right, I get it.

682
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,060
We go to the cantina scene, I think.

683
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,220
Maybe the, uh...

684
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,880
Do you have...

685
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,640
Are you on the right page?

686
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,140
That's in your board.

687
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,280
I'm on the right page.

688
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,280


689
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,640
It's in the blue pages.

690
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,500
It's in the blue pages.

691
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,780
It was added to my...

692
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,600
I don't think you can hear me.

693
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,640
Hey, caller, I'm banging on the...

694
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,500
I'm in the booth here.

695
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,100
Yeah, no, I'm banging on the caller's booth.

696
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,280
I'm here.

697
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,980
Do you have our script tonight?

698
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,200
This is me.

699
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,820
Yes.

700
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,060
Okay, so you know...

701
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:08,200
This is the introduction to the subject called human cybernetics.

702
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:16,420
It will help you to understand this strange term, which is now affecting the lives of

703
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,260
so many people, making them happier, more efficient, more successful.

704
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,940
That's your song.

705
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,760
It's got no name.

706
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,120
Let's hear this song.

707
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,980
It's got no name.

708
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,660
It's about Bob.

709
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,880
There's a fella down in Texas, and they say his name is Bob.

710
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,960
He tells me I should slack off.

711
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,900
That I should quit my job.

712
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,520
Well, I'm a subgenius.

713
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,260
Oh, yeah.

714
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,660
And I must have my slack

715
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,060
If I don't live forever

716
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,260
I get my money back

717
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,980
He said that on July 5th

718
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,280
Of 1998

719
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,660
The earth would meet destruction

720
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,700
Suffer a deadly fate

721
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,700
Bob made a deal with X-Ace

722
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,120
Who comes from outer space

723
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,100
He purchased an exemption

724
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,040
For the Yeti race

725
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,400
Well I'm a subgenius

726
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,000
And I must have my slack

727
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,480
If I don't live forever

728
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,680
I get my money back

729
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,700
The day was long awaited

730
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,340
Now it has come and gone

731
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,040
There was no far from heaven

732
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,700
And this whole world rose on

733
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,680
Old Stang was made to suffer

734
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,300
A terrible disgrace

735
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,060
Of such humiliation

736
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,680
And I must have my slack

737
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,380
He feared to show his face

738
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,360
Well I'm a subgenius

739
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,240
And I must have my slack

740
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,740
If I don't live forever

741
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,080
I get my money back

742
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,720
Old Bob may be laughing

743
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,280
Because we are such chumps

744
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,320
But that is no reason

745
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,280
To be down in the dumps

746
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,240
It will all still happen

747
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,280
No need to curse or frown

748
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,820
They got all the right numbers

749
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,980
Just got them upside down

750
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,840
Well I'm a subgenius

751
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,520
And I must have my slack

752
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,860
If I don't live forever

753
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,600
I get my money back

754
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,920
I get my money back

755
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,180
I get my money back

756
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,000
I get my money back

757
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,540
There she is

758
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,260
There she is

759
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,340
Orton

760
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,860
Nenslow dear friends

761
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,760
Our ionization layer is failing rapidly

762
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,180
We may need transportation

763
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,820
Are you prepared to leave?

764
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,700
You will keep in contact until the moment of departure

765
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,300
I stood before the wall

766
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,560
And it was a wall

767
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,220
Stretching to infinity

768
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,120
In either direction

769
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,220
It was dark

770
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,620
It was thick

771
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,480
It was massive

772
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,460
And it was solid

773
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,420
It was not something you could see into

774
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,340
Rather it stopped sight

775
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,820
And it was solid

776
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:10,820


777
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:10,820


778
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:10,820


779
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,700
And it was directly in front of me

780
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,840
The dark clouds rolled into the sky above

781
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,180
And it was directly in front of me

782
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,180


783
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,060
I had heard that the wall is the end

784
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,400
I had heard that the wall is the end

785
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,160
And when you reach it

786
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,340
You are stopped forever

787
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,020
And can only turn around

788
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,920
And go back

789
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,240
But I had arrived here

790
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,320
By my own choosing

791
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:40,820
And I couldn't do anything

792
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,340
I had no intention of ever going back

793
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,480
I was going through

794
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,420
I wanted to know what was on the other side

795
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,180
I wanted to know what was on the other side

796
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,920
I am not a normal man

797
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,680
And we did flicker

798
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,840
Dancing a world full of wonder

799
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,020
Dancing a world full of wonder

800
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,380
Flying there under

801
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,680
Under the sea

802
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,840
First there was the Fig Newt

803
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,120
The four legged amphibian

804
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,240
Which evolved directly

805
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,120
Suddenly into the Yeti

806
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,200
Under excess technology

807
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,320
And then instantly devolved

808
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,900
Back down into Pythocampus

809
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,460
Which is represented now by Bob Mosek

810
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,860
Which is a Pig Newt

811
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,960
Which is a Pig Newt

812
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,240
And then instantly devolved

813
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,580
Back down into Pythocampus

814
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:28,580


815
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:28,580


816
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,700
This is the place

817
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,940
This is the place

818
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,720
This is the place

819
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,000
So far nothing of military

820
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,240
Or any other interest has been received

821
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,780
Though their ability to receive

822
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,740
A very weak signal

823
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,960
And to return it at such high power levels

824
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,320
Is impressive

825
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,720
All they've been saying is that

826
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,920
They're good at radio astronomy

827
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,080
They like prime numbers

828
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,700
And they can send our first TV transmissions back to us

829
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,260
So we've started a fire in the studio

830
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,780
We're burning the shelving here

831
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,280
We've got a nice little fire going on

832
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,000
Shelving is recording

833
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,040
Everybody sing

834
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,320
Shelving is recording

835
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,840
Shelving is recording

836
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,480
Shelving is recording

837
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,840
One check

838
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,540
Sheldon watts

839
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,140
The world's largest multitude

840
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,600
Has already been

841
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,000
Arranged to Heartland

842
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,560
A month and a half ago

843
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,140
And when I got back

844
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,740
I knew I was right

845
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:34,740


846
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,580
You're on a big pretty list

847
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:35,700
But is one thing

848
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:35,820
Credits

849
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,020
And I may be in it

850
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,560
But it's a sony

851
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:37,560


852
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,820
It's a bonnet

853
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:38,820


854
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,800
The gas music from Jupiter.

855
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,000
Real gas music from Jupiter, you're right.

856
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,020
Men of Earth.

857
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,400
Men of Earth.

858
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,780
Cease all atomic testing.

859
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,880
In a few minutes, you'll meet Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment.

860
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,840
You know what I want? I want ideas. I want one idea.

861
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,500
One idea could get us out of here.

862
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,480
Remember, thrifty thinkers are always under budget.

863
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,240
Budget, congratulations. Be efficient, be happy.

864
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,400
Thank you.

865
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,700
He appears to be heading outside the city.

866
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,320
He appears to be heading outside the city.

867
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,100
If you don't mind, I need my

868
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,200
�중

869
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,140
Ask a couple questions.

870
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,760
Rebecca, we're having this show, for the first time in a long time.

871
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,200
But it says now

872
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,560
you have five bodies.

873
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,660
Habits that have undergone an operation to carve out weapons.

874
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,880
We can find support like that.

875
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,400
Keep our eyes on the barriers with that kind of sense.

876
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,140
That'll help you out.

877
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,820
But...

878
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,300
Thank you.

879
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,360
Thank you.

880
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,480
Thank you.

881
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,640
Thank you.

882
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,640
Thank you.

883
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,980
Thank you.

884
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,220
Thank you.

885
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,700
That word come, come, come, come to me.

886
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,400
You guys, we come.

887
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,140
Thanks, Bob.

888
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,400
about four different things you were going to launch.

889
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,660
20 pounds in 20 miles in 20 minutes.

890
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,280
So you should actually launch your own homemade device

891
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,340
right into the crowd.

892
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,660
Your own rocket ship you make.

893
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,260
That should be the stunt.

894
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,360
We're going to do that right now.

895
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:29,640
Liquid or solid propelled, Dave?

896
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,580
I would say it would have to be liquid

897
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,500
to kill all the people in the front row at least.

898
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:41,540
Well, once you start the solid fuel, you can't turn it off.

899
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:47,200
I am the god of solid fuel booster rockets.

900
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,640
And I bring you fire.

901
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,440
Fire.

902
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,860
I'll bring you fire.

903
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,460
The hunger and thirst that the human heart has

904
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,480
is satisfied by you.

905
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:04,860
Coming.

906
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,020
Now, wasn't one of you working as a sex detective?

907
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,720
This is city probe scanner.

908
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,460
We've run across some illegal sexual activity.

909
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,460
It should be on your DTO screen now.

910
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,640
Relate to investigating officer.

911
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,820
Thank you for your assistance in crime prevention.

912
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,520
We've run across some illegal sexual activity.

913
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,500
It should be on your DTO screen now.

914
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,060
Let your body relax, children.

915
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,340
Open up those channels that do not normally function.

916
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,140
On radio waves.

917
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,180
Open up deep, deep inside your subconscious.

918
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,120
And build your own pleasure ships.

919
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:47,740
Children.

920
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,920
Do you hear me?

921
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,420
Sheepo?

922
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,780
Only then, when you fully come to an understanding

923
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,680
of the science of rockets,

924
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,060
can you truly slack off.

925
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,800
And light the pain of truth.

926
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,160
You hold the power of the magic eraser.

927
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,960
And it's your turn now.

928
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,180
Choose the miracle.

929
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,540
For them, sex wasn't enough.

930
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,800
They were after every kick they could get or give.

931
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,460
They were after every kick they could get or give.

932
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,880
They were after every kick they could get or give.

933
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,820
It's a sick, sick, sick world.

934
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,700
And it's waiting for you.

935
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,860
And it's waiting for you.

936
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,680
Disgustingly true.

937
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,040
No symbolism. Just realism.

938
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,140
Afoidean Mondo Kani.

939
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,880
Afoidean Mondo Kani.

940
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,300
Kani, Kani dear.

941
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,360
I love you, love you so.

942
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,920
I love you, love you so.

943
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:57,940
I love you, love you so.

944
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,060
Kani, Kani dear.

945
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,860
Don't ever, ever go.

946
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,780
You're my guiding light.

947
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,500
Each and every light.

948
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,220
You're the one that I adore.

949
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,340
For now and evermore.

950
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,060
Kani dear.

951
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:26,620
Ah, Kani, Kani dear.

952
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,000
A blushing expose of the strange activities

953
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,840
that took place behind closed doors.

954
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,100
behind closed doors.

955
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,320
A film that reveals the hidden life.

956
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,940
A world of sieve meetings and unconventional love affairs.

957
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,280
Loneliness and shame.

958
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,020
Different, bizarre, unnatural.

959
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,240
This is a motion picture

960
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,340
that depicts the secret cult of the Devil Worshippers

961
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,200
as never before shown.

962
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,000
The hidden initiation chambers,

963
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,040
or the very special ones.

964
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:10,440
The sacrifice of the snow maiden upon the altar of darkness.

965
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,140
A ritual as frightening as it is weird.

966
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,460
The recruiting of young, beautiful women

967
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:21,180
for special functions in the dance hall.

968
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,300
It's time for you to burn for Bob.

969
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,640
Time to let the fire of Bob come roaring through your veins.

970
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,180
Time to let him thunder within your heart.

971
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:35,520
Time to let him lose like a thousand horses thundering within your groin.

972
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,580
It's time for you to take the fire of Bob

973
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,920
and use it to burn your way through the cities of the pits.

974
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,300
Use it to burn your way through the very continents in open.

975
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,920
Use it to burn your emotions into the face of the planet

976
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,920
before you leave it far behind.

977
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,240
A seared ember glowing heavenly and dying in space

978
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,740
as you leave it far, far behind on your way to planet X.

979
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:00,880
It's time.

980
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:05,620
It's time for you to make your list of who's been gnarly and who's been nice.

981
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,760
Because we're wiping them both out.

982
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,400
All the pinks.

983
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,560
All the gnarly.

984
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,540
All the ones who made you work.

985
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,900
And who made you earn all your life.

986
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:19,440
Who taught you to turn your back on the ignorance that is the happiness of Bob.

987
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,560
It is time for you to get your revenge.

988
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,260
It's time for you to burn for Bob.

989
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:38,000
Two pounds, 200 miles by the year 2000.

990
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:44,320
If the X's don't come and get us, we're going after them.

991
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,380
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

992
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,140
This is City Probe Scanning.

993
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,720
We've run across some illegal sexual activity.

994
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,680
It should be on your DTO screen now.

995
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,680
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

996
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:11,220
For you have chosen to join me in this unnatural participatory ritual.

997
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,460
This tour of relentless human folly.

998
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,500
Your neighbors could be doing it.

999
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,020
Your friends, even relatives.

1000
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,160
And you'd never know until the blackmail has caught up with them.

1001
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:30,180
What else but blackmail and violence when the so-called good people of your community start swinging.

1002
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:30,820
That's right.

1003
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:31,340
And they'll finally get it down.

1004
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,680
This streaking out pit will finally blame it on God.

1005
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,400
And there'll be some kind of church started called the Streaker Church.

1006
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,200
And boy, they'll just, they'll probably try to make it religious.

1007
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,460
And I want to tell you it's abominable and it's filthy and it's rotten.

1008
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,000
And you ought to stand up against it.

1009
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,360
Say amen.

1010
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:46,980
Bob, Bob.

1011
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,740
I knew this would bother you.

1012
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,800
Bob, Bob.

1013
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:53,260
Bob.

1014
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,940
It's staying naked again.

1015
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,640
Oh.

1016
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,360
Calm down.

1017
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,240
Breathe down.

1018
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,260
Let yourself down.

1019
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,980
All right.

1020
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,780
Just take a deep breath in.

1021
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,040
Well, it's kind of tight for you.

1022
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,100
And kind of push it towards the middle.

1023
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,760
You want to stand high.

1024
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,060
Take it.

1025
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,560
You're in there.

1026
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,040
Bob will love you.

1027
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,040
I love you.

1028
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,640
You're in there.

1029
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:33,640


1030
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:33,640


1031
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:33,640


1032
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,520
Then throw your consolutions.

1033
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:41,640
The ones you're using to listen to this music with right now.

1034
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:43,620
Bob.

1035
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,940
He'll make you hard and frightened.

1036
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,620
Frightened and hard.

1037
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,740
You ever been hard and frightened, friend?

1038
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,400
Confused.

1039
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:56,700
Help me.

1040
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:56,780
Help me.

1041
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,540
Help me.

1042
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:57,720
Please help me.

1043
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,020
Help me.

1044
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,020


1045
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,020


1046
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,020


1047
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,020


1048
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,020


1049
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,020


1050
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,020


1051
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,020


1052
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,020


1053
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,160
On the surface of your very mind.

1054
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,000
You'll drink to these little spaghetti-like pumps.

1055
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,200
Just like a can of spaghetti-o.

1056
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,800
Come on, let me play it to you, man.

1057
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,920
I like to play blues.

1058
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,400
Come on, man, let me play it to you.

1059
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,080
Come on, come on.

1060
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,380
Stick your finger in there and swirl it around.

1061
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:15,020
Yeah.

1062
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:16,220
Squish.

1063
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,340
I'm not my guitar, man.

1064
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,400
You can't even hear my guitar, man.

1065
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:18,940
Come on, please.

1066
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,300
You can play with your own mind.

1067
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,080
Squishy.

1068
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,380
Poke at your own brain.

1069
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,520
I, Squishy, broke the convolution.

1070
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,120
So sickity and squishy.

1071
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,540
So frightened and hard.

1072
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,120
Frightened and hard.

1073
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,520
Frightened and hard, my friend.

1074
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,660
I have authority and I have knowledge.

1075
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,640
The hunger and thirst that a human heart has is satisfied by coming.

1076
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:55,100
I have seen the devil in my microscope and I have chained him.

1077
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:02,640
And I suppose you could say, in a sense, metaphorically speaking, I've cut him to pieces.

1078
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:14,120
The devil, Mr. Douglas, I have found is nothing more than a tiresome collection of genes.

1079
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:25,920
And it is with great assurance that I can tell you that Lucifer, son of mourning, is no more.

1080
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,240
Children.

1081
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,460
But there's a fourth thing.

1082
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,540
The Bible said that maidens have naked.

1083
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,280
In other words, they have no chain.

1084
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,780
And they took off their clothes.

1085
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,440
And they ran around in a golden cap.

1086
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,080
And they had no monstery.

1087
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,300
Need is revolution now.

1088
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,360
So let another day go by.

1089
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,740
Well, the days are getting shorter.

1090
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,020
And it's time for us to fight.

1091
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,760
The answer's not more love.

1092
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,360
It ain't love.

1093
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,160
It's blowing in the wind.

1094
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,640
Come join the revolution now.

1095
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,840
So let another day go by.

1096
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,040
Are you a member, sir?

1097
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,800
No, just tell me about the key.

1098
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,380
Pardon me, sir, if you're not a member.

1099
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,360
By the mystic order of the Lord,

1100
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,180
who made his interrogation?

1101
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:30,900

Up rightly.

1103
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,560
Wanna be a member?

1104
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,060
Naughty boy

1105
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:34,480
You wanna be a member?

1106
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,020
No.

1107
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,620
Naughty boy

1108
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,960
There's the way out.

1109
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,800
Wh Rasό

1110
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:56,280

1132
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,060
wednesday

1133
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:15,440
d

1134
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:15,680
the

1135
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,460
wee

1136
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,960
let's go

1137
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:21,960


1138
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,000
tracting

1139
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,560
media barrage material in the show,

1140
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,800
which I then re-edited some more.

1141
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,720
And it is all coming together,

1142
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,380
and we'll just edit on and on and on and on and on and on forever.

1143
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,600
Forever together.

1144
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,440
Just remember, you and me are sitting together

1145
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,360
and listening to this.

1146
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,200
How you fix for blades, friend?

1147
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,320
I don't want to put anybody on guilt trips,

1148
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,180
and I don't want to fight people.

1149
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,320
But I'm going to tell you something.

1150
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,120
If you're listening to a preacher or a group of people

1151
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,720
that are telling you you are saved,

1152
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,220
and that there's going to be the next Messiah that comes

1153
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,380
is going to pull you up to him, and you're leaving,

1154
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,120
that Messiah is Satan.

1155
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,180
He is Antichrist.

1156
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,200
And if you think you're saved whoring after Antichrist,

1157
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,660
you are sadly misled by your little house of your repute.

1158
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,280
That's a strong statement, but it's exactly true.

1159
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,320
To dwell there above the saints that we love.

1160
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,200
That'll be glory.

1161
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:21,920
Right.

1162
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,880
But to dwell here below with the saints that we know,

1163
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,740
that's another story.

1164
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,740
When am I going to be initiated?

1165
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,700
As soon as number one gets here.

1166
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,840
Number one!

1167
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,660
What kind of stupid wiener name is that?

1168
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:37,560
Oh, that's very nice.

1169
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,900
But there is a beautiful, really a beautiful ceremony,

1170
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,840
which I can just show you.

1171
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,540
It's a handy chopping block that happens to be here.

1172
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:51,180
I think that when people bring in,

1173
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,160
50 caliber machine guns,

1174
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,860
remember, I'm an old military person.

1175
00:57:55,320 --> 00:58:01,460
There's no church or group that needs a 50 caliber machine gun.

1176
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,220
Nasty word for a dirty business.

1177
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,900
There are chapters all over the world,

1178
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:11,940
and it has been foretold that someday a chosen one...

1179
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,100
Okay, okay, don't ask me a life story.

1180
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,160
Let the initiation begin.

1181
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,440
Ah!

1182
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,300
Securities!

1183
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,140
You can're worth that.

1184
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,620
Followers,

1185
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,740

Thousands of followers.
