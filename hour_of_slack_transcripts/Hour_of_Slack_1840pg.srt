1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
Oh, let go! Oh, he's got my leg! Oh, my leg! Help! Don't save me!

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,780
Call the dogs up, they're biting me! I give up!

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,780
The Self-Genius Power of Squash!

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,260
That was a couple of years ago. I went back to reform school and watched my chance.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,860
And this time I finally escaped.

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:23,940
Escape.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,220
A Spitfire Hijinx, says the Dobstown Mirror.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:41,040
Most religions, most of their rules are such that if you follow them, things are supposed to be nice or better as well as correct.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,700
The Church of the Subgenius has rules that if you follow them, have similar outcomes sometimes,

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,060
and other times make things very much not nice or not better.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,840
Which makes up for the fact that I'm not a subgenius.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,840
For hours, a mail-order mind-control cult more like life than a description or a hallucination of life.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,720
One such rule?

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Mob them if they can't take a joke.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,100
Try it and see.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,240
Go ahead, kid. What's the matter? Scared? Afraid your mom will find out?

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:22,220
Anyway, we'll be hearing the first live hour of Slack from 24X Day on Friday, July 2nd.

18
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,820
And I'm not going to play the first hour.

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:31,560
It is the last 26 minutes of Dr. Hal and me talking because it was recorded only on my phone and my location recorder,

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:40,560
which also picked up drunken audience chatter and just sounded too much like the situation actually sounded.

21
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,880
The last 40 minutes got recorded off the line mic board mix, which was salvageable.

22
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,240
Just for contrast, the first minute or so of this is from my ambient recordings, then the rest is from the board.

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,880
I don't mean the bored audience, I mean the mix board.

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,380
The old animated cartoons were the MTV videos of their time

25
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,440
where they build a cartoon around a popular song,

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,440
like happy harmonies, merry melodies, silly symphonies, and so forth.

27
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,200
The song, just about seven minutes long, perfect for a cartoon.

28
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,720
You're just following in those footsteps.

29
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:49,680
You're just following in those footsteps.

30
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,940
And then they're illegal now.

31
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,580
Some are.

32
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,880
I heard that they made the Warner Brothers cartoons non-violent somehow.

33
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,980
But not the special collections.

34
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,580
Anything that's chopped up for TV.

35
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,120
And Spielberg also messed everything up with his idea of Warner Brothers cartoons.

36
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,220
That just makes the banned ones more popular on YouTube.

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,500
I was thinking how awful it was that in the 70s that Ron Miller,

38
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,060
the director of the Disney organization,

39
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,060
a former football player,

40
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,160
took all the Donald Duck cartoons and so on

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,300
and put thumping disco music to them

42
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,540
and then released them.

43
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,620
And they used to show these ads again and again

44
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,020
with Donald Duck's fanny boinging to electro disco music.

45
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,640
Or goofy or something like that.

46
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,240
Strange laps somewhere.

47
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,100
And then they made the decision.

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,200
And then they made the decision.

49
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,320
Holy cow, we're going to have a pyramid of drunkenness here.

50
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,940
He's warmed up too much.

51
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,180
Thank you, I'm sorry.

52
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,820
I'll pour another one down in just a momentito.

53
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,340
Thank you, hunch peas.

54
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,340
Thank you so much.

55
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,740
The hunch peas.

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,480
Of Notre Dame.

57
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,120
God, what a butt kisser.

58
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,520
God.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,520
The hunchback of Notre Dame?

60
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,140
The hunch peas.

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,120
Oh, the hunch peas.

62
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,100
Oh, I'm just giving him crap.

63
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,020
It's all about ball busting with these military guys.

64
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,840
Well, as long as it's affectionate.

65
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,460
You see, when your default way is to run everybody down

66
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,200
and insult them, there comes a time something is not right

67
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,600
and then suddenly you snap and get irritated.

68
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,700
Like Mr. Spock saying,

69
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,180
I never did appreciate those comments you made about my ears.

70
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,060
I didn't like it then and I don't like it now.

71
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,360
Oh, geez, Mr. Spock.

72
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,720
Ease up.

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,860
Ease up or whatever.

74
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:59,960
Too much is, I hate to say it, in every instance is not always better than not enough.

75
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,300
Except to provoke a change.

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,860
Well, you know, the original quote was,

77
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,260
too much is always better than not enough but it's almost as bad.

78
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,940
But that just didn't have the same ring.

79
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,360
It didn't go over with the college kids nearly as well.

80
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,640
No, because they wanted all.

81
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,780
They wanted an excuse to hurt themselves with beer,

82
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,960
and that's exactly what I'm a little worried about

83
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:28,240
when I saw the 50 cases of Orange Blossom back in the day, IPA.

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,060
It's great, but 50 cases?

85
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,520
Take one down and pass it around.

86
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,560
There's 49 cases of beer on the floor.

87
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,360
Yeah, Onan already suggested that.

88
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,840
Yeah, well, Onan's not coming, right?

89
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,380
No, no, he couldn't.

90
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,660
He actually had to work.

91
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,960
Oh, yes, work.

92
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,860
The workaday world must go on, whether capitalism or communism.

93
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,480
Work?

94
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,180
Maynard G. Krebs knew that terror.

95
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,580
But you're about to know a new terror,

96
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,480
as taught by Father Joe Mama, Papa Joe for short,

97
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,300
in his miraculously preserved first sermon from 24X Day,

98
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,780
Gird Your Very Self.

99
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,760
Hello, dear friends, and welcome.

100
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,980
The sermon tonight is entitled

101
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,980
The Secret of Sisyphus.

102
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,380
You remember Sisyphus, don't you?

103
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,220
He was the ancient Greek king

104
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,880
who defied the gods and was condemned in Hades

105
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,420
to roll the large boulder up the hill to the very top,

106
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,060
only to have it roll back down over and over again.

107
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,060
How does one motivate themselves to do this over and over

108
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,160
throughout all eternity?

109
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,760
It's a dilemma many subgenies face,

110
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:42,960
but it's not a secret.

111
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,140
They're all working hard at their jobs,

112
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,100
working for the Khan.

113
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,300
How can we continue to fight our way through the work week,

114
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,480
hour after hour, day after day,

115
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,200
week after week, month after month,

116
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,960
and year after year?

117
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,560
We try desperately to empty that in-basket,

118
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,380
only to have it refilled just as quickly as it is cleared.

119
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,920
What did we do to deserve such punishment?

120
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,940
Nothing.

121
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,020
Nothing at all.

122
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,960
And what can we do to make it clear

123
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:12,960


124
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:12,960


125
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:12,960


126
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,740
that we're not the only ones in this hell on earth?

127
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,840
Nothing.

128
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,100
Nothing at all.

129
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,460
But there is a secret to withstand the despair

130
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,400
that this punishment tries so desperately to impose on us, dear friends.

131
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:35,180
A well-guarded secret that allows us to fight on despite any and all odds.

132
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,260
But to reveal it, we must go forward in time,

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,620
over two thousand years,

134
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,920
to 1860,

135
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:42,960


136
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:42,960


137
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:42,960


138
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:42,960


139
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:42,960


140
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,360
during the American Civil War.

141
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,660
during the American Civil War.

142
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,260
The bloodiest war in American history.

143
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,300
650,000 casualties.

144
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,940
One of the earliest battles

145
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,980
was the Battle of Lexington, Missouri,

146
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,420
or as the natives called it during wintertime,

147
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,040
Missouri.

148
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,740
The Yankees had attacked the city

149
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,560
and were dominating the battlefield.

150
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,240
and were dominating the battlefield.

151
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,940
During the day, the Union and Southern forces

152
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,100
would meet on the battlefield and kill one another.

153
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:10,980
During the night,

154
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,940
they would meet on the campgrounds,

155
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,520
and play each other at poker.

156
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,580
They weren't friends,

157
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,440
they were frenemies.

158
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,060
And who doesn't like beating their

159
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,540
adversary at cards and taking their money?

160
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,340
adversary at cards and taking their money?

161
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,520
The daily fighting was brutal.

162
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,320
At one point, the Yankees took over

163
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,680
the Confederate field hospital,

164
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,740
the old Anderson House,

165
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,140
which had been converted to a three-story

166
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,320
warehouse for the wounded.

167
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,460
Many rebels were trapped on the upper floor,

168
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,660
and the two sides traded gunfire

169
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,880
up and down the large,

170
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,000
central stairwell.

171
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,740
Finally, the Yankees offered

172
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,740
a truce of sorts.

173
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,880
Any Confederate who could survive a jump

174
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,820
from the third floor and could crawl

175
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,700
back to his unit would be allowed to do so.

176
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,260
Several accepted,

177
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,860
and survived. So, the Union

178
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,480
changed the rules just a little bit.

179
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,980
They set out bayonets

180
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,020
pointing upward

181
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,640
at the bottom of the drop,

182
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,220
and took wages on how many would impale themselves.

183
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,800
Many did.

184
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,840
But, even

185
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,980
more gruesome was the fighting that occurred

186
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,740
out on the river bluffs.

187
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,780
The Yanks held

188
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,840
the high ground, forcing the rebels

189
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,540
to push up the hill under

190
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,980
withering gunfire, only to be repulsed

191
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,140
and forced back down time after time.

192
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,700
Then,

193
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,400
the South tried something

194
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,360
different.

195
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,780
Why not provide some portable protection?

196
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,980
They took some of the

197
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,740
bales of crops from the surrounding

198
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,040
farmland and started rolling them up the hill

199
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,820
like a rotating rock.

200
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,460
It stopped the bullets,

201
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,960
and the Yankees started to worry.

202
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,060
Then they came up with another idea of their own.

203
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,060
They heated their bullets

204
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,060
and fired those at the bales.

205
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,720
And sure enough, it worked

206
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,600
for a while.

207
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,200
It set the bales on fire,

208
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,720
and yet, the rebels kept coming.

209
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:02,820
Even

210
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,660
when the smoldering and often burning

211
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,680
bales made it so much more difficult,

212
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,360
they continued to fight, and

213
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,220
when the battle was over,

214
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,240
the rebels had won.

215
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,340
Despite overwhelming odds,

216
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,560
Lexington was safe,

217
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,040
at least for a little while,

218
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,660
and the South thanked God for their

219
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,540
miraculous victory.

220
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,700
But was it really divine

221
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,020
intervention that provided their victory that day?

222
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,720
Or was there another

223
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,920
forgotten factor,

224
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
a secret to their success?

225
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,720
And what the

226
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,400
Hades does this have to do with Bob?

227
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,000
Well, for that answer,

228
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,920
dear friends, I'd like to

229
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,940
reveal to you an often overlooked little detail.

230
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,160
That crop

231
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,380
that the bales were made out of

232
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,580
was a common cash crop back then.

233
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,740
Not cotton,

234
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,140
but hemp.

235
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,740
A plant used to make rope

236
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,940
and other fibrous products.

237
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,140
It is the older equivalent of cannabis

238
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,420
and Havafrop Zipulops,

239
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,020
the sacred subgenius herb from Bob's pipe.

240
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,280
The more those bales burned,

241
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,320
the more inspired those rebels became.

242
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,600
And as to the

243
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,980
Sisyphus is concerned,

244
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,380
well, what kind of fumes do you think

245
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:15,940
they are?

246
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,960
Well, they are

247
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:17,960


248
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,760
Hades and Hadesia.

249
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,540
The more you

250
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,080
think about it,

251
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,220
the more you'll be surprised

252
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,220


253
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,220


254
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,220


255
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,260
The more you

256
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,360
think about

257
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,360


258
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:42,940
Sisyphus,

259
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,080
the more you'll be surprised.

260
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,520
Because we are the modern day rebels.

261
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,580
Only we are not fighting for slavery.

262
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,980
We are fighting against slavery.

263
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,420
We are fighting the same slavery

264
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,880
the conspiracy created

265
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,640
when they traded the subjugation

266
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,620
of one race by another

267
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,560
using whips and chains

268
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,260
with the modern subjugation of all races

269
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,240
using time cards and security cameras.

270
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,000
They replaced the overseer's

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,580
whipping with the modern

272
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,100
manager's tongue lashings.

273
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,940
No, you can call it slavery

274
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,280
light if you like.

275
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,960
All the oppression, but only one third

276
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,060
of the actual effort.

277
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,180
The 24 hour bondage has been replaced

278
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,700
with a 40 hour work week.

279
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,140
But don't expect any gratitude

280
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,960
from us. We all know they

281
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,540
only did it to make us more

282
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,020
interchangeable and expendable.

283
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,780
It was

284
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,360
a cost cutting measure

285
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,340
because like everything else,

286
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,940
even slaves are cheaper

287
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,720
to rent than to own.

288
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,440
There is also

289
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,500
a color difference

290
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,820
to the modern warfare.

291
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,060
It is no longer the blue against the gray.

292
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,820
It is a battle betwixt

293
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,720
the pinks and the grays.

294
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,120
And come next day,

295
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,500
the burning bullets of the pinks

296
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,740
will be no match for the titanium

297
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,760
plating of the gray

298
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,000
saucer ships. Nor will they

299
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,860
be capable of outrunning the laser

300
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,200
cannons of the Exis Starfleet.

301
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,280
So embrace

302
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,080
the struggle leading

303
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,540
to Ex Day, dear friends.

304
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,640
The fierce fighting that shall occur

305
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,660
no matter how bleak it may appear.

306
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,500
Remember our

307
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,740
history and fight on.

308
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,020
Remember the secret

309
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,100
of Sisyphus

310
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,740
and the secret of the Southwood's amazing

311
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,920
battle. If you

312
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,000
can't beat them,

313
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,180
joint them. And don't

314
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,320
worry, be

315
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
frappy. It is the word

316
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,040
of our praise, Bob!

317
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,000
Amen!

318
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,320
YAY!

319
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,640
YAY!

320
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,360
YAY!

321
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,880
We're broadcasting live on

322
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,440
Freethink Radio!

323
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,160
Freethink Radio!

324
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,340
Freethink Radio!

325
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,560
Has all the subgenius shows.

326
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,880
Put your hands on the radio

327
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,820
and maybe it'll stop that annoying humming.

328
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,920
They do replay

329
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,420
almost all the...

330
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,060
You know, it's good to where

331
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,440
I hate to say it, but the number of subgenius shows

332
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,600
is too damn high.

333
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,960
It's like the number of subgenius Facebook

334
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,980
pages. Too damn high!

335
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,040
I can't begin

336
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,220
to follow them all.

337
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,100
It's ridiculous.

338
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,920
Well, a lot of applicants aren't

339
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
bothering to fill out the subgenius

340
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,480
questionnaire quiz

341
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,900
and I think they should

342
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,820
at least make a stab at it.

343
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,180
We discontinued the questionnaire

344
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,300
because... You did?

345
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,180
Yeah, people were spending so much time filling them out

346
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,900
and I wasn't doing anything with them. I felt

347
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,980
bad about it. Well, if they put anything, it

348
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,100


349
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,140
I mean, you can't admit them, but if they

350
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,960
just refuse to cooperate,

351
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,080
do you really want them hanging around?

352
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,420
They're too snarky for their own good.

353
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,860
I still have them all.

354
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,040
In a big paper sack

355
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,060
that's rotting away.

356
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,800
Don't hold them back.

357
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,580
Put them in a paper sack.

358
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,580
In the shed. The Dobbs shed.

359
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,000
Right. I'm too bad about that

360
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,920
unfortunate fire that...

361
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,620
Well, we shouldn't have been

362
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,960
using pure oxygen to

363
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,200
fill the place.

364
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,260
Like the Hindenburg.

365
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,120
There went all those types.

366
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,560
No, actually, it's got...

367
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,740
The Dobbs... There is a Dobbs shed

368
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,000
Uh...

369
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,320
Dobbs shed. Near my house

370
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,600
lined with

371
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,700
fossil rocks.

372
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,660
Don't go near that old shed, kids.

373
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,160
Yeah.

374
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,440
It's got $3000

375
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,720
worth of insulation sprayed in it and

376
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,840
two air conditioners that are both

377
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,440
running full speed right now.

378
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,320
And the only thing that's

379
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,320


380
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,320


381
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,320


382
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,320


383
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,320


384
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,040
used to preserve the ancient

385
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,660
rotting documents on paper.

386
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,300
And 8mm,

387
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,280
35mm film, 16mm film,

388
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,920
Betamax VHS.

389
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,260
Sounds great.

390
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,520
The zines and

391
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,100
mail art of the 80s and 90s.

392
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,200
Well, the ones that the squirrels

393
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,860
didn't pee on in my Cleveland...

394
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,220
Still continuing, the zine world

395
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,080
is flourishing.

396
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,840
And, uh, Onan is

397
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,820
inheriting that shed

398
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,980
because he's

399
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,060
qualified. He recently gave

400
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,080
the world's biggest

401
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,240
Buckminster Fuller archive

402
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,360
to a university.

403
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,020
He had acquired that much

404
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,220
Buckminster Fuller. He says his was...

405
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,140
There's probably another guy that would say

406
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,400
his was bigger, but...

407
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,160
You know, it's all about size.

408
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,760
Like the pink Canucks. Oh, they're

409
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,980
Marshall McLuhan. But Onan was so big, he gave

410
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,600
it away for free to

411
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,900
some university in Portland. It's probably

412
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,280
been burned down by now.

413
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,900
Well, you don't know. He left

414
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,940
Portland. He lived too near downtown

415
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,780
and it was just

416
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,900
downright dangerous. He got tired of the

417
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,760
ruckus, so he actually

418
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,000
left for that reason. I've turned into a fad of

419
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,980
ruffian violence.

420
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,520
With the

421
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,400
excuse of wokeism.

422
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,240
Out of control. You see,

423
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,880
these youngsters don't remember

424
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,260
the 20th century and the

425
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,020
cultural revolution in China

426
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,720
and its revolutionary

427
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,040
excesses. Because all revolutions

428
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,200
of every kind

429
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,660
ultimately have excesses.

430
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,020
The pendulum swings back

431
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,700
and forth in the human way

432
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,900
and for a while, the extreme

433
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,500
is

434
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,600
an intensity which can be unpleasant

435
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,420
for those who are on the other end of it.

436
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,820
That stuff scares me because that

437
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,960
really did happen in China. The most

438
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,640
ignorant, and Cambodia,

439
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,120
the most ignorant

440
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,080
people who outnumbered

441
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,840
the intelligentsia and

442
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,520
professionals and shopkeepers

443
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,740
took power and

444
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,580
wrecked

445
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,500
the

446
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,060
lives of anyone who could

447
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,040
read or speak a foreign

448
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,340
language, wore glasses.

449
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,240
I know people who went through that as

450
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,060
teenagers. Tried to preserve art

451
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,700
from earlier non

452
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,140
Marxist Leninist eras.

453
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,840
Yeah, well I worry about the

454
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,600
I don't know, damn

455
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,720
Trumpy Qanons doing the same thing.

456
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,960
Other people worry about the anti-fa army.

457
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,060
Which as far as I can tell

458
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,760
exists only in

459
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,820
Portland and Seattle. The trick

460
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,080
is not to get around

461
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,220
between those two stones.

462
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,740
But they are real

463
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,000
in those two places.

464
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,260
Anti-fa just means you oppose

465
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,060
fascism. If you want to see where they are

466
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,980
go to Arlington National Cemetery.

467
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,880
Sure, we're all

468
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
anti-fa, but in the sense

469
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,100
I mean, it's people who'll

470
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,120
say, yeah man, I'm anti-fa.

471
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,220
F*** you dude. Oppressor.

472
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,980
And then they'll topple a

473
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,940
statue of somebody who is a

474
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,140
hero to the gay community.

475
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,520
Or crash,

476
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,000
burn down a courthouse where all kinds

477
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,920
of human rights things were done for the first

478
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,880
time. Because they have no idea about

479
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,640
their own damn history. They destroyed

480
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,540
a statue of Frederick Douglass.

481
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,360
Why? Well they

482
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,040
I don't know why. In San Francisco

483
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,940
they took red spray paint and

484
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,140
spray painted in the face of the statues

485
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,040
in the park of Don Quixote,

486
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,600
Sancho, Panza,

487
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,280
and Cervantes. And Cervantes

488
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,840
was himself enslaved

489
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,120
for a while.

490
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,940
But I guess they didn't like it because they thought

491
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,960
these were conquistadors who

492
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,020
oppressed the First Nations people

493
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,220
and had never read Don Quixote.

494
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,860
As opposed to satirical

495
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,100
novel characters.

496
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,940
Good God. Next

497
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,600
question.

498
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,140
I'm not sure if you're

499
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,740
interested in this, but

500
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:31,740


501
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,720
story of the

502
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,960
first-generation

503
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:33,960


504
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,580
The first-generation church

505
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,060
was a church

506
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,060


507
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,080
built in the

508
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,640
18th century.

509
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,040
And it was

510
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,720
built in the

511
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,900
18th century.

512
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,080
But what's this?

513
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,040
From the cult

514
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,900
of Zere, a strange

515
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,020
document with the curious

516
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,680
title, Wizard Bong.

517
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,980
Here, I think

518
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,560
I'll read it.

519
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,840
Is existence incorrect?

520
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,020
While there is much

521
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,920
to investigate, what we don't

522
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,740
understand increases exponentially

523
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,040
with each passing year.

524
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,440
Recently, for instance,

525
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,060
Wizard Bong is known

526
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,040
to be Wizard Bong and potentially

527
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,880
other things and

528
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,840
or everything that is not

529
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,660
Wizard Bong, while also

530
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,920
remaining everything that is

531
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,940
Wizard Bong all the while.

532
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,820
And

533
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,840
also not Wizard Bong?

534
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,980
You read that correctly,

535
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,000
we think. And tell you what,

536
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,880
containing all possibilities,

537
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,060
including the possibility of one's

538
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,120
own absence without undergoing

539
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,940
some form of severe

540
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,380
existential crisis,

541
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,600
indicates a bold,

542
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
emotional fortitude.

543
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,800
This damn thing

544
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,740
proverbially eats its own

545
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,080
stomach, so to speak.

546
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,620
How the hell can a Bong

547
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,620
do that stuff?

548
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,760
A Bong that is

549
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,860
and isn't a Bong, and also is

550
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,280
and isn't everything else.

551
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,900
Strive to achieve. Reach.

552
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,260
Fail.

553
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,080
Breathe. Take a nap.

554
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,960
Be at the coffee

555
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,800
shop in three hours and look for a

556
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,200
man wearing pants.

557
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,200
Oh my goodness!

558
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,340
Wom sma tem

559
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,920
enon she daftod.

560
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,000
It's fine really, fine.

561
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,140
It didn't have to happen this way,

562
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,100
but now that it has, let's not cry

563
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,040
about it. Stop muttering. It'll be

564
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,320
okay.

565
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,800
Wizard Bong, fine.

566
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,200
The proof is in the park.

567
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,000
Highly illogical research

568
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,740
indicates the promising possibility.

569
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,780
We're engaged in

570
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,840
irrevocable congress with lost

571
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,040
truths. Where does the park

572
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,480
factor in, for example?

573
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,120
Still a mystery, embarrassingly,

574
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,420
but we'll find out.

575
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,580
Where exactly

576
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,020
are we now? Climb

577
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,040
beyond your expectations. Wet

578
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,640
your appetite. Wrestle

579
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,760
alligators. There are mysterious

580
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,860
underpinnings to the reality we

581
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,960
view daily through a lens darkly.

582
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,460
Wizard Bong,

583
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,980
you are where you said you

584
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,420
were, aren't you?

585
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,320
Were you lying?

586
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:25,880
...

587
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
This is the sixth heading.

588
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,960
Illumination decrypt

589
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,740
mismatch error.

590
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,920
Unfortunately, you can't read the sixth

591
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,040
heading until you've read and memorized the entire

592
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,060
website. Once you have

593
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,700
undergone this strenuous exercise,

594
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,060
the actual paragraph should be quite

595
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,020
easy to read behind this one.

596
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,800
In other words,

597
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,380
this is not the actual paragraph.

598
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,700
Wouldn't you like to finally

599
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,960
truly know?

600
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,920
Exactly!

601
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,820
And that's Wizard

602
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,940
Bong from Cult of Zere,

603
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,720
which I think Onan found

604
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,700
on a website.

605
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,860
Cult of Zere is

606
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,640
basically our friend

607
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,820
Molg.

608
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,920
Molg also lives in

609
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,340
Portland.

610
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,540
Hot, hot, hot.

611
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,040
Well, here's

612
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,640
a... We got a little bit of mail.

613
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,700
Oh boy, mail call.

614
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,940
Yeah. Well, let's

615
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,560
see what's in Bob's bottomless

616
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,640
mail bag this time, Stang.

617
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,260
Someone,

618
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,320
Sigma

619
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,320
Starspawn,

620
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,960
Cute.

621
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,880
Just sent a short, it was a

622
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,340
quote he found in the

623
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,980
Dobstown Mirror.

624
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,100
Lay it on me.

625
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,980
If there is a God, he is a machine

626
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,560
that converts prayer into irony.

627
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,480
And

628
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,360
the letter writer said,

629
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,000
I wish I had written that.

630
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,660
And I wrote back, and I said, so do I,

631
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,720
but Onan wrote that.

632
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,100
Onan actually has been sort of like my

633
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,160
co-speechwriter for a long time.

634
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,080
He's coming up with good stuff, and I hope

635
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,160
we're all familiar with the Dobstown Mirror,

636
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,780
that wonderful subgenius

637
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,680
newspaper.

638
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,420
I gave him a plug in the

639
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,580
nanoheliograph.

640
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,540
I don't know why this is in here. This was...

641
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,880
This is some... It says,

642
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,620
after

643
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,860
track 10, this

644
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,960
1830th hour

645
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,100
of Slack is a good rerun from 2008.

646
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,040
And everything about

647
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,720
X-Day still applies in

648
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,000
2021, except the main

649
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,760
party is being held in Land O'Lakes,

650
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,980
Florida, at the nudist resort of

651
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,940
Reverend Xanthea Octo-Shroom and

652
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,440
her dad.

653
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,640
Good boy. What a...

654
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,640
This is... What an improvement this is.

655
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,960
But most subgeniuses...

656
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,160
It's certainly more comfortable.

657
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,860
Probably won't be nude. Most of our skin

658
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,740
is generally unkissed

659
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,880
by the sun's rays and will likely

660
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,940
stay that way. All information

661
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,500
can be had...

662
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,100
Who is saying this?

663
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,120
Dr. Howell and I will be

664
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,220
there, and a whole bunch of young...

665
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,280
much younger subgeniuses,

666
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,140
including ringleaders

667
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,620
Argus Fox, Reverend Eads, and

668
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,380
Pitt Chooley. The rising generation.

669
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,060
We depend on them to perpetuate our

670
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,060
legacy. Yeah, and to

671
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,600
haul our luggage. When the

672
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,840
torch falls from our faltering

673
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,880
fingers, there are brawny

674
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,080
hands to grasp it and hold it

675
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,120
high. Oh, and then there's a

676
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,840
sad thing about Reverend Rock

677
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,620
Roswell. Oh, yeah.

678
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,400
I saw that. Yeah.

679
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,760
He was only 60.

680
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,120
That is really too bad. He had a lot of

681
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,620
trouble with health and insurance.

682
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,440
You know, Dr. Evermore

683
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,400
died also in

684
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,660
2020. Oh,

685
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,860
the list goes on and on. Reverend

686
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,280
Crash. Yeah.

687
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,920
Heathen, of course. Heathen,

688
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,320
yes.

689
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,800
I really, really miss

690
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,520
Heathen. It's really terrible about Heathen.

691
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,940
On the other hand, I think Heathen

692
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,940
died in his sleep of a heart attack, which is not

693
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,900
a bad way to go. Yes. You know,

694
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,980
you just wake up on the escape vessels and go,

695
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,940
whoa. You wake up dead,

696
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,380
yeah.

697
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
And, of course,

698
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,740
Jay Lynch and Skip Williamson.

699
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,640
Interesting cases because

700
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,700
when Jay Lynch died,

701
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,060
Skip Williamson couldn't stand to

702
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,600
go on living.

703
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,040
.

704
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,000
Yes, but

705
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,560
there are the survivors,

706
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,740
the hearty survivors of

707
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,040
this terrible

708
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,620
time.

709
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,880
And that just shows that

710
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,440
somebody always survives,

711
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,660
and you always think it's going to be you.

712
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,660
And who knows? It might be.

713
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,200
It's the lottery, luck of the draw.

714
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,040
You might

715
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,840
be allowed to be aboard

716
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,800
the Ark. Although I

717
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,080
saw that Noah's Ark movie

718
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,900
and I wondered where they were coming

719
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,920
from with that. The bad guys

720
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,920
stows away aboard the Ark

721
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,860
and starts eating endangered

722
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,860
species and so forth. Where did that

723
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,660
come from? And long

724
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,000
suffering Mrs. Noah played by

725
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,560
Jennifer Connelly, you know.

726
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,100
What a performance.

727
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,000
That must have been

728
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,960
a forgettable movie or maybe it was

729
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,140
late at night. I saw it but I don't remember

730
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,820
any of it. Yeah.

731
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,000
It starts with the Anakim.

732
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,040
No, no, no, not the Anakim.

733
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,120
What are the

734
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,900
angelic beings who had sex with the

735
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,000
daughters of men?

736
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,000
Yes. Only in this movie

737
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
they're like the pile of

738
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,660
rocks monster from Galaxy

739
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,920
Quest. They're these

740
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,880
big tumbling balancing

741
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,060
boulders stumbling

742
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,000
around. How are they going to have sex with anybody?

743
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,020
Anyway, so that's Hollywood.

744
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,000
What can you say? Speaking of

745
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,500
Noah's Ark movies, I

746
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,080
found a list of movies

747
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,220
that have been filmed in the town I live in,

748
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,740
Glen Rose. Yeah.

749
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,240
And of all things,

750
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,100
besides Dinosaur Valley Girls,

751
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,140
was Noah's Ark. I saw that one.

752
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,640
I have that one.

753
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,840
Had been partly shot there.

754
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,640
Well they have the Noah's Ark

755
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,760
attraction, don't they?

756
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,060
I understand. We have a

757
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,980
wildlife safari park there

758
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,980
and you can film

759
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,880
giraffes and zebras walking

760
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,160
two by two if you're desperate.

761
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,320
You know,

762
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,960
but it turned out it

763
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,000
wasn't the big budget

764
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,320
Noah's Ark. It was

765
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,420
the Michael York Noah's Ark.

766
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,880
Oh no. Yeah.

767
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,420
A Christian made Noah's Ark.

768
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,140
Real, real low budget.

769
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,140
So that explains why they had to go to

770
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,680
the safari park in Texas

771
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,240
to film the zebras

772
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,460
walking two by two.

773
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,040
Well I read that one Noah's Ark

774
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,240
from some Christian Noah's Ark

775
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,040
park got washed away by

776
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
severe floods, which seemed

777
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,880
so appropriate. No, it wasn't.

778
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,580
It had severe

779
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,240
water damage. The one in Kentucky.

780
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,380
The giant building shaped like Noah's Ark

781
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,080
leaked

782
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,680
and flooded.

783
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,900
And the water poured in and

784
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,160
they didn't read their Bible closely enough.

785
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,160
That's all so silly, friends,

786
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,840
because Noah's Ark actually

787
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,020
sank at the area

788
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,340
known as Stang Ranch

789
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,160
in Glen Rose, Texas today.

790
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,680
It's not on Mount Ararat

791
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,600
or anywhere. I can show you

792
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,680
the wreckage. There's very little left.

793
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,080
A few boards.

794
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,780
Well it was made

795
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,820
so many cubits long

796
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,860
and deep out of shittim wood.

797
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,600
The prehistoric

798
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,060
subgeniuses jumped off

799
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,160
the boat and as it

800
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,860
sank a lot of critters

801
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,880
went down with it.

802
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,520
But don't they have some of these parks with

803
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,780
Jesus riding a triceratops

804
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,940
and so forth? I mean they really

805
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,040
go off the deep end. Hal, I can't

806
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,940
wait to get you to the Creation Evidence

807
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,360
Museum in Glen Rose.

808
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,720
Well the most amazing one

809
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,160
is in, is it in, no it must

810
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
be in Virginia because I told

811
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,900
Doug about it and then he went there

812
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,320
which is the Republican

813
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,920
Dinosaur Park where

814
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,940
the South wins the Civil War because

815
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,060
dinosaurs eat Lincoln and U.S.

816
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,760
Grant and so on. They have all these

817
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,420
dioramas of

818
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,840
dinosaurs munching the Union Army

819
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,920
and so forth. Well I told Doug

820
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,860
about that and then he went to his

821
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,880
Virginia Military

822
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,720
Academy reunion and he

823
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,080
took time to drive over to the

824
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,880
park and he got there when it wasn't open

825
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,980
but he talked to the guy and the guy let him get in

826
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,040
and shoot pictures so he has

827
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,400
a slide show of it now.

828
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,900
Great, great bad

829
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,920
dinosaur parks. There's

830
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,220
quite a few of them. There's one in

831
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,780
Glen Rose, a dinosaur world.

832
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,940
There's one, same as the one, same

833
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,940
chain as the one here and

834
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,100
there's one in Cave City, Kentucky

835
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,140
also. There still are a lot of them.

836
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,960
Many have fallen by the wayside.

837
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,960
Flintstone Village is

838
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,340
in ruins, a sad

839
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,280
state compared to

840
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,940
where it used to be. But the

841
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,840
thing is, what a great film

842
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,060
project it would be to start at

843
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,880
one end of the country and then drive to

844
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,020
every tacky dinosaur park

845
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,120
that there is. You know, have a giant

846
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,160
road trip and

847
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,280
you know, make commentary

848
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,340
on it.

849
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,060
Show clips from dinosaur

850
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,580
movies.

851
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,160
Couldn't it be entertaining?

852
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,440
That would be fun to do.

853
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,220
A lot of

854
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,880
gift shops of

855
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,080
various places veer

856
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,720
into dinosaur park territory.

857
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,320
Mainly you've got the big shapeless

858
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,780
concrete dinosaurs

859
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,740
somewhat weathered with pieces of

860
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,120
rebar sticking out for the pathetic

861
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,380
nature of it all.

862
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,180
I'm lucky enough to live

863
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,980
in a town that's famous

864
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,580
for dinosaur tracks and that's

865
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,880
their claim to fame. Dinosaur Capital

866
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,480
of Texas. Dinosaur tracks,

867
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,420
chemotherapy. Yeah, the

868
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,200
most famous ones.

869
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,640
And there's lots of really boring

870
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,240
cretaceous marine fossils.

871
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,780
You don't like those, huh?

872
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,380
Oh, I love them. My house is full of them.

873
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,720
I had to move most of them back outside.

874
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,460
I've lined my yard with them.

875
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,640
But they're all fossilized

876
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,000
things that are still around today.

877
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,480
Snails, oysters, clams.

878
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,160
Not the same ones.

879
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,800
Not mosasaurs, but I didn't find

880
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,360
any of those.

881
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,080
Well, we have varanid lizards today

882
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,700
and mosasaurs are just those big

883
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,540
monitors that went back to the ocean

884
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,620
and became aquatic.

885
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,900
There was a fairly new one

886
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,900
found called Dallasaurus.

887
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,020
Interesting.

888
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,220
It's got a three foot long mosasaur.

889
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,100
There's also Arizonasaurus,

890
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,160
which is a fin-backed

891
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:45,940
archosaurian

892
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,860
reptile which is not a dinosaur

893
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,260
but more of a

894
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,580
crurotarsal.

895
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,240
And then there was the moronodon,

896
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,040
the fattest, stupidest of all

897
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,000
dinosaurs, so bloated that

898
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,960
its belly had to be covered with thick

899
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,540
scales to prevent harm

900
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,520
from dragging over the rocks.

901
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,320
And the blundersaurus whose

902
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,680
constant tripping caused the

903
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,800
indentation of the ventral surface

904
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,940
which has puzzled so many

905
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,420
scientists.

906
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,060
But yeah, I'm lucky

907
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,520
to live in a town that has more

908
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,660
dinosaur statues, good,

909
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,420
bad, and indifferent than

910
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,080
most small towns. Sounds pretty good to me.

911
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,120
Yeah, some of them are really great.

912
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,980
There's a miniature golf course

913
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,840
with the worst

914
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,820
dinosaur, the worst

915
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,680
brachiosaurus you ever saw.

916
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,300
It's hard to do it right.

917
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:35,720
It's just laughable.

918
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,720
And I have the full collection

919
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,980
on my phone if anybody really wants to see it.

920
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,760
I was just in Chicago

921
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,760
O'Hare airport on the way here

922
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,960
and I usually try to find the

923
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,720
giant brachiosaurus

924
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,040
that they have there on loan from the Field Museum.

925
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,620
I'm not sure it's there anymore.

926
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,020
Anyway, I had trouble walking. I couldn't get there.

927
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,900
But when you're there,

928
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,500
you're standing by its legs

929
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,240
and they're like the immense tree trunks.

930
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,940
Hey, the background

931
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,640
music by Fid Chooly sucks.

932
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,640
And its head is touching

933
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,020
the very top of the

934
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,980
concourse. And down by

935
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,040
its toes, there's a little shop

936
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,880
that sells plastic dinosaurs

937
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,160
and other sacred objects.

938
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,920
I saw what looked like

939
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,880
a giant wishbone in the Dallas

940
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,840
DFW airport.

941
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,940
For years they said, you see dinosaurs

942
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,080
didn't have a wishbone. But now we know

943
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,460
they did. A furcula, as it is called.

944
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,920
This would have been Godzilla's

945
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,880
wishbone. So I'm wondering

946
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,900
maybe it was a work of art made to look like

947
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,900
a fossil wishbone of a giant creature.

948
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,980
Boy, if you crack that one and get the

949
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,280
big piece, I wonder what kind of wish you get.

950
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,100
Could you make a guitar pick out of Godzilla's

951
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,020
press bone? Godzilla's what?

952
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,940
Like Superman. Could he

953
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,360
like...

954
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,640
Could he like fight

955
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,720
Superman, Godzilla, and then

956
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,540
Superman wins?

957
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,900
Well, the important

958
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,520
pick, of course... And then

959
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,680
Superman makes a pick out of Godzilla's

960
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,140
press bone.

961
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,680
Whose sound could melt a heart of stone.

962
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,780
Then there's the

963
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,680
pick of destiny.

964
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,060
Maybe that's what it is.

965
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,260
Maybe that's what the pick of destiny is.

966
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,940
It was the pick of destiny!

967
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,120
My life knew

968
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,920
every single Tenacious D song

969
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,620
by heart.

970
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,880
Well, they're good songs, especially

971
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,760
that whole thing about challenging

972
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,360
Satan to the rock-off.

973
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,680
It's a great sustained

974
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,900
sequence. One should

975
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,220
generally not do that.

976
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,620
Don't challenge demons

977
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,560
to do things and so on.

978
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,540
Life is better without that.

979
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,760
You know, when Voltaire

980
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,800
was dying, and of course

981
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,000
Voltaire thought he was dying for the last

982
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,980
20 or 30 years of his life.

983
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,860
But at one point he was really

984
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,200
dying, and he was the big free thinker

985
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,600
in France, so...

986
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,780
A priest went there hoping

987
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,920
to get a deathbed

988
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,860
confession, you know, a conversion.

989
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,120
So he finally came back to the

990
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120
church and he was shouting,

991
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,560
Renounce Satan! Renounce Satan!

992
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,600
Voltaire was saying, really,

993
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,920
at a time like this, do we want to make enemies?

994
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,240
Last night I heard a most confusing sound

995
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,180
it came from

996
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,680
inside the wall

997
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,680
A moist and sloshing noise

998
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,780
a condensation sprawl

999
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,780
A wheel of gastro

1000
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,460
with a fulvic protuberant

1001
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:42,740
spine

1002
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,420
A radioactive skull

1003
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,100
and tentacle sublime

1004
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,260
He shook his shiny

1005
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,680
radula and

1006
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,340
asked me with a Croatian

1007
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,100
drawl

1008
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,720
Could

1009
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,660
I please see

1010
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,720
Farley Granger's oxygen

1011
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,720
tent?

1012
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,200
Oxygen tent!

1013
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,300
I suppose

1014
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,620
it needed to see

1015
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,300
if Farley was okay

1016
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,880
Gastropoda

1017
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,920
worry a lot, their concerns must

1018
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
feel late

1019
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,960
Their excretory organs are known

1020
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,860
to emit an assertive bouquet

1021
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,060
I told them to clap and

1022
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,560
gesticulate it

1023
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,820
Would you, would you, would you

1024
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,220
please?

1025
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,060
The gastropody

1026
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,500
bound to Farley's

1027
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,080
face and

1028
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,980
sarcasm

1029
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:57,980


1030
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,080
the sarcasm

1031
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,080


1032
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,080


1033
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,080


1034
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,080


1035
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,080


1036
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,080


1037
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,080


1038
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,240
of the

1039
00:37:59,240 --> 00:37:59,240


1040
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,480
tenacious sheets of mucus

1041
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,320
like my ankle falls

1042
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,580
His throbbing ganglion

1043
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,080
suggested pleasure

1044
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,040
through a bloody mass

1045
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,800
of pus-covered gauze

1046
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,760
Thank you

1047
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,300
sir

1048
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,680
for letting me into the

1049
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,640
oxygen tent

1050
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,600
Love should pay

1051
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,900
and Farley Granger's

1052
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,380
oxygen tent should stand

1053
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,820
Oxygen Tent

1054
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,100
Oxygen Tent

1055
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,800
Oxygen Tent

1056
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,540
Oxygen Tent

1057
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,280
Oxygen Tent

1058
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,080
The Rudy Schwartz

1059
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,060
Project Farley Granger's

1060
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,240
Oxygen Tent

1061
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,900
from the album adjacent to the

1062
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,860
latex gerbil

1063
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,600
that's its title not its location

1064
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,200
probably, maybe both

1065
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,000
Now back to 24X Day

1066
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,440
with special guest Dr. Howland Owl

1067
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,780
Well I, Dr. Howl

1068
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:03,900
I'm an old fart and I think that as old farts we should let the young farts...

1069
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:08,500
Well let them step up here and grab the microphone. I'm not stopping anybody.

1070
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,740
Well, you see they're closing in on the science.

1071
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,160
Who's gonna fight the next war?

1072
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,460
Alright, let them come I say.

1073
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,340
Because, after all, you gotta feed the monster.

1074
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,180
Content is what it's all about.

1075
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,140
Hours and hours of tape.

1076
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:32,500
More and more content that can be edited and spliced and sent to the ears of the awaiting faithful.

1077
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,020
Right, nobody comes to listen to us here because I know it's all gonna be on our slot so I'm gonna need that.

1078
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,440
We have plenty more where that comes from.

1079
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,940
Well, you don't know, the meteor could fall tomorrow or the exes could come a few days early.

1080
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,060
You know, what to them is our foolish sidereal idea of time.

1081
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,660
Just if you hit it broadly...

1082
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,120
That's all.

1083
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,120
That's the best one could expect.

1084
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,680
Well, an hour of slack is still an hour.

1085
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,420
And still slackful.

1086
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,900
An hour of slack production or as I call it, squeezing out a Glen Rose steamer from the house of Blivets.

1087
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:14,680
Okay, if that's your concept of artistic creation.

1088
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,540
Well, I have to do most of them at home and I do have to squeeze them out.

1089
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,660
Well, sometimes it may flow and other times it may be a harder effort.

1090
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,800
I'm gonna now read the last two rant notes that I had for an hour of slack.

1091
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,680
Please do so.

1092
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
It's only two post-it notes.

1093
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,700
One says, brave new 1984.

1094
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,060
Yeah.

1095
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,200
Which I feel like that phrase entered my head and I thought that's what we have here.

1096
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,940
A hedonistic authoritarian state.

1097
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,760
It's authoritarian but they keep the...

1098
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,640
There's a lot of bread and butter in there.

1099
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,580
Bread and circuses and legalized marijuana and drugs.

1100
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,760
On MFK 106.

1101
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,580
And TV and internet to keep everybody, you know...

1102
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,620
Keep them docile.

1103
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,100
Keep them at home, basically.

1104
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,780
Keep them in line on the slaughterhouse ramp.

1105
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,380
Yeah, brave new 1984.

1106
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,820
Hey, I'll pay extra for room 101. I've heard they've got VR.

1107
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,700
That's for sure.

1108
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,260
Worst case I've ever seen.

1109
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,360
The other little note I had was...

1110
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,260
It says...

1111
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,800
Guns don't kill people.

1112
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,760
Cops kill people.

1113
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,600
But I have to attribute that to Tommy Chong.

1114
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:38,220
Who said it in a really terrible movie they did called Still Smokin'.

1115
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,180
It was like a comeback movie.

1116
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,240
I liked Up and Smoke.

1117
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,260
And it just...

1118
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,680
It didn't cut it.

1119
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,820
Now did we hang out with him in Amsterdam or was that...

1120
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,240
We met John Sinclair.

1121
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,180
Did we meet Tommy Chong?

1122
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,360
We didn't meet Tommy Chong.

1123
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:57,920
Oh, we didn't.

1124
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,800
You're imagining that.

1125
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,380
Alright, I'm trying to get it all straight.

1126
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,280
You're thinking of...

1127
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:02,900
Harrow.

1128
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:03,860
Okay.

1129
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,640
Yeah, the pot-smoking, the pot-inventing guy.

1130
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,440
Okay.

1131
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,140
And John Sinclair.

1132
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,540
You're forgetting that we did that radio thing.

1133
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,440
You know, we got just a little bit of time on his microphone, but...

1134
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,900
You're sure that didn't happen?

1135
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,840
John Sinclair, yeah.

1136
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,100
Okay, John Sinclair.

1137
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,140
Yeah, not Tommy Chong.

1138
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,020
Alright, yeah.

1139
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:35,280
Or either that or we did do something with Tommy Chong, but he had a better prop even than Xavier Hollander's dad or husband had.

1140
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,740
Well, I gave all of mine to Xavier Hollander and her man friend because everybody kept saying,

1141
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,900
Oh, you can't go through customs with it.

1142
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,800
They'll search you.

1143
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,440
They know what it's been.

1144
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,880
You know, you're going to be gone over with it.

1145
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,940
You're going to be gone over with it every inch of your life.

1146
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,840
And so I gave all the marijuana samples away.

1147
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,080
I went through and the guy's reading a magazine.

1148
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,260
He just waves me through.

1149
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:02,740
And he has joints in his pocket that he forgot to take out and he gets waved through.

1150
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,360
So once again, that's slackful luck.

1151
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,360
Actually, we had a whole bag of tulips that we didn't understand we were not supposed to take out of Holland.

1152
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,900
We did anyway.

1153
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,180
It could have been a bag of hat.

1154
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,880
I did see a little dog suddenly...

1155
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,800
Following these two cops at customs.

1156
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,660
The marijuana sniffing mongrel?

1157
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,180
Suddenly sit down next to the bag of a nice young couple.

1158
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,420
A nice young couple and this little dog just sat right down next to their bag.

1159
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,380
And wags his tail.

1160
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,700
And the cops said, sir, you have to come with us.

1161
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:38,580
Horrible.

1162
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,260
Please come with us right now.

1163
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,960
I demand to speak to my ambassador.

1164
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,360
So, yeah, we thought that you could smoke pot anywhere in Holland.

1165
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,680
But no, actually, it's only in those clubs.

1166
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,760
We got in trouble for it.

1167
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,520
They almost kicked us out of the hotel.

1168
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,880
We really didn't know.

1169
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,920
Ah, after Lieber and Stoller.

1170
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,540
Heck, we've got looser laws in Colorado now.

1171
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,220
Well, it's hard to keep up.

1172
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,180
But at any rate, it's mostly legal now.

1173
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,820
And going to the marijuana store is one of my usual chores.

1174
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,700
Well, I live in Texas.

1175
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,340
And it's still the way it used to be.

1176
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:19,980
In Texas.

1177
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,460
And probably cheaper that way.

1178
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,240
Oh, wow.

1179
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:23,740
Maybe.

1180
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,700
That's the way.

1181
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,720
I mean, I always liked the underground economy.

1182
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:37,680
Except that you have to go to the seller's house and pretend you're his friend and sit there for hours and hours and listen to his music and listen to his talk.

1183
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,500
And then finally he drags out the cigar box or whatever it is.

1184
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,620
And then often if somebody else comes, then you are free to go.

1185
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,320
But otherwise, you're really glad you've got your dope on.

1186
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,440
But you can't get out of there.

1187
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:55,140
And you're expected to smoke it there, too, with Mr. McBoring.

1188
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,040
Yeah, I know the feeling.

1189
00:44:59,220 --> 00:44:59,740
I sure do.

1190
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,940
Luckily, that doesn't happen to us much anymore.

1191
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,660
You call this girl, meet her at the supermarket parking lot.

1192
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,460
Exchange.

1193
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,160
Give her a few items.

1194
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:15,920
Exchange.

1195
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,200
Get your fake frop.

1196
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,500
It's just plain marijuana.

1197
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,980
Fake frop.

1198
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:38,620
How come it used to be, I hear this a lot from my roommate, Mr. Mavridis, how come it used to be so much better and you pay all this money for artisanal strains of marijuana and it's like, it's barely there.

1199
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,540
Rather smoke it than not.

1200
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,860
But, well, I used to get this great dope that a guy grew.

1201
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,100
And he left it for free in a paper bag in his garage.

1202
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,260
And you could just come in and scoop it up.

1203
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,820
And if it was psychedelic, you'd be tripping on it.

1204
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,440
Really.

1205
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,300
That's Paul?

1206
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,100
Well, what do you mean?

1207
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,620
Was that Paul's memory of things?

1208
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,940
No, that's my memory.

1209
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:02,100
Oh.

1210
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:08,500
But Paul was saying that the old stuff was so much better than the new stuff.

1211
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:08,820
What?

1212
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,680
That's what he's saying.

1213
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,180
It could vary in quality.

1214
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,440
Quality may vary.

1215
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:21,320
There was no board of judges elevating this strain or that or giving it a funny name.

1216
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,740
Yeah, I love the names.

1217
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
It's all the same.

1218
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:26,940
It all gets you high.

1219
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,340
Purple push, gangster, strawberry.

1220
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,060
The name, you know, the elder spiel that goes with it.

1221
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,360
It's like wine snob.

1222
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,720
And they all know it.

1223
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:42,160
So if you order dope, the dope guy comes to your house and then he says, well, this is a very mellow strain.

1224
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,000
And you'll notice elements of it.

1225
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,500
This is more of a body high.

1226
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,060
Yeah.

1227
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,440
Whereas this one's more mental.

1228
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,880
This is kind of a more buzzy.

1229
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,900
The guy who bicycles over there is an expert.

1230
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,000
A gourmand.

1231
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,640
There's such a bunch of hooey.

1232
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,580
Well, maybe so or maybe no.

1233
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:08,160
On the inevitable thought has occurred to me that the reason it was so good back then is that when you're young, you can consume anything.

1234
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:08,780
Right.

1235
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,140
When you're old, maybe those receptors are there.

1236
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,680
Those receptors are somewhat worn down.

1237
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,860
Think of all the crap that kids eat and they can do it.

1238
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:26,400
But have an adult try it, you know, end up in a world of hurt or maybe just a continent of hurt or city of hurt or something.

1239
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,740
Well, if you ask me, I would quote Dave Gardner talking about something else.

1240
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,880
Even the worst was wonderful.

1241
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,060
Absolutely.

1242
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,400
I would not deny it.

1243
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,620
Not for a moment.

1244
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,460
No.

1245
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,840
We cannot repent of such notable wonders and undertakings.

1246
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,020
Oh, here's an interesting.

1247
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,380
This is a love comic about little monkey boy in spilling his guts.

1248
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:09,800
And it stars Mr. Chanto, who's fairly normal looking with a turtleneck and monkey boy who looks kind of short and sad and monkeyish.

1249
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,440
How do you like it?

1250
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,000
I like my new shirt, Mr. Chanto.

1251
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,720
Maybe now Mary will go out with me.

1252
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,660
Silly monkey boy.

1253
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,100
Appearances don't matter.

1254
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,080
It's what's inside that counts.

1255
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,180
Hmm.

1256
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,540
Later he meets Mary.

1257
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,660
Hi, Mary.

1258
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,640
Hello, little monkey boy.

1259
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,340
I was wondering.

1260
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,320
He pulls out a knife.

1261
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,300
Would you go out with me?

1262
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,340
And he slices his belly open and his guts fall out.

1263
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,420
With entrails like that, I'd go to the moon with you, Larry.

1264
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:41,420


1265
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,260
Oh, little monkey boy.

1266
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,260
And monkey boy dies thinking, I'm so happy.

1267
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,640
And stink lines rise from his guts.

1268
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:56,740
This is all from Swank by Greg Petix and Reverend Chris Silla.

1269
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:03,480
Here's one that is a haunted trucker story.

1270
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,560
Route 666.

1271
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,900
Chicken spooks haunt this rig.

1272
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,680
Phantom beaks peck at my neck.

1273
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:18,960
Cow specters hammer down blame, mooing accusal from the back.

1274
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,840
Vegetarian when I was alive, hauling meat to make ends meet.

1275
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:28,720
Tortured by the guilt until I jackknifed off Route 666.

1276
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,840
And it shows this great big rig going off a bridge over a bridge.

1277
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,560
Sam's Choice Meats.

1278
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,580
It says on the side.

1279
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,440
I'm a trucker ghost.

1280
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,340
My handle long forgotten.

1281
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,820
Chained to this damn stretch of road.

1282
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,960
I never stop for gas.

1283
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,240
My tank's full of hellfire.

1284
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,200
I never stop for food.

1285
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,100
My stomach's in a drainage ditch outside of St. John.

1286
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,980
Eighteen wheels of apparitions weighing on the sleeping brows of a continent.

1287
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,080
Barreling down Moonlit River.

1288
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,840
A midnight blacktop.

1289
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,120
Triple nickels on the dime.

1290
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,700
Boy, that should be a country western song.

1291
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:21,180
And that's it from Swank Comics Collection.

1292
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,520
Originally published in the Arizona Daily Weekly.

1293
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,300
Or Daily Wildcat.

1294
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,980
The Arizona Daily Wildcat.

1295
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,600
I'm sorry.

1296
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:33,500
And you can find this.

1297
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,540
By sending free comics to.

1298
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,780
Got your pencil ready?

1299
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,300
3333.

1300
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:45,660
Southeast Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard.

1301
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,680
Number 5.

1302
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,520
Portland, Oregon.

1303
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,400
Poor things.

1304
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,040
97202.

1305
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,900
Or email is swankboy at yahoo.com.

1306
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,100
All yours dear friends.

1307
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,520
Okay, Dr. Howell, I think there's no audience.

1308
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,400
One other thing.

1309
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,060
Totally irrelevant, but I meant to say it before.

1310
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:19,180
In that vampire show, What We Do in the Shadows, I thought I saw Paul Rubens in there as a vampire.

1311
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:19,840
Did I?

1312
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,300
Was he in there?

1313
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,140
That was a good episode.

1314
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:31,080
Yeah, when they go to these other vampires' house and he's there with these really obnoxious ones, including a real vampire.

1315
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,080


1316
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,080


1317
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,080


1318
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,080


1319
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,080


1320
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,080


1321
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,740
Yeah, the rapping one.

1322
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,360
When he's there.

1323
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,120
Actually, I can see that easily.

1324
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,220
He does have kind of a Bela Lugosi look.

1325
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:42,100
Yeah, the art direction of that show is just wonderful.

1326
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,060
No.

1327
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,540
You've seen the movie, right?

1328
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,220
Which one?

1329
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,960
What We Do in the Shadows.

1330
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,220
No, I've not seen that.

1331
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:51,960
How about the movie?

1332
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:52,700
No.

1333
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,600
Oh, at least watch the movie.

1334
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,020
The movie is groovy.

1335
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,320
It's got a different cast than the...

1336
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,060
The list of things that I must see.

1337
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,000
Now, sit right down and watch.

1338
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:03,280
To Camelot.

1339
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:03,600
Yeah.

1340
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:11,460
Well, every now and then something comes out that's really exceptional and encouraging and has great art direction.

1341
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,360
Oh, I know.

1342
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,700
There's a lot of them.

1343
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:13,900
Yeah.

1344
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,460
Tons of them.

1345
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,600
Can't keep up with them.

1346
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,720
And they get plowed under.

1347
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:23,960
But the same people from New Zealand who made the movie have made the show.

1348
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,360
And the show has a different bunch of vampire roommates.

1349
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,320
But it's the same conceit of there's a camera crew in there.

1350
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,040
And they're prominent.

1351
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,760
And they're famous not to be eaten by the vampires.

1352
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:40,380
They can film their roommate interactions which are full of conflict because some are thousands of years old.

1353
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,760
Some are hundreds of years old.

1354
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,420
Some are ten years old.

1355
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,960
Some were just made vampires.

1356
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:50,800
And the human stooges who do all the work with pathetic hope that they'll be made into vampires.

1357
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,020
They have the different type of vampires.

1358
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,180
They have not vampires.

1359
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:55,880
They have blood.

1360
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,040
But they steal your emotions.

1361
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,420
Oh, that's the best one.

1362
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,040
In the show there's a...

1363
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:08,220
There's a guy who's an energy vampire who's like this bald businessman type who talks at you and he sucks all your energy away.

1364
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,100
And he even sucks the energy from the vampires.

1365
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,820
Nobody likes him.

1366
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:17,060
He tells these terrible jokes and laughs in an insincere way.

1367
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,620
And people are slumping over and falling over.

1368
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,660
Their energy getting sucked up.

1369
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,120
That sounds kind of John Shirley-like.

1370
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,400
It sounds like the kind of thing he'd come up with.

1371
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,880
Well, it's pretty good.

1372
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:37,340
I was visiting my friend in New York and she showed me a bunch of those episodes which I can't watch because I don't have cable and so forth.

1373
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,380
But I watched a bunch of them.

1374
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,080
I don't have cable.

1375
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:41,920
But the movie.

1376
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,520
Read the movie.

1377
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,220
You'd be amused by it.

1378
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,180
It's lots of fun.

1379
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:46,920
It's well developed.

1380
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:54,820
See, they have a hypnotic power so they can have the cops over to their house and the cops don't notice all the dead bodies on the floor.

1381
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,660
And the cops are there to answer a complaint.

1382
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:57,720
It's funny.

1383
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,360
It's supposed to be Orange Officer.

1384
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:01,960
Oh, okay.

1385
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,060
And the werewolves are in it too.

1386
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,780
A subgenius got away with the crime.

1387
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,020
He was caught red-handed.

1388
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,480
Or orange-handed.

1389
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,720
He was spraying orange Dobbs heads in public.

1390
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:17,160
Terrible.

1391
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,960
And the cops said, what's going on here?

1392
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:23,740
And our friend who was an older guy, kind of a Pease-like guy.

1393
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,040
He goes, oh, it's supposed to be Orange Officer.

1394
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,700
He hadn't planned it.

1395
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,440
He didn't plan to say that.

1396
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,840
It just came out of his mouth.

1397
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,700
And the cops were, okay.

1398
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,760
It was like, these aren't the droids you're looking for.

1399
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:34,860
It worked.

1400
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,400
It's supposed to be just distraction.

1401
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,380
Well, it's supposed to be, I guess, you're all right.

1402
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,760
You're not seeing this.

1403
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,960
You're seeing that.

1404
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,400
Magician trick, you know.

1405
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,140
Distraction.

1406
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,100
These aren't the drugs you're looking for.

1407
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,220
I'm looking for drugs.

1408
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,020
But they are the drugs you want.

1409
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:53,980
Will drugs.

1410
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,700
See, it doesn't.

1411
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,600
Will drugs turn you on?

1412
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,380
This orange blossom is a wonderful drug.

1413
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,660
I just had a whole can of it.

1414
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,560
It's 6.4% alcohol.

1415
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,020
But the rest is healthful water.

1416
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,940
So it's good for you, kids.

1417
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,260
I've had . . .

1418
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,600
Back in the day, IPA.

1419
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,840
Believe me, I know my IPAs because I'm Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius.

1420
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,680
And Blossom Special, back in the day, IPA is what a monster.

1421
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:25,680


1422
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,200
My very favorite.

1423
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,560
It's almost as good as back in the day.

1424
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:34,120
Hey, it is back in the day.

1425
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,740
Amen, brother.

1426
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,560
In the future, there not going to be any day.

1427
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,240
So this is back in the day.

1428
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,400
In brave new 1984, there ain't going to be no more back in the day.

1429
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,900
Because it's all been the same the whole time.

1430
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,460
Ah.

1431
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:55,660
The people my sister is in prison with.

1432
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:11,160
Many of them seem to think that this country has always been English people, English speaking, mostly white people with cars in suburbs.

1433
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:18,660
And when they see something like a Robin Hood movie, they go, why didn't he just get a gun and shoot him?

1434
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:25,320
Well, he did in that Kevin Costner one where they bring in gunpowder and start blowing up the sheriff's office.

1435
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,100
The less said, the better.

1436
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,740
That wasn't a great Kevin Costner movie.

1437
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,420
No, it was not.

1438
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,460
I, on the other hand, happen to really like Waterworld.

1439
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,280
Many people hate it, but I thought it was pretty fun.

1440
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:42,680
Did you ever see Richard Lester's Robin and Marian?

1441
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,560
Yeah, I did a long, long time ago.

1442
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,080
Not bad.

1443
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,000
And I remember it being good.

1444
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:48,620
Yeah.

1445
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,840
But that's all I remember.

1446
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:55,300
The thing is, many have argued that that part of the Robin Hood legend is bad.

1447
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,700
It's put in later as anti-Catholic feeling.

1448
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:04,080
A nun bleeds Robin to death because of the traitorous papacy and so forth.

1449
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:08,360
But bleeding was how they tended to you in those days.

1450
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,120
It let some of that bad blood out.

1451
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:14,380
They just let a little too much out from Mr. Hood.

1452
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,120
What is that music?

1453
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,340
Why, it sounds like Rimsky-Korsakov.

1454
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:21,980
Yes.

1455
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,840
The now politically incorrect,

1456
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,360
Arabian Nights fantasy.

1457
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,220
No, that's from Universal Monsters.

1458
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,480
It's colonialist.

1459
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,800
Well, it's, I believe it's...

1460
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,380
Could it be The Mummy?

1461
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,920
The Mummy?

1462
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,720
The Mummy has Swan Lake at the beginning, period.

1463
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,440
No other movie, music in it.

1464
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,920
Like Dracula, it starts with Swan Lake, no other music.

1465
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,300
But Swan Lake, yes.

1466
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,900
So it's not Rimsky-Korsakov.

1467
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:56,820
I don't know why.

1468
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,100
That's from a Universal Monster movie, an early one.

1469
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,180
I think it's The Mummy.

1470
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,840
They do that when they show the pyramids and so on at the beginning of The Mummy.

1471
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,180
No, the titles.

1472
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:09,300
Exactly.

1473
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:14,440
The titles among some miniature pyramids that they rigged up for the titles.

1474
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:18,540
And the Rocko has Swan Lake.

1475
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:23,280
Also, Renfield is heading off over the Borgo Bridge.

1476
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,400
And they play it.

1477
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,120
But after that, not a note of music in the whole movie.

1478
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,280
Now you know it's an hour of slack, because it's going on for another half hour talking

1479
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,740
about old Universal Monsters.

1480
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,240
Oh, we haven't begun to get started, friends.

1481
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,380
I haven't discussed such movies as Earthworm Tractors or Shhh!

1482
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,160
The Octopus.

1483
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,120
You ever seen Shhh!

1484
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:42,900
The Octopus?

1485
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:43,800
No.

1486
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,160
I did see Ticks, though, after last X Day.

1487
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:47,720
You told me about Ticks.

1488
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,900
Oh, I told you about Ticks.

1489
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,260
Yes, you see marijuana growers in the woods are using too much fertilizer, creating a

1490
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:58,540
giant ticks that attack teenagers, naturally, since everything attacks teenagers.

1491
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,560
Hey, there's a band coming.

1492
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,820
Let's get out of here, Dr. Howell.

1493
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:01,700
Got it.

1494
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:07,160
I'm going to take this undrunk can of beer and change it into a drunk can of beer.

1495
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:07,820
There you go.

1496
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,200
Or maybe I'll be the drunk.

1497
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:18,660
So, until another iteration of the soi-disant hour of slack, we've got a million of gags,

1498
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:23,240
stories, and reminisces about old movies that no one is interested in.

1499
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:29,380
But you never know whether we might strike a spark in such a fashion.

1500
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,520
So, somebody else get up here and start a yakkin' and palaverin'.

1501
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:41,420
We need a lot of clabber, and after so many beers, I can't blab such blibber blubber.

1502
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,420
My tongue isn't made out of rubber.

1503
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,880
Yes, I'll take that one and this one.

1504
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,600
Subgenius.com.

1505
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,120
That's subgenius.com.

1506
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,740
Everything you want to know is there.

1507
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,240
But you will have to truly get it.

1508
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:53,660
You will have to truly look.

1509
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,240
Thanks for listening and looking.
