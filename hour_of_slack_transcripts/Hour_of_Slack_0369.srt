1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
Three ways clean, it's called get clean.

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,840
This is the sound of my brain.

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,580
Then I said, this is the sound of my brain on...

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,080
The Soap Genius.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,200
Hour of Swatch.

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,240
Well, I don't rightly know, ma'am.

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,540
Last I heard from him, he was riding herd down by Gummer's Canyon,

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,300
about 20 miles west of the old squinting place, just before you get to Mule Creek.

9
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,880
Said something about finding a man that killed his pappy.

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,240
Now, you all know as well as I do, ma'am, that means he's gunning for Gummy Gilligan.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,360
And that means he's headed for Dodge.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,600
And when he gets there, Gummy Gilligan, Big Boy Simpson, Doc Burke,

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,620
and Keeper McCracken are going to be waiting for him.

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,840
And they ain't going to be throwing no teapot in.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,400
Hold it right there, Casper.

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:13,720
Now, let's see you put that cruise missile down real gentle like.

17
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:22,000
And a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the Lord.

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,280
But the Lord was not in the wind.

19
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,160
And after the wind was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake.

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,800
And after the earthquake was a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire.

21
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,600
And after the fire was a still, small voice.

22
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,640
This is a big Friday, right?

23
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,200
I got up in the morning, my car wouldn't stop, right?

24
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,900
So I call my bus.

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,120
I'm not coming in until later.

26
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,460
But he says, oh, OK, no problem.

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,620
Joanie's coming in late from Bayside.

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,680
She can swing over, pick you up.

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,900
I says, oh, boy, Joanie.

30
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,520
No, Joanie, right?

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,140
Man, she didn't look out for 30 minutes with Joanie, right?

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,080
So he says, wait a minute.

33
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,140
I'll take a train.

34
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,100
He says, oh, no.

35
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,580
No problem.

36
00:01:59,580 --> 00:01:59,580


37
00:01:59,580 --> 00:01:59,580


38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:01:59,580


39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,880
Anyway, I need you to be here by 10.

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,760
She'll be over in 20 minutes.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,320
So I says, OK.

42
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,120
So about 20 minutes later, she pulls in, right?

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,960
Beep in the horn.

44
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,400
She just pulled into the driveway, right?

45
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,900
She's already, like, laying on the horn.

46
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,300
I'm rushing around looking for my shoes.

47
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,700
I tell you, Liz, this girl is, like, mentally retarded.

48
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,620
Ruby Gleeka.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,560
Ella Xona.

50
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,380
Ella Xona Gondamu.

51
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,820
Ella Proia.

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,740
Medina Ghi.

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,240
Si sun san ilia tida.

54
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,520
Ruby Mumikri.

55
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,560
Ruby.

56
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,240
Welcome to Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Flags.

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,860
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,220
Yeah, I mean, some of those other religions have gotten a long way,

59
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,480
but they're just drinking symbolic blood at those altars and eating the symbolic.

60
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,500
You know, if they want to believe a little old lady,

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,500
is eating the literal flesh and blood of some god from 2,000 years ago,

62
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,820
then why can't we drink real blood at our rituals, huh?

63
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,860
And guess whose blood it's going to be this time, huh?

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,540
Ivan Stang.

65
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,060
Papa Joe Miles.

66
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,880
Jane or Hyperclete.

67
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,580
Princess We Are Doe.

68
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,380
And...

69
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,400
Sister Mary Square.

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,160
Don't forget to land us on Susie.

71
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,360
And Susie the floozy.

72
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,460
And land us on, excuse me, Susie.

73
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,860
Susie the floozy.

74
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,400
Tonight at 10 o'clock there's going to be a D-Bible,

75
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,360
and in a moment I'm going to let these folks tell you what a D-Bible is all about.

76
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,780
But, um...

77
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,140
Oh, no.

78
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,720
Wait a minute, you're going to ask us to explain it?

79
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,800
You didn't say we had to explain anything.

80
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,660
The Bible is.

81
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,620
Okay, you're not past the safe harbor.

82
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,120
Next you're probably trying to say we have to explain...

83
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,020
Who Bob is.

84
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,100
You know, we have never had any problem with most of the, quote, teachings of Jesus,

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,800
even the ones that they allowed not to be censored.

86
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,140
In fact, he came to our last revival in Cleveland,

87
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,880
and he and Bob were seen whining and dining with the women in the Devil Biker Babes.

88
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,520
So this whole...

89
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,100
This is literally true.

90
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,020
Jesus and Bob has been basically cooked up in a front for the media.

91
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,480
They're pals.

92
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,780
They've always been pals.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,300
In fact, Jesus does a lot of business with Bob.

94
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,480
Uh, Jesus taught Bob how to sew things.

95
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,920
That is the real fight in Jesus.

96
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,440
The one that smokes Chester for days.

97
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,460
Yeah, I mean, we...

98
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,500
Our problem is with the fan club.

99
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,580
Yeah.

100
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,620
You know, it's just certain members of Jesus' fan club.

101
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm kind of surprised that he puts up with them.

102
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,220
I'm starting to lose...

103
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,660
I'm starting to be a little bit disappointed in Jesus for that.

104
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,720
But, it does hurt to lay down your seat at a place that

105
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,600
You sit in and just laze about.

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,020
All right.

107
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,460
That's all that matters.

108
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:12,460


109
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,440
In fact, God is not going to bite into...

110
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,580
I can feel it because I got this word, man.

111
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:16,580


112
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:16,580


113
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,100
Well, I can feel it right here.

114
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,100


115
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,060
So we're gonna...

116
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,260
I touched the dirt.

117
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,320
and your marriage won't flung

118
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,580
as long as she puts out

119
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,640
when you come home drunk.

120
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,880
She thinks you're garbage

121
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,980
and you think she's scum.

122
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,020
You'll both be content

123
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,140
if you manage to come.

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,320
Promotions received

125
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,620
when you lick the brown star.

126
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,600
Just help reinforce

127
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,880
what you think you are.

128
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,220
It's all worth as much

129
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,160
as a turd to me.

130
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,500
You're a smegma on toast

131
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,660
and that's all I can see.

132
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,360
So call me a cynic

133
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,440
and call me a bore.

134
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,640
That don't change the truth

135
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,840
that you're still a whore.

136
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,900
To the worthless existence

137
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,180
you'd know that you lead.

138
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,360
Fueled by the lies

139
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,500
that you eat, sleep, and breathe.

140
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,320
Fueled by churches and unions

141
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,220
and such and corporate sleazeballs

142
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,100
can't get enough.

143
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,380
Prankstein, football,

144
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,380
pretzels, and beer.

145
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,900
The problems, the commies,

146
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,080
the Jews, and the queers.

147
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,640
strand of the

148
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:38,640


149
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,120
The trials

150
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,340
Jack off with what

151
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,460
theicionar

152
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,360
I'm ammonium

153
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,520
Do me a favor

154
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,520
I blame agency

155
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,140
on your grave in the fog in the detail

156
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,540
on your grave in the fog in the detail

157
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,140
on your grave in the fog in the detail

158
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,120
but one thing that you said, Reverend Stang, on the hour slack a few weeks ago

159
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,980
was that the hour slack is meant for those that are just random tumors

160
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,880
and I want to agree with that very much

161
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,120
because I think it's a great thing

162
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,620
because every episode we play we get a phone call

163
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,420
from somebody who says, what the hell is going on?

164
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,240
I was driving down the road and I heard this stuff on the radio

165
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,640
What are you?

166
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,300
I love what you guys are doing

167
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,360
I'm going to give you all my money tomorrow

168
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,800
when I sober up

169
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,580
Open your bank account to Bob

170
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,360
I see the comments the other night

171
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,280
um

172
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,700
um

173
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,120
um

174
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,120


175
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,140


176
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,400
um

177
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:29,400


178
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,880
let me stay here

179
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,800
for the folks who haven't listened to the hour slack

180
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,600
can you give us an idea

181
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,720
the only thing I tell people is you've got to listen Saturday at midnight

182
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,820
you've got to listen to it

183
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,000
well then just what is it?

184
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,000
what can you tell me?

185
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,660
well it's very simple

186
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,660
it's the radio outreach

187
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,240
it's the main and most official radio outreach

188
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,600
of the church of the subgenius

189
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,000
which is a disorganized religion

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,080
for mutants misfits the graceless the great faceless those without a face those who maybe

191
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,380
once were geniuses but well they made a few mistakes few excesses in their youth now they're

192
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:25,080
so doing anything the guru Bob Bob says we preach the word Bob but but it's done in a style that's

193
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,360
yeah in a style it's I mean you can't say it's a real familiar style for most people

194
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:40,320
it's an incredibly sensual experience for those who are units and it's kind of it's easier to

195
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,680
say what it isn't than what it is but it's like it's best for the technically all that and it's

196
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:54,080
for an entire hour for sex with the mind just like orgasms for those who never had it and yet

197
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,680
beyond

198
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:24,840
it is life itself let's go

199
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,740
all right I have absolutely nothing to rant about but nobody else is ranting

200
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,300
and so my god someone is gonna do it

201
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,560
we need somebody to help drag Bob's corpse backstage I'm not gonna get hit Bob's blood

202
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,080
all over this good white

203
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,920
it's Bob's blood it should be good enough for you somebody go over there and give that man a hand

204
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,540
and most importantly I

205
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,700
think we all need to remember a few important principles that Bob has taught us before his

206
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,000
untimely death here tonight one of the most important lessons is something that they tried

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,360
to teach us all about when we were in high school and when we were in early days of college and

208
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,940
that's about time management now they trying to manage your time that's your time that they want

209
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,800
to manage for you time management for them is they tell you when to study they tell you when to go to

210
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,300
They tell you when to drink, they tell you when to have sex, they tell you when to have everything.

211
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,860
They make you think that it's your plan, but it's not.

212
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,580
Now, I had my own personal idea of time management this very night.

213
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,420
All this year, I have been busy with this and busy with that.

214
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,060
I've had commitments on my time.

215
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,100
I've had responsibilities that I've had to live up to.

216
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,520
Now, let me tell you something, friends.

217
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,320
One by one, I realized that someone else was taking control of my time.

218
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:01,180
I realized that all these commitments I'd made, they were good commitments, they were valid, they had to be lived up to.

219
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,540
But I didn't want to make them.

220
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,600
Someone made me want to make them.

221
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,420
Someone made me want to make them.

222
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,400
I was not managing my time properly.

223
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,500
Tonight, I destroyed the last of my responsibilities.

224
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,880
I have no more commitments.

225
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,680
I have nothing to do but what I want to do.

226
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,160
And this, this is the subgenius idea of time management.

227
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,800
This is my watch.

228
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,240
This has been controlling every aspect of my time for the past year.

229
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,800
And it is no more.

230
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,380
I control my time.

231
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,320
This is time management, the subgenius way.

232
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:48,960
Thank you.

233
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:49,520


234
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,140
I had a hammer.

235
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,880
I had a hammer in the morning.

236
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,540
I had a hammer in the evening.

237
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,260
I had a hammer any time I damn well felt like it.

238
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,460
Is there a hammer in the house?

239
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,980
I have a golf club.

240
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,260
I know I have a sledgehammer.

241
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,580
And now, here is the sacred gavel of Dr. Le Guin, which says,

242
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,320
a cannon, process 999.

243
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,780
If you love it that way.

244
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,660
The Hammer of Vengeance,

245
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,560
specifically,

246
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,240
We brought four time control rituals, and it's all yours.

247
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,340
Give it back when you're finished.

248
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,780
This is Bob's blood.

249
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,240
Bob's blood.

250
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,300
Bob's blood.

251
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,120
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

252
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,900
What can I call this son of a bitch on?

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,780
Use that tongue.

254
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,240
All right.

255
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,760
As we pass around the sacrament of Bob,

256
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,260
Bob's blood that he spilled for us tonight

257
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,520
to show what it means to be a subgenius,

258
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,940
it means to be free.

259
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,300
It means to have anything you want.

260
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,040
Anything.

261
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,500
If you believe in Bob,

262
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,180
Bob will return to you that which you most want,

263
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,200
and that is you.

264
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,300
Yes.

265
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,380
And now, time management, the subgenius way.

266
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,500
It's real easy.

267
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,200
You just stand up there, and somebody goes,

268
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,740
okay, one, two, three, rant.

269
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,620
And then, of course, you do this real heartfelt thing

270
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,180
about how bad the conspiracy is and so forth.

271
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,920
Thank you.

272
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,680
And you know what?

273
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,040
It is heartfelt, as a matter of fact.

274
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,340
That's not funny.

275
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
It becomes more tender and more heartfelt

276
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,740
with more money they give you.

277
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,060
The opposite.

278
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,100
It becomes more hate.

279
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,720
The more hate.

280
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,020
That's what we're reaching for is the hate.

281
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,860
We're looking for people who love to hate.

282
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,560
We're looking for people who like to gag.

283
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,240
Sacred hate, love.

284
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,120
Yes, we're talking about a positive hate.

285
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,100
You can't just hate the conspiracy and normalcy.

286
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,280
No, you've got to love to hate.

287
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,480
You've got to hate the wind and the trees.

288
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,360
Oh, yeah.

289
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,160
And the little blue butterflies that flutter out.

290
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,860
You've got to hate a bluebird chirping at dawn.

291
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,740
You've got to hate a cure for cancer.

292
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,040
Yeah.

293
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,440
You've got to close your eyes,

294
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,940
and clench your fists,

295
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,640
and furrow your brow,

296
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,740
sit down,

297
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,440
and with all your might,

298
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,420
you've got to hate a small child

299
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,560
being cured of muscular dystrophy

300
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,660
and under-walking.

301
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,320
You have to hate like Bob hates, friends.

302
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,080
The divine hate.

303
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,860
The ultimate hate.

304
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,240
You can't compare yourself to any human hate.

305
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,220
We're talking about a divine hate.

306
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,460
I mean, a hate that...

307
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,560
that can never die because it was never born.

308
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,960
An eternal hate.

309
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,300
You've got to...

310
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,460
you've got to become the hate.

311
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,020
It's kind of like a type of yoga.

312
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,300
You've got to...

313
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,500
you've got to become one with the hate

314
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,300
of pinkness and normalcy.

315
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,460
The hate of everything.

316
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,580
Even the hate itself?

317
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:14,420
That is when you come to truly, truly become...

318
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:14,880
become the hate.

319
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,880
Then, you can truly hate the hate itself,

320
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,960
and then you have achieved what we call hate squared.

321
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,320
And you hate the fact that you hate.

322
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,960
And that... and you can read about hate squared

323
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,340
in Dobbs' Guide to Sex Hurt,

324
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,020
which is available in most adult bookstores.

325
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,340
Hate squared and love squared, of course, you know, but...

326
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,860
It's kind of an eternal thing.

327
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,400
You have to hate the fact that you're not...

328
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,480
that you hate the fact that you hate the fact

329
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,140
that you hate the fact that you hate.

330
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,040
It's a delicious hate.

331
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,180
All religions are based on hatred of everybody not in that religion.

332
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,380
And we're the only ones that are straight up, just up front about it.

333
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,940
You know, we've pared it down to the basics.

334
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,620
You really will pay to know what you really think,

335
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,640
which is that you hate the others.

336
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,140
Because they just, you know, they...

337
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,520
they won't give you any slack.

338
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,940
And it's the truth, man.

339
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,360
It sounds like stupid subgenius jargon, but it is the truth.

340
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,480
The others will not give you any slack.

341
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,240
Unless you take it.

342
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,220
And that's why we have to get so loud about it.

343
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm sorry.

344
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,720
I paid to find out what I...

345
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,200
I paid to find out what I really thought.

346
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,700
I didn't know what I really thought until I joined the Church of the Subgenius.

347
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,800
I was into these...

348
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,220
You never paid.

349
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,880
Well, I never paid, but I...

350
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,700
I found out...

351
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,200
I found out what I thought.

352
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,220
I found out what I thought.

353
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,440
Yeah, Jayner paid in having to sit next to so many weird,

354
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,000
even weirder people than him on bus trips to subgenius revivals.

355
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,720
He's like a magnet for real, real weirdos.

356
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,360
Deep weirdos.

357
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,180
And deep poebuckers.

358
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,260
Deep pinks with the most intense flavors of them.

359
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,080
When I first got into Scientology,

360
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,340
I wanted to be successful in Scientology

361
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,240
as far as it being a profession.

362
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,760
So when I started FSMing and debugging,

363
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,400
that is when I looked at the product,

364
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,540
a revitalized being,

365
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,640
a salvaged person who is on lines

366
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,760
and everybody wins from that.

367
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,900
It put me on purpose and got my ethics in

368
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,600
and dynamics aligned.

369
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,780
I can salvage as many people as come across my lines.

370
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,700
As FSMs, we can reach out into the field physically

371
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,320
and we can be these people's terminals.

372
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,220
Setting yourself up as a terminal for these people

373
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,180
really helps them up the bridge.

374
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,820
At one time, I was an electrician.

375
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,080
But when I finished the SHSBC and the internship,

376
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,880
I felt that it was an overt to go back to my job.

377
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
At ASHO, the Environment Department,

378
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:07,760


379
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,420
it is very OT and very upstat

380
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,440
and it's impossible not to win

381
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,320
across all of your dynamics

382
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,300
once you've started a training cycle there.

383
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,440
For anyone who's decided to, quote,

384
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,700
flourish and prosper, unquote,

385
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,820
the BC is certainly going to help you

386
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,680
arrive at the postulate.

387
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,320
Reminds me of, what's his name, Tommy.

388
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,540
You should drink with him. What's his name?

389
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,260
You should live at the fancy hotel, Uruguay.

390
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,260
Whatever happened to him? What's his name?

391
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,640
Tommy?

392
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,300
He's supposed to go to L.A., some job or something.

393
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,380
Did he ever go? What happened to him?

394
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,940
Oh, his wife died. He cracked up.

395
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,560
Everybody peoples must to this hotel

396
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,080
pay on 10.30 the rent, $40,

397
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,440
or must leave from the hotel.

398
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,180
Everybody peoples.

399
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,680
Is rent for one week, $40.

400
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,640
The money here paid for $40 one week, the room.

401
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,920
No radio talking, the disco radio talking

402
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,360
in the nighttime sleeping time.

403
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,860
Everybody peoples.

404
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,780
No visitor.

405
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,980
Is no the visitor to come

406
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,180
all the morning, day, night, and sleeping time.

407
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,960
Everybody peoples.

408
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,960
Barakbill hal witla'ay.

409
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,220
Hay kumitri shu'asay.

410
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,320
Wulim manas meni albay.

411
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,460
Ma da dee ha da.

412
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,180
You look up and I'll be gone.

413
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,200
Bit by bit by bit.

414
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,540
Acting for you, for you, acting for you.

415
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,900
But you did not heed my urgency.

416
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,760
Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today?

417
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,820
They got a crime to be out in the cold.

418
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,840
Watchin' other sad doves.

419
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,360
Oh, I'll say shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

420
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,300
Now, I'll say shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

421
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,300


422
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,300


423
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,480
Oh, future for you.

424
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,680
I'm painting, I'm painting again.

425
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,640
I'm cleaning, I'm cleaning again.

426
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,420
Oh, you know sometimes it gets to be too much.

427
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,460
I mean sometimes really.

428
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,800
I can't cope with it.

429
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,980
It's so autonal.

430
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,940
It's just a din.

431
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,880
It's awkward to listen to I think sometimes.

432
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,660
Don't you?

433
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,000
I don't like groups either.

434
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,960
Actually, groups, oh gosh, do you like, oh not much.

435
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,240
Groups, you know, like.

436
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,060
Hoo.

437
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,400
Who.

438
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,680
Who.

439
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,320
What.

440
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,760
Goodness knows.

441
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,380
Of course I'm not much of a jazz buff.

442
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm afraid of a bit of a square.

443
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,060
I always have been.

444
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,620
So I don't know too much about it.

445
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,640
Just of course for dancing when you're young and that sort of cold porter department.

446
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,200
But when they go banging around and whooping and yelling and you know.

447
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,180
Do a whole number.

448
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,620
It's only got one chord in it.

449
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,040
And you can give these guys a shot.

450
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,420
These people, you know, they've got two keys and three chords, and that's all you get in an entire evening.

451
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,380
And then, of course, they yell, all this yelling, because you never understand a word they're saying.

452
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,180
That's another thing, I mean, if you could understand the lyrics, you might at least get a little something out of it.

453
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,040
And then, of course, oh, the din!

454
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,240
No, I don't like that at all. I think I faded out on the Beatles.

455
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,480
You know, our vocalist that normally sings this song has changed his political opinions

456
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,780
and really has got at whether or not he can sing it with fervor anymore.

457
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:48,100
He thinks he's kind of lost his gumption, the thing that kind of gave him the oomph to sing it with,

458
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,880
what really felt it with the people.

459
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,500
Yeah, we've got a, how'd you know him?

460
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,320
Oh, okay.

461
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,640
No, no.

462
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,880
Okay, well, we won't do the ecology-minded song after all, even though it's one of our better tunes.

463
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,460
Okay, we'll do it.

464
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,780
I'll show you, I'll viupe it.

465
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,820
Good job.

466
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,980
You got him?

467
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,220
Go now, come on.

468
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,460
Come on now, get on.

469
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,580
Come on now, get on.

470
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,340
Come on now, get on.

471
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:19,900
Oh, yeah.

472
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:13,040
Oh, yeah.

473
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:37,440
Oh, yeah.

474
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,300
Oh, yeah.

475
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,660
Oh, yeah.

476
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:56,660
Oh, yeah.

477
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,780
Oh, yeah.

478
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,060
Oh, yeah.

479
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,060


480
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,140
Oh, yeah.

481
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,520
¶¶

482
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,240
¶¶

483
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,240
¶¶

484
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,800
Thank you.

485
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,740
Praise Bob!

486
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,600
Where's Reverend Stanch?

487
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,220
Can I get a praise, Bob?

488
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,520
Praise Bob!

489
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,140
I want to get a praise, Bob!

490
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,360
Praise Bob!

491
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,800
Give me a praise, Bob!

492
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,960
Praise Bob!

493
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,540
Are you all lathered up now?

494
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,460
We come to bring a sword between every brother, sister, mother, and child.

495
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,460
Religious cleansing, that's not a new idea.

496
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,960
Praise the paradoxical power.

497
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,560
There's a lot of hate out there.

498
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,880
Go out and spread it.

499
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,800
We're the...

500
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,860
Hate, love, love to hate, hate to love.

501
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,920
Our symbol is the happy symbol turned upside down.

502
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,600
But you can build a hate.

503
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,460
If you're not successful enough in the world,

504
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,520
there's one thing you can do.

505
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,400
It's kind of like exercising.

506
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,360
You can build a hate by, say,

507
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,860
watching a Bon Jovi video over and over for two hours.

508
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,140
You get a hell of a hate on.

509
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,200
You can get a...

510
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,580
You'll have a throbbing hate on, man.

511
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,100
You'll have a hate on so hard,

512
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,700
you'd be ready to have a night truck with the government.

513
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,620
You'd be ready to have a night truck with the government.

514
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,120
Whoo!

515
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,300
Yes, ma'am!

516
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,600
Man.

517
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,560
Say it with me.

518
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,740
Hate love.

519
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,200
Hate love.

520
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,440


521
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,440


522
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,440


523
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,440


524
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,440


525
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,440


526
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,440


527
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,440


528
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,440


529
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:47,920
Love.

530
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,900
That kind of hate, don't we?

531
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,640
Oh, yes, we do.

532
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,800
We look and thump it.

533
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,920
I love to hate.

534
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,860
It's a positive, uplifting thought.

535
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,580
Yeah, it is.

536
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,380
It's kind of...

537
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,320
It's rejuvenating.

538
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,120
It's kind of neat.

539
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,160
And you just want to hate more.

540
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,920
It's a neat hate.

541
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,760
And the bigger you hate and the bigger things you hate

542
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,960
and the better and the harder and the firmer they stand,

543
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,900
the more you just want to hate them.

544
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,080
Oh!

545
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,260
Oh!

546
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,440
Wait a minute.

547
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,520
That wasn't the way I hurt.

548
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,840
She's mucking up my thighs.

549
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,620
She just...

550
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,420
Do you accept that?

551
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,360
Yeah, yeah.

552
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,860
That's not what we call sex hurt.

553
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,660
Some people get a little bit mixed up.

554
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,740
It can be, certainly.

555
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,680
We're not putting it down, but that's a narrow definition.

556
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,480
Sex hurt was what we always considered was until it feels so good, it hurts.

557
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,300
Kiss me and turn me and tie me up and swear me.

558
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:46,500
Whoo!

559
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Whoo!

560
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:47,800
Whoo!

561
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,580
All right.

562
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,300
Let's see.

563
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,220
Where was I talking?

564
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:56,440
We were talking about Connie and the power of the goddess in the subgenius church, but

565
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,820
I've had a little bit of beer thanks to the swing'em love corpses.

566
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,060
Here we go.

567
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,080
Swing'em love corpses.

568
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,260
Whoo!

569
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,260
They get me.

570
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,900
Oh, so proud.

571
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,240
It hurts.

572
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,540
It feels so good.

573
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,420
It hurts.

574
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,780
I hate to love and love to hate.

575
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,120
Whoo!

576
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,480
Whoo!

577
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,480


578
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,480


579
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,480


580
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,480


581
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,520
This is sacred hate.

582
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,620
A hate that feels so good.

583
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,720
I just keep gushing and gushing and gushing.

584
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,980
Of course, it could be the beer, you know, Connie.

585
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,100
Praise the beer.

586
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,360
Praise the beer.

587
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,060
Praise the beer.

588
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,620
Race!

589
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:32,620


590
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,940
Connie herself is quite a drinker.

591
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,820
She likes, she loves her liquor.

592
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,340
You disbelievers better have your hands close to your wallets.

593
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,480
Your hands should be closer than yours.

594
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,480


595
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,480


596
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,480


597
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,480


598
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,480


599
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,480


600
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,480


601
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,480


602
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,480


603
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,480


604
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,060
if you were, yeah.

605
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,240
Well, that's what I mean, close to her.

606
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,960
I didn't want to be too obvious about it.

607
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,200
Sister Mary Squared, au contraire!

608
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

609
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,240
Help, honey, help!

610
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,280
Well, I'm damn glad to be here in Atlanta, Georgia.

611
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,540
This is as close as I've ever gotten to the Bible Belt.

612
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,560
I'm in the Bible Belt, am I not?

613
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,680
You are the Bible Belt!

614
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm in the buckle of the Bible Belt.

615
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,000
And it is my intention to unbuckle the Bible Belt tonight, folks.

616
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,140
This is good down-home preaching.

617
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,380
Feed me, pet me, milk me, eat me.

618
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,340
Ye sacred cow women, arise!

619
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:57,800
It is time to stop prohibition and start to bitchin'.

620
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,560
Ladies, it was the women that got us out of prohibition.

621
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,120
It was the women that said,

622
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,180
enough of this mindless conspiracy oppression bull.

623
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,840
We've lost enough men over it,

624
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,360
and yet, yet, yet we did not succeed.

625
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,980
We only did half the job.

626
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,620
Still, we are prohibited.

627
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,820
There are certain states where sodomy is illegal.

628
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:37,660
There are states where oral sex is not allowed.

629
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,100
Now, I don't know about you,

630
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,820
but I don't feel like traveling when I want to be...

631
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,720
experimental.

632
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,400
Do you know what I mean?

633
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,180
How did I enforce that?

634
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,100
Are you ready to have fun tonight?

635
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,540
Yes?

636
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,760
You ready to have fun?

637
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,720
Friends, I'm going to take you on an initiation

638
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,000
into the sisterhood of the Yeti.

639
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,540
We're from one of the schisms in the church,

640
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,740
the Sisters of the Yeti,

641
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,480
where Uber Priest is over event to the untamed.

642
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,800
We are trained in tantric deviations,

643
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,640
synchrodynamic swimming ballet,

644
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,020
and time control.

645
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,760
Schizophrenia.

646
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,120
Yetinthropy.

647
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,360
Yetinthropy.

648
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,560
Scytofuturistics.

649
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,420
Orgasmic radiation emitting.

650
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,780
We were trained by some genius that didn't have to read the book of Bob,

651
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,460
and I'm sure all the women in the church

652
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:45,460


653
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,120
here can agree,

654
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:51,000
because we've always known that we've had slag sitting on our hip

655
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,620
right next to our whip for the past thousand years.

656
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,520
And it's not going anywhere.

657
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,940
We're still here.

658
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,360
You're still sitting on it.

659
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:01,660
Yeah.

660
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,620
Face painting.

661
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,980
This isn't makeup.

662
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,280
We don't make ourselves up.

663
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,340
This is war paint.

664
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,200
This is the look of the warrior ending Uber Woman.

665
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,600
Basically, we preach the word of God.

666
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,000
For the last number in our act,

667
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,560
we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row.

668
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,700
One, two, three, four, five.

669
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,900
Splits, spread eagles, flip flops, backflips,

670
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,280
one right after the other.

671
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,400
Well, this one night we were in Cicero, the three of us,

672
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,360
and we were in this hotel room boozing and having a few laughs,

673
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,860
and we run out of ice.

674
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,480
So I went out to get some.

675
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,300
I come back, open the door.

676
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,900
There's Veronica and Charlie doing number 17.

677
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,140
The spread eagle.

678
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,660
And one night she came.

679
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,780
Years ago, thousands of years ago,

680
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,600
before you and I were ever born,

681
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,140
before we even had a memory of a lifetime before this,

682
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,580
there were these priestesses, these sisters of the Yeti,

683
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,780
these tantric, deviant priestesses in every city,

684
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,060
in every size, shape, and color.

685
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:13,500
We were well-rounded women because in the early curves of Mae West,

686
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,060
the curve is, my dear.

687
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,360
And if you can't get straight, you can always go around.

688
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,120
And that's what the Church of the Subgenius has taught me.

689
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,000
It taught me how to become my own person

690
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,120
and be defined by my own actions.

691
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,940
And in the initiations into the sister of the Yeti hood,

692
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,300
as I was saying, there goes the liquor.

693
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,500
Praise the liquor.

694
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,680
Praise the beer.

695
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,600
Praise the beer.

696
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,300
Praise the beer.

697
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,140
And the thing is, the ground is self-centering.

698
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,360
There's no place like my ego.

699
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,920
And it's kind of like Christ is centering.

700
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,060
It's kind of like the nuagier-than-thou section of our church.

701
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:03,340
My biggest fantasy, and it's a whopper of a fantasy, boy, I tell you,

702
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,540
is to have the born-again Christians come to my house

703
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,700
and be all love and light.

704
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,680
And you know how they want you to get down on your knees and pray with them.

705
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,760
The center.

706
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,000
And I want, well, that too.

707
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,560
But, you know, they don't.

708
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,540
That's the problem.

709
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,160
They don't want to get into my house.

710
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,920
They just want me to, you know, worship this hung-up man

711
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,600
who's skinnier, that doesn't look like he could get up and save his life,

712
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,800
and he's telling me that he loves me?

713
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,260
My fantasy is to wait until these people turn around and go,

714
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,260
oh, you know, Sister Mary, Jesus loves you.

715
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,320
But will he respect you in the morning?

716
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,180
And I turn around and I would say,

717
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,680
he loves me?

718
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,580
Well, does he love me enough to...

719
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,180
.

720
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,080
It should also be noted, another good opener is, like,

721
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,680
how to explain to a priest.

722
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,480
I usually start out with kind of, you know, oh, the graphic stuff.

723
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,920
I say, well, we take this guy and we, like, we nail him up on these boards

724
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,040
until he's bleeding.

725
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,200
And then, like, we break his legs and we stuff spears in him.

726
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,240
And we put this crown of thorns on him.

727
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,340
No, no, no, just kidding.

728
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,240
No, it's only just a severed head.

729
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,820
No, no, no, it was kidding.

730
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,000
But that gets him, you know, that loosens him up a little bit.

731
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,100
Makes him a little more open-minded, hopefully.

732
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,180
No offense, you'll be mad.

733
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,880
We're not trying to insult you.

734
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,900
We know that you're fried in your own fat for not believing.

735
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,620
And within five and a half years.

736
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,660
So, you know, we don't hold anything against you.

737
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,800
We pity you, if anything.

738
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,440
No, we do.

739
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,780
And we look forward to watching you fry.

740
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,820
We look forward to watching you writhe in your own agony

741
00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:01,840
as your head begins to blister and boil and ferment in its own juices.

742
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,800
And pretty soon you'll feel a sort of...

743
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,820
In other people's juices.

744
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,040
Other people's juices.

745
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,000
And you'll begin to suck up inside.

746
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,700
And you'll be...

747
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,600
Loading with joy.

748
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,020
When they say you can make a difference.

749
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,060
And this could happen to you if you listen to the hour of sloth.

750
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,420
Well, I don't hate...

751
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,220
Saturday nights at midnight.

752
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,880
Every Saturday night's at midnight.

753
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,100
We hope someday that they can find Bob, too.

754
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:26,900
Yeah.

755
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,040
We don't just love them with our own hearts.

756
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,800
We love them with their own hearts that we will pull out of their chests.

757
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,040
And give back to them for a certain amount of money.

758
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,000
To be perfectly honest with you, I was sort of hooked.

759
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I mean, where else could a guy like me get a hold of money like that?

760
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,880
Your love gives me such a thrill.

761
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,320
But your love won't pay my bills.

762
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,540
I want money.

763
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,240
That's what I want.

764
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,080
Ooh.

765
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,780
She wants money.

766
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,900
She wants money.

767
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,500
She wants money.

768
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:14,660
Like other religions, we come out and say what our primary motives are, which are, in fact, money.

769
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,000
And the destruction of our enemies.

770
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,840
Although we don't have to do that.

771
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,240
We depend on these aliens from another world.

772
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,080
There's no pussy-puttin' around.

773
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:31,680
We'll be taken away to pleasure dimensions while they pry into hell beyond all comprehension or imagination.

774
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,220
If you're in a logical frame of mind, what would you rather be?

775
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,520
Someone that's strummin' a harp of the clouds for all eternity?

776
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:46,720
Or someone that gets eternal slack, sex, drugs, rock and roll, anything else they want?

777
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,620
I mean, it's your choice.

778
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,400
Take out pizza.

779
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,060
If you really think clouds and harps is cool, then just go every Sunday.

780
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,560
That's right.

781
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:57,820
But if you're into the other, more enjoyable life's pleasures, then tune in Saturday night.

782
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,080
You'll have so much slack you won't even be able to say it.

783
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,940
You'll have so much slack you'll even know you have slack.

784
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,620
That's how you'll be like Bob Dog.

785
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,560
You'll be like Bob Dog.

786
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:18,580
You are floating in slack now, but you're just too blind and deaf to see it.

787
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,960
You just can't realize it.

788
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,620
You've got a whole mouth full of pills.

789
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,040
You just don't know how to swallow them.

790
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,940
There's no place like my ego.

791
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,900
There's no place like my ego.

792
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,800
There's no place like my ego.

793
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:49,420
I want you to get so caught up in your heads, caught up in your heads like you believe that you are a true vessel for the alien forces of Bob and Connie to come channeling down into you like an unidentified object.

794
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,120
That fifth chakra over there.

795
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,260
Shake my chakra now.

796
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,180
Shake your chakra.

797
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,260
Coming down, landing on top of your head.

798
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,920
And I want you to start chanting me.

799
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,060
I want you to start chanting me.

800
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:15,540
Now beyond morphosizing yetis and stuff, isn't it true that you have videotaped practically every occurrence in your life?

801
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,100
Yes, that is true.

802
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,460
Everything you have ever done.

803
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,860
Since about 1980.

804
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,640
79, about 79.

805
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,920
Making spaghetti.

806
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,900
Passing out on the floor.

807
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,020
Going to the bathroom.

808
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,840
You name it.

809
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,320
Everything.

810
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,340
Everything.

811
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,880
Everything.

812
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,380
Every subgenius has ever done.

813
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,380
Scrub-a-dub-dub.

814
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:44,760
Even the boring, most mundane activities are scrutinized under the watchful eye of Dr. Z, which doesn't exist right now.

815
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,120
No, I'm sorry.

816
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:46,900
I digress.

817
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,560
You're thinking of the Jehovah's Witnesses.

818
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,080
That's right.

819
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,380
That's where it came from.

820
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:51,940
Yeah.

821
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,200
The inventor.

822
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,180
The killer of small heads again.

823
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,760
The one who, I'm sorry.

824
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,320
Yeah.

825
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,040
Okay.

826
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,720
I lost my train of thought.

827
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,240
I'm sure you did too.

828
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,160
I didn't have one to start with, though.

829
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,500
No, but it's always running on time, ain't it?

830
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,300
I was asking you about everything you tape.

831
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,040
Like this is being taped also.

832
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:13,760
It is.

833
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,000
Why do you do this?

834
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,860
To get for the tapes.

835
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,260
We do everything for the tapes.

836
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,460
Everything looks so much better on the tapes.

837
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,220
You do the tapes for the tapes.

838
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:24,960
The special effects are so much cheaper.

839
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:24,960


840
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,180
Yeah.

841
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,900
We do everything for the tapes.

842
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,280
Even the life we're living is for the tapes.

843
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,360
And the tapes that we tape of the lives is for the tapes.

844
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,020
That's why the tapes are so good.

845
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,960
But do you show them?

846
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,440
I mean, do you show them in their entirety?

847
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,040
Do you edit?

848
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,020
Oh, they're edited.

849
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,120
Everything's edited.

850
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,100
The memory.

851
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,920
See, the whole thing is memory editing.

852
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,800
We're doing memory editing right now.

853
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,260
That's why you keep getting mixed up.

854
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,680
I can't remember what you're talking about.

855
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,400
That's why I don't know what I'm talking about.

856
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,060
That's why I don't know what I'm talking about.

857
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,500
I can't remember what I just said.

858
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,080
That's why I can't know what I'm talking about.

859
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,220
We could backtrack.

860
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,380
We could backtrack.

861
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,720
It's just like running in reverse a little bit.

862
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,160
Just punch it down there and see what we did.

863
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:05,840
Okay?

864
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,060
And that's why it always runs on time, right?

865
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,740
Oh, now you lost me again.

866
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,420
I'm sorry.

867
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,340
Well, you're talking about the train.

868
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,980
The train of thought and how we just backtrack up.

869
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,480
And we find out that you only go around once at a time.

870
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,340
At a time.

871
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,220
At a time.

872
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:20,460
Yeah.

873
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,800
But you do maybe go around 6,000.

874
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,500
I mean, the tenet of reincarnation does exist within the church of subgenies to a certain degree, does it not?

875
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:29,860
Right.

876
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,600
Right.

877
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:47,060
But because you only go around once at a time, you have to pretend that you're going to be the only one.

878
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,940
So you should live life both as if it could end any second.

879
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,000
Like it was just about to end.

880
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:53,600
Go around.

881
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,500
Go around as if you had forever.

882
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,560
In other words, don't waste a minute.

883
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,560
And if it feels good, do it, baby.

884
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,280
Here comes the judge and all that cool stuff.

885
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,560
Go around the little red choo-choo train.

886
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,460
What was that piece of stuff?

887
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,320
Yeah.

888
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,840
Do your own thing.

889
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,440
I lost.

890
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,060
That's what we say.

891
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,500
Do your own thing, baby.

892
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,660
This is my happening, and it's freaking me out.

893
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,240
Oh, my.

894
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,140
No.

895
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,700
Now, take a look at this here.

896
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:17,800
See where it's cool.

897
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,580
It's groovy.

898
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,860
Every trip out on.

899
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:21,920
We're up here.

900
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:21,920


901
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,340
I'm gloobing and oodling.

902
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,900
You know, things were kind of different back in the old days of the church.

903
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,220
I remember back in my day, back in the old days, we used to have to light the sun every morning.

904
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,140
And have to stoke it with kerosene.

905
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:44,200
I remember back in my day, the human body was composed of wood.

906
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,440
You had to just nail your arms onto your body.

907
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,080
Those were the good old days.

908
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,140
You had to construct your entire body out of wood and hammer and nails.

909
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,520
I guess you could say things were a little bit different back in my day.

910
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,800
Kids today, you have no appreciation for how easy it is.

911
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,900
I mean, you come and you give us your last $15, and you think you've done something significant.

912
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:16,980
But, you know, for us, the milk money, you know, was money that we had to pay the teacher so that they wouldn't have sex with us.

913
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:21,900
And back in our days, back in our days, walking around the school, we had to pay the teacher.

914
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:21,900


915
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,640
Walking in the school was like, well, it's like walking across the surface of the sun and freezing.

916
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,200
Barefoot.

917
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:36,840
When I had to go to school, I had to walk across the surface of the sun barefoot in a snowstorm while swallowing fish hooks.

918
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:44,000
Oh, you had, oh, at least they gave you fish hooks.

919
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,660
They only gave us worms.

920
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,300
You guys, you get these three-pronged fish hooks.

921
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,380
We had to go with a single fish hook variety.

922
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,380
I mean, that's how spoiled you can be.

923
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,500
But, you know, we're not trying to make you feel guilty or anything about it, you know.

924
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,840
It's just to underline how fortunate you are today.

925
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:09,820
And then today, you complain because you had, like, maybe some newspaper that you had to stuff in your shoe because of that hole in the bottom of your sole.

926
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,720
Well, in our days, we had to stick newspapers in the bottom of our feet because of the holes in our feet.

927
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,880
You guys have got it easy.

928
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:25,420
I remember back in my day when you'd go to a convenience store, you'd have to wait a century for a Coke.

929
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,920
And then your Coke can wouldn't have a bottom.

930
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,560
And all the Coke would just pour out of the bottom before you could get a sip.

931
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,580
And even if you could sip some, it was just water with black food coloring in it.

932
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:46,680
And then you complained because your special little opener up there just, you know, you press it in.

933
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,720
Back in our days, you'd drink your Coke.

934
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:56,440
And you'd get not just one, but about 30 of these Coke tabs would come guzzling down your throat right about the time you really slug it back.

935
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,720
You don't even know what those things are, but we used to get them in our Cokes all the time.

936
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,900
And we only put one of them in there ourselves when we opened it up.

937
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,360
So go figure.

938
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:16,880
I can remember back in my day, the iron clothes, I had to heat my hand up over a wood stove and run it over the clothes so familiar.

939
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,360
Life is so tame.

940
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,940
Well, so what about the future of the church?

941
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,740
I mean, maybe it's...

942
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,180
Discuss the past back in our days.

943
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,980
Yeah, back in the good old days.

944
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,900
And we know about the sickening present.

945
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,840
And we liked it that way.

946
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,200
Oh, we miss those days.

947
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
That's nostalgia for us.

948
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,800
When we drink a Coke and, you know, maybe there's some sharp ice in there.

949
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,860
Maybe we buy it at a store where someone's got it.

950
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,740
And we've laced it with cyanide.

951
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,840
We think, you know, this brings back memories.

952
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,140
But nowadays, it's all gone.

953
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,660
So what about the future?

954
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,960
Where should it go?

955
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:02,780
More guns.

956
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,740
More guns.

957
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,740
But there's going to be plenty of guns July 5th.

958
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,800
You're not even going to have to put in for your license that day.

959
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,580
There'll be nothing but guns on that day.

960
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,020
Well, the way I see it, and I'm just talking for myself,

961
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,680
but there's several alternatives that could happen.

962
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:28,620
One is nothing could happen on July 5th, except, of course, mass suicides of the devout.

963
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,040
And I hope I see each and every one of you is devout.

964
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,220
That's a sweet thought.

965
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,560
If you're not willing to kill yourself for Bob, you're nothing but a whimpering Bobby.

966
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,560
It's very possible that July 5th,

967
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,060
it's actually July 6th,

968
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:52,060
and you're just going to come on July 6th to see if you didn't kill themselves.

969
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,980
And they're going to kill those who didn't kill themselves.

970
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,940
So if you really want to save yourself a lot of pain, you'll do it yourself.

971
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:08,120
Well, one thing I should warn about that Bob has specifically mentioned

972
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,540
that's going to happen on July 5th that may shake some people up.

973
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,660
As, of course, you know, X-Day,

974
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,480
happens in each time zone.

975
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,960
It's 7 o'clock.

976
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,480
You'll be able to, if you live in California,

977
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:30,120
you'll be able to watch the rupture and X-Day happening in New York on live TV.

978
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,160
And it may be...

979
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:38,340
Some people have expressed concern that will affect how people in California react to X-Day.

980
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:42,980
They may be predicting the rapture where they wouldn't otherwise have predicted it.

981
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,000
It may affect the results.

982
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,300
Well, there's another aspect that you may not be aware of.

983
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,100
Apparently...

984
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,680
Now, of course, this isn't the way it seems,

985
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,320
but apparently to see someone being ruptured

986
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:03,120
in the process of being lifted up in power and glory to the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

987
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:10,500
they look sort of like a burning monk screaming in agony as he bursts into flames.

988
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,980
In other words, all these saints and geniuses with their hands

989
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:19,420
and membership cards in their pockets will be seen on live TV by those Californians

990
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:23,040
bursting into flames and screaming for someone to put them out.

991
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,620
But it's really in pleasure. It's in pleasure.

992
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:30,740
Yeah, that's just the resistance to the pleasure that's about to happen

993
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,300
when they suddenly wake up on the escape vessels.

994
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:38,360
So, if you happen to be watching, you know, a time zone ahead at 7,

995
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,340
well, for you it would be 6 in the morning, but for New Yorkers it would be 7, let's say.

996
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:49,760
Don't worry. We're sure Bob wasn't kidding about it.

997
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:54,900
It's all right. It doesn't really hurt when you burst into flames screaming like that.

998
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,280
The decapitations, the mutilations, they're all...

999
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,220
That's just part of the satire.

1000
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,640
...preludes to pleasure.

1001
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:12,800
It's to ready you for pleasure so intense that it's almost worse than being paper cut to death.

1002
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,900
Okay, so that's one possible future of the church.

1003
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:21,700
The other, of course, is the commercial future of the church.

1004
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,880
Let's say this turns into something popular that the pinks enjoy.

1005
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,080
Let's say it turns into something that everyone starts wearing on their T-shirts,

1006
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,120
kind of like Batman T-shirts, W-R-E-K T-shirts and stuff.

1007
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:36,180
Then...

1008
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:41,000
We'd hate to have that many normal people like us, but we'd do it for the money.

1009
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,280
Yeah, they'd contempt us with money.

1010
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,000
We'd have to do it for the money. It would be against our religion not to.

1011
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,980
They know they can buy us out.

1012
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,200
People say there's too many Bobbies, but we think there should be more.

1013
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,640
We think there should be millions. That's the only way we're going to get rich off of this thing.

1014
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,000
Well, we don't just need their money.

1015
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:08,980
Those are the souls that Bob's going to be dealing to the exes in order to save the souls of the true subgeniuses.

1016
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:13,260
You can't use a pink soul. He has to use a Bobby, which is sort of in between.

1017
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,220
It's between a pink and a true subgenius.

1018
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,360
The exes will think they're getting subgenius soul, and it'll be good enough.

1019
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:29,600
That first line of soul and anguish and so forth will be good enough that they'll hopefully go ahead and close the deal with Bob.

1020
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,240
Well, if that happens, you should truly wake up scared.

1021
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:41,260
Because what that should indicate to you is that the anti-Bob is going the extra mile

1022
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,520
to get you out of the church.

1023
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,580
He knows that you resist that which is popular.

1024
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:50,820
He knows that you resist that which everyone else is doing.

1025
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,360
He knows that you're into this alternative lifestyle.

1026
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:01,260
And he figures that if he can make you think that your alternative lifestyle is no longer alternative, that you'll bail.

1027
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:08,100
And if he's willing to spend the billions of dollars to commercialize it and market it,

1028
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,000
then you should ask yourself,

1029
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,920
are you going to fall for it?

1030
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,640
Are you going to burn that J.R. Bob Dobbs t-shirt?

1031
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,080
Are you going to toss that membership card at the bottom of your drawer?

1032
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,640
Are you going to stop telling somebody at the bar about Bob?

1033
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,760
Are you going to pretend when someone says,

1034
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,280
Oh, did you hear about J.R. Bob Dobbs?

1035
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,680
Oh, not again. I'm so tired of that.

1036
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,880
I mean, you should really be scared at that point.

1037
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:37,580
Because the other alternative, and one that we've been discussing in private,

1038
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,980
and we're not going to tell you whether or not we're going to do it,

1039
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:40,860
is whether or not we really believe you.

1040
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:48,320
But what scares us the most is that maybe it is something that's a secret even from us.

1041
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,840
What if this conditioning was directed towards you?

1042
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,780
We've been telling you this July 5th and everything.

1043
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,140
Just so that the people out there in the audience today are sitting there and going,

1044
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,920
Okay, it's just a joke, but I'm in on it.

1045
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,100
It's just a joke. Nothing's really going to happen.

1046
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:03,900
I've got my membership.

1047
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,520
What if it's not a prank? What if it's real?

1048
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,480
What if we haven't even been really let in on the secret?

1049
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,400
What if they're not sex goddesses? What if they're pain goddesses?

1050
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,400
What if this is a grand plan?

1051
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,560
What if Jane is the only one who knows?

1052
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,260
Please don't tell us.

1053
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,460
If it's Bob's will, then so mote it be.

1054
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,860
We may be the first ones to die the painful death.

1055
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:30,080
So actually, we could be wrong about all of this.

1056
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,340
Bob could be the most evil being in the universe.

1057
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:38,320
This could be the one true false religion of the end times

1058
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,540
predicted in the Bible.

1059
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:45,440
But because it is Bob, then therefore even that would be the right thing to happen.

1060
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,400
I'm a Stangian Orthodox back to the pamphlet subgenius.

1061
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,420
I do not question Bob's edicts one way or the other.

1062
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,080
I'll just do whatever he tells me to do.

1063
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,100
Blind faith.

1064
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,260
Why do you think we're sitting here right now?

1065
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:07,220
I've got some bad news for you in that respect.

1066
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:10,140
Some of you guys may consider this very bad news.

1067
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:15,980
There is a step, another phase of evolution between man and overman.

1068
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,720
And I'm afraid it's woman.

1069
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,340
Woe man.

1070
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,080
Woe man.

1071
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,800
A woman and a man just as long as they go woe.

1072
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,060
Now some of you guys may be into this.

1073
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,940
There's going to be a short period, hopefully, probably a short period of time

1074
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:38,920
after the sex goddesses rupture you up on X day.

1075
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:43,580
Just before you're turned into an overman, you're going to have to spend some time as a woman.

1076
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,000
Now I don't know about you, I've always kind of been intrigued with that idea.

1077
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,840
You know, for maybe a couple of hours.

1078
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:52,280
You know, just some time in the shower, something like that.

1079
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,720
I'd love to check it out.

1080
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:54,700
Ugh.

1081
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,820
You can get off on yourself.

1082
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:58,560
That's right.

1083
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,100
How long are you going to be what?

1084
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,400
How long are you going to be what?

1085
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,200
What?

1086
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,020
Bob says not very long.

1087
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,000
About seven inches.

1088
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:12,880
I trust Bob.

1089
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,740
He said it wasn't going to be real long.

1090
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:23,600
You know, he said, and most of the brain sections that he takes are not, you know, it's not going to age you much, he said.

1091
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,360
You hardly notice the difference.

1092
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,300
So it's not like.

1093
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:30,120
He only removes the unnecessary portions of your brain.

1094
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:30,600
Yeah.

1095
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,260
I mean, you know, stuff you wanted to forget anyway.

1096
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,220
You know, math lessons, crap like that.

1097
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,600
You know, stuff he can use.

1098
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,380
You probably aren't going to use them.

1099
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,860
He'll ask, you know, he'll take different things from different people, I'm sure.

1100
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:50,780
Removes the curse of memory, that stumbling block to perfection.

1101
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,420
Oh, really?

1102
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,680
If only we could be more like Bob.

1103
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,800
And to truly know nothing.

1104
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,780
Then we would be walking the path of least resistance.

1105
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:03,420
But.

1106
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:09,680
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1107
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:18,160
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

1108
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:25,180

1109
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,740

Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1111
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,280

1112
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,060
Subgenius Radio Ministry,

1113
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:46,780
Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1114
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,900
Stay tuned and Praise Bob.

1115
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,500
She wants money,

1116
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:55,660
she wants money.

1117
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:59,640
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

1118
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,840
I give the rich a giant tax loophole.

1119
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,540
I leave the poor living in a poophole.

1120
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,440
There's something about having a gun in your hands and being able to control it.

1121
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,420
I don't know what it is, but all the girls talked about it.

1122
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,540
Anytime you want to go shooting, just give me a call.

1123
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,180
What's next?

1124
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,560
Remember what to do, friends.

1125
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:45,480
I want you to think of anything that's ever gone out of you, anything that's ever shot out of you,

1126
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,940
anything that's ever spewed out of you, anything that you have ever...

1127
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:57,080
It's just been ripping to get out, and I want you to take a deep breath on the count of three.

1128
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:57,400
Ready?

1129
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,000
One, two, three.

1130
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:07,980
And hold it, and hold it, and think about everything, and let it out on an exhalation.

1131
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,120
You begin to grasp the concept of extra meditation, I can see.

1132
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:36,980
Now, on the third inhalation, I want you to think of everything in your life, and in your mind, and in your body, and in your soul, and in your devotions to the Vedic deities, and witchy type things that has ever gotten caught in between.

1133
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:45,220
Pieces of chicken in your teeth, your brain, in your head, anything that has ever gotten caught in between.

1134
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:51,680
And I want you to take a deep breath on the count of three, and hold it as long as you can.

1135
01:00:51,920 --> 01:01:03,180
And I'm going to raise my arm, and when I lower my arm, when I call the drop for the power to be released, I want you all to scream,

1136
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:08,200
as loud and as long as you can.

1137
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,320
Are we ready?

1138
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,580
All right.

1139
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:15,420
One, two.

1140
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,600
One, two, three.

1141
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:27,940
And hold it, and hold it, and think of everything that has ever gotten in between, and scream.

1142
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:29,200
Woo!

1143
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:33,320


1144
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:41,440
Woo!

1145
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,920
Oh, sacred, heinous conspiracy!

1146
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,620
Get in there!

1147
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,100
Let it out!

1148
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:46,280
Let it out!

1149
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,040
Hoo!

1150
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:47,620
Hoo!

1151
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,260
Hoo!

1152
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,040
Hoo!

1153
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:51,820
Hoo!

1154
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:53,260
All right!

1155
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:54,840
All right!

1156
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,240
Woo!

1157
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:03,780
You guys are all true disciplines of the Sisters of the Yeti, and the prescribed sciences of techno magic.

1158
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,460
Time plus money equals slack.

1159
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:14,420
Oh, yes, dear friends, and that's where I need to cut in and give us some credits to let you know what you've been listening to.

1160
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,260
Thank you.

1161
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:15,860
Thank you.

1162

Awesome, bastante, take a bow for us.
