1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,780
And now, the Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Subgenius Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,200
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,520
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,760
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,300
Oh, alright.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,840
And I, Stang, am in a big, bubbly hurry,

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:47,580
And so tonight's show is a re-re-re-run, but not of an hour of slack, not even of a minute of slack, nay, but rather of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse from WREK Atlanta.

8
00:00:47,580 --> 00:01:05,140
And not this time won by the good reverend Susie the Floozy, but a mental classic by her co-pad was the Lymph Node Institute.

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,340
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.

10
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,760
You are listening to Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

11
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,040
The Lymph Node Institute Edition.

12
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,420
I'm Doc.

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,580
And I'm Bugsy.

14
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,920
We're going to discuss the brain this evening in the interest of the magic dancing giants above us.

15
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:43,140
It's funny because your brain will fill in gaps as needed, especially when you're receiving everything through your ear holes.

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,820
So if you hear any extra noises, it's just the, it's the dancing giants.

17
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,480
The subliminal dancing giant.

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,560
We're not really, as far as you know, hammering anything into your brain.

19
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,580
It's for your benefit, Atlanta and places beyond.

20
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,640
Your brain's squishy, little monkey man.

21
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,500
Let's go.

22
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,980
You have a few feet on my back.

23
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:28,980


24
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,600
That's the way to get off the bottom of the mountain

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,000
That's how Westin made me great

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000


27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000


28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,340
We mean good

29
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,340


30
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,700
Our 똑돼 이젠

31
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,400
One word

32
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:44,760


33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:44,760


34
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:44,760


35
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,460
I know

36
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,780
Although I do believe there would be more

37
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:46,780


38
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,340
I've got a nervous kind of feeling

39
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,720
Got a painful yellow headache

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,380
Every picture in every magazine's tongue frills

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,720
Every face looks out and screams at me to frills

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,700
Cold sweat on my collar

43
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,760
Dripping to my boots

44
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,940
The waves of nauseous pain

45
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,280
Sets off the pressure pad along

46
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,380
Gotta get out of hell

47
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,640
Gotta get out of hell

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,060
Gotta get out of hell

49
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,260
Gotta get out of hell

50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,320
Got a painful swelling brain

51
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,040
Banging in my head

52
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,560
Got a painful swelling brain

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,760
And I call it a day

54
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,840
I'm cold off sick

55
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,820
Got a swelling itching pain

56
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,460
Got it pulling out my hair

57
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,040
Got a swelling itching pain

58
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,740
Clutching at my brain

59
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,000
Got a painful swelling brain

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,020
In the back of my head

61
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,180
Got a painful swelling brain

62
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,740
Got a painful swelling brain

63
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:16,740


64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,120
In my head

65
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


67
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


68
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


70
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


71
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


72
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


73
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


75
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


76
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


77
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


79
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


80
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,120


81
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,020
Got a cold half sick

82
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,440
Got a swelling itching pain

83
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,680
Got me pulling out my hair

84
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,460
Got a swelling itching pain

85
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,900
Clutching out by brain

86
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,660
Got a painful swelling brain

87
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,940
Got me laying on the floor

88
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,680
And she banged, banged it in my head

89
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,940
Got a painful swelling brain

90
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,040
In the back of my head

91
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,360
Got a painful swelling brain

92
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,180
And I called off sick

93
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,560
Got a painful swelling brain

94
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,740
Got that pulling out my hair

95
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,640
Got a painful swelling brain

96
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,920
Clutching up my brain

97
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,800
Got a painful swelling brain

98
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
People swelling brain

99
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,940
Driving me up to wall

100
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,040
Got a painful swelling brain

101
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
People swelling brain

102
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,560
Clipping out my eyes and closing my mouth

103
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,260
Got a painful swelling brain

104
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,240
People swelling brain

105
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,340
Imploding my thoughts

106
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,480
Got a painful swelling brain

107
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,360
People swelling brain

108
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,540
That's me holding up my hand

109
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,440
義

110
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,480
Got a flying empty bag while I do my

111
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,940
Punching in my brain

112
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,560
Got people falling, people falling

113
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,300
Got me lying on the ground

114
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,800
Got people falling, people falling

115
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,280
Going out of my squad

116
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,980
Got people falling, people falling

117
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,540
Burning up my thoughts

118
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,180
Got people falling, people falling

119
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,360
Coming out my eyes is losing my

120
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,400
Got people falling, people falling

121
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,720
And it's falling, tearing me apart

122
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,680
Good evening, outpatients.

123
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,520
I know it has been some time since I've donned the blood-spattered lab coat of healing,

124
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,820
and it is possible that some of you listening have suffered mightily at the withdrawal of your coded programming.

125
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,240
Some of those not listening may be, in fact, deceased.

126
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,820
But let me make my position clear.

127
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,760
We don't need you anymore.

128
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:03,020
We're so deep in our endgame model that we don't have the time or resources to even look around,

129
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,040
much less worry about you.

130
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,660
We've got all the human...

131
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,440
human pincushions we need since our rapture-has-passed recruiting drive.

132
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,860
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

133
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,800
I tell ya.

134
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,700
Global anxiety equals multiple international revenue streams.

135
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,420
But on to business.

136
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:31,780
One of the last remaining uneaten helper monkeys reminded me of some damn funding technicality community outreach bullsh-ish.

137
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,000
So, here we are at or around the point.

138
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,840
Ahem.

139
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,500
Now,

140
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,580
more than ever,

141
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,640
your mind is a battleground.

142
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:46,060
The invading armies of normalcy have already dug in on the beachhead of your desire for acceptance,

143
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,520
which is, not coincidentally,

144
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,200
perilously close to your slack reserves.

145
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,640
No, please.

146
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,220
I hear your protest.

147
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,640
I understand the reflex to automatically attest your rugged individualism,

148
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,440
but this is not a cigarette ad.

149
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,520
You damn well better take a passing interest,

150
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,900
in the opinions of others.

151
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:14,860
I should not have to remind you that our kind has a poor track record when it comes to frenzied pink mobs.

152
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,480
So, you desire that they accept you,

153
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,220
at least to the point of keeping your guts off their pitchforks.

154
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,500
You know, all I have ever asked of you is one simple thing.

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,640
Make the simple decision that it is the world that is insane,

156
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,700
not you.

157
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,500
Just acknowledge that somehow,

158
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:48,900
a system of techno-feudalism in which blind slaves squirm at the feet of sad, sadistic, repressed yetis,

159
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,800
clamoring for crumbs and passing up rumors on their farts,

160
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,700
has somehow failed.

161
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,300
No problem, right?

162
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,400
Plain as the scabs on my nose, you say.

163
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,180
But,

164
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,060
tomorrow,

165
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,940
or the next day,

166
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,260
you'll be back at the table,

167
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,120
playing their comfortingly stupid shell game.

168
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,340
The world hovers on the edge of rebirth,

169
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,040
and I'll bet you still have a damn job,

170
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,000
still standing at the answer table in the back of their seedy opium den of lies.

171
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,220
Oh, don't get me wrong.

172
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,780
I'm not here to run the moneylenders out of the temple.

173
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,020
Just think of me as the guy in the next cell,

174
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,640
who won't stop whispering dangerous,

175
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,720
bull-ish,

176
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,120
through the cinder blocks.

177
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,880
But it's not because I'm trying to get you in trouble,

178
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,400
although that would be funny.

179
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,260
I just don't want you to forget the present that history has bought for you.

180
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,240
See you in the gulag.

181
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,260
Goodnight.

182
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,420
And now,

183
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,100
the parts of the train,

184
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,300
performed by,

185
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,580
the train.

186
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,740
Yes.

187
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,100
Neocortex frontal lobe.

188
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,340
Brainstorm! Brainstorm!

Hippocampus neural node, right hemisphere.

00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,120
Pons and cortex visual.

191
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,280
Brainstorm! Brainstorm!

192
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,800
Sylvian-Fisher pineal, left hemisphere.

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,960
Cerebellum left,

194
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,000
cerebellum right.

195
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,100
Synapse hypothalamus,

196
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,980
striatum dendrite.

197
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,420
Axon fibers, matter gray.

198
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,340
Brainstorm! Brainstorm!

199
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,240
Central tegmental pathway,

200
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,300
temporal lobe.

201
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,420
White core matter, four brains go.

202
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,340
Brainstorm! Brainstorm!

203
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,320
Central fissure, cord, spinal,

204
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,820

205
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,820
Piameter,

206
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,120
men and geovane,

medulla, vanguata, and lobe.

208
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Ptolembic, microelectrodes.

209
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,180
The brain!

210
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,400
The brain!

211
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,120
One is moral,

212
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,140
one is not.

213
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,480
It's super ego and idbot.

214
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,160
Do you have any idea how frustrating it is

215
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,760
to be a robot personification

216
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,740
of the human id?

217
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,860
I never should have given you a penis.

218
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,740
That's what she said.

219
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,740
Oh idbot.

220
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,000
Well come on, let's sit down at this

221
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,980
all you can eat buffet.

222
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,740
Oh boy, I want all of it.

223
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,140
Now.

224
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,200
Now now idbot.

225
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,780
No, out of my way.

226
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,780
Only eat what you need.

227
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,320
Cuff you, you big queer.

228
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,840
Gluttony is a sin, idbot.

229
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,740
And you're a pansy, get out of my way.

230
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,040
All things in moderation.

231
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,680
I gots to have it.

232
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,720
No you don't, you're a robot.

233
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,120
As a personification of the human id,

234
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,520
I must have all of it, I gots to have it,

235
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,040
I gots to have it, gimme gimme, get out of my way.

236
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,820
You're incorrigible, idbot.

237
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,500
That's it, I'm waiting in the car.

238
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,580
Get out of my way, other patrons.

239
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,160
Nom nom nom.

240
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,520
Nom nom nom.

241
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,200
Nom nom nom.

242
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,860
Nom nom nom.

243
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,020
One is moral, one is not,

244
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,380
it's super ego and idbot.

245
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,360
Did you read Brave New World by Aldous Huxley?

246
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,080
Laugh Riot.

247
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,040
It's pretty funny for a book that's not supposed to be funny.

248
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,400
I mean, he was not a swift.

249
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,040
No, but orgy porgy

250
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,020
until I started seeing a lot of

251
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,720
rap videos.

252
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,000
Really struck me as comical.

253
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,900
Well they got the JC character in there and that wasn't so funny.

254
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,760
And the savage.

255
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,780
It's the same with 1984, there's always

256
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,720
a heretic, a Satan figure.

257
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,640
Or Jesus, depending on which

258
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,140
side you're looking at him from.

259
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,900
But me mum smoked when she was having me and I got okay with

260
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,360
brackish amniocytic fluid.

261
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,680
But it wasn't quite poo poo.

262
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,880
In Brave New World they just deprived some of the oxygen

263
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,780
to the fetus. Yeah.

264
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,000
It's amazing how that really stunts development. Funny that.

265
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,720
Let's say things go Brave New World

266
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,760
and you start doing all the alterations

267
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,820
of fetuses to make sure they end up in certain

268
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,480
positions in society. Yes.

269
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,620
Because you know the society, the needs of the society are

270
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,940
paramount to the society. It really messes up

271
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,560
the whole mother nature curve if you start

272
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,480
dumbing down some and smartening up others.

273
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,680
Music

Shakers and we will not burn

Killers and we will return

297
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,240
Shakers and we will not shock

298
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,700
Shockers and we will burn

299
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,780
I'm not the world's most incredible man

300
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,960
But I just can't seem to understand

301
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,020
If it weren't for all the people I'd be all alone

302
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,860
Rock me baby, rock me baby all night long

303
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,820
I'm not the world's most incredible man

304
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,840
But I just can't seem to understand

305
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,480
If it weren't for all the people I'd be all alone

306
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,940
I'm not the world's most incredible man

307
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,740
Shakers and we will not burn

308
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,180
Killers and we will return

309
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,060
Shakers and we will not shock

310
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,160
Shockers and we will burn

311
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,700
They were doing what I was doing

312
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,440
When lightning hit the street

313
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,200
A bar of soap, a pint of scope

314
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,100
Was all they'd had to eat

315
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,560
Look at that, some macaroni had happened to his hair

316
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,360
He had a shirt but it was hurt

317
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,220
And sadness filled the air

318
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,440
The arms of the world's most incredible man

319
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,900
I never can quite seem to understand

320
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,900
If it weren't for all the people I'd be all alone

321
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,360
Rock me baby, rock me baby all night long

322
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,300
It takes a lot of money to let you teach them how to talk

323
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,500
Come on pretty baby, rock, rock, rock

324
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,800
One is moral, one is not

325
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,260
It's super ego and it's bot

326
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,760
Ah, now for some fine adult entertainment

327
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,220
Remember, no touching

328
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,940
Guff that noise, I gots to have it

329
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,920
It bot, I can't take you anywhere

330
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,140
You're embarrassing me in front of the ladies

331
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,960
Guff you, pansy, give me a dollar

332
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,420
Well, all I've got are these Sacagaweas

333
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,520
Look at the ladies, I gots to have it

334
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,340
It bot, no!

335
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,280
Ladies, I have attachments

336
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,180
I have special attachments

337
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,420
Please, you have to respect these people

338
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,600
They're just working a job like anyone else

339
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,580
Guff you, give me a ten spot

340
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,160
I wish I had a laugh

341
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,280
Oh, I need to have a laugh dance

342
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,400
It bot, retract that tentacle

343
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,360
Bouncer, you better step off

344
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,200
Excuse my friend, sir, he's a little bit of a robot

345
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,580
I'll drink all the liquor and have all the booty in this hole

346
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,660
It bot, moderate, you're embarrassing me

347
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,840
People are looking at us, the Japanese businessmen

348
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,140
Moderation is for pussies

349
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,880
Seriously, it bot, I can't take you anywhere

350
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,660
Ha ha ha ha ha, um

351
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,980
It bot, that's murder

352
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,700
One is moral, one is not

353
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,120
It's super ego, and it bot

354
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,600
Now you heard the disclaimer, you know the deal

355
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,080
If you, if you take any of this seriously

356
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,680
Then you have a real problem

357
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,620
Well, you sure are talking serious, doc

358
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,420
About all his cognition processes

359
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,380
Well, hell, I don't know

360
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,240
The brain is funny, too

361
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,320
Actually, the appreciation of humor

362
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,640
Probably is just as important as having the gullies of depression

363
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,200
So I don't know, I don't know

364
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,600
I tell you people who are leveled out, mostly

365
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,820
From the pills you take

366
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,380
You're missing most of the ride

367
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,780
Your rollercoaster's pretty straight

368
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,440
Hunter S. Thompson said that the first sign of insanity

369
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,100
Is the loss of the sense of humor

370
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,940
But what about people who never had one?

371
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,860
Born crazy

372
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,160
You know the bland, the bland Blanco?

373

Deaf, dumb, and bland

376
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,340

Gonzo, hyper, cybernetic

Jump in the air and levitate

You are blurred, you can't hold that deck

Marsh your mind and ride the groove

386
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,440
Do your part to make a wish

387
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,680

Slam the beat and funk aside

Ain't no psycho, ain't no relic

395
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,700
Reality is psychedelic

396
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,160
Psychedelic

417
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,180
music is a strange function of the human mind it's not necessarily a function of the mind the

418
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,640
mind does determine patterns but when the music's presented those are predetermined patterns you may

419
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,760
interpret them differently but it's not like you're making music out of randomness you're

420
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,240
being presented with patterns already but if you go back i mean way back to the advent of music

421
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,940
one can only assume that it was organic sounds a couple of stone cavemen sitting somewhere

422
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:37,460
listening to bugs probably hitting rocks and skulls yeah sticks on the sixth day of god time

423
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:49,240
the mastodon went away from far beyond the galaxies i've journeyed to this place

424
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,700
to study

425
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:58,120
the behavior patterns of the human race and i find them highly illogical

426
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:09,840
girl meets boy they fall in love she says he's everything she's dreamed of but when they get

427
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,820
married before he's aware she changes his habits the way he combs his hair she changes him to

428
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,320
someone he's never been and then complain

429
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,780
he's not like other men now really i find this most illogical

430
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:35,780
take the case of your automobiles greatest invention since man discovered wheels

431
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:42,420
high dramatic overdrive floor on the floor push button windows push button doors

432
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:49,140
double barrel carburetors rush you any place but you never can find a parking space

433
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,420
highly

434
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,640
illogical

435
00:22:51,640 --> 00:23:01,380
take the case of modern man he works all his life gives it all he can saves all his money

436
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:09,400
works overtime pinches every penny banks every dime all he can think about is money but you

437
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:15,760
know that he can take it with him where he's going to go now i find that fascinatingly

438
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,660
illogical

439
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,160
now is the time to journey home

440
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,940
to tell of what i've learned my people i believe have every right to be concerned

441
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,300
illogical

442
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:35,220
for in spite of computers and advanced psychology behavior patterns are still a mystery i predict

443
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,220
the future of this earthly human race is that having made a mess of earth they'll move to

444
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,940
outer space well there goes the neighborhood

445
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,200
totally completely absolutely

446
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,680
illogical

447
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:50,680


448
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:50,680


449
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:50,680


450
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:50,680


451
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,600
and

452
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,240
one is moral one is not it's super ego and it bot

453
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,480
ah it bot it's been such a long time since i couldn't take you anywhere remember when

454
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,460
we first used to go to the candy shack when we were young boys shut your wet human mouth

455
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:20,660
you're making me hungry i want sweets and i need them yesterday that's exactly what

456
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:20,660


457
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:20,660


458
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:20,660


459
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:20,660


460
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,860
what you used to say.

461
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,460
Sir, take that right back.

462
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,520
Hey, can I help you?

463
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,520
Yes, I'd like a modicum

464
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,260
of moderately priced chocolate.

465
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,320
Give me everything in the counter.

466
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,900
Open up the counter.

467
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,880
Move out of the way, old fellow.

468
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,660
I will have you from behind.

469
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,560
Ibbot, no, you're embarrassing me in front of

470
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,360
the old man.

471
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,540
I don't even know who you are. Don't touch me.

472
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,000
What the hell is he doing?

473
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,220
Never mind my friend, sir.

474
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,500
He's a little excitable for the sugar, but

475
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,820
don't worry, he's a robot.

476
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,980
Put candy in my orifice now.

477
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,120
Put it in.

478
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,280
Ibbot wants more candy.

479
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,880
Ibbot, no, that's his head.

480
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,840
Ah, yes, those were the days.

481
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,060
One is moral, one is not.

482
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,400
It's super ego

483
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,540
and Ibbot.

484
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,560
We'll have to wait until the terrorists

485
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,280
kidnap Ronald Reagan to do that.

486
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,920
What terrorists? The terrorists.

487
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,860
What? The terrorists that...

488
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,260
Don't you remember any of this?

489
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,220
The terrorists that escaped from Guantanamo Bay

490
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,480
invaded the country, just like that

491
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,760
Chuck Norris movie, and then

492
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,980
freaking kidnapped Ronald Reagan.

493
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,100
That hadn't happened yet, has it?

494
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,100
Well, he's Alzheimer's boy.

495
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,980
So we can't very well ask him.

496
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,580
He's so retold.

497
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,640
I believe it. He was Alzheimer's boy when he was in office.

498
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,880
No, I have read the script

499
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,320
as it is going to be executed.

500
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,540
The terrorists will escape from Guantanamo

501
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,320
and they will kidnap Ronald Reagan

502
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,380
and I think they do something terrible

503
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,300
to the state of Texas.

504
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,600
I think Negative Land pulled off

505
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,540
the whole time trials better.

506
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,660
Hell yes.

507
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,300
Let's play a little Negative Land.

508
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,800
They've done everything better than we have.

509
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,060
Fine. Okay, fine.

510
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,420
Let's play some Negative Land.

511
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,380
Yes, let's.

512
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,540
You're the Pepsi generation.

513
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,160
Now, what's inside of you?

514
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,580
Open it.

515
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,380
What's gonna be there?

516
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,020
What's inside of you?

517
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,160
Open it.

518
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,120
What's gonna be there?

519
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,960
What's inside of you?

520
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,320
What's inside of you?

521
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,560
Open it, I tell you.

522
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,340
Pepsi.

523
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,220
Pepsi.

524
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,100
I need a Pepsi.

525
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,180
I need the Pepsi.

526
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,860
I need a Pepsi today.

527
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,620
Open it.

528
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,100
If there's Pepsi,

529
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,040
I know

530
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,180
Ports are aisle

531
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,400
I need a Pepsi.

532
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,100
Open it.

533
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,020
If there's Pepsi,

534
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,720
I need a Pepsi right away.

535
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,860
Open it.

536
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,320
If there's Pepsi,

537
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:38,440
I'll only know

538
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,300
Pepsi, Pepsi today.

539
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,100
Pepsi, Pepsi today.

540
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,500
What does make Pepsi,

541
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,620
I could say Pepsi to you?

542
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,460
I don't know what else to say.

543
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,120
Put a had whom.

544
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,080
But you need a Pepsi,

545
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,060
need a Pepsi,

546
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,040
need a Pepsi

547
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,500
I need a Pepsi today.

548
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,620
I need a Pepsi.

549
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,480
I need a Pepsi.

550
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,040
I need a Pepsi right away.

551
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,780
What did I tell you?

552
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,060
I need a Pepsi.

553
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,420
To show my grand loyalty.

554
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,580
To say all good about me.

555
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,700
We don't know what else to say.

556
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,020
But I need Pepsi.

557
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,820
What's up?

558
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,940
I need a Pepsi.

559
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,540
What's up?

560
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:17,460
So I can play basketball.

561
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,600
I don't need Coca-Cola at all.

562
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,160
To show my grand loyalty.

563
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,200
To feel good about me.

564
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,540
We don't know what else to say.

565
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,640
But I need Pepsi.

566
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,860
Pepsi.

567
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,640
Pepsi.

568
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,160
Pepsi today.

569
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,000
Pepsi today.

570
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,220
Pepsi today.

571
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,460
I need Pepsi sometimes.

572
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,720
And I don't know why.

573
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,180
There's a voice inside my head.

574
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,800
That makes me go out and buy.

575
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,240
I need Pepsi.

576
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,060
I need Pepsi.

577
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,760
I buy a Pepsi.

578
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,120
Buy a Pepsi.

579
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,400
Buy a Pepsi after drinkin' some beer.

580
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,320
Beer.

581
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,640
Buy a Pepsi.

582
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,860
Buy a Pepsi.

583
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,580
Buy a Pepsi after beatin' up queer.

584
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,160
Pepsi Pepsi.

585
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,180
Buy a Pepsi.

586
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,780
Buy a Pepsi after beatin' up queer.

587
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,380
Pepsi.

588
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,320
Buy Pepsi.

589
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,880
After drinkin' some beer.

590
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,900
Peps-I need Pepsi.

591
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,840
We might as well come right out with it.

592
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,080
I need a Pepsi sometime.

593
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,280
All flavors have that happy face.

594
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,480
And I don't know why.

595
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,240
Except sarsaparilla.

596
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,500
We haven't quite hit that happy, carefree note in sarsaparilla.

597
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,400
There's a voice inside my head.

598
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,100
Now please don't misunderstand me.

599
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,000
I need a Pepsi.

600
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,180
Our sarsaparilla is absolutely dependable.

601
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,420
I need a Pepsi today.

602
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,320
It's trustworthy.

603
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,300
It's loyal.

604
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,000
Right away.

605
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,420
And many fine, upstanding citizens love it.

606
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:46,860
Pepsi.

607
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,800
A really good mix.

608
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,660
I need a Pepsi.

609
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,560
But it just isn't what we call happy.

610
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,280
Pepsi.

611
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,680
Pepsi.

612
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,260
A really good mix.

613
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:55,700
Pepsi.

614
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,340
Pepsi.

615
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,500
Pepsi.

616
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,340
Pepsi today.

617
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,760
You take our orange.

618
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,040
It's absolutely rollicking.

619
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,380
Fountain Pepsi.

620
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,400
Our lemon is almost giggling.

621
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,520
Maybe a 12 ounce Pepsi.

622
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,520
Our black cherry and black raspberry are so bubbling with happiness.

623
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,000
They damp in the glass.

624
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,460
Maybe a 16 ounce Pepsi.

625
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,740
We're sorry about sarsaparilla.

626
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,460
Pepsi.

627
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,020
Pepsi.

628
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,100
Pepsi.

629
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,120
Why?

630
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:17,960
Isn't it happy?

631
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,620
Pepsi.

632
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,220
Honey, you can just go out and urinate.

633
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,440
You're an orange especially if you

634
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:21,440


635
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,320
Isn't it happy?

636
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,420
Hasn't it happy?

637
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,280
I love negative playing. That was great.

638
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,000
It was. Everything they do.

639
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,740
You know what they call it when they're starting a marketing campaign

640
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,760
and the first wave is just to get you to be aware that the product is out there?

641
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,500
Foreplay?

642
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,300
Basically, it's called establishing a mind share.

643
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,920
Isn't that a Queensryche album?

644
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,560
Operation Mind Share?

645
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,180
Operation Mind Slime. Operation Daddy Did Me.

646
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,080
Showload.

647
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,420
He's like Showboat, but loady.

648
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,660
Well, Jack, it's great to see you again.

649
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,180
Hey, thanks.

650
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,900
You folks say you've been making remarkable progress?

651
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,920
I hope the antidepressants have helped.

652
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,340
Yeah? You look good.

653
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:22,920
Thanks.

654
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,680
You look real good.

655
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,520
Well, thanks.

656
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,600
I think we should start today's session with a little word association.

657
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,040
I don't have to be here, you know.

658
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,560
Actually, you do. You've been remanded to my care by the courts.

659
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:31,820
Whatever.

660
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,920
So, just clear your mind. Shouldn't be that hard to do.

661
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,380
And say the first thing that comes to mind.

662
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,520
Chocolate.

663
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,780
Let us begin.

664
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,220
Razor wire.

665
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,700
No, see, I will say the word you will respond to,

666
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,160
and that's the association by which I will respond.

667
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,580
I'll make judgments on how normal you are.

668
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:47,980
Papa Bean.

669
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,360
No.

670
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,080
Razor wire.

671
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,640
Are you ready?

672
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,020
Wealthy.

673
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:54,920
Poor.

674
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,400
Octogenarian.

675
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,360
Octopus.

676
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,480
Pheromones.

677
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,740
Ferret.

678
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,620
My friend's got some ferrets. They're funny.

679
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,980
Family values.

680
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,680
Funny ferrets.

681
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:09,720
Subwoofer.

682
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,520
Subwoofer.

683
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,460
Pass.

684
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,840
Authority figures.

685
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,600
Mom. Dad. Teachers.

686
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,260
Cops.

687
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,140
Ass.

688
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:21,860
Cryptophane.

689
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,160
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

690
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,020
What will you do if we let you go?

691
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,580
And the plastic's all melted and so is the car

692
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,860
Who are the brain police?

693
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:28,320
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

694
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:34,280
What will you do when the label comes off?

695
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,120
And the plastic's all melted and the chrome is too soft

696
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,820
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

697
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:34,260
I can't believe I'm alive

698
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,260
Who are the brain police?

699
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:57,880
What will you do if the people you knew

700
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,780
Were the plastic that melted at the chromium tube?

701
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,040
Who are the brain police?

702
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Who are the brain police?

703
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,300
Who are the brain police?

704
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:51,300


705
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,340
Who are the brain police?

706
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,220
Who are the brain police?

707
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,920
Who are the brain police?

708
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,380
Who are the brain police?

709
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,460
Who are the brain police?

710
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,360
All your senses are filtered through your brain.

711
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,800
They're just like microphones and cameras,

712
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,400
and heat and touch receptors

713
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,860
attached to that thing in your skull.

714
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,740
So if your brain is messed up,

715
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,740
you can never accurately perceive the outside world.

716
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,820
One expects that to happen.

717
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,140
We've had it proven by all the movies

718
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,700
that show people in little bamboo cages

719
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,840
clawing at their own feces, because they're crazy.

720
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,500
Speaking of behavioral programs,

721
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,420
I guess the prime one would be fight or flight.

722
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,520
Brought to you courtesy of your hypothalamus.

723
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,460
Once the senses squeeze in

724
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,020
through your various sense organs,

725
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,660
they run through something called the hypothalamus,

726
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,740
which is a little squirting gland in your brain.

727
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,880
The hypothalamus is kind of in charge of

728
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,600
deciding what is important and what is not.

729
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,860
So it's like Charlie for your brain.

730
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,020
Yes, basically it is your brain secretary.

731
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,000
It operates basically under four prerogatives,

732
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,980
which is fight, flight, feed, and puff.

733
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,860
And if something you see is important

734
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,920
to one of those four poles, I guess,

735
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,900
then the hypothalamus kind of gives it a little extra squirt,

736
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,400
which is why you might drive off the road

737
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,080
looking at some chickies behind,

738
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,600
because your hypothalamus is chanting,

739
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,780
well, you know...

740
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,780
Get you some, get you some.

741
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,820
Get it, get it, get it, get it.

742
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,020
And then when you look back to the road

743
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,000
and you're about three years old,

744
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,140
you're about three feet from the bumper of the car in front of you,

745
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,140
that's when your hypothalamus once again kicks in

746
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,240
with your fight or flight,

747
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,120
and there's really nothing you can do.

748
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,020
At the three seconds from the truck collision,

749
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,400
then you get the whole flash before your eyes,

750
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,900
read the whole of your existence,

751
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,800
which has to do with, I guess, the memory.

752
00:36:49,460 --> 00:37:13,720
They all look very similar, right?

753
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:13,860
You can easily simply detest someone

754
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:13,860


755
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:13,900
You don't belong there.

756
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:13,920
But if someone comes as a real human,

757
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:13,960
that person can build an existence

758
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:13,960


759
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:13,960


760
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:13,960


761
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,000
and it took two meters to bring them together to show the difference.

762
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,000


763
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,160
Yeah, kiss for me, sweet and brave

764
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,640
Kiss for me, shit to impale

765
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,780
My head on my head, you walk out like arrows

766
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,780
My head on my head, my mind's growing narrow

767
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,520
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit

768
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:50,860
And you breathe, and you breathe

769
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:58,140
Yeah, kiss for me, sweet and brave

770
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,740
Yeah, kiss for me, shit to impale

771
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,680
My head on my head, your words are like arrows

772
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,740
My head on my head, my mind's growing narrow

773
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,620
Yeah, kiss for me, it hits me hard

774
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:19,120
Yeah, kiss for me, you love me so hard

775
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,200
My head on my head, you walk out like arrows

776
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,340
My head on my head, my mind's growing narrow

777
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,220
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit

778
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,740
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit

779
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,920
And you breathe

780
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,780
They're all the same, they're all the same

781
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,360
20 eyes in my head

782
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,840
20 eyes in my head

783
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,460
They're all the same, they're all the same

784
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,900
When you're feeling 20 things at a time

785
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,660
You just can't slow things down

786
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,400
When you're feeling 20 things in your mind

787
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,200
You just can't slow things down

788
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,840
Well, all the time

789
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,660
This is the crowding of your human face

790
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,400
Well, all the time

791
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,460
We're taking over the world

792
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,220
20 eyes in my head

793
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,140
20 eyes in my head

794
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:56,420
20 eyes in my head

795
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,860
They're all the same, they're all the same

796
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,180
When you're feeling 20 things at a time

797
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,100
You just can't slow things down

798
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,840
When you're feeling 20 things in your mind

799
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,620
You just can't slow things down

800
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,260
Well, all the time

801
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,020
This is the crowding of your human face

802
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,820
Well, all the time

803
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,740
We're taking over the world

804
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,580
20 eyes in my head

805
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,400
20 eyes in my head

806
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,460
20 eyes in my head

807
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,880
They're all the same

808
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,320
20 eyes in my head

809
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,480
They're all the same

810
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,820
20 eyes in my head

811
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,020
They're all the same

812
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,280
20 eyes in my head

813
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,840
They're all the same

814
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:58,760
We were going to talk about memory.

815
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,540
Well, that's because your life flashed before your eyes.

816
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,720
It seemed like an appropriate seg.

817
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,140
Yes, yes.

818
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,600
And memory is very important

819
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,560
because basically the memories of who you are

820
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,280
and what you've done

821
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,000
sort of make who you are in the present.

822
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,680
Let's say you're reading a book

823
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,960
that's like fifth in a series.

824
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:14,480
Yes.

825
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,840
I think you would enjoy the subtleties

826
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,800
of the main character you're supposed to relate to

827
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,380
much more if you'd already been with that character

828
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,440
on several other adventures with different input.

829
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,440
And if you're the character in your own story,

830
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,840
which you really should be,

831
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,920
you very much should be,

832
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,360
then you're going to have a much more rich existence,

833
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:31,980
one thinks,

834
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,280
if you can relate everything that's currently happening

835
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,660
to what's happened in your past.

836
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,760
But don't live in the past

837
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,320
because that's a Jethro Tull song.

838
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,400
That's Stang's job to play Jethro Tull.

839
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,000
We don't do that.

840
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,260
Yeah, so memory's important.

841
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,400
When you lack memory,

842
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,660
you start to lose your definition of who you are, I think.

843
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,880
You look at these Alzheimer people.

844
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:47,720
Look at them.

845
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,880
I don't want to.

846
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,760
I know, not a pretty sight.

847
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,420
Could happen to you.

848
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,760
Don't drink your cola out of cans, kids.

849
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,580
They say that,

850
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,580
and I guess you can't use deodorant either

851
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,300
with all that alum.

852
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,380
That's what they say.

853
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,160
That's what's said.

854
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,580
That's what's said.

855
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,380
That's what's said.

856
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,100
So you're best at being

857
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,560
just what you are.

858
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,760
You can't be what you were.

859
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,460
The time of now is running out.

860
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,720
It's running out.

861
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,300
It's running, running, running out.

862
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,440
You can't be what you were.

863
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,660
So you're best at living the life

864
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,740
that you're talking about.

865
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,720
You can't be what you were.

866
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,220
You're just like a

867
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:13,540
a

868
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:13,700
a

869
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,160
a

870
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,360
a

871
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:14,400
a

872
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:14,660
a

873
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:14,700
a

874
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:14,760
a

875
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:14,780
a

876
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:14,780


877
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:14,860
a

878
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,020
a

879
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:15,880
a

880
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:15,880


881
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,380
a

882
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:16,380


883
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:16,580
a

884
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:16,580


885
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:16,720
a

886
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,440
a

887
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,440


888
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,060
a

889
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,700
a

890
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:20,700


891
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:20,700


892
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:20,700


893
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,260
I'm not guys, you know, aren't you?

894
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,540
a bad mind

895
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,940
There's no moving

896
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,220
There's no moving

897
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,540
There's no moving

898
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,040
in a bad love

899
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,360
if I

900
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,880
trade a bad

901
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,720
mind

902
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,480
You're always

903
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,500
talking, talking, talking,

904
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,160
talking, talking

905
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,740
this now

906
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,740
But you will

907
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,740
talk yourself down

908
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,100
You're going down

909
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,100
One is moral

910
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,160
One is not

911
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,480
It's super ego

912
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,560
and it bought

913
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,600
Well, it bought

914
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,300
Here we are

915
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,580
at yet another Woodstock

916
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,780
I smell cannabis

917
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,740
They are illegal

918
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,840
and we wouldn't want

919
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,720
to do anything wrong

920
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,780
or get in trouble

921
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,200
Out of my way

922
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,820
but truly makes me crazy

923
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,780
I do what he says, folks

924
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,580
I'm caught in the mud

925
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,220
Help

926
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,560
I have got to get

927
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,840
some of that sex drugs

928
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,420
and rock and roll

929
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,720
Well, maybe

930
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,600
two out of three

931
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,740
If it's too loud

932
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,720
then you are too old

933
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,980
Well, it's not too loud

934
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,200
I've got my earplugs in

935
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,000
You are such a

936
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,240
pansy panty waist

937
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:06,960
If you want me to

938
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,760
damage my hearing

939
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,760
that would make you happy

940
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,520
Why don't you hold

941
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,360
that girl down

942
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,200
while I set fire

943
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:11,860
to this tower?

944
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:12,240
No!

945
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,680
We need that tower

946
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,580
for observation

947
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,300
and filming

948
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,440
I like to watch

949
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,620
I like to watch

950
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,000
Give it to it, bot

951
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,720
It bought

952
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:19,980
No!

953
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,500
Let me at it

954
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,060
I gots to have it

955
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:23,620
All right

956
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,280
You just retract

957
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,280
those tentacles, mister

958
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,160
We gotta get out of here

959
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,620
You've gotten us

960
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,300
in trouble again

961
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,160
Woodstock

962
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,600
Woo

963
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,680
Party till you puke

964
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,500
That piece

965
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:31,840
of paper

966
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,080
I put in my mouth

967
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,100
is making me feel

968
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:34,680
awful

969
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,260
funny

970
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:39,780
Whoa

971
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,340
One is moral

972
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,440
One is not

973
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,760
It's super ego

974
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,800
and it bought

975
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,780
What's the difference

976
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,460
between the mind

977
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,020
and the brain?

978
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:49,920
The brain is the organ

979
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
and the mind is the

980
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,580
the part we like to

981
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,580
think that we are

982
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,740
Is the mind the soul?

983
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,280
Probably

984
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,320
Our consciousness

985
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,120
and personality

986
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:57,760
sure as hell

987
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,520
don't live in the brain

988
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,800
If you want to test that

989
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,780
just give someone's brain

990
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,320
a good whack

991
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,000
and watch their personality change

992
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,980
You know, you wipe out

993
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,860
one part of the brain

994
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,260
and some other part of the brain

995
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,080
starts kicking in

996
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,440
I think the mind is like a modem

997
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,220
The brain itself

998
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,580
is like the piece of equipment

999
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,040
that we used to call a modem

1000
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,980
A modulator demodulator

1001
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,540
That's correct

1002
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,200
It connects with the outside world

1003
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,460
And not only does it connect

1004
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,240
with the outside world

1005
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,460
but the whole part that makes it

1006
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,460
I think the seat of the soul

1007
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,020
is its connection

1008
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,540
to things that the rest of your senses

1009
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,520
can't really get at

1010
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,680
and so you have to intuit

1011
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,320
So what else does the mind

1012
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,060
really make you decide you need?

1013
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:28,620
Clothes

1014
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,260
Clothes?

1015
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:29,860
Hey, actually

1016
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,100
And again, if the mind

1017
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:31,860
is the seat of the soul

1018
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,940
then all those big corporations

1019
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,720
trying to get you

1020
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,800
and get that mind share

1021
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,480
that we talked about

1022
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,020
are actually after your soul

1023
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,440
Trying to redefine

1024
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,340
who you think you are

1025
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,240
so you give them money

1026
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,620
It's amazing how people

1027
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,520
just sort of

1028
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,840
intuitively understand

1029
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,840
that companies

1030
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,100
are after their brains

1031
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,700
and that they don't seem to mind

1032
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,900
but when you mention the soul

1033
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,900
they pucker up

1034
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:50,600
That's why we've got

1035
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,300
the invisible monster

1036
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,880
He's the great Connie in the sky

1037
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,880
One is moral

1038
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,920
One is not

1039
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,260
It's super ego

1040
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,340
And it bought

1041
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,380
Well, it bought

1042
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,880
Now that we're in Hawaii

1043
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,980
I hope you don't

1044
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,880
choose to embarrass me here too

1045
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,880
Come on, get out of my way

1046
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,740
I need to get laid

1047
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,140
That wasn't funny

1048
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,440
at the airport either

1049
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,300
Now, are you going to sit down

1050
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,180
and enjoy the luau or not?

1051
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,560
You know very well

1052
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,500
that I can't sit

1053
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,880
Are you making fun of me?

1054
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,080
Don't put a chip

1055
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,060
on your shoulder there

1056
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,360
Get it?

1057
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,020
Chip robot

1058
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,420
I think you are making fun of me

1059
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,420
Of course I'm not

1060
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,220
I'm just happy

1061
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,920
I want the pig

1062
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,660
The pig is for everyone, idbot

1063
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,600
I will not share

1064
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,500
The pig will be mine

1065
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,820
I'm cutting you off

1066
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,780
I'm sick of this

1067
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,780
I can't take you anywhere

1068
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,180
Move these damn foreigners

1069
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,040
out of my way

1070
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,460
Move, move, move

1071
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,260
Now, idbot

1072
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,420
This is a foreign country

1073
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,820
We're all foreigners here

1074
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,120
No, no, no, no, no, no

1075
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:41,460
Idbot

1076
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

1077
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:42,720
That's it

1078
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,000
This is the last time

1079
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:44,660
You

1080
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,800
No, no, no, no, no, no

1081
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:45,820
Me

1082
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,500
Edge of the volcano

1083
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:47,300
Now

1084
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,940
All right, super ego

1085
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,760
Have it your way

1086
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,200
Just carry me safely

1087
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,300
to the lip of the volcano

1088
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,920
Meanwhile, at the top of the volcano

1089
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,700
Ah, you've had this coming for years

1090
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,800
Mom always liked you better

1091
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,720
I'm sick of this

1092
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,160
Sonification of your id

1093
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,200
You made me vomit all over my prom date

1094
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,380
You turned me into a cybernetic organism

1095
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,320
You made me gain fifty pounds

1096
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,300
when I broke my leg and started smoking pot

1097
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,280
Ah, ah, you never lubricate me properly

1098
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,440
I built you

1099
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,380
You have a point

1100
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,020
I do

1101
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,320
Let's not fight

1102
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:17,980
No

1103
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,460
Ah, I tricked you

1104
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,540
Oh, ahhhhhh

1105
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,740
One is moral

1106
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,760
One is not

1107
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,240
It's super ego and it's bot

1108
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,440
Tonight the city is full of morgues

1109
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,760
And all the toilets are overflowing

1110
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,320
There's shopping malls coming out of the walls

1111
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,820
As we walk out among the manure

1112
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,100
That's why

1113
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,740
I'm super ego and it's bot

1114
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,100
But the ladies at the counter

1115
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:03,100


1116
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,560
We gon' pay no mind

1117
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,060
away

1118
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,700
I said you ain't gonna bring the sweet

1119
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:16,780
But no Facet

1120
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,720
Give the finger to the rock and roll singer

1121
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,160
As he's dancing upon your paycheck

1122

Yeah, it looked pretty cool

1214
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,280
I had a habit to do it midnight

1215
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,200
And I watched it drag me by

1216
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,600
Knowing who's the guy

1217
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't know, it's nothing more than that

1218
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,940
Now I know you won't make me lose

1219
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,280
I know you won't, but you'll

1220
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,180
So much to lose

1221
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,620
We've been so far

1222
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,960
You've got a thing for me to lose

1223
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,720
So take my hand for a walk

1224
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,260
She's my belief in my mind

1225
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,160
We were down to ground

1226
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,760

1227
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,120

There's a child in you

1229
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,900
And a sister in you

1230
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,660
You've got to be the son

1231
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:17,020

1233
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,020
Hey, hey, hey, you know everything

1234
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,940
Now there is new

1235
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,800
Now here's my gun, oh

1236
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,280
Take it home, we've got a phone

1237
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,960

Who's gonna give you what you need

1239
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,300
You're worth it, definitely

1240
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,720
You've got to make this city big

1241
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,140
I don't know who you are, but you

1242
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,620
I know your world is huge

1243
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,500
We've got so much to do

1244
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,720
We've got so much to do

1245
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,520
So take my hand

1246
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,940
So take my hand

1247
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000

I believe in life

1258
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,900
You can come and see the back of the earth

1259
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,300
If you're the girl

1260
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,940
I believe in life

1261
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,980
You've got to raise something up your arm

1262
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,940
Let us into your mind

1263
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,200

1264
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,100
It's a job for you

1265
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,040
You're the sister you've got

1266
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,440
For me

1267
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,420
You've got nothing to sign

1268
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,660
Don't get a baseless

1269
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,080
You've got nothing for me

1270
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:52,780
For our parents

1271
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:55,740
And you've got nothing for me

1272
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,120
A rainy day

1273
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,640
I could die seasons away

1274
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:06,440
But you bought some of the clothes

1275
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:06,440

Until they found а rainbow

1279
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,000
You're sweet and kind

1280
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,860
You've got something to say

1281
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,980

1287

00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:18,920


1292
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,420
Is that too far out?

1293
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,320
Not for me, it's not.

1294
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,380
One is moral, one is not.

1295
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,760
It's super ego and it bought.
