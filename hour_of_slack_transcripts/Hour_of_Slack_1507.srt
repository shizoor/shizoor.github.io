1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,780
Bob's Bob.

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,200
Bob!

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,280
What's the trouble, Bob?

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,240
It's Bob.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,880
That's Bob over there.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,060
He's dead.

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,460
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,900
Bob, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,940
Bob says it's the last one for him.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,040
He didn't say that.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,020
Bob said we had to get in.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
He didn't say that.

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,140
Bob said, why don't you ask Bob that?

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,620
To his face.

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,700
We must know what we want.

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,700
We must want what we need.

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,700
And what we need is duty now for the future.

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,760
Duty now for the future, dear friends.

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,940
And the future is here.

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,200
Princess Wee and I walked in to Charleston's show ending,

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,140
and I suddenly realized that they had

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,640
completely replaced the mixing board,

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,920
the whole system that the DJ operates,

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,500
had been completely replaced.

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,420
I guess I missed a memo.

26
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,020
Praise Bob!

27
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,600
It's the most futuristic thing.

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,860
The chairs are spinning around.

29
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,540
The whole studio revolves around this.

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,340
It's on top of a giant spire,

31
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,280
a kind of tower like they have in Seattle and Dallas.

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
And they've changed everything.

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,760
It's the most Jetsons-looking thing I've ever seen.

34
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,000
And all I could think was,

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,960
it's a darn good thing that we were planning

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,940
to just play a pre-recorded show tonight.

37
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,160
You know in that movie 2001,

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,740
that black monolith thing,

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,660
that big black square domino-looking thing

40
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,180
that appears in front of the ape men,

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,860
and then on the moon,

42
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,020
and then at the end going,

43
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,520
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

44
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,200
Well, I have one of those in my tummy today.

45
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,540
So I'm going to take a break and rest up

46
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,500
and play this pre-recorded episode of somebody else's show.

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,560
It was their idea, too.

48
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,760
Last week, I was interviewed for this podcast

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,760
called Project Archivist,

50
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,760
which you can find at projectarchivist.com.

51
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,100
And since it wasn't a subgenius show,

52
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,500
I actually explained the church of the subgenius.

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,300
And Bob Dobbs and everything else that's super important.

54
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,440
And so it's completely different from the normal hour of Slack.

55
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,920
In this one, I'm talking the whole time

56
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,520
and without Lonesome Cowboy Dave or Princess Wee.

57
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,880
And also, I'm on the phone, so the sound is a bit rough.

58
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,480
It's not caused by your speakers or this station.

59
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,680
Anyway, we'll play some Lemurian collagerie first,

60
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,500
and then we'll play some Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

61
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,380
It's going to be 48 minutes of the Project Archivist show.

62
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,660
Price Bob.

63
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,120
You love TV. You love TV.

64
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,360
From top athletes that call in sick

65
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,040
with a sore knee, shoulder, wrist, foot, or elbow.

66
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,060
That's how you stay on top. That's how you become a champion.

67
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,520
My feet ache every day.

68
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,700
Spreading cancer cells.

69
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,500
You love TV.

70
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,080
Were you able to perceive the truth?

71
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,640
Please.

72
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,540
No way. We made it up.

73
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,540
You love TV.

74
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,140
From PR News in Washington,

75
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,360
I'm going to continue carving trees and damaging buildings.

76
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,820
Meanwhile, Pakistani officials say the U.S.

77
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,280
captured trees in Afghanistan last year.

78
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,460
The BBC reports the U.S. is returning trees to Pakistan.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,040
The American said today that the U.S. had first Afghanistan and Pakistan

80
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,840
killed by the Afghanistan army on the Pakistan border last year.

81
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,300
Then Afghanistan and Afghanistan came into the hands of the U.S.

82
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,340
drone strike, receiving humane treatment.

83
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,400
Typhoon Hagupet is across the Philippines.

84
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,260
Typhoon Hagupet woke up with relief.

85
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,980
Hagupet continues to make powerful winds and intense rain,

86
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,300
landslides and wet floods.

87
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,060
The typhoon is expected to make PR News in Manila.

88
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,800
Russia is praising French President Vladimir Putin.

89
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,800
PR's report reports.

90
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,160
Russia has been increasingly close to being canceled.

91
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,040
Moscow denies PR News.

92
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,920
This is.

93
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,980
PR.

94
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,940
PR News.

95
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,460
Ish.

96
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,780
The U.S. military has sent six trees to Uruguay

97
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,340
to continue treating Ebola patients.

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,880
Memorial ceremonies are being held

99
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,480
commemorating Japan's attack on PR News in Washington.

100
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,020
Hey, uh, Fry, do we have any pot?

101
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,220
No, we don't.

102
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,440
Marijuana is illegal.

103
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,640
What about nitrous, man?

104
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,320
Shut up, Er.

105
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,780
Fry, man, we're full of religion now.

106
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,160
Everyone, please, bow your heads and pretend to be serious.

107
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,160
Do it or I'll bow.

108
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,880
I'll bow for ya.

109
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,480
You have deeply offended us and our God, and our God is a God of vengeance and horror.

110
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,060
And action!

111
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,120
Our God is an Indian that turns into a wolf.

112
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,520
Man, that's a wolfin', man.

113
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,260
Well, the wolfin' will come for you with his razor.

114
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,840
Whether you drive a shiny new 1952 model or a pre-war jalopy,

115
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,200
remember that death is the biggest killer on the highways.

116
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,060
This year, 500 lives can be saved and 15,000 killed,

117
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,600
and 500,000 injured.

118
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,280
It'll be curtains for you.

119
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,340
When people say you're bright, they mean you've been used drugs.

120
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,480
They mean you've changed their brain.

121
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,360
They mean you've wasted your brain.

122
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,280
For information, call 6666.

123
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,760
Hey, everybody, welcome back.

124
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,280
This is an unusual episode.

125
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:55,520
And on this show, we have never shied away from covering religion, spirituality, all those kinds of things.

126
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,040
My personal favorite thing about this show is that it's a lot of fun.

127
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,720
And my personal belief on religion is I don't really care what a person believes in

128
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,340
as long as you're not hurting anybody else or imposing your beliefs onto somebody else.

129
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,480
How does the joke go?

130
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,140
Religion is kind of like having a penis.

131
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,100
It's fine until you start waving around in front of people or something like that.

132
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,660
Is that how?

133
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:13,900
Yeah.

134
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,800
Yeah, that's what it is.

135
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,420
Yeah.

136
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,660
So what we've decided to do on this show is we've decided to put together a show based on alternative religions.

137
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,260
Everybody that you're going to hear on this show,

138
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,620
for lack of a better term, is quote unquote in on the joke.

139
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,320
And it went through various forms because we were going to –

140
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,300
I almost interviewed a group of people that were into Odinism

141
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,100
and that actually believed in Odin, Thor and all those things.

142
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,500
But again, those people actually were into what they were believing.

143
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,260
And a lot of them also turned out to be white supremacists.

144
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,300
Fortunately, they didn't –

145
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,280
Yeah, that was awkward.

146
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,240
So fortunately, they didn't get back in touch with us.

147
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,360
They didn't get back in touch with me.

148
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,980
Then I thought about contacting the Raelians.

149
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,320
But again, you have a situation where as strange and as kooky as those people can be,

150
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,080
they actually believe in what they're talking about like hardcore.

151
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:15,620
So from there, the scope narrowed down and narrowed down and narrowed down to the point where on this episode,

152
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:23,100
we have Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius, which I call subgeni,

153
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,980
which he very quickly corrects me in the interview.

154
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,620
We also talked to Reverend Gary from the Church of the Later Day Dude.

155
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:36,420
Then we talked to Fred or Isla of Coincidence Control Network fame

156
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,800
who has managed to set up a religion based on Batman.

157
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,680
But we will get to that.

158
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,620
Batman.

159
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,980
So the first interview we do is with Reverend Ivan Stang, great guy.

160
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,960
This has probably been one of the most difficult interviews that I think we've had.

161
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:54,960


162
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,880
Despite my best efforts to keep this on track and keep it as a hard, serious interview,

163
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,640
it just, well, you'll see.

164
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,160
But it's funny.

165
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,360
I mean, it's been a little while since we've done a show where we've let our hair down and just had a good laugh and had a good time.

166
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,460
We're about due for that.

167
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,500
If you're a new listener to the show and you've caught all of our recent episodes, they've been fairly serious.

168
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,300
Yes, we've cracked jokes and things like that.

169
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,620
But every once in a while here, we like to let our hair down.

170
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,780
And just have a good time.

171
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,940
The odd part is neither myself nor Lobo really have any hair.

172
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,000
Hey, I shave mine.

173
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,080
I am balding and shave mine off and Lobo just shaves his off.

174
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,040
So this is going to be the show where we just sit back and have a good time and have a good laugh.

175
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,760
So we're going to move on with our first interview, which is going to be with Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.

176
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,540
Praise Bob.

177
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,220
Praise Bob.

178
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,540
All right.

179
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:15,340
With us tonight, we are graced with the fine presence of Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius.

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,140
Welcome to Project Archivist, Reverend Stang.

181
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,220
Say that again?

182
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,680
I said welcome to Project Archivist, Reverend Stang.

183
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,880
Oh, oh, oh, right.

184
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,440
I thought you were asking me to.

185
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,180
To project something and archive it.

186
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,800
No, that's not it.

187
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,820
Right.

188
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,660
Thank you.

189
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,160
Thank you.

190
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,440
Everything's fine.

191
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,000
What are we doing right now?

192
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:32,980
Recording.

193
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,640
Everything's going fine.

194
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,360
No trouble.

195
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:42,440
Everything is, yep, we're, with the blessings of Bob, we are now into the, we're sending this out into the ether for people to hear.

196
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,580
So where do we begin?

197
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:51,520
You are the, one of the ringmasters of the Church of the Subgeni, of which I am a big fan.

198
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,300
Well, no, no.

199
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,820
Actually, you have that wrong.

200
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,860
I'm not, I'm sorry, you guys.

201
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,060
You, you got, you got a hold of the shopping room clerk, the mail boy.

202
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,560
I'm the janitor.

203
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,140
Okay.

204
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,460
And the clerk.

205
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,260
Seriously.

206
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,300
I mean, I'm, I'm the guy that does the dirty work for you.

207
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,060
And it's the Church of the Subgenius.

208
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,620
Yes.

209
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,620
Subgeni is plural of subgenius, although we just as often say subgenius.

210
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,480
Well, is there a lower form of subgenius than subgenius?

211
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,620
Well, the ultimate subgenius is J.R.

212
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,240
Bob Dobbs, our guru, the, the saint of sales, the slack master.

213
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,500
He's both our leader and our logo, you might say.

214
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,100
I wish our listeners could see a picture of Bob and maybe that will, to some people that explains everything.

215
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,680
They see Bob's face.

216
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,520
He's a smiling, bored, cleaver looking guy with a pipe.

217
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,520
You feel like you've seen him a million times and you have because he's, he used to model for ads.

218
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,900
And magazines back in the old days, the square guy with the pipe with an insane grin.

219
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,740
And in some cases people go, well, that's their God.

220
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,620
Praise Bob.

221
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm behind him all the way.

222
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,740
And other people go, well, that's just crazy.

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,980
He's just some guy.

224
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,560
Why, why would they believe a religion?

225
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,260
Because it's printed in a book.

226
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,400
Absolutely.

227
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,960
Good question.

228
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,940
Oh yes.

229
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,420
Yes.

230
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,220
You're preaching to the choir here.

231
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,680
Feel free to go right ahead.

232
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:21,980
Yeah.

233
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:37,080
So we're, um, so I'm, I'm, uh, I am the person that answers the phone here most of the time, but, uh, uh, it's the church of subgenius has been around for a long time.

234
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,680
Back in the late seventies, uh, my friend, Dr.

235
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:51,960
Philo Drummond and I kind of, well, basically we were in Dallas, Texas and the Bible belt in the eighties and they were telling us we were all going to go to heaven.

236
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:51,960


237
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,600
So what chance did we have?

238
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,960
I mean, what choice did we have, but to start our own religion?

239
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,460
Uh, what would, then we found out that Bob had already started the perfect religion.

240
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:09,700
And so we ended up working for him, although he seems to be kind of an absent guru.

241
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,400
Well, aren't all of the great ones.

242
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,640
We haven't seen him in quite a long time.

243
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:21,480
Although my office is covered with pictures of his face and products with pictures of his face.

244
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:21,940
Because, uh, I don't know.

245
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:34,220
I mean, this is where this is a, uh, uh, church, uh, not only that's out to save your soul, but to save us a whole lot of your money or so that we can give it to Bob.

246
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,560
Of course, you know, he needs it.

247
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,720
Absolutely.

248
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,420
But that's, you know, that's how these things work.

249
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:51,940
We borrowed from, we borrowed from the greatest religions from Jimmy Swagger and the televangelists to the, the major, the major, the major, the major, the major.

250
00:12:51,940 --> 00:13:02,160
The, the, uh, the great, the great recent, the, the Scientologist, and of course the more established things like woke Anus and Oh Dan ism, Christianity, Hinduism, so forth.

251
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,540
Mm.

252
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:10,300
You know, we, we pick and it's kind of like going through your, your dad's paperbacks, you know, you're looking for the good parts.

253
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,640
I was thinking of porn collection myself, but go ahead.

254
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,960
Yeah, well that's what I, that's the kind of paperbacks.

255
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,460
Yeah.

256
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,960
Special drawer that we found.

257
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,920
The, the, the really good parts.

258
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,420
of all these ancient religions

259
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,800
and with Bob's directions

260
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,060
kind of stitched them together

261
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,940
into sort of a Frankenstein's monster

262
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,980
composed of parts of dead religions.

263
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,200
Then needless to say,

264
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,020
you know, when you,

265
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,320
we all know what happens

266
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,780
when you create a monster,

267
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,940
it always kind of turns against its creator

268
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,480
and hilarity ensues.

269
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,080
So for 35 years,

270
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,420
we've been slaves to J.R. Bob Dobbs

271
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,880
at this point.

272
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,160
I doubt if we have much choice,

273
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,280
but we wouldn't have it any other way.

274
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,040
Yes.

275
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,480
Well, let me ask you, if I may,

276
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,820
tell us the story of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

277
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,980
I mean, I am aware that he is

278
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,260
the world's greatest salesman,

279
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,140
but it is to my understanding and knowledge

280
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,680
that he had contact with extraterrestrials as well.

281
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,180
Is that correct?

282
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,960
Yeah, that didn't start

283
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,160
until he was well-established

284
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,460
in his sales career,

285
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,320
which was uncannily lucky.

286
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,740
And let's just say the aliens noticed

287
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,700
there was this vortex in the luck plane.

288
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,100
There was something happening

289
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,440
on this little planet

290
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,520
that was not normal at all.

291
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,460
And let's go back in time

292
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,820
about 40 billion years.

293
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,440
And there's this alien,

294
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,160
space monster that goes by the name Jehovah

295
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,680
and various other names.

296
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,000
Jehovah One,

297
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,260
he's just another alien space monster,

298
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,200
but he's meddled with Earth history

299
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,120
for a long time.

300
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,760
And we've seen the dreadful results

301
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,440
all over the planet.

302
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,040
But Jehovah One,

303
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,300
a single Bob out in the 50s

304
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,220
and fed him a bunch of visions

305
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,400
of the end of the world,

306
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,220
of course,

307
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,440
very dramatic predictions.

308
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,920
As one does, yes.

309
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,780
The world would end on July 5th, 1998,

310
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,340
when the men from Planet X

311
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,800
would come down from space

312
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,340
and rescue the dues-paying subgeniuses

313
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,640
who would then be given

314
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,560
giant planet-sized spaceships

315
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,600
and anything they ever wanted,

316
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
such as revenge on anyone

317
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,920
who ever picked on them.

318
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,280
I'm more interested in collecting things

319
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,560
like the Grand Canyon

320
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,860
than getting revenge

321
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,320
on my fifth-grade teacher,

322
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,340
although she's on

323
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,840
the list.

324
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,080
But the problem, of course,

325
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,120
with prophecy is,

326
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,060
you know,

327
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,960
you stand around

328
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,160
and wait for the saucers

329
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,520
on July 5th, 1998,

330
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,500
and by golly,

331
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,320
they don't show up.

332
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,440
So you do it again in 99.

333
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,900
And we actually do this.

334
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,580
Every year,

335
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,340
there's subgeniuses

336
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,320
all over the world outside,

337
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,700
so they don't bump their heads

338
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,300
on the ceiling

339
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,440
when they're ruptured up.

340
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,260
They stand around outside

341
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,480
at 7 a.m.,

342
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,840
this ungodly hour,

343
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,840
and the day after,

344
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,180
you know,

345
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,100
with a hangover on July 5th,

346
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,780
waiting for the aliens.

347
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,940
And because,

348
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,540
you know, sure,

349
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,060
we're disappointed each year,

350
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,200
but are we going to let

351
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,660
the Jehovah's Witnesses

352
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,680
out-cook us?

353
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,380
I ask you,

354
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,580
and the answer is nay.

355
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,120
Nay.

356
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,360
So we,

357
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,660
it's actually really,

358
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,240
and some of us gather

359
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,020
in a big campground every year.

360
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,320
It's been in southern Ohio

361
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,360
this decade.

362
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,340
And we deliberately

363
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,260
choose,

364
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,320


365
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,320


366
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,660
we choose a clothing optional

367
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,320
kind of hippie pagan campground.

368
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,120
Not that we're pagans

369
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,540
or all hippies or anything,

370
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,280
but we enjoy...

371
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,540
Well, pagan implies godlessness.

372
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,900
We can throw a party

373
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,740
just as well as the pagans

374
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,460
and hippies can,

375
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,860
and we use some of the same equipment,

376
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,660
including nudity,

377
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,100
although it's usually

378
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,200
just the wrong people

379
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,320
that are getting baptized,

380
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,940
doing the naked baptism.

381
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,440
So we basically,

382
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,900
after 35 years,

383
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,360
the Church of the Subgenius

384
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,240
has actually grown

385
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,360
to be bigger

386
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,980
than quite a few cults

387
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,300
that have gotten a lot more news,

388
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,340
were much bigger than Jonestown.

389
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,840
If we committed all suicide

390
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,680
all at once,

391
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,100
we would way outnumber them,

392
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,920
and certainly Heaven's Gate.

393
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,880
Those guys were such amateurs.

394
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,220
Boy, did I get a lot of worried.

395
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,800
You know,

396
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,840
Subgenius has got a lot of worried

397
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,440
phone calls from people

398
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,420
the morning of the week.

399
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,420


400
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,420


401
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,420


402
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:48,580
They're like,

403
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,000
the Heaven's Gate suicide.

404
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,480
It's like, what?

405
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,140
Flying saucer believers?

406
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,940
And they killed themselves?

407
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,000
They get on board?

408
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,180
Oh, no, that sounds like

409
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,360
subgeniuses to me.

410
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,380
And none of those people

411
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,060
were even marked.

412
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,660
I have a question I'd like to ask you

413
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:02,980
real quick.

414
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,860
If I may cut you off

415
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,660
for just a second.

416
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,800
One of our listeners

417
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,100
has asked me to ask you,

418
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,560
did Bob Dobbs actually

419
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,220
sell the Earth to the Exus?

420
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,980
And if so,

421
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,500
how much money did Bob

422
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,700
make from that sale?

423
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,320
Or is that just a vicious...

424
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,420
Well, yeah,

425
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,480
it's a yes and no.

426
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,620
Yes and no.

427
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,780
The deal is closed.

428
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,140
Obviously,

429
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,700
it isn't 1998 yet.

430
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,860
They've lied to us

431
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,340
about calendars and time.

432
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,220
We're not even sure

433
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,420
what planet this is,

434
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,820
much less which year.

435
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,820
Obviously,

436
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,460
because if Bob said

437
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,980
the aliens would be here in 1998,

438
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,720
it obviously isn't 1998 yet.

439
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,120
But the deal is closed.

440
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,540
We have faith in Bob,

441
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,100
the FIB, we call it.

442
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,600
We all hold up the FIB.

443
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
And he...

444
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,420
It's not a deal

445
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,420


446
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,420


447
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,420


448
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,420


449
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,420


450
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,740
in money.

451
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,180
The aliens don't care

452
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,880
about human notes

453
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,180
of exchange, currency.

454
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,360
They collect what we might call

455
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,640
anguish and pain or soul.

456
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,960
To an alien,

457
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,320
the extracted soul of a human

458
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,160
removed from a subgenius

459
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,140
by Bob and kept in containers

460
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,420
that happen to be

461
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,780
in my basement right now.

462
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,620
Those are what the aliens...

463
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,200
That's like a kind of a drug

464
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,980
for the aliens.

465
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,780
They'll huff,

466
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:18,420
they'll puff,

467
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:18,420


468
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:18,940
they'll puff these

469
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,560
like bath salts.

470
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,260
If you ever wonder

471
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,540
what happened to the dinosaurs,

472
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,660
something like this occurred

473
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
back then

474
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,480
at the end of the Cretaceous.

475
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,700
So we're hoping it works out

476
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,780
a little bit more controlled

477
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,360
this time.

478
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,280
Of course, we've got Bob

479
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,420
to help broker the deal.

480
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,920
Of course, we need

481
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,300
as many subgenius ministers

482
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,720
as we possibly can.

483
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,340
We're trying to make sure

484
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,900
the world ends correctly

485
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,100
so that the...

486
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,800
deserving, the pinks,

487
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,220
what we...

488
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,620
You know, any religion,

489
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,780
it's us versus them.

490
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,020
We refer to all the unsaved

491
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,340
as the humans,

492
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,440
the pink boys,

493
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,200
the mediocritans,

494
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,420
the Barbies and Kins,

495
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,520
the Gloriffs.

496
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,720
We have as many nasty names

497
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,980
for us as they do for us.

498
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,660
No, wait.

499
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,000
As many nasty names for them

500
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,800
as they do for us.

501
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,820
We also have nasty names for us.

502
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,360
Yes.

503
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,540
And it's really fun

504
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,560
to watch the Bobbies

505
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,220
talk about who else is a Bobby.

506
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,360
So that's bad.

507
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,580
That's like being a Mooney.

508
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,180
See, you're too into Bob.

509
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,480
And so it's amusing

510
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,840
to sit in our high thrones

511
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,160
in the hierarchy

512
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,380
and watch the Bobbies

513
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,720
call each other Bobby.

514
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,900
So you do have a separation

515
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,880
within your church

516
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,820
is what you're saying then?

517
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,860
Or is this common?

518
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,180
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

519
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,160
Yeah, there's...

520
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,300
We don't have a list.

521
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,340
We don't have a list.

522
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:45,420
We don't have a list

523
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,580
of who is in the hierarchy,

524
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,940
but you can kind of tell

525
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,560
who's not.

526
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,340
It's mostly nepotistic

527
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,040
and based on seniority.

528
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,280
Philo was the first

529
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,360
of Bob's called ministers,

530
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,860
and I was the second one.

531
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,240
Of course, I was the sucker

532
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,400
who did most of the work.

533
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,320
That's fine, though.

534
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,180
Philo gets invited

535
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,940
to the good parties.

536
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,540
Yeah.

537
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,080
At the Playboy Mansion,

538
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,120
stuff like that.

539
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,240
Yeah, but that place

540
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,380
isn't that great anymore,

541
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,340
so you're not missing much there,

542
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:21,820
I would assume.

543
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,500
Oh, I didn't even know.

544
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,240
Anyway,

545
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,340
back in the 80s,

546
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,420
strangely enough,

547
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,640
the people used to draw

548
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,760
underground comics like Zap,

549
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,060
including some of the well-known ones

550
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,140
like Robert Crumb

551
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,160
and Gilbert Shelton.

552
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,180
Robert Williams,

553
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,820
and especially Paul Mavridis

554
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,800
and Jay Kinney

555
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,780
got interested in the church,

556
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,720
and they felt

557
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,000
that we were right about Bob,

558
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,200
and Bob was the answer.

559
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,200
Well, maybe not the answer,

560
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,500
but neither is anything else.

561
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,140
Yes.

562
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,100
So we had a really nice boost,

563
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,480
seriously,

564
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,280
in the world of publishing

565
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
because of having

566
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,140
a lot of people

567
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,140


568
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,140


569
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,140


570
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,140


571
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,140


572
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,140


573
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,140


574
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,140


575
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,140


576
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,140


577
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,260
among the underground cartoonists.

578
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,800
They really helped give us

579
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,000
a boot up,

580
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,320
and we managed to get it out in 1983,

581
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,140
which, strangely enough,

582
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,800
that first book is still in print.

583
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,660
The Book of the Subgenius,

584
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,940
it's an e-book,

585
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,440
although I don't recommend the e-book.

586
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,520
The layout isn't anything like the real book.

587
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,080
And we did several other books since then,

588
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,020
and there's three current

589
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,900
subgenius radio shows

590
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,600
on radio,

591
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,140
and we did a lot of them.

592
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,140


593
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,140


594
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,140


595
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,460
Radio stations.

596
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,340
I mean,

597
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,320
college,

598
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
mostly college

599
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,480
and independent stations.

600
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,560
My show,

601
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,360
The Hour of Slack,

602
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:50,960
is on

603
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,620
the Cleveland State University station.

604
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,200
But I've been on for 30 years.

605
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,360
Yeah, it's also available

606
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,120
for podcasts.

607
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,200
And with...

608
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,140
It actually gets to be

609
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,840
a bit of a chore

610
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,380
every single week

611
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,980
after 30 years.

612
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,120
We're on episode number

613
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,920
1,506, I think.

614
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,420
Holy crap.

615
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,500
And, yeah,

616
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,100
not many of those

617
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,020
have been reruns.

618
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,200
It's...

619
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,220
There must...

620
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,500
And we try to use

621
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,220
material that's only by

622
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,240
subgeniuses.

623
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,780
We might use

624
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,120
old monster movie music

625
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,880
in the background

626
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,140
when we're ranting

627
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,120
or spouting

628
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,700
or whatever,

629
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,500
or preaching.

630
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,560
But most of the time,

631
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,860
my show is original.

632
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,080
There's another show,

633
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,160
Reverend Susie the Fluesy

634
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,980
does Bob Slack

635
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,900
on FunHeads.

636
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,360
Out of WREK

637
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,180
at Georgia Tech

638
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,820
in Atlanta.

639
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,320
And she's been on

640
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,180
for 25 years.

641
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,240
And her show is mostly

642
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,900
collage of found audio

643
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,020
and the best of bad music.

644
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,580
Then there's the

645
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,560
Puzzling Evidence show

646
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,780
at KPFA Berkeley,

647
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,920
which is one of the oldest

648
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,860
underground stations,

649
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,020
although it is a broadcast,

650
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,400
big broadcast station.

651
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,340
And they've been doing it

652
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,240
since 1982.

653
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,900
And it's...

654
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,360
It's just pure freeform

655
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,900
improv madness,

656
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,080
the Puzzling Evidence show.

657
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,000
So we've done everything

658
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,420
that doesn't make money.

659
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,460
We've never had a TV show

660
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,420
or a movie

661
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,960
or a really commercial show.

662
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,380
You do have a role-playing game

663
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:29,780
out there.

664
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,420
Yeah, we...

665
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,200
Steve Jackson Games

666
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,120
and us

667
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,340
did an extension

668
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,940
for his Illuminati

669
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,500
New World Order game.

670
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,860
Back in the 95.

671
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,180
And that was a lot of...

672
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,940
That was a lot of fun.

673
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,820
That was a project

674
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,100
that I didn't write

675
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,620
but helped to illustrate.

676
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,440
Normally, it's the other way around.

677
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,620
I can't draw.

678
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,020
But I did learn how to use...

679
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,980
I did learn how to use

680
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,960
Bryson Poser

681
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,040
for a while there.

682
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,260
All right.

683
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:02,660
Well...

684
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,320
Oh, God.

685
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,820
Let me ask you this.

686
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,220
Let's say that I am

687
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,660
a lost degenerate soul

688
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,020
who is without slack,

689
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,960
which we will get to

690
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,420
in a minute.

691
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,420
What would reasons

692
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,500
would there be for me

693
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,520
to come and join

694
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,960
the Church of the Subgenius?

695
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,780
Well, right off the bat,

696
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,900
there wouldn't be

697
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,940
any good reason

698
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,360
because by definition,

699
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,660
this is an organization

700
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,880
for non-joiners.

701
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,840
So, it's like a club

702
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,000
for non-conformists.

703
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,540
So, obviously,

704
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,680
you would never want

705
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,020
to be a member of a club

706
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,760
that would have you

707
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,640
as a member.

708
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,480
Some people get the wrong idea

709
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,540
and think it has something

710
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,820
to do with being a genius.

711
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,840
No, just the opposite.

712
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,580
We're saying that intelligence

713
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,760
has been mystified.

714
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,860
We're talking about

715
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,580
common sense,

716
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,320
sense of humor,

717
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,200
and dollars and cents.

718
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,820
But the main thing

719
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,960
that you could actually

720
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,740
get out of it

721
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,760
in real life

722
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,740
would be

723
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,700
some swinging new friends,

724
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,300
including ones

725
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,140
of possibly

726
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,900
the desired sex.

727
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:01,380
So...

728
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,000
I'll be the first to admit

729
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,080
that for a long time

730
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,920
in the 80s,

731
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,980
the church looked like

732
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,340
kind of a sausage fest.

733
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,360
Like,

734
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:11,640
like,

735
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,320
like a Devo concert

736
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,420
or a Dwar concert.

737
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,740
But,

738
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,440
if you go to a Devo concert now

739
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,880
or comic book conventions,

740
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,140
it used to be all guys.

741
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,300
The comic book conventions.

742
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,640
You go to a comic convention

743
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,140
or a game convention now,

744
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,200
it's wonderful girl watching,

745
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,060
if nothing else.

746
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,440
Yes.

747
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,340
The same thing happened

748
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,200
with the church of the subgenius.

749
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:32,480
You know,

750
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:32,840
it's like,

751
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,220
build it and they will come.

752
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,560
We started acting like

753
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,640
it was a sex cult.

754
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:39,620
And,

755
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,700
although most of us

756
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,040
old timers who started it

757
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,800
are too square

758
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,080
to pick up on it,

759
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,640
the younger generation

760
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,060
used it for just that.

761
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,080
And,

762
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,920
we've had,

763
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,720
I keep,

764
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,480
I've lost count

765
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,180
of how many people

766
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,040
that I've personally married.

767
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,480
I mean,

768
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,340
to each other,

769
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,660
not me marrying them.

770
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:57,920
But,

771
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,320
I was,

772
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,220
I was the minister

773
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,060
on lots of,

774
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,180
you know,

775
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,720
legitimate weddings

776
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,360
and they had kids.

777
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,700
Some of them had divorces

778
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,560
and then married other,

779
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,320
you know,

780
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,920
divorced geniuses.

781
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,180
We,

782
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
we've matched up

783
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,060
quite a few subgeniuses

784
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,000
with pagans.

785
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,220
But,

786
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:16,480
you know,

787
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:16,720
they're,

788
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,020
they're,

789
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,960
they're from different

790
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,060
religious backgrounds

791
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,400
in that the pagans

792
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,180
have one.

793
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:22,740
But,

794
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,680
we,

795
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,340
they do,

796
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:25,960
like I say,

797
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,440
the pagans know how to party.

798
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,080
And,

799
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,000
and I,

800
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,200
I actually am involved

801
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,080
in some of the big

802
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,340
pagan festivals too.

803
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,540
I make fun of them,

804
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,000
but the cool pagans

805
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,840
love that.

806
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,500
You know,

807
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,560
they have a sense of humor

808
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
and they love to piss off

809
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,240
the fundamentalist pagans.

810
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:41,820
And,

811
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,740
believe me,

812
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,200
they're,

813
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,240
those people are like

814
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,640
Baptists or Methodists

815
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:45,860
or,

816
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,900
you know,

817
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,240
Muslims,

818
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,300
Islamics,

819
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,080
radicals,

820
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,260
you know.

821
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,280
Is there fundamentalist

822
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,040
subgeniuses as well though?

823
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,680
Yeah,

824
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,180
but we,

825
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,620
they don't last very long

826
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,800
because everybody else

827
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,220
ends up,

828
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,980
sooner or later

829
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,620
they realize

830
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
everybody's laughing at me.

831
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,800
Wait a minute.

832
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,540
You mean,

833
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,660
I'm what they're making fun of?

834
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,080
Yes.

835
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,700
The believer.

836
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,220
You have to believe

837
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,480
in,

838
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:11,620
in Bob

839
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,140
and not believe in him

840
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,940
at the same time.

841
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,200
It's,

842
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,180
it's this constant

843
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,580
tension

844
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,940
and dichotomy

845
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,740
where you're,

846
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,480
you know,

847
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,520
you may have Bob

848
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,180
tattooed on your arm,

849
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,680
but at the same time

850
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,640
you feel compelled

851
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,160
to like

852
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,960
throw a picture

853
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,480
of him down

854
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,820
and just

855
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,000
pee on it

856
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,500
now and then.

857
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:30,780
So,

858
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,320
sometimes we do that.

859
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,700
We pee,

860
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,000
we'll pee on Bob's head,

861
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,380
you know,

862
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,420
to prove that we're not

863
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,060
fanatics.

864
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,180
You said,

865
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,380
you laugh like this

866
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:42,880
is a joke,

867
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,980
but I'm talking about

868
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,600
things that happen

869
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,700
in real life.

870
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,580
It's funny

871
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,440
because it's true.

872
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,420
There was,

873
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,520
I swear to God,

874
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,780
at one of our stage shows

875
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,820
this homeless woman

876
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,760
got up on stage

877
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,440
and just

878
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,880
pulled down her drawers

879
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,820
and started peeing

880
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,940
on the poster of Bob.

881
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,680
I later found out

882
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,820
somebody had paid her

883
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,620
to do that.

884
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,660
But,

885
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,280
that was a proud moment.

886
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,060
Yeah.

887
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,060
We've had some

888
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,900
real freakish.

889
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,640
We don't do a lot

890
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,500
of live shows.

891
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,180


892
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:11,780
the,

893
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,200
the,

894
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,500
we even tried to tour

895
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,120
with Glar

896
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,640
at their invitation,

897
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,200
but even that

898
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,100
fan group

899
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:19,720
is not ready

900
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,760
for spoken word.

901
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,240
No matter

902
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,100
how much porno

903
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,820
you have projected

904
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,420
behind the creature.

905
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,360
We were always

906
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,240
very multimedia.

907
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,080
Okay.

908
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,080
We've tried to,

909
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,780
it was back

910
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,380
in the old days

911
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,440
we projected films.

912
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,940
I'm going to ask you

913
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,520
to explain

914
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,540
the unexplainable

915
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,740
and I'm going to ask you

916
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,160
to explain

917
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,940
the process of Slack.

918
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,120
What is Slack?

919
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,420
How do you get Slack?

920
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,960
Is Slack a byproduct

921
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,620
of Bob?

922
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,580
And what can Slack

923
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,300
do for you,

924
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:51,660
me,

925
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,320
and everybody?

926
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,340
Well,

927
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,600
everyone is actually

928
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,260
born with original Slack.

929
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,180
But,

930
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,280
the conspiracy

931
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,680
of the normal people

932
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,920
starts taking it

933
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,880
away from you

934
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,300
from the get-go.

935
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,180
You know,

936
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,780
they tell you,

937
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,660
they tell you

938
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,320
what you can eat

939
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:08,780
and drink

940
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,340
and what you can think

941
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:10,840
basically.

942
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,160
And,

943
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,600
from the time

944
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,120
you're a little kid,

945
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,000
they won't let you

946
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,820
let a baby

947
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,880
eat thumbtacks.

948
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,660
There may be reasons

949
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,500
why babies

950
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,800
shouldn't eat thumbtacks,

951
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,960
but that's one example.

952
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:22,500
You know,

953
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,680
they start,

954
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,240
you know,

955
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,100
hemming you in

956
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,780
and telling you

957
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,800
what you can and can't do.

958
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,240
And,

959
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,180
eventually,

960
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,440
it becomes,

961
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,720
people get to where

962
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,340
they think it's

963
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,620
perfectly normal

964
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,540
to work

965
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,560
at an unrewarding job

966
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,460
just to

967
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,000
pay for the,

968
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,640
right,

969
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,420
to be alive

970
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,720
and have a shelter.

971
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,520
And,

972
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,100
I mean,

973
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,920
let's face it,

974
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,060
that is the way it is.

975
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,440
And,

976
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,500
we can't promise you

977
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,960
a free air-conditioned

978
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,840
cardboard box

979
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,900
under a bridge.

980
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,360
You have to,

981
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,020
you have to do

982
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,080
that kind of thing yourself.

983
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,780
All we try to do

984
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,400
is remind people

985
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,420
that maybe

986
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,820
slack is not

987
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,760
to be found

988
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,100
in that raise

989
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,080
that's always

990
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,920
around the corner

991
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,980
or that boyfriend

992
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,720
or girlfriend

993
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,460
that you wish

994
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,020
you had

995
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,800
or if only

996
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,280
you could,

997
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,100
you know,

998
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,700
become a master

999
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,920
of that one video game

1000
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,800
and you have slack.

1001
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,780
It's never,

1002
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,360
well,

1003
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:18,700
actually,

1004
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,440
that might be.

1005
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:19,800
Yeah,

1006
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,680
that's an excellent

1007
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:21,760
example of slack.

1008
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,780
That might actually

1009
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,920
be a legitimate

1010
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
path to slack.

1011
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,340
I can't wait

1012
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:26,900
to get back

1013
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,420
to Monster Hunter 4

1014
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,180
as soon as we're

1015
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,000
finished with this.

1016
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:30,940
But,

1017
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:32,960
we,

1018
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,120
it's,

1019
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:35,920
you know,

1020
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,760
for some people,

1021
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,800
slack is just doing

1022
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,500
whatever oddball

1023
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,240
little thing

1024
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,940
they sort of,

1025
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,280
wanted to be doing.

1026
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,560
You know,

1027
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,360
it might be a hobby

1028
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,360
like bird collecting

1029
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,080
or hopefully

1030
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,700
it's not serial killing.

1031
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,700
But,

1032
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,120
hey,

1033
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:49,720
you know.

1034
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,840
So,

1035
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,760
so really,

1036
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,340
we're just a pep talk

1037
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,540
or kind of a reminder

1038
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,600
that although slack

1039
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,820
and money are related,

1040
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,340
they're not the same thing.

1041
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,700
And although slack

1042
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,780
and sex are related,

1043
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,800
they're not the same thing.

1044
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,940
Bob is slack.

1045
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,980
Bob is sex.

1046
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,140
Bob is money.

1047
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:10,940
Mm-hmm.

1048
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,520
That's all you really need

1049
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,060
is just,

1050
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,000
you know,

1051
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,320
really,

1052
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,020
you could forego

1053
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,620
the books

1054
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,820
and the $35

1055
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,900
ordainment

1056
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,220
and,

1057
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,560
you know,

1058
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,140
all of that.

1059
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,580
You could

1060
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,960
and just simply

1061
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,220
swipe a picture

1062
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:24,920
of Bob somewhere

1063
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,680
and stare at that thing

1064
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,020
for the rest of your life

1065
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,620
and find true slack.

1066
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,080
That hasn't worked

1067
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,540
for me.

1068
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,180
Yeah,

1069
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,740
I would rather have

1070
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,240
the sex

1071
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,880
and the money

1072
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,460
and the women

1073
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,100
and all that.

1074
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,480
I must be

1075
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:35,980
loving this.

1076
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,340
Oh, right.

1077
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,180
The picture of Bob

1078
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,160
can be on the wall

1079
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,980
and you could,

1080
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,300
you know,

1081
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:39,660
whatever.

1082
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:40,620
Yeah.

1083
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,220
Uh,

1084
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,100
so,

1085
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,780
yeah,

1086
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,120
the important thing

1087
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,900
is we don't promise

1088
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,540
you a damn thing

1089
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,540
except some really

1090
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,000
nice reading material

1091
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,600
um,

1092
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,160
and

1093
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,940
the opportunity

1094
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,980
to meet

1095
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,380
some interesting people.

1096
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,720
And by interesting,

1097
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,220
sometimes

1098
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,620
you,

1099
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,340
you wish,

1100
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:01,660
sometimes

1101
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,940
that the other

1102
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,620
subgenius

1103
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,740
is that one person

1104
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,180
put on this planet

1105
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,400
to piss you off.

1106
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,180
But most of them

1107
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:09,740
aren't.

1108
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,480
Um,

1109
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:11,860
and, uh,

1110
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:12,940
uh,

1111
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,460
it's,

1112
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,280
you know,

1113
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,420
you don't want to go to Mensa.

1114
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,260
Everybody there thinks

1115
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:16,820
they're smart.

1116
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,080
Well,

1117
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,980
you won't find that

1118
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,080
at church of the subgenius

1119
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,120
because they don't even agree

1120
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,160
what smart means.

1121
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,200
Hmm.

1122
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,120
You know,

1123
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,280
you might get some help.

1124
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:24,960
You might,

1125
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,080
you might hear some really

1126
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,960
dirty jokes.

1127
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,920
I can promise,

1128
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,360
I can,

1129
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,700
I can promise that.

1130
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,040
Nice.

1131
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:31,760
So,

1132
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,900
you know,

1133
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,460
it's, um,

1134
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,420
each person gets slack

1135
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,680
in their own way.

1136
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,380
Mm-hmm.

1137
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,360
What Bob does

1138
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,480
is he helps you pull

1139
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,080
the wool over your own eyes,

1140
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,240
so that you can relax

1141
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,000
in the safety

1142
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,300
of your own delusions.

1143
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,300
And he,

1144
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,540
and he also brings you,

1145
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:46,880
not,

1146
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,780
instead of forgiveness,

1147
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,180
he brings excuses.

1148
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,080
Um,

1149
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,120
you know,

1150
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,500
you don't,

1151
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,800
he's not requiring you

1152
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,580
to act smart.

1153
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,600
In fact,

1154
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,460
as Bob said,

1155
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,380
if you act,

1156
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,460
and this is,

1157
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,400
really holds true

1158
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,300
in most jobs,

1159
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,200
if you act like a dumb shit,

1160
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,660
they will treat you

1161
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,440
as an equal.

1162
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,300
Mm-hmm.

1163
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,800
And,

1164
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,440
think about it.

1165
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,620
It's called

1166
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:09,980
talking over.

1167
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,680
It's really true.

1168
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,560
And we,

1169
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,620
and do you really

1170
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,480
have to feel like

1171
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,180
you're brilliant

1172
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:15,800
and smart

1173
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,260
and,

1174
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,900
you know,

1175
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,600
understand integral calculus

1176
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,880
in order to know

1177
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,980
how the universe works?

1178
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,940
Why should you know

1179
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,200
how the universe works?

1180
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,140
You know,

1181
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:25,860
we're just trying

1182
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,660
to surf the luck plane.

1183
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,580
Mm-hmm.

1184
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,020
That's,

1185
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,440
to,

1186
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:29,880
to,

1187
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,200
to follow the path

1188
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,400
of least resistance.

1189
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,400
So,

1190
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,400
do you have the most

1191
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,540
flack

1192
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,040
for the least effort?

1193
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,500
And,

1194
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,280
if you can,

1195
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,840
you know,

1196
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,340
live off on the dole

1197
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,900
or just gob on life,

1198
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,520
as we say,

1199
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,360
then great.

1200
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,440
Most of us really

1201
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,400
can't do that

1202
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,280
and end up having

1203
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,540
to deal with the man

1204
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,120
one way or another.

1205
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,700
And that's where

1206
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,220
the hour of slack comes in.

1207
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,240
Yes.

1208
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:56,800
When you,

1209
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,840
if you can drive home

1210
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,660
from work listening

1211
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,620
to the hour of slack,

1212
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,480
or no doubt your show,

1213
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,240
uh,

1214
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,620
or any of the subgenius shows,

1215
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,220
you'll,

1216
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,960
you're a little less likely

1217
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,540
to have the kind of road rage

1218
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,820
that puts you in pressure.

1219
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,920
I'll tell you,

1220
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,360
the subgenius hour of slack,

1221
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,060
you know,

1222
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,780
that I listen to

1223
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,820
through podcast form

1224
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,820
is what gets me through

1225
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,180
my work week.

1226
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:17,700
Um,

1227
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,940
you know,

1228
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,200
uh,

1229
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,680
Oh, really?

1230
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,080
Yeah.

1231
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,200
Bob and slack have done

1232
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,180
tremendous things for me.

1233
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:22,400
Yes,

1234
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,220
I am a big advocate

1235
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,100
of Bob myself.

1236
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,220
Um,

1237
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,900
so I'm aware you just got back

1238
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,720
from a big long trip

1239
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,060
and everything.

1240
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,820
I do listen,

1241
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,240
you know,

1242
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,300
faithfully every week

1243
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,900
to the stream of consciousness

1244
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,300
that is the subgenius hour

1245
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:34,700
of slack.

1246
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:35,920
So,

1247
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,040
I'm here to,

1248
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:38,440
uh,

1249
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,180
uh,

1250
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,560
since,

1251
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,260
since,

1252
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,420
uh,

1253
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,720
I know I haven't worked

1254
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,840
for anyone except

1255
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,120
the church of the subgenius

1256
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,300
for several years now.

1257
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,940
And my wife retired

1258
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,120
from a government job.

1259
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,020
So,

1260
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,740
uh,

1261
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,100
we are,

1262
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,380
are able to travel

1263
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,460
around a lot during,

1264
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:55,820
uh,

1265
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,760
and of course live in Cleveland.

1266
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,220
We choose to travel around

1267
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,320
during the winter.

1268
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,940
We go south,

1269
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,900
we go to California.

1270
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,560
In fact,

1271
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:03,800
we,

1272
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,460
we explored the Salton Sea

1273
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,260
this last,

1274
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:06,640
uh,

1275
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,240
January.

1276
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,340
You can buy really cheap

1277
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,280
land there.

1278
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,340
It'd be a great place

1279
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,380
for a cult compound.

1280
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,320
Absolutely.

1281
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:14,820
Uh,

1282
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,320
except,

1283
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,940
except for the fact

1284
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,000
that the whole area

1285
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,560
smells like rotting toxic fish

1286
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,660
and it's 120 degrees

1287
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,340
in the summer.

1288
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,800
But hey,

1289
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,580
you know,

1290
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,740
if you have faith in Bob.

1291
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,700
But it's a dry heat.

1292
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
It's really a dry heat.

1293
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,420
Yeah,

1294
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:29,960
we'll,

1295
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,840
we'll put him to work

1296
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,040
on a little farm down there

1297
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,480
or something.

1298
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,140
Nice.

1299
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,700
Now for a moment,

1300
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,960
let's consider an entirely

1301
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,200
different type of case.

1302
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,740
The case of Bob,

1303
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,220
one which shows

1304
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,480
how ambitious men

1305
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,500
can get ahead

1306
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,960
under our American system

1307
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,860
of free enterprise.

1308
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,880
When Bob graduated

1309
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,680
from high school,

1310
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,620
Bob was surprised to learn

1311
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,880
that this Bob society

1312
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,660
had created a special type

1313
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,080
of life

1314
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,460
for people of his type.

1315
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,620
Right, Bob?

1316
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,500
Well,

1317
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,040
life never was a burden.

1318
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,920
In the first place,

1319
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,140
Bob's flexible.

1320
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,440
Bob can expand

1321
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,020
or contract.

1322
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,860
Now,

1323
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,940
Bob is a man

1324
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:06,940


1325
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:06,940


1326
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:06,940


1327
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:06,940


1328
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:06,940


1329
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:06,940


1330
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,480
who has gone far.

1331
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,700
Why not profit

1332
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,560
by Bob's example?

1333
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,340
Send the postcard care

1334
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:12,920
of this station

1335
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,100
to the Bob society.

1336
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,540
Until last week,

1337
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,980
the Bob society

1338
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,260
of the United Bobs.

1339
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,780
We've had you on here

1340
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,460
for a while.

1341
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,540
It sounds great.

1342
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,520
I'm an ex-Jehovah's Witness.

1343
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,180
I'm on board.

1344
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,720
Yeah.

1345
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:26,660
Yeah,

1346
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:26,800
see,

1347
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,280
yeah,

1348
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,100
Lobo here is an ex-Jehovah's Witness.

1349
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,160
So,

1350
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,540
um,

1351
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:31,700
Wow.

1352
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,600
Well,

1353
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:32,880
then,

1354
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:33,800
you've probably heard

1355
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,960
some fairly intense preaching,

1356
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,700
I would hope.

1357
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:36,920
Well,

1358
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,960
I guess they're not,

1359
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,780
they're not real big

1360
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,560
on show business,

1361
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,020
are they?

1362
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,200
The Jehovah's Witnesses,

1363
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,640
you know,

1364
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,140
I'll tell you what,

1365
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,640
they have the best artwork

1366
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,340
of anybody.

1367
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,740
I have been more inspired

1368
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,600
by the artwork

1369
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,740
in Watchtower

1370
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,380
and,

1371
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:50,740
um,

1372
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,000
what's that other one?

1373
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,740
Awake.

1374
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,020
Yeah,

1375
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,720
those two,

1376
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,340
those two,

1377
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,560
we were really inspired

1378
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,280
by those.

1379
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,500
Philodramon and I

1380
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,220
would look at those,

1381
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,420
we'd find them free

1382
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,960
in laundromats,

1383
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,620
and we'd look at each other

1384
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:03,820
and went,

1385
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,120
you know,

1386
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,080
we could print up

1387
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,140
something like this,

1388
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,000
but it's a little,

1389
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,800
a little cheaper

1390
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,140
and we have to use clip art

1391
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,760
because we don't have

1392
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,620
the great painters

1393
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,280
that the Jehovah's Witnesses did.

1394
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,500
But,

1395
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:13,840
uh,

1396
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,960
we thought we could leave

1397
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,300
this stuff in laundromats

1398
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,280
and that was actually

1399
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,140
how it started.

1400
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,720
The problem was,

1401
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,980
it turned out that printing

1402
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,240
was more than we expected.

1403
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,240
My wife at the time

1404
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,100
got really mad

1405
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,700
when she saw

1406
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,320
the $60 printing bill

1407
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,640
for a hundred pamphlets

1408
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,480
and said,

1409
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
you have to send these

1410
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,120
to publishers,

1411
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,860
you can't just

1412
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,500
give these away.

1413
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,140
And we did

1414
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,900
and the publishers

1415
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,820
all threw them away,

1416
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,520
but,

1417
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,380
at the underground

1418
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,460
comic book places,

1419
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,380
the artists

1420
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,280
fished them out

1421
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,860
of the trash.

1422
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,120
And we were saved.

1423
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,900
We almost went out

1424
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,760
of business in,

1425
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,700
in the,

1426
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:46,960
in,

1427
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,140
well,

1428
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,400
yeah,

1429
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,120
in a way,

1430
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,360
we were financially saved

1431
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,080
because somebody

1432
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,040
noticed our work

1433
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,440
and,

1434
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,800
and we got a publisher.

1435
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,380
Then we almost went

1436
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,860
out of business

1437
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,520
until the internet

1438
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,040
came around in the 90s

1439
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,540
and that really

1440
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,940
saved our asses.

1441
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,220
You know,

1442
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:01,900
it was,

1443
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,120
uh,

1444
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,300
we needed

1445
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,600
a new way

1446
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,500
to reach out

1447
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,820
and there it was.

1448
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,580
How,

1449
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,560
how far,

1450
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,340
are you,

1451
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:10,940
are you global?

1452
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,480
I mean,

1453
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,240
are there,

1454
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,840
are there subgeniuses

1455
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,420
all over the world?

1456
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:14,560


1457
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:14,560


1458
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,060
Yeah,

1459
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,680
if you,

1460
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,460
if you look at,

1461
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:17,720
uh,

1462
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,900
subgenius.com

1463
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,000
under the events,

1464
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:20,900
uh,

1465
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,160
you'll see that there's,

1466
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,340
uh,

1467
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,180
been regular,

1468
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,040
uh,

1469
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,100
tours and

1470
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,260
revivals in,

1471
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:26,660
uh,

1472
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,740
Europe and,

1473
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,360
um,

1474
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:29,840
well,

1475
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,600
all over Europe,

1476
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,420
mostly England

1477
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,320
and Germany

1478
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,580
and Amst,

1479
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,460
the Holland.

1480
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:34,800
We,

1481
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,440
we really enjoy Amsterdam.

1482
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,580
I would imagine.

1483
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,000
That's one of our favorite

1484
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,220
places to,

1485
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:39,460
well,

1486
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:39,640
they,

1487
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,140
they don't need to be preached to

1488
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,760
about Slack.

1489
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:42,940
But,

1490
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,440
um,

1491
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,820
we just like to go there.

1492
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,060
But,

1493
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,920
uh,

1494
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,720
and,

1495
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,000
uh,

1496
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,560
there's a lot of them in Austr,

1497
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,040
there's a,

1498
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,740
there's a whole,

1499
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,120
in the English speaking world,

1500
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,480
there's subgeniuses all over.

1501
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,420
I'm talking about thousands of them,

1502
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,000
not a few dozen

1503
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,960
or a few hundred.

1504
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,420
I'm talking about thousands.

1505
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,140
I would say over the years,

1506
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:02,560
I mean,

1507
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,120
it's been 30,

1508
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,140
35 years.

1509
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,100
We get at least,

1510
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,520
at the very least,

1511
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,100
we get two,

1512
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,620
a membership or two a day.

1513
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,120
And some years it's more like six or seven a day.

1514
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,320
So you do the math.

1515
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,700
It's been like 40,

1516
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,360
50,000 people

1517
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:17,680
who,

1518
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,220
who bought the actual membership.

1519
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,460
I don't mean that bought,

1520
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,840
we sold a hundred thousand,

1521
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,060
the,

1522
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,500
the book of the subgenius

1523
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,800
and the other books have sold over a hundred thousand copies

1524
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,940
over a long period of time.

1525
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:27,940


1526
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,840
So it's,

1527
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,100
there's no way this stuff could ever be bestseller material.

1528
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:32,720
That would,

1529
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,080
I mean,

1530
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,260
it's,

1531
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,620
it's anti bestseller material.

1532
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,140
It's the antidote

1533
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,560
to everybody else's placebo.

1534
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,220
So,

1535
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,500
you know,

1536
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,080
we don't,

1537
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,980
we've never really expected anything big time.

1538
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,780
We would love to,

1539
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,460
I have a movie screenplay

1540
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,460
and we'd love to do a,

1541
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,040
a movie sometime,

1542
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,080
but,

1543
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,080
crowdfunded.

1544
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,900
Yeah.

1545
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,940
Yeah.

1546
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,420
Well,

1547
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,040
I've been starting to think about that.

1548
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,420
What we would more likely do would be to crowdfund

1549
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,240
a radio play album,

1550
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,360
sort of like the Fireside Theater used to do.

1551
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,020
That would be awesome.

1552
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,080
That was the inspiration.

1553
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,000
That was,

1554
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,660
that was our original inspiration was Fireside Theater,

1555
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,060
really,

1556
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,900
for a whole,

1557
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,840
for the radio subgeniuses anyway.

1558
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,800
You could do that through podcast form now with no problem.

1559
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,440
You could do that.

1560
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,560
Cracked Prairie Home Companion.

1561
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,180
Yeah, exactly.

1562
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,760
You could do that now through home,

1563
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,040
through,

1564
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,560
through podcasting format now.

1565
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:27,920
It's,

1566
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,020
that would be somewhat easy.

1567
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,000
Well,

1568
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,680
right.

1569
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,340
But the,

1570
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,140
the important thing is the slack.

1571
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:35,960
Yes.

1572
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,240
So,

1573
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,100
I,

1574
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:42,520
I really personally didn't get into this to be the clerk of the church,

1575
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:42,900
but,

1576
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,060
but I do end up doing that a lot of the time.

1577
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,440
And I'm not really that ambitious of a clerk.

1578
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,420
And we're,

1579
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,380
we're starting to put some of our stuff on and camp.

1580
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,040
And actually charge for it.

1581
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,520
For the,

1582
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,800
the radio stuff has always basically been for free.

1583
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,300
We sell CDs and stuff,

1584
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,920
but nobody buys CDs anymore.

1585
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:06,980
And we,

1586
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,120
we sell downloadable things.

1587
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,240
And of course the hour slack is just free,

1588
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,600
but we ask for donations and believe it or not,

1589
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,260
we get some.

1590
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,800
What,

1591
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,300
what we lack in sales,

1592
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,980
we've made up foreign donations in the last few years,

1593
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,280
I think just because we've been around for so long.

1594
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,120
There's,

1595
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,240
there's people that kind of really have gotten to where they appreciate us

1596
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,980
being there.

1597
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,840
They'd hate to see us disappear because in certain,

1598
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,820
you know,

1599
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,180
to,

1600
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,460
to some people were,

1601
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:41,860
were like the last little remnant of really anti-commercial,

1602
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,080
whatever,

1603
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,240
whatever we're doing,

1604
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:44,740
uh,

1605
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,200
preaching.

1606
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,360
It's not,

1607
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:46,940
we want,

1608
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,680
we want money.

1609
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,360
It's not that we,

1610
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:48,600
we,

1611
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,740
we don't want money.

1612
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,400
It's that we don't want to work for it.

1613
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,420
Yeah.

1614
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,140
We don't want it to be a job.

1615
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:55,640
You know,

1616
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,300
as long as we can do this stuff at college stations in the dead of night,

1617
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,920
we have all this great equipment.

1618
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,380
We can do what we wanted to do and nobody cares.

1619
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,120
You know,

1620
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,620
we're not beholden to any advertisers.

1621
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,980
We just can't cost.

1622
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,020
Well,

1623
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,240
that's what the internet version is for.

1624
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,840
I put the customers back in for the internet version.

1625
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:16,420
So,

1626
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,680
so really it's,

1627
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,500
we've had a lot of freedom of,

1628
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:20,820
uh,

1629
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,740
of fun.

1630
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,060
I mean,

1631
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,220
we,

1632
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,080
we've had to do this around working around our day jobs,

1633
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,360
most of us.

1634
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,240
Uh,

1635
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,080
but you might say it beats working.

1636
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:30,940
I don't know.

1637
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:31,720
Well,

1638
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,000
several of my friends are art bums like me.

1639
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,400
Uh,

1640
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:36,600
they,

1641
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:44,720
they do just enough for freelance work of different kinds or they make just enough off of some kind of sub-genius royalty or another that they,

1642
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,760
they can live in a nice,

1643
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,000
uh,

1644
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,000
hovel and not have to shave.

1645
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:50,820
Can one,

1646
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,100
you know,

1647
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,960
shave or go to work?

1648
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:58,140
Can one become ordained in the sub-genius to become a sub-genius minister?

1649
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,220
Well,

1650
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:00,380
yeah,

1651
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,420
that's the whole idea.

1652
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:01,940


1653
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,540
you,

1654
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:14,160
you pay a fee that's 35 bucks and we ordain you as a sub-genius minister and there's no law that says you aren't a minister.

1655
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:14,540
You,

1656
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,780
you can perform legal weddings.

1657
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,200
You may have to,

1658
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:18,560
um,

1659
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,960
provide a little bit of paperwork,

1660
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,240
but we help with that.

1661
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,580
We also encourage people to join the Universal Life Church,

1662
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:31,680
which is a sort of a tax protest church that's quite legitimate.

1663
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,820
They were formed because their founder,

1664
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,720
Bishop Henley,

1665
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,000
thought,

1666
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:37,880
why should people,

1667
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,900
why should religions be tax exempt?

1668
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,860
Why should my taxes subsidize somebody's ridiculous,

1669
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,940
made up magic time of sky story?

1670
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,300
So I'm just going to make my own religion and say I'm tax exempt.

1671
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,420
So they do the tax exempt thing,

1672
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,200
which is tricky.

1673
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:53,940
Uh,

1674
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,140
we don't do that.

1675
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,760
We can ordain you and you can do weddings,

1676
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,480
but,

1677
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:58,920
uh,

1678
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:05,200
but don't try to claim tax exempt unless you work through somebody a little bit more,

1679
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:05,720
uh,

1680
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,580
soberly established like the Universal Life Church.

1681
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,000
I'll tell you,

1682
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,280
man,

1683
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:11,580
if,

1684
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,240
if,

1685
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,600
if our weddings are not legitimate,

1686
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,540
then a hell of a lot of people have wasted money on expensive divorces.

1687
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,620
Our weddings are cheap,

1688
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,060
but the divorce is not.

1689
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:24,740
Yeah,

1690
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:25,060
you know what?

1691
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:26,860
They're worth it.

1692
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:27,520
Exactly.

1693
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:28,960
Well,

1694
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,200
you know,

1695
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:30,440
yeah,

1696
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,000
the lawyers are the ones that make the good money on that.

1697
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,560
So if God,

1698
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,120
if we could,

1699
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:35,560
you know,

1700
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,540
if we could sell divorces,

1701
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,840
that would be the big money.

1702
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,240
See,

1703
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,880
I guess what we need is the law office of the subgenius,

1704
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,740
not the church.

1705
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,100
I'm sure you could establish that.

1706
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:47,720
Well,

1707
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,640
let me ask you this then.

1708
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,060
If I pay the $35 and I become ordained,

1709
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,620
does this buy me any form of salvation?

1710
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:59,900
Does this buy me a ticket on the magical spaceship off of the planet on the day that X day actually comes?

1711
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,560
Well,

1712
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,080
in fact,

1713
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,080
we have an offer that no other religion makes.

1714
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:06,580
Oh,

1715
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:06,960
okay.

1716
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,200
Eternal salvation,

1717
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,160
eternal salvation or triple your money back.

1718
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,980
So if you end up at the gates of hell,

1719
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,760
for eternity,

1720
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,620
we will pay you back $110.

1721
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,500
Oh my God.

1722
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,760
It's so much fucking way.

1723
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,800
The problem is the,

1724
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,740
the eternity issue.

1725
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,960
That's the problem.

1726
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,440
You know,

1727
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,260
you have to prove it was for eternity.

1728
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,780
So it may take a while before your check comes through.

1729
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,380
But,

1730
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,480
but yeah,

1731
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,140
you know,

1732
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:40,300
I,

1733
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,200
I mean,

1734
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,120
I tell you what,

1735
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,700
if you do end up at the gates of hell,

1736
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,020
cause you joined the church,

1737
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,960
then I guess you deserve that.

1738
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:48,940
But,

1739
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,780
but,

1740
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:49,820


1741
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:49,900


1742
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:49,900


1743
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:49,900


1744
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:49,900


1745
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:49,900


1746
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:49,900


1747
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:50,400
Buy or beware.

1748
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,280
We haven't heard it.

1749
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:51,980
Yeah.

1750
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,000
We haven't heard any reports back.

1751
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:54,720
I was going to say,

1752
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,120
if you had to honor that guarantee thus far or,

1753
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,600
you know.

1754
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,000
X money that?

1755
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:58,700
Yeah.

1756
00:46:59,240 --> 00:46:59,680
No,

1757
00:46:59,760 --> 00:46:59,840
no,

1758
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,760
you know,

1759
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,780
lots of jokers,

1760
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,020
uh,

1761
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,200
try to claim it,

1762
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:03,720
but that's the,

1763
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,280
you know,

1764
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,140
there's that eternal.

1765
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,220
That's not even in small print.

1766
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,920
That's the first word of the guarantee,

1767
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,540
the colonel salvation or triple your money back.

1768
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,920
of salvation. You could buy your way out of hell for specific amounts

1769
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,700
of time for a certain indulgence, you know.

1770
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,580
You'd give a certain amount of money to the church and it would save you

1771
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,680
some time in hell, but I always thought that was kind of a rip-off because hell

1772
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,720
by definition is pretty much eternal and what you're

1773
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,760
buying is just a drop in the bucket. Might as well give it away to the

1774
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,620
poor, frankly. Well, what is Bob's version of heaven? Is there a

1775
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:49,580
Bobtopia? Well, think of most

1776
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,800
people's version of hell.

1777
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,820
It's kind of like the reverse order. The Christian heaven is the subgenius

1778
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,020
hell. It would be so boring to us.

1779
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,400
Whereas the subgenius, you kind of have to go to the regular hell

1780
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,500
to be ready to appreciate how great the subgenius heaven

1781
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,620
is because it's just unimaginable. First off, you get

1782
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,400
to live forever.

1783
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,320
X day comes, assuming you can make it till X day.

1784
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,800
You get to live as long as you want. Then when you choose to die,

1785
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,520
you still get the eternal salvation.

1786
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:31,620
So, you know, it's a win-win situation no matter

1787
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,860
what. You'd be crazy not to spend

1788
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,360
the $35. Absolutely.

1789
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:43,440
For all we know, the Baptists are right and hell is real, so it doesn't hurt to

1790
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,980
repent on your deathbed either.

1791
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,300
At the last minute, you know, just go, okay, Jesus, I believe in you.

1792
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:56,020
Muhammad, you too. Jehovah, all you guys. Krishna, Rama,

1793
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,420
Odin, I'm all for y'all, all of you.

1794
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,620
I'm ready for my virgins.

1795
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:08,360
We're not going to tell you what to do. We'll just tell you how to think.

1796
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:09,580
That's all.

1797
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:12,920
That's all.

1798
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,420
Reverend Stang, we've had you on here.

1799
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,580
We've had you on here for 45 minutes. I was originally only intending to have you on here

1800
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,860
for about 20 or so. I didn't want to take up all this time.

1801
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,300
We always do that.

1802
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,220
Well, this was worth the $35.

1803
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,360
Hey, guess what? I'm not really Ivan Stang. I'm really

1804
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,500
Ed Holmes from the Church of the Last Laugh.

1805
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,600
Oh, yeah.

1806
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,540
I'm going to put a link up to the Church of the Subgenius in our

1807
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,060
show notes when this show goes up.

1808
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,960
We also have some beautiful pictures of Bob up there.

1809
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,180
If anybody wants to join your fine organization,

1810
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,160
they would go to subgenius.com, I would assume. That's the website?

1811
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:04,020
That's it. Subgenius.com. Everything you know is right in the first words at the top of the page.

1812
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,740
The important thing is that the word subgenius does not have an O in it,

1813
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,940
although .com does.

1814
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,360
In fact, there are two Os in .com, depending on

1815
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,240
how you do it.

1816
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,720
The property is with the word.

1817
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:19,920
Yes, correct.

1818
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,840
Easily able to be found on the Googles, which has two Os in it.

1819
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,900
Thank you very much for coming on here.

1820
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,340
We very much appreciate it.

1821
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,520
I can't thank you enough. It's been a pleasure and an honor to speak with you.

1822
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,940
Next time when I call, I hope to actually talk to the real

1823
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,960
Reverend Ivan Stang and not the janitor.

1824
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,060
For being a janitor, you've done a fantastic job of

1825
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,080
filling us in on pretty much nothing.

1826
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,520
For that, I am truly grateful.

1827
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,100
I've listened to Reverend Stang for years.

1828
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,760
I can imitate almost all of his famous sermons.

1829
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,180
You sound almost exactly like the guy.

1830
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,140
I would wager to venture that you probably actually are

1831
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,260
Reverend Ivan Stang posing as a janitor,

1832
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,040
which is fine.

1833
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,060
We all have our fetishes.

1834
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:07,520
I was the first Bobby.

1835
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,900
I was the first Bobby.

1836
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,120
I'll do anything Bob says.

1837
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,500
Praise Bob.

1838
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,260
Praise Bob.

1839
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,520
Praise Bob.

1840
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,220
Thank you very much.

1841
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,180
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

1842
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,480
Six to an even.

1843
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:27,280
Over and out.

1844
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,440
Thank you.

1845
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,560
Six o'clock, Bob.

1846
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,280
Time to wake up.

1847
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,180
Come on, Bob.

1848
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:33,740
Come on, Bob.

1849
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:33,900
Get up.

1850
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,460
Get up.

1851
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,320
Bob.

1852
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:35,860
Bob.

1853
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:36,680
Come on, Bob.

1854
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,140
Come on, Bob.

1855
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:38,620
Bob, rise and shine.

1856
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,120
Rise and shine.

1857
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:39,460
Come on.

1858
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,000
Come on.

1859
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:40,920
Bob.

1860
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:41,700
Come on.

1861
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,200
Bob, get up.

1862
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:42,740
Bob, get up.

1863
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:43,180
Bob.

1864
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:43,600
Bob.

1865
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:44,780
Bob.

1866
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:46,620
Bob.

1867
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,660
Bob.

1868
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,280
Bob.

1869
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:49,840
Bob.

1870
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,400
Bob.

1871
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:50,400


1872
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:50,720
Get up.

1873
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,200
Get up.

1874
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,140
Come on.

1875
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:52,560
Come on.

1876
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:52,780
Come on.

1877
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,460
It's six o'clock.

1878
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,180
Rise and shine.

1879
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:54,820
Rise and shine.

1880
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,080
Time to go get the car right now.

1881
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:56,660
Come on, Bob.

1882
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,000
Come on.

1883
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:57,340
Come on.

1884
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:57,760
Come on.

1885
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:57,900
Bob.

1886
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:58,680
Bob.

1887
00:51:59,460 --> 00:51:59,900
Bob.

1888
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:01,560
Bob.

1889
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:01,960
Bob.

1890
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:03,500
Bob.

1891
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,200
Bob.

1892
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:04,440
Bob.

1893
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,480
Bob.

1894
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:08,940


1895
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:09,020


1896
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:09,860
No.

1897
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:10,580
Bob.

1898
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:10,580


1899
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:10,580


1900
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:10,580


1901
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:10,580


1902
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,060
So that was Reverend Ivan Stang.

1903
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:13,500
Uh,

1904
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,160
again,

1905
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:14,860
you can go to,

1906
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:15,940
or was it,

1907
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,920
or was it the janitor?

1908
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:17,480
Oh, God.

1909
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,600
Listen, people,

1910
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,220
if you,

1911
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,220
I'm going to warn everybody here.

1912
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,400
If you go out and download the subgenius hour of slack,

1913
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,660
of which I myself am a subscriber to,

1914
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,440
um,

1915
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:27,900
that show,

1916
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,420
uh,

1917
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,980
can be difficult to listen to.

1918
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,920
It is a one hour LSD mushroom stream of consciousness trip.

1919
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,080
Some of their episodes are really funny.

1920
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,000
Some of their episodes,

1921
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,500
I'm not sure what they are.

1922
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,520
What's funny about that interview is I kept,

1923
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,420
I only wanted to have him.

1924
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,600
I wanted to have him on for like 30 minutes or so,

1925
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,380
maybe 20 minutes.

1926
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:45,820
Come on,

1927
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:47,080
tell us what the church is all about.

1928
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,580
And he just kept going.

1929
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,600
And I just,

1930
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:51,940
you know,

1931
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,680
we talked about it.

1932
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:52,920
I've,

1933
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,300
you know,

1934
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,040
we decided not to edit that show.

1935
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,740
So what you heard was the actual interview word for word.

1936
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,020
Cause I kept trying to let him go or I'd go to say something and stag just,

1937
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:03,540
you know,

1938
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,320
he evangelizes.

1939
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,860
He's out there doing what he does.

1940
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:12,260
He's a preacher and he puts far more work into what he does than he should for the amount of slack that he wants to acquire.

1941
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:13,980
Oh,

1942
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,780
but he was in a mess.

1943
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,160
He had a battle scene coming up in the movie deeper than what she had planned.

1944
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,920
It came up and I wasn't gonna not do it from my part.

1945
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,780
I was gonna do whatever it was she asked me to do,

1946
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:32,780


1947
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:32,780


1948
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:32,780


1949
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:32,780


1950
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,780
you can't let blood toombő you see,

1951
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:33,780


1952
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:33,780


1953
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:33,780


1954
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:33,780


1955
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:33,780


1956
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:33,900
Come,

1957
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,840
I just have topai our lin 들.

1958
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:40,980
It's pretty much ever since we played her in my first movie.

1959
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,280
so I can help her rest himself.

1960
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:41,280


1961
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,400
But still maybe something that you should consider when taking part in it.

1962
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:43,400


1963
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:43,400


1964
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,080
Little wife, show her you care

1965
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,160
And you'll be glad if you do

1966
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,320
My grandkids are hungry

1967
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,300
Our house is so bare

1968
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:06,840
All it takes is money from you

1969
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,880
Feed the stings, money for swag

1970
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:24,680
Money, money, money for swag

1971
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:31,480
Feed the stings, that's what he cries

1972
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,820
Mom overhead, spaceship's gone

1973
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:36,820


1974
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,700
Let's fill the skies

1975
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,720
In Wisteria, campground

1976
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,220
Bob Dobbs and his minions

1977
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:49,120
Look down at the Yeti hive

1978
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,600
And though you can't see it

1979
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,200
You know that he's smiling

1980
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,480
Each time that you give

1981
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,640
Thirty five

1982
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:14,200
Though his words are simple and few

1983
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:21,660
Listen, listen, he's calling to you

1984
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:29,580
Feed the stings, money for swag

1985
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,480
Money, money, money

1986
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,600
Money for swag

1987
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,780
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1988
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,540
Dragging your butt through the day

1989
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,560
Time for you to hit all of the guilt

1990
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,960
But none of the sex?

1991
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,400
There is a simple answer, dear friend

1992
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,860
A growing beacon of slack

1993
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,120
Amidst the turmoil and darkness

1994
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:06,820
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs and his mighty church of the dead

1995
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,400
The subgenius

1996
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:14,720
Though his words are simple and few

1997
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:22,520
Listen, listen, he's calling to you

1998
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:30,420
Feed the stings, money for swag

1999
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:36,800
Money, money, money for swag

The HTTP tutte de la fame

2001
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,340
Money for swag

2002
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,700
What the hell do you think you're venturing out for?

2003
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,300
Drop down on्' Chr İs Library

2004

Solid conservatives

2014
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:02,240
Get rid of all the stings

2015
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:02,780
Keep them all out

2016
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:03,100
When I tell a story

2017
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:03,500
No one's gonna scent me

2018
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,240

Okay, sneaky fish head, who gets the fish?

Share the fish, that fish wouldn't be any fish.

2029
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,320
Well, in other words, you fish.

2030
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,500
I share the fish, he is not fish.

2031
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,580
Two fish.

2032
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,000
Gentlemen, we're not interested in fish.

2033
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,040
His fish.

2034
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,400
Well, uh, the fish beyond the fish.

2035
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,460
That's better.

2036
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,260
Ladies and gentlemen.

2037
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,460
Hi, I'm a serious problem in America.

2038
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,860
Because they don't call.

Oh, you're absolutely right.

2045
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,100
From PR News in Washington,

2046
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:58,180
I'm shooting up and attacking an FBI agent.

2047
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,420
I'm appointed by Governor Spike.

2048
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,220
President Obama was found dead in a dumpster yesterday

2049
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:05,800
in Ferguson, Missouri.

2050
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,820
PR's report on racially diverse Amazon.com.

2051
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:15,100
CEO Jeff Bezos told investors he plans to deploy PR News by year end.

2052
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:19,120
The World Health Organization says Liberia and Guinea

2053
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,700
have 70% of people infected with Ebola,

2054
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,360
burying those who have the disease.

2055
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:28,140
On Wall Street, police say 49, 65.

2056
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,520
Police also say you're listening to PR News.

2057
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,680
This week's meeting in Peru is expected to be

2058
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,140
in Paris.

2059
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,140
PR's report reports that the meeting is an effort to revive interest

2060
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:43,000
in a new international PR News in Washington.

2061
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,860
At this, PR News failed.
