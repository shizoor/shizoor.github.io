00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,460
I'm serious, Mr. Jammet. I'm certain something's wrong. I'm sure it is.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,100
Calm yourself, madam. It's just a signal to stop the hour of slack.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,080
Because we're so geniuses.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,660
Oh, it's lovely. Oh, it's so beautiful.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,400
Well, Dr. Watson, that was certainly a case of never the one for a man was that.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,760
On the contrary, we were both in the same position.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,300
Oh, no.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,480
Jesus Christ, come on down!

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,680
Come on!

10
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,000
Come on!

11
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,420
Come on!

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,380
Come on!

13
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,180
If you ever wondered how you get triangles from a cow you need

14
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,260
But a milk and cheese and an equilateral chainsaw

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,080
In debt I owe someone a fiver

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,080
Maybe I should try my hand at slack

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,200
James Dean was just a careless driver

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,240

From PR News in Washington, I'm bottoming out.

61
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,400
After 11 straight weeks of declines, I should soon be going back up again.

62
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,220
PR's report is causing headaches for companies trying to prepare next month's victims.

63
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,700
Taxpayers could see an average two-tax increase next year.

64
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,640
PR News.

65
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:40,780
PR's reports show shoppers say shoppers saw stores spending stocks shot in snow shop states.

66
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,660
Syria's president told reporters, this is PR News from Washington.

67
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,700
It's being described as another insider attack.

68
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,540
PR News has stirred outrage across the country.

69
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,660
Forecasters moving across the middle of the country say police staged PR News with a pistol in Washington.

Thanks to Lee Murr for that and the titles.

71
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:13,020
I have to do these credits quietly and quickly because I'm in a motel room and we have to get up early to go to Death Valley.

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:25,920
The song 99% of Gargoyles Look Like Bob Dobbs was by Half Man, Half Biscuit and is on the Bob Songs 5 CD.

73
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,700
Most of this show came about while we were in California.

74
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,140
First, we went to KPFA in Berkeley.

75
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,560
And did a puzzling evidence show.

76
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,160
And now we're swimming around in your mind.

77
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm just splashing my feet.

78
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,000
I just pushed her cough sensor.

79
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,580
I just took my socks off.

80
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,300
What's this crud floating on the surface?

81
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,660
Old Sequa will nibble your toes.

82
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,120
Well, I took my socks off in her brain there.

83
00:06:50,280 --> 00:07:01,100
Yes, the secret of old Sequa is that he doesn't so much live within the pit of the wisteria pond, but deep within the pit of your own mind.

84
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,800
I have to admit.

85
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,480
It's really terrible.

86
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,700
The waters are actually rather warm.

87
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,380
But there is a prehistoric turtle down in the depths.

88
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,360
A snapper.

89
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,520
Ready to shoot up and drag you down instantly in one gulp.

90
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,460
It's like everything in John's panorama ever right now.

91
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,840
Giant birds all over the place.

92
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,240
That's true.

93
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,980
It smells fishy.

94
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:32,140
I think old Sequa will shake your body around to soften the bones up and then stashes you under a shelf underwater.

95
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,500
I don't know if he shakes.

96
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,100
He stashes you, yes, but I don't think he shakes you.

97
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,300
He just drags you down.

98
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,280
Live at some place.

99
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,840
Live at somewhere con.

100
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,780
Yeah, live at some place.

101
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:50,740
Crocodilians and alligators shake their prey, but the snapping turtle, an opportunity feeder, just grabs it and drags it down.

102
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,240
Eating animal and vegetable indiscriminately.

103
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,240
An omnivore in the turtle family.

104
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,660
Do you know of any mermaids existing to this day?

105
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:02,840
No.

106
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,620


107
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,620


108
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,620


109
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,620


110
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,620


111
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,620


112
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,620


113
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,620


114
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,620


115
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:03,620


116
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,260
They're all organic.

117
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,720
When I'm feeling bad, I just throw some money at something.

118
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,600
Over this way.

119
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,580
There it goes.

120
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
I feel better all the time.

121
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,160
No, you overshot, damn it.

122
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,460
That's a lot of money.

123
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,560
I missed it, too.

124
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,640
We could have had the asteroid hit the planet for that much, and you guys just threw it away.

125
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,820
I could have had a V8 for a cheap laugh.

126
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,780
There you go.

127
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,920
We had a good time.

128
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,080
He's on the air.

129
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,160
He sent the meteorite.

130
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,840
Now that meteorite exploded in the air.

131
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,280
Isn't it?

132
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,700
In an airburst, fortunately, instead of striking on land, which would have been quite a problem.

133
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,080
Cheap pops and bad puns.

134
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,080
That's what we do here on the Puzzling Evidence Show.

135
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,780
Just keep it down to a dull roar and confine your shenanigans to the rumpus room.

136
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,500
I don't want to hear one peep out of your kids, and don't make me come up there.

137
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,360
Oh, yeah?

138
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,080
Well, what if?

139
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,300
I beg your pardon?

140
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,120
Yeah.

141
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,780
What if we don't want to listen to you?

142
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,620
Well, I...

143
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,160
I can hear him jumping on the bed.

144
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,260
He's up there right now.

145
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:04,900
That's right.

146
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,620
Yeah, what are you going to do about it?

147
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,400
Who's going to fight next?

148
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,100
What if...

149
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,840
Yeah, what if we don't want to listen to you?

150
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,540
Oh, that could never be.

151
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:11,960
What are we going to do?

152
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,240
If we don't...

153
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,240
If you don't want to listen to the Puzzling Evidence Show right now...

154
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,880
Wait, wait, wait.

155
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,500
Well, what...

156
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,340
Well, there are other things...

157
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,040
What kind of person are you talking about?

158
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,540
Who would not want to listen to this?

159
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,420
Who would not want to listen to this?

160
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,180
Oh, wait.

161
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:24,920
McAfee's over.

162
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,780
A suicide call.

163
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,180
It's a sad man.

164
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,400
Suicide call's over.

165
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,860
Who would not want to listen to this?

166
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,760
this. This stuff, this

167
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,700
dreck, this drivel, this pile of

168
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,040
stink. Not as sad as it is.

169
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,260
People don't want to listen to this show.

170
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,780
No, surely

171
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,980
not. This is a distempered

172
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,780
dream of Dr. Drummond.

173
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,900
Well, ever since Homeland Security came in, they make

174
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,780
you do everything. They force you to

175
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,200
listen to the show even now.

176
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,840
We didn't want to have to. We wanted people to do it

177
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,720
voluntarily. And we'd rather

178
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,800
be at home on the auto, man.

179
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,940
Stretched out, eating grapes.

180
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,660
But instead, we have to be here and

181
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,680
do this show.

182
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,540
And there's 11 or more cameras

183
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,740
just focused in on us right now.

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,220
11 time zones.

185
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,720
And there's 7 safeties

186
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,560
on the 45 and 18

187
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,060
cameras in the building. 18?

188
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,940
You counted them, huh?

189
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,520
No, that's what they said. They sent out a little email

190
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,580
to warn everybody.

191
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,220
But outside, they're also...

192
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,420
I'm going to start wearing a mask to the show.

193
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,860
That'll make me invisible.

194
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,540
They might know it was you

195
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,380
just the same. Shane's going to wear one of those

196
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,360
kind you wear when you're in front of a green screen.

197
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,520
Yeah, one of those dark, standard

198
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,440
darkly ones. They'll just shop me out

199
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,180
of it. Well, we can

200
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,420
always take you out. They'll shop

201
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,500
me. They'll just shop you out, too, whenever

202
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,680
they... Just take a still...

203
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,080
They'll shop you.

204
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,380
They'll shop you into the picture.

205
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,860
You'll feel the air rise.

206
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,540
Just take a still picture of the room and put it in front of the camera.

207
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,640
Yeah, there you go. Yeah, that's right.

208
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,520
No one would ever cut none of that.

209
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,680
Like the little... Oh, they do it in

210
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,780
a... Mad Magazine.

211
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,940
And Mad Magazine. Right.

212
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,800
It worked there. Yeah.

213
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,720
It worked with Stang. I put a

214
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,860
still picture of 1977 in front

215
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,680
of him. He never noticed.

216
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,700
You are bobsolete.

217
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,740
Sounds evil. That's terrible.

218
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,960
I protest.

219
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,440
You are bobsolete.

220
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,400
My attorney let me place

221
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,700
in the record...

222
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,540
You are no longer

223
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,200
of use to the society.

224
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,560
You are bobsolete.

225
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,920
Isn't there any young

226
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,280
person that will speak for me

227
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,000
or must I be... No, go

228
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,100
throw him into the lake of Soylent Green.

229
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,300
Don't take Halloway. I like

230
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
house. Don't take Halloway. There you

231
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,400
go. She's supporting me in my

232
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,300
last pathetic... Everybody

233
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,880
loves Hab Halloway.

234
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,060
That great jazz singer.

235
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,340
Hab Halloway.

236
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,400
He was ripped off by another guy.

237
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,100
Hoity ho, hoity ho.

238
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,320
There was a cigarette

239
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,340
dance that said, don't take

240
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,220
Halloway.

241
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,360
Don't take Halloway.

242
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,960
Hab Halloway

243
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,260
smokes Chesterfields.

244
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,700
They are mild.

245
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,940
The cigarettes?

246
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,920
Chesterfields, yes.

247
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,640
Named after Lord Chesterfield.

248
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,800
Who wrote such excellent letters

249
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,360
of advice to his son.

250
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,160
Yeah, Chesterfields

251
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,860
I guess would be the official cigarette

252
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,760
of the Church of the Septuagint.

253
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,260
As opposed to Raleigh,

254
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,300
which were smoked by Sir Walter.

255
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,000
Although Lucky Strikes were a real

256
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,600
runner up.

257
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,160
It's luck to catch one of those,

258
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,900
but nobody can.

259
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,860
What about Camel?

260
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,980
Which? What? What about...

261
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,460
Camel.

262
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,120
Camel.

263
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,300
Now the thing you have to understand

264
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,540
is that the reason why Chesterfields

265
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,060
are important is because that's the

266
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,900
brand that Jesus smoked.

267
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,520
Yes, we've been through this all

268
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,600
before. Jesus smoked Chesterfields.

269
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,260
But once the Camel gets its nose

270
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,760
under the tank, then, uh,

271
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,360
it's a little bit of a

272
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,360


273
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,360


274
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,360


275
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,360


276
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,360


277
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,360


278
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,360


279
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,360


280
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,360


281
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,500
one must give up.

282
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,480
The rest of the beast will soon follow.

283
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,980
But Satan smoked Lucky Strikes.

284
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,180
All the way through the eye of the needle.

285
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,580
No, no, what about Camel Crust?

286
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,760
LSMFT.

287
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,180
Crust.

288
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,300
Lucky Strikes means fine tobacco.

289
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,580
Says Satan.

290
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,320
It has to be some sort of satanic.

291
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,080
Loose straps mean floppy.

292
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,860
A little too hard on Satan's head.

293
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,440
I think you called the wrong show.

294
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,360
You can get cigarettes in hell

295
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,020
unless you're a smoker.

296
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,360
Even in a distant city?

297
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,820
They are inventing machines down there.

298
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,280
Yeah, that would be hell in itself

299
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,600
if you're a smoker but you can't

300
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,340
get cigarettes in hell.

301
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,400
That's your punishment.

302
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,420
Distant city on the steps

303
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,360
like Chelyabinsk.

304
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,240
Fine tobacco.

305
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,640
Still has all those cameras.

306
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,860
I'm taking notes of everything

307
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,540
you're saying here.

308
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,440
All these cameras that can

309
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,260
record something remarkable.

310
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:50,980
Yeah.

311
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,320
Even in that far corner of the

312
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
civilized world.

313
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:54,940
Right.

314
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,200
We now have dozens of videos

315
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,180
of the civilized world.

316
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,560
Among which,

317
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
are the most incredible footage

318
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,720
of such a natural event

319
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,120
that ever occurred.

320
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,960
Incredible.

321
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:06,960


322
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,160
Unbelievable.

323
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,380
Pretty possible.

324
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,620
One in particular has the sound

325
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,620
of the shock wave arriving.

326
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,720
Shock wave.

327
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,760
Shock wave.

328
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,580
And shattering windows.

329
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,980
You hear this cascade of breaking glass.

330
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,080
That was the astronaut,

331
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,600
the air burst of the asteroid.

332
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,940
Hold on.

333
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,880
I'm going to write this down.

334
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,600
Yes.

335
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,120
That's right.

336
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,320
That's happening right now.

337
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,560
Or is it?

338
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:30,560


339
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,940
Over the Pacific Ocean.

340
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,280
The skies of Russia.

341
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,600
Several hours ago,

342
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,520
they had the most remarkable

343
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,040
video ever obtained of a close

344
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,420
cup of Mirage Junior,

345
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,440
which was obtained.

346
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,460
They shot that?

347
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,700
They have it on video?

348
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,560
There are dozens of them now.

349
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,140
Dozens of videos?

350
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,260
You won't going to believe it.

351
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,300
Some of them looks like surveillance

352
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,720
cameras of an office,

353
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,600
and all of a sudden,

354
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,720
you see the window blown open

355
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,740
and the door on the opposite

356
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,140
side.

357
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,540
Same thing.

358
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:00,540


359
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:00,540


360
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:00,540


361
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:00,540


362
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:00,540


363
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:00,540


364
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:00,540


365
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:00,540


366
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:00,540


367
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:00,540


368
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,000
The paper is simultaneously

369
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,500
shoved the same direction,

370
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,300
and the papers are flying across the room.

371
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,740
It's like nuclear test films,

372
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,540
but within a modern living context.

373
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,500
There's a room with a door that was blown open,

374
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,540
and you can see the brilliant outdoors.

375
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,960
That's right here.

376
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,760
Smoke kind of going into the room.

377
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,420
But did you ever see the movie

378
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,360
Is that on YouTube now?

379
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,080
Day of the Trip?

380
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,640
Yes, yes.

381
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,700
Meteor, Russian explosion.

382
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,140
I wish I could give you URLs,

383
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,980
but I'll put something on the,

384
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,180
on Philo's Facebook page.

385
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,680
There's something weird going on here.

386
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,640
You know this is for a reference.

387
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,500
What is, what would you Google for that?

388
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,200
I'll give you the word Russia.

389
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,480
Why do you want the meteor?

390
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,620
It's always by the Russian meteor.

391
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,460
Russia is so big,

392
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,600
the chances mathematically are increased

393
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,340
that they would hit great big Russia.

394
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:45,820
But that's still,

395
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,000
you're talking about not just Russia,

396
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,540
you're talking about the entire surface

397
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,200
of the world.

398
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,680
Well, then they should follow the Pacific,

399
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,180
shouldn't they?

400
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:52,500
Exactly.

401
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,200
And maybe they do.

402
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:53,960
And in the US.

403
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,840
And in the Atlantic.

404
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,300
And everywhere.

405
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,040
But instead,

406
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,620
they always fall in Russia.

407
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,300
This is the world so far.

408
00:15:59,500 --> 00:15:59,900
But,

409
00:15:59,900 --> 00:15:59,960
this is the world so far.

410
00:15:59,960 --> 00:15:59,960


411
00:15:59,960 --> 00:15:59,960


412
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,320
Maybe Russians deserve it.

413
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,680
Anyway,

414
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,240
if you could put,

415
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,620
you probably don't have a computer there,

416
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,720
you could put something online,

417
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,460
but the audio of this one thing,

418
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,380
I'll reference it,

419
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,260
which is well worth listening to,

420
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,860
just for the,

421
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,880
the immensity of the sound.

422
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,260
You can hear the sound waves

423
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,020
slamming in the cascade of glass,

424
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,040
and then you hear the secondary explosions

425
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,720
from the,

426
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,500
the pieces that were trailing

427
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,920
each leading air shock wave.

428
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,360
It's terrible rotten smell

429
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,400
of burning flesh.

430
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,280
A horrible rotten smell.

431
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,820
The Siberian Tate is

432
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:29,940
the worst.

433
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940


434
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940


435
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940


436
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940


437
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940


438
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940


439
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940


440
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940


441
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:29,940


442
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,560
This is real.

443
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,520
Even the rogues of the church.

444
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,400
The rogues of the church

445
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,480
have nothing to do with it.

446
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:35,880
Well,

447
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,700
I heard that the Russians

448
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,080
don't love their children.

449
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,300
They're just making money.

450
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:39,900
They're not like us.

451
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,780
They're all rich like us.

452
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,720
They have no respect

453
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,960
for the sanctity of human beings.

454
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,780
I heard that on a

455
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,040
Seafrist for Communism movie.

456
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:47,940
Really?

457
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,620
But,

458
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:48,840
who,

459
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,420
seriously,

460
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,880
who else saw the movie

461
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,160
The Day of the Triffids?

462
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,000
I did.

463
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,620
I did.

464
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,440
I did teach her.

465
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,380
Who didn't see the movie?

466
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,000
I saw it a whole bunch of times,

467
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,320
teacher.

468
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:57,980
I saw it recently.

469
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,080
I saw it when I was a kid,

470
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,540
but remember,

471
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,360
I read the book.

472
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,060
it starts with a gorgeous

473
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,520
meteor shower

474
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,880
that everybody watches

475
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,520
and they say,

476
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,420
ooh and ah.

477
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,740
Everybody in the world

478
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,500
watches it.

479
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,160
Except one guy

480
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,580
who's got bandages

481
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,180
on his eyes

482
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,100
because he's in the hospital.

483
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,140
The next day,

484
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,420
everybody in the world

485
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,300
except that one guy

486
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:16,940
is blind.

487
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,600
No.

488
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,960
Because those meteors

489
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,860
that everyone was looking at

490
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,140
burned out their eyeballs.

491
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:23,480
Don't be scared.

492
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,220
Nobody else in the world

493
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,600
had a blind eye.

494
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,300
There's a whole crew

495
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:27,940
in a submarine.

496
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,000
There are people in mines.

497
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,520
There are people

498
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,240
in train cars.

499
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:30,980
They all get there

500
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,440
of course.

501
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,440
What's going on down there

502
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,680
at that station anyway?

503
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,080
We're trying to figure out

504
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,500
when to go to Gary's house.

505
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,800
We're having a party.

506
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,440
Culler,

507
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,120
can you suggest

508
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,520
when to go to Gary's house?

509
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,280
We're thinking Sunday night.

510
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,060
No,

511
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:46,780
come to my house.

512
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,700
Come to my house.

513
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,520
Okay, Culler,

514
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,280
that's what I'm saying.

515
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,340
We're all going

516
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,520
to little Big Bear's house.

517
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,260
We're going to go

518
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:53,940
to Gary's house

519
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,140
and then Baby Bear's house.

520
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,760
Because Baby Bear

521
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,720
is hiding the cop gun gun.

522
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,980
Baby Bear's hiding

523
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,000
the cop gun gun.

524
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,520
Baby Bear's hiding

525
00:17:59,520 --> 00:17:59,520


526
00:17:59,520 --> 00:17:59,520


527
00:17:59,520 --> 00:17:59,520


528
00:17:59,540 --> 00:17:59,640
the cop gun gun.

529
00:17:59,640 --> 00:17:59,640


530
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,680
where is your house?

531
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,320
Well,

532
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,540
my house is at the corner

533
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:02,780
from the auction.

534
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,520
Not yours.

535
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:03,940
Not yours,

536
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,320
Baby Bear.

537
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:04,900
What was that?

538
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,000
Not yours, Gary.

539
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,120
Not yours, I was asking

540
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,880
Baby Bear.

541
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,220
Yeah, not yours, Gary.

542
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Not yours, Gary.

543
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,480
I'm really getting tired

544
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,720
of this year after year.

545
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,260
This is not

546
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,380
your Gary business.

547
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,320
Not Baby Gary.

548
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,340
It's little Baby Gary.

549
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,460
I want to believe

550
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,660
I'm important, you know?

551
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,260
Well,

552
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,520
then you have to buy the band.

553
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,040
Oh, God.

554
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,800
You know, again.

555
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,740
All over again, yeah.

556
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,960
I thought he owned the band.

557
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,380
He did,

558
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:29,780
he had the best deal.

559
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,640
So how do I get

560
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,300
this surfboard

561
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,000
out of my butt

562
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,360
and why?

563
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,540
That's what I want to know.

564
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,480
It feels good there.

565
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,240
You need to weaponize

566
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,000
your surfboard.

567
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,000
Install some

568
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,040
automatic weapons.

569
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,780
Yeah, and also,

570
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,480
I thought that's

571
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,160
the name of the band.

572
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,040
Surfboard up my butt?

573
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,900
Something about

574
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,160
butthole...

575
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,980
I was always afraid

576
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,140
to say the name

577
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,520
of that band.

578
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,260
It's called

579
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,660
the Butthole Smurfs

580
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,420
or something like that.

581
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,200
Yeah, something like that.

582
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:54,460
Yeah.

583
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,780
Yeah, well, you know,

584
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,000
that's the thing.

585
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,780
It turns everything blue.

586
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,640
Stick a pencil

587
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,260
in your ear.

588
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,200
Oh, that's a different

589
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,440
album cover.

590
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,020
Never stick anything

591
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,460
smaller than your elbow

592
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,140
in your ear.

593
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,260
Wasn't that an album cover?

594
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:04,840
Yeah, it was.

595
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,280
It was.

596
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,660
It was a giant billboard

597
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,840
in Los Angeles, copyright

598
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,600
Paul McCready.

599
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,300
Oh, yeah.

600
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,800
Yes, it was.

601
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,420
And then after they

602
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,260
take down the billboard,

603
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,200
they give you the giant

604
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,820
piece of paper

605
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,500
that it's printed on.

606
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,500
You have to take care of it.

607
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,520
Oh, gosh, I would have...

608
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,460
But you'll never have

609
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,600
to buy toilet paper again.

610
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,180
Well, so I guess

611
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,100
we should all come down

612
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,720
and troop through

613
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,800
your museum wing.

614
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,680
The museum's wing.

615
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,580
Curiosities,

616
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,460
anomalies,

617
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,140
and oddities.

618
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,520
I was hoping...

619
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:30,660
Of weird protests

620
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,380
of nature and sports.

621
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,100
Grotesques in the grottos.

622
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,380
I was hoping all my

623
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,440
rich subgenius friends

624
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,300
would buy paintings

625
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,420
and then donate them

626
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,360
to the museum

627
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,560
like 30 seconds later

628
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,480
because they hate them.

629
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:41,920
Museum of pathetic mutations.

630
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,260
You were hoping, right?

631
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,300
Hoping against hope.

632
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,600
Hoping against hope.

633
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,520
That's grotesque

634
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,780
monstrosities of...

635
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,220
Holding off

636
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,420
on destroying the art?

637
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,020
Well, he doesn't

638
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,960
destroy the art anymore

639
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,940
because now it goes

640
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,700
into the giant

641
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
Gary Hughes wing.

642
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,800
That's right.

643
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,600
Is it because

644
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,440
he can't collect

645
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,980
on the art?

646
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,520
No, sure.

647
00:19:59,540 --> 00:19:59,820
Seriously,

648
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,340
there's a

649
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,100
Ghebregfran art wing

650
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,320
of the Santa Cruz

651
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:03,940
Museum.

652
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,040
Insects,

653
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,720
too late now.

654
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,460
Yeah, but it's

655
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,240
the broken wing.

656
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,260
Snakes,

657
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,580
moles,

658
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,400
birds.

659
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,080
It's limping around.

660
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,320
But now,

661
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,500
I presume it's

662
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,360
the left wing, right?

663
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,020
Name and piece.

664
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,680
It's the left wing.

665
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,440
And his enameled,

666
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,860
jeweled snuff box.

667
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,800
Your Philo's art

668
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,780
is in the other wing.

669
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,460
Philo's art is

670
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,100
in the other wing.

671
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,000
It's in the right wing

672
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,980
of the Peoria Museum.

673
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,340
I refuse to be

674
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,000
on any wing.

675
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm not a winger.

676
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,380
I'm a wingless man.

677
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,880
I don't have no wings.

678
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,620
Wingless man.

679
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,780
He's a flightless

680
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,200
bird of a man.

681
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:35,380
I do.

682
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,540
Now, just sit down

683
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:36,560
in the chair.

684
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,540
An emu of a man.

685
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,620
We'll have those wings

686
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,680
off in no time.

687
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,080
I've performed this

688
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,460
operation a hundred times.

689
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,200
There's nothing to fear.

690
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,040
Why do I want them all?

691
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,460
Why?

692
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,740
I got a email

693
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,580
yesterday from Sterno.

694
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,580
Wow.

695
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,240
Why?

696
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,280
And he said none

697
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,800
of you guys ever call him

698
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,740
or write him anymore.

699
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,980
He told me that he

700
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,680
only comes to me.

701
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,460
I tried to write him.

702
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,840
I said that about him

703
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,400
the other day.

704
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,000
He never calls

705
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,760
or writes or comes by anymore.

706
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,260
Okay.

707
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,420
Doesn't everyone

708
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:02,800
email?

709
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,020
We're all reactionaries.

710
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,520
We react.

711
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,780
I think I smell a scum.

712
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,180
Let's all just

713
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,540
letter bombs Sterno.

714
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,420
And by letter bomb

715
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,040
I don't mean like...

716
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,700
What a letter bomb?

717
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,820
He's not on the internet.

718
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:13,960
What letter bomb

719
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,820
do you mean by text bomb?

720
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,460
He only communicates

721
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,120
by text, he told me.

722
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,080
You know, I knew

723
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,780
a Jewish doctor

724
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,740
who was a terrible

725
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,280
letter bomber

726
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,960
when he was a kid.

727
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,000
Yeah, he only does

728
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,880
sex speech.

729
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,780
He sexts and texts.

730
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:27,960
Right.

731
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,660
Letter bomber?

732
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:28,980
Yeah.

733
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:28,980


734
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,300
Is that the person?

735
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,240
Hey, hey, is this

736
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,760
where I'm supposed

737
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,440
to say something

738
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,400
about Frank Zappa?

739
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,060
Sucks.

740
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,360
I'm gonna send some...

741
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,600
There you go.

742
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,660
I'm gonna send some...

743
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,200
Oh, I feel so liberated.

744
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,800
I'm gonna sext a message

745
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,120
to Sterno right now.

746
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,480
You've really caused

747
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,400
the Christmas tree

748
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,640
to light up like a board

749
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,700
with your last remark.

750
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,500
Oh, I know.

751
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,500
I do that on purpose.

752
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,200
It's just to drag out

753
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,440
the Zappa cultists.

754
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,780
It's a drag out,

755
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,660
knock down Zappa

756
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:54,660


757
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,520
I'm gonna take a picture

758
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,060
of something sexy.

759
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,360
All right, throw it

760
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:58,360


761
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:58,360


762
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:58,360


763
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:58,880
All right, throw it

764
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,760
in the towel over it.

765
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,060
Yeah.

766
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,960
Um, let's, uh...

767
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,520
He was gonna visit

768
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,920
everybody in Santa Fe.

769
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,520
...growing roses

770
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
in sedate floral gardens

771
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,340
where perfumes wafted

772
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,540
upon summery daisies

773
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,760
are idly fanned

774
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,060
by the wings of huge

775
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,500
hovering butterflies

776
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,780
and lunar moths.

777
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,620
Hmm, deep fried wings

778
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,060
of huge hovering butterflies.

779
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,140
Don't you guys get

780
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,220
better stock footage

781
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,620
to go with that narration?

782
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,900
...of hanging grapes,

783
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:26,980


784
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,140
We have one of those

785
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,920
butterfly wings

786
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:28,980
that are like

787
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:28,980


788
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:28,980


789
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:28,980


790
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:28,980


791
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:28,980


792
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:28,980


793
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,280
a allegations.

794
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:47,920
I am очie...

795
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,040
That's a native

796
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,520
Man with wings...

797
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:52,580
That's a monster

798
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:52,980
that's make the most

799
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,480
sound in the thành

800
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:58,940
õ...

801
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:57,980
...crie...

802
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,220
This is a true anecdote.

803
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,920
My father's dog ate my father's teeth.

804
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,940
My father had, Pappy, had all false teeth.

805
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,680
And he left them out.

806
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,260
And the dog just loved the taste of his master's slobber.

807
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,000
So he chewed on those dentures.

808
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,220
Hence, I can say the dog ate Pappy's teeth.

809
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,820
That'll teach your dad to slobber on his dentures.

810
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,220
Yeah, right.

811
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,180
How disquietingly distasteful.

812
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,640
If he'd brush once in a while, he wouldn't have those problems.

813
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,840
Yeah, he could scare the hell out of little kids by popping those things out.

814
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,440
Don't slobber on your dentures.

815
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,780
I used to be that little kid.

816
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,000
An indentured servant.

817
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,920
No, please, no.

818
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,820
When I grow up and get some dentures, I'm not going to slobber all over them.

819
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,400
Brave words now, Philo.

820
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,880
Let's see if when it gets right down to the rough and tumble, you're able not to eat them.

821
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,560
Yeah, okay.

822
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,200
Yeah, well, I turned down some the other night.

823
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,640
Somebody offered me a plate of dentures and, you know, like...

824
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,800
Turn down the top sheet and put a mint on the pillow.

825
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,820
Was it a variety?

826
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,080
Pull down the top sheet and pull the hell you're in, Hal.

827
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,880
You're going to sink the boat if you...

828
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,400
Hal sunk the boat.

829
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,860
I did not.

830
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,020
I piloted her truly to where she should have been.

831
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,380
Hal sunk the boat and Bob screwed the pooch.

832
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,880
Ever last time.

833
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,700
It's the same...

834
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:28,980
As ever.

835
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,480
It's the same, you know.

836
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,880
You flew the coop when you...

837
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,060
After you sunk the boat.

838
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,620
I know that.

839
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,600
Sink the boat.

840
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,480
That's how you realize that you now have several million...

841
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
He hit the...

842
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,780
Because the pilot...

843
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,200
He sunk the boat, hit the road, and flew the coop.

844
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,420
All at the same time.

845
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,600
Fans are fans.

846
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,080
Yes.

847
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,540
I'm sure you can...

848
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,580
I think Baby Bear did the same thing.

849
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,500
First of all, I'm sure it's...

850
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:56,740
I'm sure it's...

851
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,960
An uphill battle against...

852
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,220
The sound effects now.

853
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,320
And now...

854
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,480
I can't breathe.

855
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,440
I can't breathe.

856
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,640
If only we could hear you...

857
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,680
So it's just all there?

858
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,020
Must reach volume switch.

859
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,860
Yeah, it's just guys talking real loud about how they can't hear anything.

860
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,080
I can't hear a thing.

861
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,220
Well, I can hear it all.

862
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,300
Of course you can.

863
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,100
Every last word.

864
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,500
They just can't hear it.

865
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,980
That's what I've been waiting for is the last word.

866
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,860
Now, where is it?

867
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,800
Around like two in the morning.

868
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,960
I think you're sitting on it.

869
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,000
It was at 420.

870
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,960
Oh, the princess is there too.

871
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,100
Yeah.

872
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,220
Everyone's there.

873
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,340
Where's Michael Pepe?

874
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:35,880
Right here.

875
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,140
Is this the one about the lady that was at the side of the road?

876
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:39,960
Yeah.

877
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,100
There is no princess.

878
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:41,780
It is not.

879
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,560
It is not.

880
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:43,920
Right.

881
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,040
Can you hurry this up?

882
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,080
It's the same old story that lots of people tell.

883
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,000
She's a magical person.

884
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,680
In Navajo country, it's a guy's uncle.

885
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,800
In the Appalachians, it's their aunt.

886
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,940
The wailing woman.

887
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,020
In Slovakia, it's a grandmother.

888
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,720
La Iona.

889
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:56,940
La Iona.

890
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,260
Is she a grandmother?

891
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,500
No, it's not Slovakia.

892
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,920
She was old and she was giant and she was in the pitch black with a staff and it was 2.25 in the morning in the mountain.

893
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,320
You don't want to mess around with her.

894
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,260
No, ma'am.

895
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,060
No, you don't.

896
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,420
I know.

897
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,960
Was she there when you came back?

898
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,400
She was walking.

899
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,600
She's there now.

900
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,740
She was walking.

901
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,700
She's still there because you didn't give her a ride.

902
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,660
Don't.

903
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,780
Don't give her a ride.

904
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,420
Don't feed the ghost women.

905
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,880
You might make the offer just to be polite.

906
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,480
Hey, do you guys have any kept women down there I can use?

907
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,140
You know, what they do is they want to drink some blood.

908
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,140
Ghosts always want that.

909
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,220
If you put out a bowl of blood for them, they'll be very happy.

910
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,280
You know, after a couple of days, it becomes a gap.

911
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,180
I think she's a vampire.

912
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,460
You can see the level of the blood go down when they drink it.

913
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,580
Well, it's just a courtesy to them.

914
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,140
They want to.

915
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,880
They want to.

916
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,420
You should sip off the bottom of the bowl.

917
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,740
The blood doesn't get as.

918
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,640
Why do you think she's a vampire?

919
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,400
What do you mean?

920
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,920
They want what they can never have.

921
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,980
Well, and it takes all day for the ghost to drink the.

922
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,680
I don't know.

923
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,160
I just sounded good at the minute.

924
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,880
Sometimes you can see the level dropping down rather swiftly.

925
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,500
Oh, really?

926
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,800
It's really easy.

927
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,900
If you centrifuge the blood before you drink it, then you can have the antibodies one by

928
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,440
one, and then all the blood solids, and then at the last, you can just top it off with

929
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,400
a big drink of plastic.

930
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,400


931
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,400


932
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,400


933
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,400


934
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:25,740
And then you can have asthma.

935
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,460
By Jove, that's the key.

936
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,280
Much better that way.

937
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,320
I think we should do an experiment.

938
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,460
Which is current cancer.

939
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,380
The red cells of courage.

940
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,180
The red cells of green courage.

941
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,200
That's right.

942
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,780
They may be red as it were said.

943
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,980
All aboard the razor train.

944
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,940
But their money is green.

945
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,340
With this razor.

946
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,500
So I'm going to be in San Francisco for an hour tomorrow.

947
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,440
Slice away error.

948
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,200
Oh, you are.

949
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,620
Are you?

950
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,120
An hour?

951
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,520
What time?

952
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,500
I'm coming up to sell my car.

953
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,900
Sell your car?

954
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,400
Well, how are you planning to get a better job?

955
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,400


956
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,400


957
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,400


958
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,400


959
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,400


960
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,620
I'm going to drive out with a new car.

961
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,900
Well, I'm still on my truck.

962
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,420
A truck, eh?

963
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,340
You can drive one with each hand.

964
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:02,880
There's plenty of room.

965
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,260
There's plenty of room in it, pal.

966
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,060
We'll take you to Arkansas in the back.

967
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,880
Oh, okay.

968
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,580
We'll strap you down.

969
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,180
We'll give you a couple shots of Nemutol and...

970
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,820
The Arkenstone of Thrain.

971
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,980
Dr. Gubrog, friend, is this the car that you scared me to death in last year?

972
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,800
Whoa.

973
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,200
The hot rod sports car?

974
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,780
Yeah, it's being sold tomorrow.

975
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,940
It's a gold...

976
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,060
Oh, thank God.

977
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,380
...car.

978
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,380


979
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,380


980
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,380


981
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,380


982
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,380


983
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,380


984
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,800
You know, it's just filled up with ghouls and I can't get them out now, so I've got

985
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:31,980
a...

986
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,100
I've got a...

987
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,560
And plates of blood spilled all over...

988
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
Igor, you fool.

989
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,880
Be a little more cool.

990
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,920
I brought my mummy with me.

991
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,960
I love this guy.

992
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,240
Oh.

993
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,360
Gary took me for a ride in the hills in that...

994
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,140
He took him for a ride.

995
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,580
...fancy car of his and...

996
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,900
I gave him a concrete...

997
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,100
...heal my soul...

998
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,200
Well, that's one of the problems.

999
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,120
I was never able to get rid of the smell after that.

1000
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,360
I think that you're not supposed to be scared.

1001
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,360


1002
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,360


1003
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,360


1004
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,360


1005
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,360


1006
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,360


1007
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,360


1008
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:55,820
I'm not supposed to.

1009
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,580
We're on the way.

1010
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,080
Oh, the smell of it goes on.

1011
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,500
Well, we design and create and manufacture an outrageous line of products to handle

1012
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,840
problems just like this.

1013
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,040
All out of the oil of the common polecat or skunk.

1014
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,600
We call it piggy on the potty.

1015
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,060
It's great stuff.

1016
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,660
Our pot on the piggy on the...

1017
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:22,320
Is it true that somebody, some visitors might be on our planet as soon as Sunday?

1018
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,400
Well, it might be.

1019
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,280
It would be Sunday night if I think.

1020
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:28,900
Sunday night.

1021
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,300
We're the sleeping air.

1022
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,080
Bob has not told us what to do fully yet.

1023
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,880
We're awaiting his instructions.

1024
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,460
Would you have a place on your floor for a stang to lie?

1025
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,840
Well, we have a...

1026
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,260
...weary head.

1027
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,180
Yeah, we do.

1028
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:42,780
We do.

1029
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,020
There would not be a Princess Wee with me, unfortunately.

1030
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,500
She's helping the Queen Mum of...

1031
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,380
The Queen Bee Mother is again filled with honey to the brim and has a lot of...

1032
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,380


1033
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,380


1034
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,380


1035
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,380


1036
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,380


1037
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,380


1038
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,380


1039
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,380


1040
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,380


1041
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,420
...she has to be bled again with...

1042
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,700
She's laying eggs again.

1043
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,920
...meeting bubbles.

1044
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,080
She's...

1045
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,540
...beating bubbles.

1046
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,340
Her pulsating abdomen is...

1047
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,440
...winking at the brim.

1048
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,780
...is heaving out those...

1049
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,400
...and purple stangers...

1050
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,920
And we're thinking about driving to the Pinnacles.

1051
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,580
We'll be in the camper and then coming to your place that evening.

1052
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,960
Home of the giant California cumber.

1053
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,240
...that spreads its wings and blackens the sky.

1054
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,740
We're hoping puzzling evidence would be with us as well.

1055
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,100
Okay, well, we have enough floor for you.

1056
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,220
Under the unrushing wings of darkness...

1057
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,380
...we're hoping puzzling evidence would be with us as well.

1058
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:24,380


1059
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:24,380


1060
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,420
And we have a comforter for you, too.

1061
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,160
A monstrous crow.

1062
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,320
It's a monstrous comforter.

1063
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,000
She's a little furry, but she's warm.

1064
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,800
Oh, look at that.

1065
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,040
And you can stretch her out over...

1066
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,760
How cute.

1067
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,220
Oh, my.

1068
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,200
Well, all right, I...

1069
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,700
Very crazy.

1070
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,800
We were thinking about going to Pinnacles National Monument, which last two days ago

1071
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
became Pinnacles National Park.

1072
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,960
Just listen to Pinnacle Pete over there.

1073
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,360
What's funny is they...

1074
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,360


1075
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,360


1076
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,360


1077
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,360


1078
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,360


1079
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,360


1080
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,360


1081
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,360


1082
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,540
It was like front-page news.

1083
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,460
There was a beautiful photograph of the pinnacle-shaped phallic rocks.

1084
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,540
I'm telling you, there's a...

1085
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,280
And I swear to God, there were people on Yahoo!

1086
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,260
Comments going, see, they're programming our mind.

1087
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,920
They could have shown any photograph of rocks, and instead they showed that one.

1088
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,880
That, you know, implying that...

1089
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,900
The pinnacles.

1090
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,840
Now, as far as I know, everywhere you look at pinnacles, you see rocks that look

1091
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,740
like, well, pebbles.

1092
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,800
They're swinging federal...

1093
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,300
Well, you do.

1094
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,340
And you also...

1095
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:24,340


1096
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,660
You also see the giant condors living there in the trees.

1097
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,220
Right, and you do a butt.

1098
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,800
Some of us also see the rocks that look like butts or bosoms or faces.

1099
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,980
Rocks that look like butts, and there's also a cave full of giant spiders that you

1100
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,560
have to go through.

1101
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:38,840
But these paranoids...

1102
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,140
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the whole idea.

1103
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,460
The path leads through there, and after that, it gets even harder.

1104
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,360
It's one of the toughest paths ever.

1105
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,020
Oh, great.

1106
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,440
I nearly died on it.

1107
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,500
What are you talking about?

1108
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,360
Yeah, the path at the pinnacle that goes up over the saddle.

1109
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:53,480
Which trail did you take?

1110
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,020
The one that goes over the saddle of the mountains.

1111
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,600
There are six trails.

1112
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,440
Well, the one that goes through the cave of the outsized arachnids.

1113
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:03,580
Oh, yeah.

1114
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:03,900
You counted them?

1115
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,800
Yeah, that's a strenuous trail.

1116
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,520
I never had trouble on that trail.

1117
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,060
Oh, it's...

1118
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,660
I almost did.

1119
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,140
I'm just exaggerating.

1120
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,180
I did fine.

1121
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,860
I did just fine.

1122
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:17,020
Well, anyway, the point is the conspiracy built those rocks to look like phallic symbols

1123
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,140
because they're messing with our mind.

1124
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,560
That was the point of the Yahoo comment.

1125
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,460
I thought they were just doing it to get comments.

1126
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:23,460


1127
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:23,460


1128
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:23,460


1129
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:23,460


1130
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,720
They're just doing it to get comments on YouTube or something.

1131
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,920
Well, they got it mentioned on the show.

1132
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,640
Learn how to use the internet or get off.

1133
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,580
I don't speak their lingo.

1134
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:37,720
I don't know why you want to follow a series into a sick place so they can be in peace.

1135
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,120
I'd kill that caller, would you?

1136
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,980
I don't think it's that I'm deaf.

1137
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,660
I think it's that cell phones are getting worse.

1138
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,700
I'm far off, I'm lost.

1139
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:51,860
I'm sorry.

1140
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,740
I got nuts.

1141
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,440
I'm sorry.

1142
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:53,440


1143
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:53,440


1144
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,720
I don't think that's it.

1145
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,360
You guys make me want to cry and remember the people that I once was.

1146
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,880
Why hidest thou thyself in time of trouble?

1147
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,360
Yeah, they're trying hard to be on show.

1148
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,960
Be with show.

1149
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,860
Be in show.

1150
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,480
The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor.

1151
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:15,380
Let them be taken in the devices which they have imagined.

1152
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,200
All those other mattress guys, are they not there tonight?

1153
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,140
Mattress?

1154
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,020
Pookie and the mattress folks aren't here.

1155
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,860
The Plecto mattress company?

1156
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,540
Mookie and the mattress people are...

1157
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,020
I think they're playing down at Bob's Pub or somewhere.

1158
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,220
The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after God.

1159
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,940
Oh, Mookie and the mattress backs, though.

1160
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,680
They're down there at the other place.

1161
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,560
God is not at all in his thoughts.

1162
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,280
His ways are always grievous.

1163
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,780
His judgments are far above and out in the sun.

1164
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,600
Dookie and the dumpster divers.

1165
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,340
As for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

1166
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,780
You puff.

1167
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,320
Puff.

1168
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,440
Puff.

1169
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,700
Puff.

1170
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:53,920
Puff.

1171
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,940
Bob is the box.

1172
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,920
Bob is the box you have to think outside of.

1173
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,740
He hath said in his heart.

1174
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,200
Huh?

1175
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,080
I shall not be moved, for I shall never be in adversity.

1176
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,340
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud.

1177
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,560
You guys can't be cursing on that nice, pretty radio show of y'all.

1178
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,280
Under his tongue lieth deceit and vanity.

1179
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,940
We don't say the seven deadly words of Christ, but we say the rest of them freely and openly.

1180
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,780
Like poo-poo, you say that.

1181
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
We say poo-poo.

1182
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,020
You say left nut.

1183
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,940
You ever say that?

1184
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:26,400
Yeah.

1185
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:30,240
It depends on the context, Dr. Gibbard-Fran.

1186
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,800
We say arse town from time to time.

1187
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,100
Oh, wow.

1188
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,360
It's more context than the word itself.

1189
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,660
Yeah, well, I don't have to use context anymore since I went through menopause.

1190
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,980
He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages.

1191
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,940
In the secret places doth he murder the innocent.

1192
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,200
Those are pretty castanets, too.

1193
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,520
Do you know of any medication that helps with the woes of menopause?

1194
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,920
Well, you know...

1195
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,880
Because I think I'm starting to catch that.

1196
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,020
He's a man who's being put on pause.

1197
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,500
That's right.

1198
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,960
That's why they make Cialis, Reverend Stang.

1199
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,780
Just go see Alice.

1200
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
She'll treat you fine.

1201
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,740
Menopause.

1202
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,380
Hand effect.

1203
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,280
Gland effect.

1204
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,200
That's it.

1205
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,220
Transplant usually is the best thing.

1206
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,560
Total body transplant.

1207
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:27,800
And try a steel wool rubdown at S&M-Olin Recreational Park.

1208
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,140
And not to mention a good power buffing helps.

1209
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,160
True.

1210
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,520
You can't be too buff here in California.

1211
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,640
No.

1212
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,540
Be a buffster like everybody else and you'll prosper and flourish.

1213
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,700
Also, we recommend a full exfoliating scrub genius.

1214
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,920
Well, around here we just peel ourselves.

1215
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,760
We don't peel our skins off like the little reptiles.

1216
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:58,020
We don't have eczema or pandouty or any of those other diseases.

1217
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,540
Because we're just able to cut our entire skin at once.

1218
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,480
We whip our skin back.

1219
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,240
We clip the claws on our menopause.

1220
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,580
Yeah.

1221
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,280
Yeah, what he said.

1222
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:20,860
Now, I'm going to stop the show until I sell just one.

1223
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,140
I'm going to sell just one of these magnificent watches.

1224
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,360
Everyone ought to have a watch like this.

1225
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,500
It's one that will probably make that girl.

1226
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,600
You've got your eyes on.

1227
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,100
Sit up and take notice of you.

1228
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,640
And she'll say, say, what a handsome watch that young buck is.

1229
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,040
I never noticed how cute you were.

1230
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,260
He must be a good provider.

1231
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,440
He has a handsome watch.

1232
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:45,580
Now, I'm going to tell you, you can expect to pay at least $12 for a fine watch like this with a nickel steel casing.

1233
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,580
But you don't even have to pay $12.

1234
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,240
You don't have to pay $11.

1235
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,920
You can pay $5 and $12.

1236
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,200
You can pay $37.8.

1237
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,080
Now, wait a minute. Where are you getting that?

1238
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,140
That's kind of wild.

1239
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,800
We're making an incredible offer with these fabulous steel watches.

1240
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,580
We're cutting out the middle man.

1241
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:05,640
We're cutting out the top man, the under man, the low man on the totem pole.

1242
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,400
We're going straight to the manufacturer.

1243
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,380
This has a high tensile mainspring of Toledo steel.

1244
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,300
We're even going to cut out the manufacturer to get this price down to nothing for you.

1245
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,740
But who watches the watch salesman?

1246
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,620
Robin numerals that roam all over the dial.

1247
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,800
This watch is so tiny you can't even see it on your arm.

1248
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,620
It's so lightweight. It won't cause any stress.

1249
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,580
It's crystal starts fires and tortures grasshoppers.

1250
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,580
And it's stately, saintly case clicks firmly in place.

1251
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,560
But do you have an under-putting watch that works down to 300 feet of footing?

1252
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,940
Yeah, this special compartment holds, well, your medicine.

1253
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,240
It's a very well-known watch.

1254
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,040
It's so dark down there the light on the watch has to be really bright to even see it.

1255
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,160
No problem. Built-in LED light shows the way.

1256
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:04,380
So when you get to the bottom of the pudding, you can still see at least one nano-inch in front of you.

1257
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,460
Clockwork mechanism plays Annie Laurie as ringtone.

1258
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,660
Annie Laurie or just a specific one?

1259
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,880
Annie Laurie, the song Annie Laurie.

1260
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,340
Oh, yes.

1261
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,920
Some people were raised in a barnyard.

1262
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,140
You guys ought to be on the home shopping channel.

1263
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,060
Only 27 shopping days till Axe Max.

1264
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,960
Oh, no.

1265
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,940
But how many... What day is Cuthbert?

1266
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,940
Counting down the calendar to St. Swithin's Day.

1267
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:43,840
And at the end of St. Cuthbert's Festival, all readily available mails will be in bowels.

1268
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,820
I always loved St. Cuthbert.

1269
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,660
St. Cuthbert was a fine saint.

1270
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,780
You know, one weird thing about him was his body never corrupted.

1271
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:59,460
Centuries after centuries, they kept opening his coffin just to give him a haircut and a nail clipping.

1272
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:00,820
Really?

1273
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,640
Yes, and finally...

1274
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,360
It didn't do any good, though.

1275
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,320
Well, finally, the last time they opened it, he was looking kind of mummified and skeletal.

1276
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,320
And now he's just a skeleton surrounded by holy relics.

1277
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,920
If they hadn't been opening his grave up and opening the closed...

1278
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,280
Open and close, open and close...

1279
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,920
He's probably saying, keep that damn door shut!

1280
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:29,300
These holy relics include fragments of the true cross, water from the fountain of Gethsemane, and a small Japanese transistor radio.

1281
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,300
You kids must have been raised in a bar!

1282
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,500
I told you kids not to bother me when I'm broadcasting!

1283
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,080
A small Japanese transistor radio...

1284
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,060
Don't you know what rest in peace means?

1285
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,360
That's no kitty cat, that's a skunk! It's a skunk!

1286
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,220
I've been growing that hair for a long time now!

1287
00:39:51,480 --> 00:40:02,360
January and February are the times of year when most dogs, cats, people, and sometimes even passing cars get sprayed by old rare skunk.

1288
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,160
Don't you be trimming my nails if you used to grow that little one out just so I could pick my nose!

1289
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:14,220
Your average skunk can shoot an oily mixture out of two specialized glands in their anuses...

1290
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:14,980
Ah!

1291
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,740
...and cause severe pinpoint accuracy from ten feet away!

1292
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,900
Get that pin out of there!

1293
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,320
My mouth is watering!

1294
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:27,860
This pale yellow fluid can cause temporary blindness and severe nasal and mucous membrane inflammation.

1295
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,220
Why, that's so tight you couldn't drive a pin up there with a ball-peen hammer!

1296
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:41,500
The hideous combination smell of this santorum of garlic, rotten egg, and burned rubber is so powerful that it can ward off bears...

1297
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,060
Don't forget the burning flash.

1298
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,960
...and be detected at least a mile away.

1299
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,180
You can wash it off with X-T-D flush.

1300
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:57,680
Yes, the reeking stench is nearly impossible to get off and can linger for months. That's why we recommend...

1301
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,180
You just can't wash them out.

1302
00:40:59,460 --> 00:40:59,860
Yes.

1303
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,520
And how come it isn't the best pot smells exactly like what you're describing?

1304
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,580
It's one of the mysteries.

1305
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,460
Here is Jehovah One in his senility...

1306
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,320
That's not a coincidence!

1307
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,940
Jehovah One in his senility got a few bio details mixed up in his...

1308
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,900
...and wires crossed as so often it does.

1309
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,860
So where are we having breakfast this morning?

1310
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,880
At Dream Fluff Girl Donuts.

1311
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,820
Donut-uh-uh-teria.

1312
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,260
Godfud, you mean?

1313
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,040
The only successful skunk predator is...

1314
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,880
We go to Dream Fluff Girl.

1315
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,400
...the great horned owl...

1316
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,800
You know, I just thought we could break into my old house in Oakland and we could go to breakfast there.

1317
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,100
...which flies silently down, expanding its huge wings...

1318
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:43,300
...and it sticks its talons right into the struggling, squealing skunk...

1319
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,560
...and flaps off into the night sky with its odorous prey.

1320
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,200
A great horned owl has no sense of smell...

1321
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,560
...and it can swoop silently undetected from above.

1322
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:01,220
It's easy for its giant eyes to spot the tell-tale stripes of a skunk...

1323
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,420
...pumping along bent on mischief.

1324
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,460
Gary, it's 75 miles from your house after we leave the pinnacles.

1325
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,140
After you leave the pinnacles, it's only 75 miles?

1326
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,300
Well, that's if we go...

1327
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,320
We need to go up to the 101 side entrance.

1328
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,900
Why? Oh, okay.

1329
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,340
Because it would be quicker to come back to Gary's.

1330
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,040
Don't we get to use the secret underground tunnel?

1331
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,840
Yeah, I'm going to use the secret Gloria Road, but you're right.

1332
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,780
What about the submarine?

1333
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,500
It's Purdy. Either one's Purdy. But I go up Gloria Road because...

1334
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,960
If you are confronted by a skunk, remember the seven safety signals to disarm when skunk attacks.

1335
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,080
I'm not sure if the motorhome... I mean, it's a one-lane old silly road.

1336
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:49,760
...striped skunks lift their tails and stamp their feet before turning around, lifting their tails, and letting fly.

1337
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,700
It's not one of the two parking lots. It's a different entrance than one of the...

1338
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,780
No, it comes out onto...

1339
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,740
Spotted skunks not found in this bioregion actually stand on their hands to squirt you.

1340
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,200
They stand on their hands to squirt you?

1341
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,120
Now that is cool.

1342
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,620
Oh, yeah, okay. I know what you're talking about.

1343
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,240
That's the first interesting thing I've heard on this show.

1344
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,760
But we're not going to go in on the east side where you come down out of Hollister.

1345
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,740
Well, those are the skunks in your vicinity, Reverend Stang.

1346
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,800
Where you come down out of Hollister.

1347
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,820
In California, they don't do that.

1348
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,480
Oh, yeah, yeah. There you're right.

1349
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:23,560
But where you live, right next to that giant gorilla statue in your front yard, they will stand on their hands and do their business.

1350
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:32,540
Yes, quick movements are never a good idea around the easily irritated animals who startle easily.

1351
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,040
Yes, if you see skunks, you just let them know you're there.

1352
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,780
You make some noise and just sort of stand up for yourself.

1353
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,480
And they generally run away.

1354
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,440
You can't blame them for spraying every now and then.

1355
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,620
It's part of their defense mechanism.

1356
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,640
Surely you wouldn't deny them this one simple pleasure.

1357
00:43:53,020 --> 00:44:04,460
It wouldn't be so cold and inhuman as to force Br'er Skunk never more to release his effuvium upon the lambent breezes.

1358
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,020
Dr. Howell, I've heard a theory.

1359
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,760
I've heard the theory advanced that our animals are not as good as they used to be.

1360
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:10,760


1361
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:25,700
Our ancestors, the Primo Anthropocus, despite being weak and without claws or sharp teeth, smelled so bad that carnivores avoided them.

1362
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:32,260
They did because they were without the ability to groom themselves.

1363
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,000
And they didn't bathe.

1364
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,240
Evolutionary oversight.

1365
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,740
But we, in our days of microchips and microchips, we were able to do it.

1366
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:40,740


1367
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:48,240
And moon rockets have evolved many caustic soaps which will scrub the sin from the quivering flesh.

1368
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,840
But a skunk meat chimichanga is better than almost anything, wouldn't you say, Doctor?

1369
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:57,780
Well, as long as it's been deodorized, the skunk flesh is savory.

1370
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:03,660
And the Skunkawatomi Indians used to make it part of the staple of their diet.

1371
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,640
You gonna make that skunk dinner, Benny?

1372
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,820
Covered with cheese and skunkalotta sauce.

1373
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:09,340
Mmm.

1374
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,320
Bring that fresh skunk in there. It tastes pretty good after you de-stinkify him.

1375
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,160
Skunks have good hearing and a good sense of smell, but terrible eyesight.

1376
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:23,000
Which is why they can't read newspaper articles and may get hit by cars more frequently.

1377
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:29,160
The skunks and the ducks have a very similar family ethic, which makes me love both of them.

1378
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:34,360
The male walks proudly in front, followed by the female and the little skunk.

1379
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,920
Well, skunks are not related closely to ducks.

1380
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:45,920
Skunks, which are sometimes called stink badgers or polecats, are members of the mephitidae family.

1381
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,480
A unique group of m-m-m-m-mammals.

1382
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,760
Where we go, they're called civicae.

1383
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:59,900
They're similar to, but genetically different from, ferrets, weasels, otters, badgers, wolverines, and African bull elephants.

1384
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:07,900
Skunks in France are known... male skunks in France often mistake commonest animals for male.

1385
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,980
They're called house cats for female skunks.

1386
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,060
They are called les peuves.

1387
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,240
Yes, if they happen to walk under a ladder with white paint on it or something.

1388
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,960
A common misfortune to house cats in France.

1389
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:25,380
Causing the amorous skunk to fixate upon the feline victim.

1390
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:29,220
And not to mention the horrid French stinky cat.

1391
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,080
Oh, worst of all.

1392
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,900
So you see...

1393
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,220
They don't, those cats don't shave their arms, it's more anything.

1394
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,080
They are slinky and most appealing.

1395
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:52,260
Philo's brother had a one-eyed cat that loved to have you insert your pinky into its furry little eye socket and rub it back and forth.

1396
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,260
Oh, how that cat would purr.

1397
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,880
I once saw a gotch-eyed cat in a green grocer's window in Idaho.

1398
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,300
That cat was the fightingest cat there ever was.

1399
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,280
And what happened eventually, he got in another fight and lost his other eye.

1400
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:06,940
No way!

1401
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,660
Walked into a blind tank and fell in.

1402
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:14,400
He eventually became a totally blind cat, wandering around the house by sense of smell and hearing and habit.

1403
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,960
I told the barkeep I hadn't had a bite in weeks, so he bit me.

1404
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,220
But no kidding.

1405
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,540
It didn't seem to bother him that much.

1406
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,760
He just used his other senses and just managed to get around.

1407
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,980
And at these prices, you're not likely to. No, but seriously.

1408
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,580
That was an orange tabby named Slick.

1409
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:33,660
Slick?

1410
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,260
Slick.

1411
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,620
Yeah, my friends had a blind horse that...

1412
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,800
He had a younger female horse that led him around.

1413
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,820
It was a little nursemaid. It was pretty scary.

1414
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:46,240
I could do somebody that had a goat, had a horse that had a friend that was a goat.

1415
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,680
An old horse and a goat were like best friends in the pasture.

1416
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,240
Don't pay any attention to that old goat.

1417
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:01,140
Out on Stang Ranch, we had a goat that thought he was a cow and would follow the cattle around.

1418
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,580
What a moo-ving story.

1419
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,240
Yep.

1420
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:04,700
It was...

1421
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,660
I love the female address they have.

1422
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,340
Pus Ev.

1423
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,060
You love the female what?

1424
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,860
The Pus Ev they have.

1425
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,400
Have you seen on KPFA it says, Pus Ev?

1426
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,100
Pus Ev.

1427
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,420
Oh, come on now.

1428
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,760
It's the wrong email address.

1429
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,220
Are you sure?

1430
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,340
Pussy Ev.

1431
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,700
I'm looking at it right now.

1432
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:34,380
The email that showed that they have on the KPFA page is the wrong address for Pussy Ev.

1433
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:34,960
Are you sure?

1434
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,520
Yes, I'm sure.

1435
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,780
Unless you have Pus Ev.

1436
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,380
Are you sure?

1437
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,340
The Pussy Evidence Show brought to you by Walsporn.

1438
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:44,480
These young people get so confused by the internet, but it's okay.

1439
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,180
It'll take a generation to kind of settle into how this works.

1440
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,440
The Pus Ev Show.

1441
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,160
That was my favorite story when I was a child.

1442
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,460
Hey, young man.

1443
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,220
Who is it?

1444
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:54,820
Yeah.

1445
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:01,260
Hey, is this show going to be over soon?

1446
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,360
I'm getting really tired.

1447
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,360
Yeah, it's almost over.

1448
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,360


1449
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,360


1450
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,360


1451
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,360


1452
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,360


1453
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,360


1454
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,360


1455
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,360


1456
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,060
It's almost over, and we can get a donut when it's over.

1457
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:11,000
Yeah, we are rewarded with sugar and dough and grease when it's over, and vitamin salt

1458
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,700
and vitamin...

1459
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,640
I want scrambled egg soup or de-booper de-booper.

1460
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:14,900
Yeah, vitamin grease.

1461
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,820
Vitamin grease is the best.

1462
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,440
Vitamin G.

1463
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,480
Vitamin G.

1464
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,200
I want a bagel waffle.

1465
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,120
Vitamin S.

1466
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:19,880
Vitamin G.

1467
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,500
Vitamin S.

1468
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,700
Vitamin S is salt.

1469
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,280
Vitamin G.

1470
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,500
I'll give you some vitamin G right now.

1471
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,260
Sugar and grease.

1472
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,600
Vitamin G.

1473
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,480
Yeah, grease.

1474
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,480
Or garlic.

1475
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,340
I've got a sack full of vitamin G. Let me squeeze it out for you.

1476
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:34,340


1477
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:34,340


1478
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:34,340


1479
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,420
It's got vitamin A and vitamin B.

1480
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,180
Vitamin D stands for vitamin Dough.

1481
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,040
Vitamin Dough.

1482
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,640
Vitamin J is jalapeno.

1483
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:41,640


1484
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,720
It's the only vitamin that's really high in protein.

1485
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,500
If you're fat, it's for that.

1486
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,740
It's within packaging.

1487
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:52,780
Well, I know you're going to have to package to show up and get rid of all those clowns

1488
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:57,240
you've got and Bishop Joey and Freedies and...

1489
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,780
Bishop Joey is just sleeping like a little baby right now.

1490
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:02,340
Aww.

1491
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,320
For some reason, Freedies are sleeping.

1492
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,520
Freedies never accepts a ride or...

1493
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,680
No, he doesn't like shows.

1494
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,580
He doesn't like...

1495
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,400
He thinks shows are stinky.

1496
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,600
He thinks all calls.

1497
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,360
He thinks shows are bad.

1498
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,920
He thinks that the people that do the show is bad.

1499
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,740
Well, it's really fun once a year for 10 minutes.

1500
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,440
I think it's the greatest fun once a year for 10 minutes.

1501
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,960
People who do the show is bad.

1502
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,220
People that come down here every week are nuts.

1503
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,440
They're just completely bad.

1504
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,080
I don't think there's anybody down there.

1505
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:28,660
That's stupid.

1506
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,420
We'll get up at 3 a.m.

1507
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:30,740
Now, boy.

1508
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,120
This is the tape they make at 10 o'clock in the morning.

1509
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:33,580
Exactly.

1510
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:36,180
Well, they're drinking coffee and looking out over the ocean.

1511
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:36,680
And laughing and laughing.

1512
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,520
And there are huge picture windows.

1513
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,060
Wow.

1514
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,400
And they just laugh and laugh and say...

1515
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,720
They're going to be so cool.

1516
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,140
Who's going to listen to this?

1517
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,840
They're even going to think the callers are real.

1518
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:51,720
So, you know about the other park they're going to build down there with all the tapered

1519
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,160
holes in the ground, the Punicles?

1520
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:53,860
Yeah.

1521
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,340
Oh, no.

1522
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:00,820
Well, they're going to think that Lonnie is real and Sarah is real and Suicide Man is

1523
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,340
real and Michael Pepe is real.

1524
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,100
I'll just act like I'm really down at the station at 4 a.m., 5 a.m.

1525
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,580
You sit in the lurking places.

1526
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:06,800
Yeah.

1527
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,460
That I really woke up in the middle of the night.

1528
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,920
Vitamin H. Hey, man.

1529
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:12,820
What about Vitamin H?

1530
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,580
Vitamin H. What about Vitamin H?

1531
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,220
Did you take enough today?

1532
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,060
No.

1533
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,920
Did you have 120% of your rural requirement?

1534
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,180
No.

1535
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,120
I don't know.

1536
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,720
That's why I said I'd talk to somebody about that.

1537
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,280
Okay.

1538
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,020
Well, this whole show is set up just to talk to you.

1539
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,360
If it's Vitamin B12, it's good.

1540
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,320
If you have any questions, we'll be happy to answer them.

1541
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,320


1542
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,320


1543
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,320


1544
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,320


1545
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,320


1546
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,320


1547
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,320


1548
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,320


1549
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,420
If you have answers, we will definitely question them.

1550
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:36,840
Okay.

1551
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,800
And you've only got like five minutes, caller.

1552
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,700
But only in the order in which they've been received.

1553
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,400
It's important.

1554
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,700
You'd better get yourself up in a hurry because your time is running out.

1555
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,280
Calling number 43, caller.

1556
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:49,980
I'll ask this question.

1557
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,800
Where can I find Habifrop's Ritulox?

1558
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,100
That's Vitamin H.

1559
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,180
We've got plenty right here.

1560
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,880
Right here.

1561
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,580
But unfortunately, it only grows upon the droppings of certain Tibetan holy men.

1562
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,300
You have to go to...

1563
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:02,680
I can tell you this.

1564
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,460
Like the Marifosa Luminesa.

1565
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,100
I can tell you this.

1566
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:10,080
You must go to Radio Valencia tonight at the Ask Dr. Howell show and I'm sure you'll find

1567
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,800
plenty there.

1568
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:11,880
Well, yes, but...

1569
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,040
Oh, I see.

1570
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:13,860
Yes, but...

1571
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,920
That's what kind of deal it is.

1572
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,740
If you bring plenty there, you will find plenty there.

1573
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,960
For he who brings plenty receiveth plenty.

1574
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,940
Will I receive the mission, the preaching of Ivan Stang as well?

1575
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,180
That is so.

1576
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,440
And seed bearing flowers and fruits of every kind.

1577
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,300
But not all of them.

1578
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,540
And they're all going to go to the whole plant.

1579
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,420
That sounds like my kind of place.

1580
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:41,700
The tiny Tom tit-wren shall circle and sing in the bosky bowers of the golden bough.

1581
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,480
The tiny tit-wren.

1582
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,500
The Tom tit-wren, yes.

1583
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,960
While the chaffing sings of the orchard bough.

1584
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:51,620
Are they as tufted as the tiny...

1585
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,180
Are they as tiny as the tufted tit-mouse?

1586
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,380
Well, I...

1587
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,960
They're tiny.

1588
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:57,800
They're...

1589
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,760
You know, they're not that tall.

1590
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,400
You have a tiny tit-wren and a tiny tit-mouse together.

1591
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,300
They're tiny.

1592
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:02,300


1593
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:02,300


1594
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:02,300


1595
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:02,300


1596
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:02,300


1597
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:02,300


1598
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,120
Which one has the tiniest tits?

1599
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,300
They're tiny finches.

1600
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,720
They're fluttering little finches.

1601
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,560
This is not doing a thing for us.

1602
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:10,900
That's all.

1603
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:11,760
Oh, yeah?

1604
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,140
Their tiny hearts beat pitter-pat.

1605
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,620
The part where the show goes away?

1606
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,660
Go away.

1607
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,800
The tiny tit-mouse and the tiny tufted tit-mouse.

1608
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,920
Out of my weakness and my melancholy.

1609
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,640
And the tiny tits to the show is when you built a tit-wren.

1610
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,920
You see the show's butt going through the door away from you.

1611
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,020
The butt, butt, butt.

1612
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,800
Exits at high speed.

1613
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,100
Man is born to be a tit-wren.

1614
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,240
Man is born to be a tit-wren.

1615
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,240


1616
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,280
Man is born to be a tit-wren.

1617
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,360
You let the show slam on your butt as you leave.

1618
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:34,920
You let the smoke fly upward.

1619
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,300
Yeah, you.

1620
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,800
What were you born in a barn?

1621
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,360
What were you born in the show?

1622
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:39,840
Forever.

1623
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,500
Yeah, you're born in a show and you left a barn door open to the show.

1624
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,980
All the animals got out.

1625
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,960
All the animals had to leave because the show got too hot for them.

1626
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,420
You know how it is on the show.

1627
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,900
You can't touch the show when it's that hot.

1628
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,640
It's like a smoking the end of a recently discharged pistol.

1629
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,340
Don't give up, folks.

1630
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,260
We'll get this over with.

1631
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,260


1632
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,260


1633
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,260


1634
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,260


1635
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,260


1636
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,260


1637
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,260


1638
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,260


1639
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,320
We're going to do it right one of these days.

1640
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,420
Keep listening.

1641
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,260
All these errors will get straightened out.

1642
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:07,380
Yeah, yeah.

1643
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:07,900
We're just practicing.

1644
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,640
If you shoot the show's bullets for the next edition.

1645
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,720
We're just practicing.

1646
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,700
We're going to do it right eventually.

1647
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,720
You shoot the show's bullets, all the show's bullets at the same time the show's pistol

1648
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,840
barrel gets really hot.

1649
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:16,380
You'll be there.

1650
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,720
We'll be sweating bullets.

1651
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,500
You can burn yourself on the show's barrel.

1652
