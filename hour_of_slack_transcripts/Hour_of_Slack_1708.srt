1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,800
No, he's trying to...

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,100
He can't make them shut up.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,820
Ready? Here we go.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,500
He can't make them shut up.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,380
Will you be...

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,320
He'll never make them shut up.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,920
Somebody gag the cowboy.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,020
All right, here we go.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,200
Five, four, three, two...

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,340
One.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,180
And now it's that time you've been waiting for, kids.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,180
Your hero, my lonesome cowboy name,

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,240
just rode in on his automatic horse bucket.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,400
Howdy, kids.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,800
I had a terrible ride here tonight.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,780
I was threatened and accosted by three young bullies,

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,140
one of whom had a rancid, arid eye

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,840
that kept on staring downwards while he beat me for my boots.

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,400
After being stabbed in the night several times

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,760
about the head in Buttocks area,

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,160
I began to scream and chased a 13RTA bus

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,580
all the way down Chester Avenue.

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,720
Once I got to the dumpster next to Mary Lou's,

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,660
I had visions of her in my head.

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,480
Oh, Mary Lou.

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,280
I had visions of school patrol

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,820
and visions of French bunny girls

28
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,780
wearing little parkas

29
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,360
and little teeny, teeny, teeny tiny critterments

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,820
you couldn't even imagine.

31
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,740
I couldn't even call clothing.

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,780
And he kept me, kept me going

33
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,360
as the oil was slickering up around my feet

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,740
and the fires were raging,

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,960
making the air on my ears burn down.

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,300
All I could do was think of

37
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,820
the soul genius.

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,020
So you, uh,

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,700
you go to prostitutes, huh?

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,200
Good, good.

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,360
This is Hour of Slight,

42
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,200
number 1,708,

43
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,420
but it's also Hour of Slight,

44
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,380
number 776 from 2001.

45
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,300
We have lots of new stuff to share,

46
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,760
but if I stop to edit that now,

47
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,220
I won't get anything else done.

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,440
So it's rerun time again,

49
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,460
but that's good

50
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,120
because our old shows are sometimes very different

51
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,400
from our newer shows,

52
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,980
and this one is certainly refreshing

53
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,740
because it comes from 18 years ago

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,580
when we were all still alive.

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760
I'll see you next week.

56
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,160
Hit me!

57
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:15,020
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears.

58
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,780
Do you like it when I talk that way, honey?

59
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:51,760
Do you like it when I talk that way, honey?

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,940
Are you a big boy?

61
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,340
Do you want to do bad things, Dave?

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,480
Stop getting so excited.

63
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,340
Every time you get him sexually excited, his nuts go up inside him and he gets that female voice.

64
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,020
Well, more like a little boy.

65
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,120
He's like little Dave.

66
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,760
He gets scared.

67
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,600
That's why he's so lonesome.

68
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,080
Haven't you ever heard the gelding sound, Stang?

69
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,440
That's when a yearling is frightened by larger males.

70
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,940
He's of his own type or kind.

71
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,700
We call that the forgot-to-debeat-the-prairie-squid voice.

72
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,560
But a squid proboscis is more than just a proboscis.

73
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,880
It's a hiding place for a metaphor.

74
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,700
A metaphor for the pleasures of the universe.

75
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,060
Tuck it inside out and it works both ways.

76
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,060
Yes, Dr. Wang.

77
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,080
Take out the green skeleton of nature now and remove it.

78
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,800
That's a good idea.

79
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,800
I'm going to take my clothes off.

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm going to take my pants off.

81
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,640
I'm going to do this show with no pants on.

82
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,120
No pants.

83
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,920
The gun is good.

84
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,860
The gun is good.

85
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,300
The penis is evil.

86
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,840
The penis shoots seeds.

87
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,660
Jesus Christ, no, it's still coming.

88
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,280
It hasn't even been touched.

89
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,320
It's shooting lightning bolts from inside.

90
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,600
The flames are being blown from the sky one by one.

91
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,280
Friends, last night I was showing...

92
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Somebody told me they found my gold.

93
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,800
I had a plastic subgenius minister's card at a party I'd been at last week.

94
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,660
And I was going through my wallet and going,

95
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,120
Oh yeah, it's gone. I guess so.

96
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,180
And I found my Universal Life Church preachers.

97
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,060
How many here are members of the Universal Life Church?

98
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,760
Look at that. I knew it.

99
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,380
Praise Bishop Hensley.

100
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:48,280
He was the man who decided that he didn't want to help subsidize religions he might not believe in.

101
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,280
Since religions didn't have to pay taxes.

102
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,200
So he started ordaining everyone he knew.

103
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,740
Much like the Discordians do.

104
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,520
Ordaining popes right and left.

105
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,040
So you're all ministers now.

106
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,000
You don't have to pay taxes.

107
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,960
But as I was going through that wallet,

108
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,260
I also came upon my oldest original subgenius membership card.

109
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,940
The person looking over my shoulder went...

110
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,320
They saw the Universal Life Church card and said,

111
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,220
Oh, I want one of those.

112
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,120
I said, Oh, I'll send a self-addressed stamped envelope to Modesto, California.

113
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,040
But then she saw the subgenius.

114
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,880
membership card and said,

115
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,100
Oh, I don't want one of those.

116
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,740
Now,

117
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,560
I didn't...

118
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,000
I woke up this morning thinking about that.

119
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,140
And I thought, okay, we know what she doesn't want.

120
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,900
What does this say she does want?

121
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,220
Friends, when you say you don't want a subgenius membership card,

122
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,380
you don't want to be a subgenius minister doling out the slack of Bob's.

123
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,760
What it says you do want is that you do want to do something.

124
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,360
Take yourself seriously.

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,140
And friends, as a subgenius, I do not take myself seriously.

126
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,240
I don't take you seriously.

127
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,120
I don't take her seriously.

128
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,460
I don't even take that man J.R. Bob Dobbs seriously.

129
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,740
The only thing I take seriously is the one serious law that the Church of the Subgenius has

130
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,760
that Bob passed down.

131
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,280
And that one rule is,

132
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,460
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

133
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,540
I see somebody's been reading their...

134
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,500
scriptures here.

135
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,920
I don't even take the news, what you people call the news,

136
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,120
I don't...

137
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,340
I take that least seriously of all.

138
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,060
So you think you're in America, do you?

139
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,320
Last time I checked.

140
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,400
Well, you're not.

141
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,300
You're in high school.

142
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,600
Now take that thing and bury it where it belongs.

143
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,240
Look at this thing.

144
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,740
It wasn't even human.

145
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,640
Do you think it's healthy for a 13-year-old boy to imagine his teacher naked?

146
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,960
Absolutely.

147
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,760
Mommy, let me go.

148
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,440
I don't want to get breast.

149
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,720
This is strange, but there are four people in the hospital who nearly suffocated in here.

150
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,000
There has to be a reason for this.

151
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,640
What do you think?

152
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,860
I'll run tests on all the main electrical circuits.

153
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,320
I might find something there.

154
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
You're wearing black underwear.

155
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,380
Did you go in there and write that on the mirror while I was taking a shower?

156
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,520
Yes.

157
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,500
Well, enough is enough, young man.

158
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,560
Do I make myself clear?

159
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,240
It's like a plague or something.

160
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,980
People disappearing right and left.

161
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,060
Old ladies, little girls, young women.

162
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:21,740
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,520
School boys.

164
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,640
I don't call it a mendacity.

165
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,140
I call it anti-slack.

166
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,520
This is Ivan Stank's version.

167
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,140
Watch this.

168
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,220
He starts crying right here.

169
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,740
It's really neat.

170
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,260
Lord, please forgive me.

171
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,920
I have sinned.

172
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,620
Is he laughing there?

173
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,060
Yes.

174
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,060
I don't want him to get to you, Bob.

175
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,380
Yes.

176
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,720
Here on the last show of the month.

177
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:51,720


178
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:51,720


179
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,600
The Millennium.

180
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,640
How many last shows have we done, Doug?

181
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,380
Give me a break.

182
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,920
We never did a last show of the Millennium, though.

183
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,980
The last show of the Millennium.

184
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,600
Yeah, we never did a last show.

185
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,260
In 1998, there was a last show.

186
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,580
We never did one of the Millennium.

187
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,400
We never thought we would be at the Millennium.

188
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,540
I always thought I'd be at some pleasure saucer in space on Planet X by now.

189
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,520
I mean, I'm kind of pissed off that that ever came through.

190
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,100
Well, that's the thing.

191
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,460
Dr. Drummond.

192
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,720
Have you not heeded Bob's new word, build your own ship?

193
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,900
Bob's new word?

195
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,940
Is that like Bible with a little N?

196
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,640
Ain't quite the same as getting that eternity on the escape vessels with a ...

197
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,200
Hey, you know, I'm a flexible guy.

198
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,120
You know, he changes the rules.

199
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,020
I can change.

200
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,580
I can move.

201
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,140
I can understand it.

202
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,440
You know, I understand the way that the upper management operates.

203
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,800
Hobos, right?

204
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,440
After years of being in middle management in this cult, I'm a little more of a ...

205
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:58,760
Well, I understand that, you know, upper management changes their mind at a whim, and the whole strategic direction can change.

206
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:05,600
You know, it doesn't matter if 20 years you've been predicting that the Earth was going to end on 1998 and we would be off in the present.

207
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,940
If Connie has a headache ...

208
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:12,080
You know, yeah, if Connie has a headache, four-fifths of the dogma suddenly goes away.

209
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,100
You know?

210
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,040
That's when I don't get it.

211
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,540
These bimbos come in here.

212
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,120
They start changing the rules.

213
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,440
And, you know, Connie's the queen of them.

214
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,980
I'll say it right out loud in front of Bob and everybody.

215
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,520
She's the queen of the bimbos.

216
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,620
Oh, well, hey, is that ... So that's news?

217
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,660
So that's not news.

218
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,540
All right, all right.

219
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,160
I understand that.

220
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,700
But Connie might stick over here.

221
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,760
But I mean that in a ...

222
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,240
What, 84 or something?

223
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,760
The minute Bob was killed.

224
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,440
But I mean it in a malicious way.

225
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,020
I don't mean it in a loving way like most people do.

226
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,860
The minute Mr. Liberate the Women there shot Bob dead.

227
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,240
Yeah.

228
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,820
Yeah, I bet he's gay.

229
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,420
He ain't ...

230
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,300
He's gay.

231
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,140
He's not gay.

232
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,180
I know he's not gay.

233
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,100
Don't be Doug Wellman.

234
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:53,880
What's that?

235
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,640
He rue the day you shot Bob, because that was when them bitches took over.

236
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,120
I rule the day.

237
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,820
If you left Bob hanging and swinging, why, it'd be as if Confucius had never come along.

238
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,900
Dr. Stang, have they upped your prescription of Halcyon?

239
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,020
Is that what's going on here?

240
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,540
No, no.

241
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,860
I started this diatribe into the bowels of the things that are wrong.

242
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,320
The philosophy.

243
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,860
The philosophy itself is like ...

244
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,940
So you're talking about church point two?

245
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,800
I didn't really mean to cast any dispersion on any of our previous dogmatic points, because

246
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,420
they are still all valid, all still true, as true as truth is, you know, but perhaps

247
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,820
I wandered too far into my own ...

248
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,920
Oh, give me a break, Dr. Drummond.

249
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,220
You were the one that made it a ... wanted it to be a men's club.

250
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,420
I still think it should be a men's club.

251
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,480
God, if only it had remained the way it is.

252
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,400
If only it had been the way it is.

253
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,180
If only it had been the father church that I had promised to be.

254
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
It was a polygamous kingdom at one time.

255
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,180
The purity, the purity was there.

256
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,180
And now I feel like a stud on a stud farm with all those women I have to manage.

257
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,640
Can you guys play the Savage Revenge of Helen Keller in Reprovision?

258
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,800
What?

259
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,540
Hell yeah.

260
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,640
The Savage Revenge of Helen Keller in Retrovision?

261
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,400
That is a real actual tract written by Dr. Mars, I believe.

262
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,620
It's a visionary piece.

263
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,840
It also involves performance, and it is quite visionary, except for the fact that they duct

264
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,480
tape your eyes shut, and you're supposed to experience through your nasal cortex most

265
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
of the experiences.

266
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,740
Exactly.

267
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,820
You express that so well.

268
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,180
The long knitting needles, believe me ...

269
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,720
Express yourself.

270
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,060
Express yourself.

271
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,380
It's a kind of a clean feeling.

272
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,060
You get, you know, like you've all been ...

273
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,380
Clean yourself.

274
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,000
Clean.

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,300
Fresh.

276
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,520
Clean.

277
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,140
Clean it out.

278
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,980
Wipe yourself.

279
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,960
Find refreshment where you ...

280
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,920
Ream yourself.

281
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,620
You peppermint douche.

282
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,760
Ream again in a clean body.

283
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,100
A brand new body.

284
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,440
Lighten up.

285
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,640
Manhole.

286
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,640
Yourself.

287
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,020
Ramrod.

288
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,600
Salus.

289
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,400
Yourself.

290
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,500
I will sit for you.

291
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,740
What's he doing?

292
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,460
By accident.

293
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,920
Stallion.

294
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,360
Stallion.

295
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,360


296
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,360


297
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,360


298
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,360


299
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,360


300
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,080
Oh boy, nice.

301
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,280
Brass cannonball.

302
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,620
Then a brick shithouse.

303
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,320
Ah, there he is.

304
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,340
And you just put this right on his head.

305
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,100
Oh my God.

306
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,440
I've never seen anything like that.

307
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,720
He's got a head condom.

308
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,580
It's really a condom.

309
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,200
Dave has just put a condom over his complete head.

310
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,280
He's ready to dive right in.

311
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,140
Okay, dream.

312
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:47,360
I'm ready.

313
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


314
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


315
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


316
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


317
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


318
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


319
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


320
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


321
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


322
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


323
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


324
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


325
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


326
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


327
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


328
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


329
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,360


330
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:47,800
Let's do it.

331
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,500
Oh my God.

332
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,700
That's obscene.

333
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,780
It's lubricated and I'm drowning.

334
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,960
He's getting into it now.

335
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,940
Ladies and gentlemen, you should see what's going on in the studio.

336
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,840
It's lubricated, man.

337
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,920
You've got to help me get this off.

338
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,960
I can't breathe.

339
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,840
I've never seen performance art quite like that.

340
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,680
Eat your heart out, Howard Stern.

341
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,260
Ow.

342
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,020
It's clean.

343
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,300
Calm, calm, calm.

344
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,220
Subgenius.com.

345
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,100
And it's a ...

346
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,340
It's a ...

347
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,340


348
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,340


349
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,340


350
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,340


351
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,340


352
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,340


353
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,340


354
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:25,580
A calm moment, friends, a briefly calm moment because I was putting together last week's

355
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:32,500
show and I suddenly realized that with the Amsterdam subgenius field trip coming up,

356
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,120
I'm going to have to somehow crank out three shows in advance because I ain't going to

357
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,400
be around to do them damn shows.

358
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:47,280
Now, I could run some old reruns and things, but we don't have to do that yet.

359
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,340
Friends, because there's been so much going on.

360
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:59,140
I have this wonderful recording of a KPFA Berkeley more than an hour, less than a show,

361
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:08,960
show, the original The Show, by the way, with a special guest, Dr. Philo Drummond and host

362
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,160
Puzzling Evidence and caller Phineas Narco.

363
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,600
I've got tons of recordings from Winterstar.

364
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,220
It's a winterstar symposium sponsored by Ace here in Cleveland.

365
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,620
You're hearing some of the recordings from that in the background, Einstein Secret Orchestra

366
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,480
and Ron Slade, but I preach there.

367
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,780
Now, maybe I can ... Maybe by ... At some point, I can find some tapes of Robert Anton

368
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,100
Wilson who also preached there and was really funny.

369
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:44,380
Friends, of course, we always have tons of ESO Swamp Radio originally broadcast live

370
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,580
on WCSB in Cleveland on Thursday.

371
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:46,580


372
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,160
Thursday nights at 11 to 1 in the Eastern time in the evenings.

373
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,700
You can call that station at WCSB.org and call in.

374
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,400
Hell, why not?

375
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,700
Friends, I've got this incredible recording of Booger 9000, the legendary subgenius band,

376
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:12,200
the super group composed of Sphinx Drummond from the Swinging Love Corpses and President

377
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,060
William Howard Taft from Homicidal Briefcase.

378
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,340
Yes, shows.

379
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,140
Joe Newman from the Rudy Schwartz Project.

380
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:27,160
An incredible recording from an Austin revival in the 90s captured by our friend, Pater Nostril.

381
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:33,000
Friends, as always, every hour of Slack recently has been partly programmed by the artists

382
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:42,660
of alt.binaries.slack where, along with artwork, lately the Sabinis have been posting sounds.

383
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,320
We have all been doing that.

384
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,320


385
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,320


386
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:53,740
All these little clips and bits and mixes from New Monet, Artemia Salina, Dr. Phineas

387
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:01,200
Narco, Puzzling Primates for Bob, Jupiter Research, and Mr. Sister.

388
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,320
And friends, we got the Bran Flakes new album is in here.

389
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,860
We've got old Meteor Barrage stuff as always, which I bet you've been better on the website.

390
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,140
You better check that stuff out.

391
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,100
I've got the revival recordings coming in.

392
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,300
Better ones than I've had.

393
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,200
From Tucson Revival.

394
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,520
And of course, the sample, the Tampa revival samples did have not hardly been touched.

395
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,080
Oh yes, friends.

396
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:32,020
And finally, I may end up having to, you know, as I said, I have to do three shows in a week

397
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,580
to get a catch up ahead.

398
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,160
And finally, the final show, number 778, might be nothing but outtakes with no explanations

399
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,800
at all.

400
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,420
I don't know.

401
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,400
Because we've got to move in a hurry, friends.

402
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,700
We've got to move fast because this is the church of the subgenius.

403
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:53,060
And we know because of the word Bob that the end times are so, so very nigh.

404
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,640
The time is ripe for their arisals.

405
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,300
And XXXX day is coming, friends.

406
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,120
4X day.

407
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:12,900
We'll see you there at that campground come July 5th, 2001, when the aliens shall meet

408
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,320
with those who are worthy.

409
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,720
And have achieved their ministershiphood in the church of the subgenius under the slackmaster

410
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,140
Bob.

411
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,260
Oh yes, praise Bob.

412
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,360
We didn't want to play this gig.

413
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,040
But when Jesus told us we had to, we couldn't say no to that.

414
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,860
Do you want to hear some Schoenberg or some Neil Diamond?

415
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,780
Okay, I think it's pretty clear.

416
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,060
Everybody here would like a Neil Diamond.

417
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,080
Let's make it.

418
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:44,640
Thank you.

419
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,900
Thanks for coming.

420
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,880
You too.

421
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,580
You and you.

422
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,980
Raquel and Rosie get on board.

423
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,640
We gonna ride till there ain't no more to go.

424
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,580
Taking it slow.

425
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:10,340
Lord, don't you know, I'll have me a time with the poor man's lady hitching on a twilight

426
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:10,960
train.

427
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,300
Ain't nothing here that's not going to help me.

428
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,300


429
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,300


430
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,600
But I'd care to take along, maybe a song

431
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,540
To sing what I want

432
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:28,060
No need to say please to no man for a happy tune

433
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,580
Oh, I love my Rosie child

434
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:42,240
You and me we're going in style

435
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,600
Crackling Rosie, just a lulled woman

436
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,980
But you make me sing like a guitar strummin'

437

00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,980
Girl if it lasts for an hour, well that's alright

446

We got all night

447
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,320
To set the world right

448
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,600

Yeah that's right

512
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,140
That knows how it feels

513
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,140
When you've been dancing with a hard on

514
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,060
That's a little hard on

515
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,080


516
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,200
Lords of Acid is just about nothing but

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,800
Well how about a pronuncement

520
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,000
Of earth squashing impertinence

521
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,400
Somebody told me that people have group sex

522
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,140
At Lords of Acid concerts

523
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,120
I said

524
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,640
Now I've been to a

525
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,440
5X Days and a Thrill Kill concert

526
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,820
I've seen them all

527
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,640
Just about

528
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,660
But

529
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,980
And this

530
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,000
Young lady

531
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,360
That was explaining this to me

532
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,200
Said well I had my first three way

533
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,280
At a Lords of Acid concert

534
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,600
Well everybody had a three way there

535
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,520
But they're talking about

536
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,320
Long sliking dogs

537
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,880
They're talking about three way hits

538
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,440
No I think they were talking about

539
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,040
Three way

540
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,620
Sexual activities

541
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,540
With a prairie squid

542
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,300
A man on one end

543
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,580
A woman on the other

544
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,000
And a squid in the middle

545
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,400
You better believe it baby

546
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,600
And sometimes you can get another guy

547
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,960
Or a girl in there

548
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,580
Depending on how

549
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,940
If it's a large enough

550
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,160
And willing enough

551
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,120
Depending on how

552
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,980
And cute enough

553
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,900
The ink sack is on the squid

554
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,440
That's right

555
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,120
You can always use the ink sack

556
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,160
Once it's been de-inked

557
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,120
Can you put them together

558
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,500
Like a little pioneer toy

559
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,180
When you were 75 years old

560
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,800
We've got those de-inking

561
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,640
Suction cup pad machines

562
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,620
At Subgenius Foundation

563
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,280
Huh?

564
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,420
Or I mean just if you had three squid

565
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,460
Not three squids

566
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,840
I'm of course an erudite person

567
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,580
Three squid

568
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,400
Could you just snap

569
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,320
Them together like blocks

570
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,340
And they would serve the same purpose

571
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,700
Of perhaps a hundred just clear

572
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,100
Army

573
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,300
The South American army squid

574
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,880
Oh they're

575
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,560
Will do that

576
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,460
They will actually form bridges

577
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,840
Of their own bodies

578
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,160
Across rivers

579
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,100
So that their horny squid mates

580
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,060
Can get across

581
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,900
You know at the

582
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,000
Cost of thousands of lives

583
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,920
Yet thousands more will live

584
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,880
The reason for the psychic experiments

585
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,420
Look here

586
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,300
The army squid are not only growing in size

587
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,140
To conjugate

588
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:31,920
And multiplying

589
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,480
But they have one mind

590
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,120
One heart

591
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,940
One mind

592
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,160
Much like you

593
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,500
Dr.

594
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,340
If you cut off the head

595
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,460
It just grows another one

596
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,080
If you pull a beak

597
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,020
Another beak appears

598
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,900
If you shave an eyebrow

599
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,300
Another thing laughs at you

600
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,400
And cries at you

601
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,700
If you pull out its fangs

602
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,280
It grows twice as many

603
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
If you pull its ears

604
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,580
It wants you to rub its belly

605
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,740
If you give it milk

606
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,520
It will suck your blood

607
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,860
All these things and more can be yours

608
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,220
At Squidtown

609
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,160
Prairie Town, USA

610
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,620
My

611
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,940
Miles and miles of furrowed dirt

612
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,600
And squid flipping and undulating

613
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,100
In each and every patch

614
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,120
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven

615
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,780
Rose, poor rose

616
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,260
I never thought I'd die

617
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,660
I never believed there could be such a squid farm

618
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,640
I'm fine

619
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,240
Squids as far as I can see

620
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,420
They're sluppin' and sluttin'

621
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,080
I think they're ready to be picked

622
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,580
I got my Viagra

623
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,680
I'm all greased up and ready to go

624
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,660
Look, look I got one of them fake beauty marks

625
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,840
I'm sorry it's a melanoma

626
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,500
But look, I got a tear

627
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,120
Tight, tight, tight pants

628
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,600
I got a tight squid here

629
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,200
Yeah

630
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,460
Retired here

631
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,200
Little bit of that sorrel soul

632
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,820
Sausage sorcery there, eh?

633
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,360
That's right

634
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:11,720
I like to get down in them furrows and just plow

635
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,580
You know what I mean?

636
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,900
Just plow my way

637
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,300
Use one squid as a condom

638
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,740
For the use of another squid

639
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,540
Yep

640
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,280
And then use a bigger one atop them

641
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,900
We were the ones who invented them things

642
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,760
Back in the dome

643
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,100
You know, back in the dome

644
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,180
Well, back under the dome

645
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,180
You could take one of them

646
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,320
And it would shave your eyebrow for you

647
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,900
You wouldn't have to even sit in a chair

648
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,860
You could just sit there and lecture it

649
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,860
I tried to get a patent on those things

650
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,180
But it turns out you can't patent a formula

651
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,220
That's right

652
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,260
But that didn't matter back in the day

653
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,280
And that's all you really need to create that

654
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,400
We just sit there witless and having the squid

655
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,700
Witless and having

656
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,320
Mammy didn't know nothing

657
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,260
We did all kinds of songs

658
00:35:59,260 --> 00:35:59,980
Knowing and having

659
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,180
Happy was none the worse

660
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,180


661
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,560
Remember the squid songs we used to make up

662
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,120
When we had nothing else to do

663
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,960
But just try and recharge our depleted accordion

664
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,260
Knowing the squids

665
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,780
Yep

666
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,640
Getting to know them real personal

667
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,240
Loving the squid

668
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Having the squids

669
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,940
Plowing the squid

670
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,720
Squidding around on the squid

671
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,300
Squid cake

672
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,040
I like to just take it in my hand

673
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,700
Squid soup

674
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,640
Squid sandwiches

675
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,180
Squid bed

676
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,440
Cream of squids

677
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,000
Squid flags

678
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,240
Squid pudding

679
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,940
Squid beach furniture

680
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,920
Squid cream of era

681
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,940
There's nothing like squid pudding though

682
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,360
All that stuff

683
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,360
Everybody's grandmother made squid pudding

684
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,140
Out of their own orifices

685
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,420
And squid strudel is good too

686
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,940
When you had a dry, dry old granny

687
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,460
Not like the rest of us

688
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,840
We used to dry out the grannies

689
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,180
I remember that

690
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,420
We'd take the grannies and we'd string them up

691
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,220
Smoke them

692
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,440
And for a long time

693
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,140
Two, three, four weeks

694
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,760
We would be cured but we would never get high off it

695
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:00,980
Church

696
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,720
Grannies

697
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,420
Nope, wasn't right

698
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,540
Besides, Grandpa didn't like that

699
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,560
No, he wanted all of it for himself

700
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,660
He wanted to do his own jerking

701
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,740
He walked 50 miles a day to go to a squid

702
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,400
And then Grandma, she walked

703
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,880
Until she quit squid

704
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,500
She'd walk about 25 miles a day

705
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,960
And they just keep telling the same story

706
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,400
Everybody knows you took the squid bus

707
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,720
You and the old days

708
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,040
That prairie squid merkin

709
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,940
I remember that old song

710
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,780
Grandpa

711
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,420
Alien's coming

712
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,020
Alien's coming

713
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,300
We're gonna get her to get our beef jerking

714
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,800
Did you know that Hitler owned 8,960 acres of land in Colorado?

715
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,100
What?

716
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,640
Hitler?

717
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:44,600
No

718
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,000
Yes, he did

719
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,620
He owned 8,960 acres of land in Colorado

720
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,800
Why, no American citizen would do business with Adolf Hitler

721
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,960
I'm optimistic this can happen

722
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,940
That's nothing, though

723
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,420
Mata Hari was making

724
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,000
You know how much he's making?

725
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,960
He's making $7,500 a throw

726
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,520
That must have been some poon there, boy

727
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,400
And so as we begin the work of healing our nation

728
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,780
God's gonna strike you down

729
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,740
Who's healing our nation now?

730
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,280
In a big thunder storm

731
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,040
Hey, something happened to that thing, Doug

732
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,540
I feel up your pain

733
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:54,840
And I feel like me, feel like I'm dead

734
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,680
Alive or still alive

735
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:58,820
God the heathen

736
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,420
What's wrong?

737
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,140
Are you crying right now

738
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:00,140


739
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:00,740
Are you insane is that what you're doing?

740
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,420
Because you're mine

741
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,360
There's nothing to do

742
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,380
Oh, I, I

743
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,320
I can't stand

744
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,340
The roads around, I can't stand

745
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,160
The woods down, I put a spell on you

746
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,300
Because you're mine

747
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,440
Because you're mine

748
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,560
Because you're mine

749
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,320
Because you're mine

750
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,280
I can't stand

751
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,300
The roads around, I can't stand

752
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:12,260
The woods down, I put a spell on you

753
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,380
Oh, because you're mine

754
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,240
Oh, because you're mine

755
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,380
Because you're mine

756
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,720
Because you're mine

757
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:29,800
Because you're mine

758
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,980
Because you're mine

759
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:32,980


760
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:32,980


761
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:32,980


762
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,800
Because you're mine

763
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,880
How the, you know, how the hell did you ever survive the last seven years without your, your trunk?

764
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,420
I'm sorry, I like it.

765
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,000
Well, what happens is if you've been around enough squid, well they get into you.

766
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,480
And they just start reproducing and hollering and carrying on.

767
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,200
Gene.

768
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,100
Before you know it, you're just a vessel for squid intelligence.

769
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,860
And then you gotta send them to college.

770
00:40:59,240 --> 00:40:59,760
Exactly.

771
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,880
Start all over again.

772
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,700
Yeah, you're gonna get done with the little peckers.

773
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,560
Keep you young.

774
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,740
Keep you young and quick.

775
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,320
My feet have gone to sleep while we're talking about this.

776
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,040
And I think my hemorrhoids come back.

777
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,700
So if we could maybe change the subject a little bit.

778
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,180
No.

779
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:18,900
All right.

780
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,800
I know that's the only thing you ever want to really talk about in depth.

781
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,540
But for crying out loud, we've been talking about it for six weeks now.

782
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,360
I know.

783
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:28,880
I know.

784
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,560
I know.

785
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:29,880
I know.

786
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,220
I know.

787
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:30,240
I know.

788
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,260
I know.

789
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:30,260


790
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:30,260


791
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:30,380
I know.

792
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:30,380


793
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,320
Deep dark secrets.

794
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,780
And they don't have to look.

795
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:38,980
Has Mojo come out in New Zealand the way he did at X Day?

796
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,500
I don't know.

797
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,420
It's a good question.

798
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:45,260
The emanations of the Connieites kind of turned him.

799
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,480
First, it made him want women.

800
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,480
But then it made him want women so bad that he wanted to turn into a woman.

801
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:52,960
It feels like.

802
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,680
And then he wanted to make out with, you know, the regular guys that he had just been, you

803
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,840
know, running around making explosives, shooting off bombs with.

804
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,860
That's all he was doing.

805
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,060
Bomb making.

806
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,180
He was rocket butt sniffing.

807
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,780
As long as it can be distinguished that man is man and woman is woman.

808
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,440
I think you're just a big bully.

809
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,720
What makes these men want to wear circles?

810
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,800
Those who can be changed.

811
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,900
They're the easy ones.

812
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,240
What are those who so desperately want to be of the opposite sex yet can't change their

813
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:22,620
sex?

814
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:23,420
Perfect.

815
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,100
Ordinary people.

816
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,440
Keep back.

817
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,280
Girls have alkenes.

818
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,460
Guys with limbs and men with muscles.

819
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,200
The classic dude in a.

820
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,380
One is a man, but you feel that you're really a woman.

821
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:34,980
Correct.

822
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,860
And you are going through the process of actually surgically becoming a woman.

823
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,220
Sure.

824
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,720
Very good.

825
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,660
We have a winner here.

826
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,780
I hope you don't freak out at the last second when they get out the pinkie shears for you.

827
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,940
I don't care if you like us.

828
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,880
Because we don't like you.

829
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,140
And we don't give a flying what you think.

830
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,320
I thought you were trying to French kiss me.

831
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:50,720
You're better.

832
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,440
Nice.

833
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,180
Boys have alkenes.

834
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,660
Girls have china.

835
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,460
Girls have alkenes.

836
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,840
Man is woman and woman is man.

837
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,140
Guys with limbs and men with muscles.

838
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,320
Hummin' a, humming a, humming a.

839
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,060
A woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman?

840
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:06,660
Ridiculous.

841
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,140
It's preposterous.

842
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,080
In fact, it's so preposterous no one would ever believe it.

843
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,060
I find it very mind-bending.

844
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,280
There is going to be hell.

845
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,120
Medically impossible.

846
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,800
It's not really hard to believe.

847
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,980
It's just hard for you to accept.

848
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:17,480
Medically impossible.

849
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,180
God.

850
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,720
Just castrate him.

851
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,440
Good heavens.

852
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,300
Jesus.

853
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,700
God.

854
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,120
God.

855
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,220
You can hit me while I whip this out.

856
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:30,800
Ah.

857
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,320
Guard.

858
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,680
Castrate him.

859
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,700
No.

860
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,600
No.

861
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,020


862
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:36,400


863
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,200
Guard.

864
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,980
Castrate him.

865
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:39,480
Ah.

866
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,260
This is not a haphazard maneuver.

867
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,700
Careful planning for it started months back.

868
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,140
Well, the joke's on you.

869
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:49,680
Be there.

870
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,840
I'm not even a real blonde.

871
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,420
Be there.

872
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:51,940
Be there.

873
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,060
Be there.

874
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,940
The big green dragon that sits on your doorstep.

875
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,640
He eats little boys.

876
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,380
Boys have cut my Snakes.

877
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,720
Babby dovetails and big fat snakes.

878
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,260
Eggs!

879
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,260


880
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,260


881
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,320
Eggs!

882
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,260
Eggs!

883
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:11,820


884
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,120
Eggs!

885
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,100
Eggs!

886
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:14,340
Eggs!

887
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:15,600


888
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:15,600


889
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:15,600


890
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:15,600


891
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:15,600


892
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:15,600


893
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:15,600


894
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:15,600


895
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,140
Eggs!

896
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:33,300
Connie's Spewing 2 by Reverend Protectrix Amazonia.

897
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,400
Bob said it, so you better pick up on it.

898
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:43,100
If Bob says that traffic light is green, but it looks red to you, floor it!

899
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,140
Floor that!

900
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,720
Close your eyes and gas it to the max!

901
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,380
Do what Bob said, not what your mind said.

902
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,580
Who do you trust, friends?

903
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,440
Who do you trust?

904
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,060
Your mind or Bob Dobbs?

905
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,540
Get that part straight first.

906
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,340
But people are afraid to trust.

907
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,580
You know, I don't blame them.

908
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:04,480
We've all been burned at one point because we trusted the conspiracy,

909
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,040
or we wouldn't be so screwed up as we are.

910
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,780
We wouldn't be in this room right now.

911
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,000
But, you know, you go, well, if I can't trust Bob,

912
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,660
who can I trust?

913
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,860
Friends, you cannot trust Bob to do what's right for you.

914
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:20,860
Okay?

915
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,040
That's in your hands.

916
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,320
That's entirely in your hands.

917
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:28,000
But you can trust Bob to do what's right for Bob,

918
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,160
which you can't even trust yourself about.

919
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:37,040
So, friends, Bob is real, and yet some people don't believe in Bob

920
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,580
because either he's too good to be true or they fear Bob, you know,

921
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,980
just as some people do.

922
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:42,980


923
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,160
Well, normal humans sometimes fear, well, actually, it's the old-timey,

924
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,220
I know a lot of old-time subgeniuses that fear computers and the Internet.

925
00:45:53,720 --> 00:46:00,460
There's always resistance to anything new, and Bob Dobbs is always new and improved.

926
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,860
So there's always going to be somebody scared of him.

927
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,480
Isn't a boy named Sue...

928
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,980
He cannot leave the bathroom.

929
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,100
...on the back of the EMS vehicle,

930
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,780
singing to the various crippled victims of the gerbling problems.

931
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,540
I guess we want to call them problems.

932
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:26,020
Somebody was clearly at fault and didn't want to take credit.

933
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,360
Well, if you don't feed the gerbil, what do you think's going to happen?

934
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:34,300
Soon, the gerbil becomes very hungry.

935
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,980
As his belly becomes hollow and his skin becomes slick,

936
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,660
as the hair falls out and his eyes grow weak, he will bite it.

937
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:42,980
He will bite it.

938
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,380
Anything.

939
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:49,440
At the last minute, I will substitute the starving gerbil for the healthy one.

940
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,180
Or just about ready now.

941
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,160
The master won't suspect until it's too late.

942
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,240
He humiliates you.

943
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:57,880
This is the only...

944
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,980
reste en yard τη woven abини.

945
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,980
Nothing wrong with that.

946
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,200
Just the downfall of this snack-tw trata session.

947
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:37,360
But why?

948
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:37,360


949
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:37,360


950
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:37,360


951
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:42,660
There's a positive message I could partners and working brothers share.

952
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:42,980


953
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,560
I'm sorry.

954
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,500
I have a mission to perform.

955
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,460
Give me some more.

956
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,840
Very well.

957
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,000
I will recalculate.

958
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,760
Human movement is the bringer of human life.

959
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,320
You must be an end to your race.

960
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,660
I want to see the girl Alice again.

961
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,080
Beautiful face, monsieur.

962
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,800
Oh, yes, of course, you remember, huh?

963
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,680
She drove everyone crazy.

964
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,520
Ah, the woman was for herself.

965
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,280
Oh, Dave.

966
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,760
She was at the oyster bar one time,

967
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,380
and she was clipping the cathedral, as we used to call it.

968
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,680
She was making time with a one-eyed man.

969
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:31,520
There they were, exchanging spit in the middle of the barbecue hall.

970
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,260
No man blinded me.

971
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,100
She was no good.

972
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,900
She was no bad, either.

973
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,480
She looks like one of the Stepford Stepmothers.

974
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,760
I bet you can see the Latin side of her

975
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,080
when you turn her upside down.

976
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,240
I bet she's got one of those little fuzzy monkeys, eh?

977
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:46,700
Ha ha ha!

978
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,140
Oh, no, you shaker.

979
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,180
And then he goes all the way up to her belly button, huh?

980
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,820
Bob?

981
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,360
You don't even know who he is, and you might miss him.

982
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,140
If you didn't have a real good look at him,

983
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,460
you wouldn't even know who he looked like.

984
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,660
They don't believe in Christ, do they?

985
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,220
If we get a stopper, they're gonna kill us all!

986
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,120
They don't believe in Christ, do they?

987
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:07,620
No.

988
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,740
You gonna feel blame?

989
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,180
Are you mad?

990
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,740
I will pull your goddamn tongue out of your mouth!

991
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,000
On the rope!

992
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,860
If you didn't have a real good look at him,

993
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,080
you wouldn't even know who he looked like.

994
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,000
You really haven't got any excuse,

995
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,420
but I've done all kinds of things.

996
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,020
No need for your goddamn tongue out of the rope!

997
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:23,700
On the rope!

998
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:23,940
On the rope!

999
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:24,260
On the rope!

1000
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,260
I'll give you no excuse!

1001
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:26,960
Thank you very much.

1002
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:27,640
You're welcome.

1003
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,320
You're welcome.

1004
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,340
You're welcome.

1005
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:29,760
You're welcome.

1006
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,500
You're welcome.

1007
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:30,620
You're welcome.

1008
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,160
And do you remember when you were a little girl, perhaps,

1009
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,200
and your father gave you a beating?

1010
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:35,720
Well, I mean, you know, I don't know.

1011
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,080
And get ready for a shock.

1012
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:41,000
The music that they're planning to use

1013
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,440
to crumble them all

1014
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,120
in the boroughs of America

1015
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,840
is this rotten, filthy, dirty, lewd, lascivious junk

1016
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,360
called rock and roll.

1017
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,560
It isn't just the lyrics and the music.

1018
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,880
It's called Satan.

1019
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,060
Though they dwell among the stars,

1020
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,900
they make millions of trips to planet Earth daily,

1021
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,500
traveling faster than the speed of light.

1022
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:03,080
By an increase in swearing with language that withstands a sailor's hand on end.

1023
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,920
They attempt to depress, possess, and oppress their victims.

1024
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,660
Psychiatrists and psychologists are no match for these ETs.

1025
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,380
Mob?

1026
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,320
M-M-M-M-Mob?

1027
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,420
I think of Bob as a proteus.

1028
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,860
A sex gland, often.

1029
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,460
When I think of myself ensconced in a little home,

1030
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,900
a little domicile,

1031
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,100
on the pipe, on the ring,

1032
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,080
Saturn's moon.

1033
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,020
I can see...

1034
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:22,780
Saturn's moon.

1035
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,740
Little flocks of pastures of green sheep floating by,

1036
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,080
and what do they call those?

1037
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:28,700
Hillocks?

1038
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,800
Like a little cottage with smoke curling out of it.

1039
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,520
And each one resembles a pipe.

1040
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,200
And I can see myself there with my own little Connie.

1041
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,620
A Connie of my own design, perhaps.

1042
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,220
Hairy-footed, perhaps with a face much bigger than the rest of her body.

1043
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,320
But still...

1044
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,380
I like that kind, too.

1045
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,000
I thought you did, and that's why I brought her up.

1046
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,980
She's been calling you again, Stang.

1047
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,560
That big head girl?

1048
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,260
The big head girl?

1049
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:52,680
From space?

1050
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,080
She's been calling you, Stang.

1051
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,640
You think I hear her?

1052
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,880
I think all I ever get is your machine.

1053
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,560
I know you've been thinking of me.

1054
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,320
I went back to the carnival again,

1055
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,700
and went on the ferris wheel,

1056
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,180
and rode the merry-go-round,

1057
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,820
and all I could do was think of you.

1058
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,980
Of course, it was very hard to fit my head in.

1059
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:18,960
The merry-go-round was a low ceiling.

1060
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,560
But still, I was alone.

1061
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,140
And I thought of you.

1062
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,240
I ate a loaf of bread,

1063
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,460
and then I played with myself and cried again.

1064
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,100
Then I went on the ferris wheel.

1065
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:36,760
I had to be restrained because my head was disturbing the other passengers.

1066
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,380
And I thought of you again.

1067
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:43,360
I went down to the boardwalk and looked at the scene.

1068
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,640
And all I could see was your reference.

1069
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,240
Why you don't call me back sometime?

1070
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,320
Well, it's Lady,

1071
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,400
a huge little ice cream lady,

1072
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,820
the woman from space girl calling you back again,

1073
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,660
hoping sometime you'll return my call.

1074
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,180
Bye.

1075
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,380
It's so strange.

1076
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:11,840
You know, they...

1077
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,340
All those groupies.

1078
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,240
Yeah, I remember.

1079
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:20,540
All they needed to do was to just send their $30 to Bob.

1080
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,100
And I know that's all they're trying to do is get close to Bob.

1081
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,020
They think I know Bob's phone number.

1082
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,980
And I do.

1083
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:27,500
You do.

1084
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,540
But they think I can give it to them, and I can't.

1085
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,740
I just can't.

1086
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,680
And instead of giving you their $30,

1087
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,560
I deny them Bob's essence.

1088
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,120
What do they do?

1089
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:38,980
They come up to you, and in time, they say something stupid.

1090
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,360
I don't know.

1091
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,540
They play with your hairy feet.

1092
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,820
They talk backwards to you, try and trick you.

1093
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,700
When time is right, listen to the words.

1094
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,760
Time, yes.

1095
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,560
How many times has this happened at Divi-Val?

1096
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,660
Every time.

1097
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,860
Every damn one.

1098
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,700
I remember the last time I was playing with Einstein's secret orchestra at a Divi-Val

1099
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,520
for the Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.

1100
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,520
We just finished a song, and a rush of about 11 women.

1101
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:08,100
No, it's always 15-year-old guys with glasses.

1102
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,140
Scangly clothes.

1103
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,880
If only it was women.

1104
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,560
Yeah, if only it was women who didn't look like kind of fat guys in those weird, you know,

1105
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,440
Pendleston shirts with like...

1106
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,180
With a Bob shirt.

1107
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,180
With real thick glasses.

1108
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,440
That's too tight.

1109
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,960
Guys that kind of look like us, you know, and only...

1110
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,640
I thought that was really good.

1111
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,960
The only part I enjoy was saying, you know, they're real smart and everything.

1112
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,700
Yeah, but you know what?

1113
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,120
You missed this one note.

1114
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,620
I saw where you missed this note.

1115
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,440
Yeah, it looks smart and shit.

1116
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,720
And there's a link on your website.

1117
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:32,280
It's dead.

1118
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,780
I wanted to make sure you knew about that.

1119
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,040
And you know what's wrong with those CDs?

1120
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,700
That's where they go skipping.

1121
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:36,960
No, man.

1122
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,820
We don't want that.

1123
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:38,360
That's the coding problem.

1124
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:38,640
We don't want that.

1125
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,220
That's the coding problem.

1126
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,220
Hi.

1127
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,020
How have you been?

1128
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,000
I'm watching you tonight.

1129
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,840
Are you all right?

1130
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,800
Are you hungry?

1131
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:46,720
Can I get you anything?

1132
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,120
A cup of coffee, perhaps?

1133
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,260
A sandwich?

1134
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:49,820
A ham?

1135
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,780
I'd like some guineas and some crackers.

1136
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,080
A bee job?

1137
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,000
Maybe some...

1138
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,720
Knotted nylons?

1139
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,240
Oh, yes, bees.

1140
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:55,740
Yes.

1141
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,940
I can bring you bees.

1142
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,160
Would you like some bees, honey?

1143
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,340
I can make honey for you.

1144
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,060
Oh.

1145
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:01,720
Oh.

1146
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,000
Oh.

1147
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,240
No, they don't talk that way.

1148
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,740
The hot Yoo-hoo bottle?

1149
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,560
No, they don't wear Hulu skin.

1150
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:07,800
They don't wear a hat.

1151
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:07,800


1152
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:07,820


1153
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:07,820


1154
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,140
But, Mr. Mitch, they don't talk funny languages for our pleasure.

1155
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,180
No, they just say, Price Bob.

1156
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,400
None of them have hair on their faces either.

1157
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:18,140
I found my copy of Book of the Subgenius for a dollar at the cutout bin.

1158
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,760
Would you sign it?

1159
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,540
Some of them do have the little lines, the dotted lines for the cranial lymph lines

1160
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,840
and the place where they took off the top of their head.

1161
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,740
I like that.

1162
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,180
She's pretty, don't you think?

1163
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,120
You creeped her out.

1164
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,220
Actually, to be quite honest, there's been

1165
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:44,460
times when I've thought, maybe this has gone too far. I would get frustrated with the sheer

1166
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:51,140
nerdliness of some subgeniuses, you know, because it just seemed like,

1167
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:59,400
God, I didn't know they were going to be so dysfunctional and messed up. Well, duh! Duh!

1168
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:05,680
It finally sunk in. That is what this is. That's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.

1169
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,200
Of course they're fucked up and dysfunctional, because there really is a conspiracy of normal

1170
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,800
people sapping away their slack. And of course they're fucked up, and of course that's why Bob

1171
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:27,960
is their God. Now, friends, when X-Day didn't happen in 1998, we were so sad. We're going,

1172
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:33,520
oh man, we could have had a new government that was no government at all. That, you know,

1173
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,540
Bob would be the leader, and he never showed.

1174
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,800
We'd have a new church where you didn't have to get up at seven in the morning. You could

1175
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:47,520
worship it drunk until midnight Saturday night in bars. We'd have a new coolness where, you know,

1176
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:55,960
coolness was completely defined by each individual uncool weirdo. Friends, so X-Day didn't happen.

1177
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:02,000
What are we waiting for? Do we really have to depend on some pipe-smoking dot-faced

1178
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,660
salesman or a bunch of aliens from outer space?

1179
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:14,480
Or a bunch of invisible monsters to make our own slack? Hell no, friends. Bob is not the answer,

1180
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:21,340
and neither is anything else. We must learn to think for ourselves, although only Bob can show

1181
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:32,580
us how. And we must, all of you had better, you must question authority. Or else, we've got

1182
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,040
somebody here who's been reading their pre-scriptures. There.

1183
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:43,160
One who dares to really question authority. And friends, really, honestly, I think that

1184
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:48,900
as bad as things are, if you can just, the scientific basis of slack is this.

1185
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:55,040
Fuck them if they can't take a joke! Even if they help, fuck them if they can't tell a joke.

1186
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,600
Yo, yeah, I know what time it is.

1187
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:19,580
Write to this address I'm about to give. That's Bob at Post Office Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1188
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:26,660
www.subgenius.com and praise Bob.

1189
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,680
We pulled off to the side

1190
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,860
We just knew they wanted to ride

1191
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,060
The sweetest squid you'll ever know

1192
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,160
Blow you right through the door

1193
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,760
They'll blow you right through the bar door

1194
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,700
Three squid falling from the sky

1195
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,020
Three squid and they get real hot

1196
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,320
Every three squid, well they're falling on now

1197
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,620
Every three squid

1198
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,420
I got a tentacle

1199
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,160
Oh no, there's a tooth

1200
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,760
Oh no, there's a tooth

1201
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,360
Oh no, there's a tooth

1202
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,740
Oh no, there's a tooth

1203
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,020
Oh my God, oh no, there's a tooth

1204
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,540
They're still suction cups

1205
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,440
Oh my God, I feel the

1206
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,340
It hurts when they peel the suction cups off

1207
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,260
But I like it so much

1208
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,620
Oh yeah, ooh-ooh, baby

1209
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,480
Yeah, so

1210
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:34,620
Oh

1211
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:38,600
Oh, if you're ever out of your life

1212
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,420
Don't think you have to run high

1213
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,660
When you see some hairy pink, pink snow

1214
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,880
Falling down, oh no

1215
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,600
Hairy pink snow

1216
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,940
Falling down right from the sky

1217
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:52,720
From the sky

1218
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,380
Just pull on over them on the inside

1219
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,160
Pull on over, open your mouth

1220
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,360
All the hairy squid with the best, best eyes

1221
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,860
And use some genius and joy to ride them

1222
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,700
Maybe three big squid

1223
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,200
Falling from the sky

1224
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,780
Eighty-three-d squid

1225
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,260
And they're dripping salt

1226
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,120
Eighty-three-d squid

1227
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,760
Well, they're falling on gold

1228
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,340
Eighty-three-d squid

1229
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,900
That's right, the Lord

1230
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,200
Eighty-three-d squid

1231
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,100
Eighty-three-d squid

1232
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,240
Eighty-three-d squid

1233
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,440
Fell from the sky in front of my car

1234
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,360
While I was driving down the high note

1235
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,420
I pulled over, I opened my car door

1236
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:29,080
And they were blowing my mind through the car door

1237
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,340
Placed all the hairy squid

1238
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,520
Ah, yeah

1239
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:33,940
Yeah

1240
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,460
Three?

1241
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:37,760
Ah!

1242
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:38,840
Ah!

1243
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,220
I gotta make a stand

1244
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,160
You gotta make a stand

1245
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,960
I gotta make a stand

1246
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,080
I gotta make a stand

1247
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:17,920
I gotta make a stand

1248
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:26,200
Cause we really love to make a stand

1249
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,700
Mr. High Keeper don't make me touch your mind

1250
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,140
Cause we really love to make a stand

1251
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:36,020
Mr. High Keeper don't make me touch your mind

1252
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:39,360
Back in the day, there was a kid I placed it on
