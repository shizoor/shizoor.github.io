1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
You ready, Kat?

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,420
What did your father teach you?

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,240
My father taught me to kill the sunflower.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,800
Congratulations, Mr. Curtis. You are now awake.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,040
Two hours to Jupiter.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,960
I want people to take our music seriously.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,740
The sweetest little thing you've ever known.

8
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:26,360
The Church of the Subgenius Hour of Slack was to premiere on WBCQ 7415 Sunday, September 18th at 21 UT.

9
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,100
It's being sponsored by the Bowling League.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,660
All I can say is, from a look at their website, it's got to be heard to be believed.

11
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,760
www.subgenius.com

12
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,980
Slant TS, slant HOS, dot HTML.

13
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,560
Good Lord, the hands are in.

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,500
They're not moving backwards anymore.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,260
We're in normal time.

16
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,980
You're busy.

17
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
And you're unraveled.

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,560
Oh, oh, oh.

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,440
Programming.

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,360
Wait a minute.

21
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,700
We can't be advertising UMN on this show now.

22
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,480
You suck.

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,860
The Marian's dog shall spend the rest of your wretched lives.

24
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,840
Are you threatening me, buddy?

25
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,820
Don't you understand?

26
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,900
Here on the show, we've got power.

27
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,900
Yeah, real power.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,620
And we intend to use it to make this society decent.

29
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,180
Where everybody wants to live and everybody's got a job.

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,680
And kids, maybe.

31
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,620
And pets.

32
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,680
Let's kick them.

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,220
Boom.

34
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,460
Boom.

35
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,860
Boom.

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,600
Boom.

37
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,100
Boom.

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,680
Boom.

39
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,460
Boom.

40
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,800
Boom.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:27,800


42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:27,840
Boom.

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:27,840


44
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,340
Boom.

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,400


46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,400


47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,400


48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,400


49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,400


50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,400


51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,400


52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,400


53
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,400


54
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,040
Boom.

55
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:30,920
Boom.

56
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,680
Boom.

57
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:32,860
Boom.

58
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


59
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


60
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


61
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


62
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


63
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


64
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


65
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


66
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


67
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


68
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


69
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


70
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


71
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


72
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


73
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


74
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


75
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


76
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:32,860


77
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,500
We were just a bunch of silver miners out there every day,

78
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,540
digging in the dirt, uneducated, and humping on each other every chance we could.

79
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,280
Hell, sometimes some of us good old boys would even be humping on each other, and it

80
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,900
weren't like we were trying to be fancy.

81
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,360
We just didn't know what the hell we were looking at, did we, John?

82
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,300
Yeah, we did.

83
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,920
Ah, so one day I dug up this rock.

84
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,960
And it was a brand new color.

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,300
Not a trace or a hint or nothing or any other color you've ever seen.

86
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,340
It looked like memories.

87
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,080
Well, it was embarrassing.

88
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:19,660
And if you looked at it, all the parts of your brain that just sat there doing nothing would start right up.

89
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,880
And you knew what they were there for.

90
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,660
So we looked at it and it turned us real smart.

91
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,300
The next day we went into town and read all there was to read about the chart.

92
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:38,600
Then we went out into the desert, built us this big barn and sent it up here into space with us in it.

93
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,040
Been here ever since.

94
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,820
Now the one thing we didn't reckon on was space punies.

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,320
We're space punies.

96
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,220
Hey Jake, what are space punies?

97
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,900
In a world without gravity, the muscles will become dormant.

98
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,820
And do wither.

99
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:02,960
Your spine will straighten and the calcium in your arms and legs will redistribute itself in your head.

100
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,580
Thank you, Jake.

101
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,560
You see, old Jake knows.

102
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,500
Hey Jake, what happens if you go back to Earth with space punies?

103
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,520
It kills you slicker than snops.

104
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,360
And now we gotta get back there because every day they're making further discoveries about the chart.

105
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,480
In an attempt to further our knowledge, Jake and Edna started humping on each other.

106
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,720
And lo and behold, a child was born among us.

107
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,060
Had we known he'd have grown up to be such a hellion, we'd have killed him on that day.

108
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,600
Instead, we raised him on coffee, tobacco, candy bars.

109
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,880
The kind of stuff our guts couldn't take.

110
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,260
We built him a suit of hydraulics so his muscles would grow strong.

111
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,120
As he was raised to stand up against Earth's gravity as he set out.

112
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,980
To gain more knowledge on behalf of his kin.

113
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,880
A journey the boy don't know.

114
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,700
Know nothing about.

115
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,720
On account of him being as dumb as a stick.

116
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,360
Yes, dear friends.

117
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,000
And that was from the movie, The American Astronaut.

118
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,160
By the band called The Billy Nair Show.

119
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,540
That movie, American Astronaut.

120
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,340
The American Astronaut.

121
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,800
Is one of the weirdest, most bulldada and fun movies that I've seen in a long time.

122
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,720
It's actually from the year 2000 or 2001, I think.

123
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,180
It took a long time for it to come out on DVD.

124
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:41,980
But we scored that band and that director for X-Day.

125
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,760
Our big festival in July.

126
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,020
And no doubt we'll show the movie too.

127
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,220
And meanwhile, friends, this is Subgenius Radio Ministry.

128
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,540
The hour of slack number 14.

129
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,060
2017.

130
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,900
In this case, a Subgenius music special.

131
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:11,420
The irregular and unusual gang of idiots who post their media to alt.binaries.slack, including me,

132
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:18,460
have lately had a wild hair of musical compositions up their pipe holes.

133
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,020
Plus, I've been resurrecting old 1980s Subgenius music albums like

134
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,880
The Hair of a Man.

135
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,100
And now, the song that I'm about to sing is called

136
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,700
The Hair in Bob's Ears.

137
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,460
So, we have a lot of music, plus the collages of those crazy cut-ups,

138
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,180
Reverend Norrell Preff and Reverend Artemia Salina.

139
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,800
And now, Mr. Fernandinande Limer.

140
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm asking for a videotaped confession to be thrown out.

141
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,280
PR in spot.

142
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,920
PR is part of a continuing campaign to intimidate voters.

143
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,880
Defense Executives are on the move.

144
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:54,880


145
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,520
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is recovering from massive PR news.

146
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,880
Military gangs will be sent to PR's recruiting center.

147
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,060
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has committed serious torture.

148
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,920
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that plotting to kill President Bush

149
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,400
is the latest example of how economic flexibility helps prevent PR news in Washington.

150
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,000
Bob.

151
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:19,900
Bob.

152
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,300
Bob.

153
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,680
Bob.

154
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,260
Bob.

155
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,220
Bob.

156
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,680
Bob.

157
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,120
Bob.

158
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,400
Bob.

159
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,160
Bob.

160
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,420
Bob.

161
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:36,600
Bob.

162
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,260
Bob.

163
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,260


164
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,260


165
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,260


166
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,260


167
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,260


168
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,360
Bob.

169
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,360


170
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,360


171
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,360


172
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,560
Bob.

173
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:37,800
Bob.

174
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:37,800


175
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:37,800


176
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:37,800


177
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,880
Bob.

178
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,340
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

179
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,740
I bring you a warning.

180
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,980
Every one of you listening to my voice, tell the world.

181
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,820
Tell this to everybody wherever they are.

182
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,620
Watch the sky.

183
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,080
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

184
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,800
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

185
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,640
Shazam!

186
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,900
And I say it is possible for a giant lizard to have lived there for years without being seen.

187
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,940
You, you, you, you bloated idiot!

188
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,200
You stupid!

189
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,180
I'll hit you!

190
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,040
There are a bunch of art critics and we're looking for people who like to draw.

191
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,380
You are not safe.

192
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,340
I'll save you from this.

193
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,080
Oh, so this is a...

194
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,400
Huh?

195
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:56,360
Huh?

196
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,840
Huh?

197
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,140
a fucking desert underground den?

198
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,280
That is quite a joke.

199
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,500
That is quite a joke.

200
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,800
I tried to froth.

201
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,900
Groovy.

202
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,680
Right, Bob?

203
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,540
Bob?

204
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,420
Bob?

205
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,500
Wait a minute, how did this happen?

206
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,440
And we're smarter than this.

207
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,020
Apparently not.

208
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,480
Bye-bye.

209
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,880
Long call, Dave.

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,580
Don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

211
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,840
Apparently Bob came and did something with all of us.

212
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,200
The drugs I took seem to light up my brain.

213
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,160
I don't know what they're doing to myself.

214
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,600
I don't know what they're doing to myself.

215
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't know what they're doing to myself.

216
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,200
And I say, as long as you're alive,

217
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,900
you'll make noise.

218
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,220
You'll laugh at that.

219
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,300
Because we're in love.

220
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,600
You shot up like hell.

221
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,140
And you ain't earned the last earnest tea batch.

222
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,840
Believe it or not, friends,

223
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,160
I, Stang, did that music myself yesterday.

224
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,360
Although a whole lot of the weird vocal clips in it

225
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,220
were done by the good Mr. Fernanda Nande Lemur,

226
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,840
as is PR news.

227
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,640
From PR news in Washington,

228
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,420
I'm struggling with competition from low-cost PR news.

229
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,860
Chief Justice nominee John Roberts

230
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,300
pressed Roberts about his record on minority issues.

231
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,000
The Dow Industrials are up 10-5-6,

232
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,060
down 3-7.

233
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,660
In one incident, more than 150 people will be rebuilt.

234
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,200
Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco

235
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,800
says she takes full responsibility

236
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,860
for any PR news in Washington.

237
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,940
There's plenty to think about

238
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,440
trying to direct your mind,

239
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,100
trying to direct your mind.

240
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,500
During the next two hours,

241
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,460
you'll find direction that makes sense.

242
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,480
Welcome to The Bob Show,

243
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,300
a place to find hard times.

244
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,880
And now, Counselor Bob.

245
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,020
Bob, he is on a mission,

246
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,160
on a mission.

247
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,920
Who are you?

248
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,420
Serve any purpose, serve any purpose.

249
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,640
You don't have to be a theologian.

250
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,120
Big word.

251
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,840
Ooh, that's...

252
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,760
Everybody talks about eschatology.

253
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,560
Eschatology.

254
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,520
Okay, okay.

255
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,860
Fancy tongue behind.

256
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,200
Um, um...

257
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,940
Who hasn't?

258
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,760
There are several different positions.

259
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,480
You are mine.

260
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,260
Doesn't.

261
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,260
Exist.

262
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Hear me when I say this.

263
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:42,720
5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5-3-1-3-1-7-0-5-4-3-8-3-8-3-8.

264
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,380
Get out of your mind.

265
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,920
Get out of your mind.

266
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,820
You're from Satan.

267
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,520
3-15.

268
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,020
Hi.

269
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,100
Oh, boy, I'm...

270
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,380
Uh-huh.

271
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,060
I just took it to everybody.

272
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,820
In love.

273
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,920
In love, of course.

274
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,580
I'm not totally...

275
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,200
Better than I could.

276
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,400
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

277
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,640
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

278
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,100
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy.

279
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,900
Get in that position.

280
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,300
Last day's madness.

281
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,680
In times of fiction.

282
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,540
Small P.

283
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,180
Premillennial, postmillennial.

284
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,700
Direction.

285
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,060
Coming.

286
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,060
And the rap.

287
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,440
Coming.

288
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,320
He will rap.

289
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,920
He will rap.

290
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,660
The rap is the church will be taken off the earth.

291
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,340
Bloodbath.

292
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,660
All hell breaks loose.

293
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,540
I'm very disturbed.

294
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,540
I was fascinated.

295
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,380
That didn't work.

296
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,000
A UFO.

297
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:17,680
Yeah.

298
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,340
A UFO.

299
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

300
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,040
It doesn't make any sense.

301
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,880
You have Sodom and you have Gomorrah.

302
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,880
Go measure it.

303
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,660
Tuck into it.

304
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,360
Concussions.

305
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,720
Toll free at 1-800-707-038.

306
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,520
3-8.

307
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,640
5-4-3-8.

308
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,100
3-8.

309
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,140
From PR News in Washington, I'm splitting the country along ethnic and religious lines.

310
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,580
A woman's breasts are exposed to PR News.

311
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,620
On Wall Street, 8-3-10-6-2.

312
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,960
The president said, oh man.

313
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,660
There was more chaos at the PR News in Washington.

314
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,840
Feels kinda like I'm in Spaceland.

315
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,840
That's a contradiction in terms.

316
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,500
And Bob's shining down on me.

317
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,680
And no one's aiming a rifle at me.

318
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,280
Holy dammit.

319
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,000
That's a contradiction in terms.

320
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:10,040
And Bob is the giant hepatitis penis of destruction bursting forth from the portable Johnny.

321
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,760
Now let's all be a contradiction in terms.

322
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,800
Herds of benign cattle wander across the acid-washed, flush-drained landscape.

323
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,020
All belonging to their own friendship families.

324
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,540
None loving any other than Bob.

325
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,900
The flow between adjacent points of reference.

326
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:34,040
Points on the line segment between the concrete to absolute oblivious eternity.

327
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,980
Sweet lord, Bob.

328
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:43,060
When we all act together as men, as people, we could distinguish ourselves and betray any other.

329
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,720
As it was before time, but still within space.

330
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,180
All who bow down and submit to their fractals.

331
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,820
Bob's Audition was the name of that song there by the Psychoskeletons.

332
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,540
And you can get more of them.

333
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,960
At this website.

334
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,520
Soundclick.com

335
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,760
Slash the Psychoskeletons.

336
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,260
Before that, and before PR news, we had some Norelpref.

337
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,460
And that can be had from Norelpref.com.

338
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,540
And now, Puzzling Evidence.

339
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,260
And we'll be catching the decapitation of Arnold Palmer.

340
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,160
This is Arnold Palmer.

341
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,000
Hi, golfers.

342
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,340
Illusions. All illusions.

343
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,720
From PR News in Washington.

344
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,600
I'm abusing prisoners of PR's prison in Iraq.

345
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,840
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist is being investigated by tens of thousands of Texans

346
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,620
for his sale of PR news in Washington.

347
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,480
Gentlemen, you have all worked very hard.

348
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,620
And among the lucky, you are the chosen one.

349
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,000
You have been sprinkled with pucky stardust.

350
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,560
Yes, you have.

351
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,580
For today, you have been chosen to reside in the court of the great one.

352
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:52,460
Gentlemen, I give you the boy who actually saw a woman's breast.

353
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,840
Hey!

354
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:55,900
Hey!

355
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,660
Hey!

356
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,100
Hey!

357
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


358
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


359
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


360
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


361
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


362
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


363
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


364
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


365
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


366
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


367
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


368
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


369
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,100


370
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,940
I know.

371
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,360
A-E-I-O-U.

372
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,520
O-U, sweet thing.

373
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,660
Yes!

374
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,960
A-E-I-E.

375
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:09,940
I owe you.

376
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,920
I owe you nothing.

377
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,280
But sometimes, you owe me.

378
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,280
You owe me.

379
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,180
You owe me.

380
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,260
I-E-I-E.

381
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:16,700
Hey!

382
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,120
Hey!

383
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,600
Hey!

384
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:17,960
Hey!

385
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,200
I'm talking to you when I say,

386
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,460
Why do the souls of my old dicks are still out at the sirens?

387
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,660
So call the cops.

388
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,020
And call the fire trucks.

389
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,700
And call the cops.

390
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,900
Call the cops, call the police

391
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,680
There is something walking around inside my face

392
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,860
I've got thick black stuff under my nails

393
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,300
And I think I kinda like the way it smells

394
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,540
There is food pressed against my gums

395
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,020
And I'll be good to see what it becomes

396
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,920
So I'll shave and look cute

397
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,580
With a sweat from in my poop

398
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,440
And I'll sneeze the snot from my stoop

399
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,360
And I'll wipe it down the sleeve of my suit

400
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,680
F-E-I-O, F-E-I-O, I-O, F-E-I-O, F-E-I-O

401
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,860
It was round and soft.

402
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,240
Now go back to work.

403
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,600
The boy who actually saw a woman's breast.

404
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,680
The boy who actually saw a woman's breast.

405
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:27,700
The boy who actually saw a woman's breast.

406
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,880
From the movie, The American Astronaut.

407
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,560
More on that at theamericanastronaut.com

408
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,420
The band, I guess, is the Billy Nair Show.

409
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,540
And they're on tour right now with Sleepytime Gorilla Museum.

410
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,820
And we say, check it out.

411
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,040
From PR News in Washington, I'm jammed with homosexual men from Rome.

412
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,940
Democrats are already shagging homosexuals from Washington.

413
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,460
Delta Airlines said today it plans to cut homosexual men in the United States.

414
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,540
The Dow Industrial...

415
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,040
The Dow Industrial is up 1033, down 412.

416
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,480
The Vatican is expected to issue a long document that would ban PR News.

417
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,800
There's a bob on my hood.

418
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,920
There's a bob on my rearview mirror.

419
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,240
And it sure makes me feel good.

420
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,680
There's a bob on my dashboard.

421
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,760
There's a bob on my trunk.

422
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,580
There's a tiny little bob head on my steering wheel.

423
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,040
And he drives when I'm drunk.

424
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,820
I said, bob face.

425
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,780
Bob face.

426
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,900
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that bob face every place.

427
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,980
Bob face.

428
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,980
Bob face.

429
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:53,040
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that bob face every place.

430
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,160
It says, bob on my license plate.

431
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,920
It says, bob on my bumper.

432
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,260
I got a tiny little bob face on my battery cables when I need a jumper.

433
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,840
There's a bob on my mailbox.

434
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,860
There's a bob on my street.

435
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:23,080
I even got tiny little bob faces tattooed on the bottom of my feet.

436
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,000
I said, bob.

437
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,680
Bob.

438
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,180
Bob face.

439
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,840
Bob face.

440
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,080
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that bob face every place.

441
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,400
Bob face.

442
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,420
Bob face.

443
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,620
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that bob face every place.

444
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,640
Bob face.

445
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,540
There's a bob on my shirt.

446
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,640
There's a bob on my tie.

447
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,860
There'll be a bob face on my gravestone when I die.

448
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,120
There's a bob on my wallet.

449
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,100
There's a bob on my cap.

450
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,180
There's a little smiling bob face on the place I like to crap.

451
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,540
I said, bob face.

452
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,700
Bob face.

453
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,640
Bob face.

454
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,240
Bob face.

455
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,240


456
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,780
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that bob face every place.

457
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,700
I said, bob.

458
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,040
Bob face.

459
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,000
Bob face.

460
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,220
I said, bob.

461
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,900
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that bob face every place.

462
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,300
I say, bob face.

463
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,300


464
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,300


465
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,480
One more time, sing it now, here we go.

466
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,780
Bob face.

467
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,960
Bobface.

468
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,620
If you're like me, then you'd like to see that bob face every place.

469
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:57,620


470
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:57,620


471
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:57,620


472
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:57,620


473
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:57,620


474
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:08,560
If you like me then you'd like to see that Bob face every place.

475
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,380
Bob face.

476
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,340
Bob face.

477
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:21,520
If you like me then you'd like to see that Bob face every place.

478
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,440
I sing Bob face.

479
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,960
Bob face.

480
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,320
If you like me then you'd like to see that Bob face every place.

481
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:39,860
Glass Madness did that in the good old 1980s in Berkeley.

482
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,400
And it was on the subgenius music album The Hairs in Bob's Ears.

483
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,900
And now some news.

484
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,700
And after that some of my sermon from the 25th Starwood.

485
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,420
From the 25th Starwood.

486
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,180
From the DVD.

487
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,600
Stang Live 2005.

488
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,780
From PR News in Washington, I'm not safe right now.

489
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,560
The International Atomic Energy Agency is capable of serving thousands of meals a day.

490
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,960
Stay away for now.

491
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,140
PR triggered some major blow.

492
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,280
A judge in Iraq has renewed arrest warrants for smashed police officers.

493
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,220
Tens of thousands of people took part in a march through the nation's capital today to

494
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,260
protest PR News in Washington.

495
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,420
Yeah, I'm not safe.

496
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


497
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


498
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


499
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


500
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


501
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


502
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


503
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


504
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


505
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


506
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


507
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


508
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


509
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


510
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,420


511
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,900
There really is a conspiracy.

512
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,360
And when we say, you know, develop your own strengths and your own slack, what we're saying

513
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,800
really is become less dependent on them.

514
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,660
You can't destroy that thing.

515
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,020
It's always been around and it probably always will.

516
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,120
Well, maybe in 2012 when the Mayan calendar comes around.

517
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,620
Maybe this year because it was 25th Starwood.

518
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,000
Who knows?

519
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,600
Maybe I'm wrong and maybe history will stop repeating itself.

520
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,400
But in the meantime, friends, is it really that easy to destroy the system?

521
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,400


522
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,400


523
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,400


524
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,400


525
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,340
Is it really that paranoid to be prepared?

526
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,440
Or are you prepared for paranoia?

527
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,740
A little pre-paranoia never hurt anybody, friends.

528
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,400
Pre-paranoia.

529
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,340
That's a new subgenius word.

530
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:16,880
Somebody, a guy earlier today was telling me about pro and pronoia, which was being

531
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,720
convinced that the whole world is out to make you happy.

532
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,820
I thought that was a really nice concept.

533
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,440
Yeah.

534
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,200
It's a nice conceit that would keep you going until you, you know, got cut off in traffic

535
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,700
or something.

536
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,420
Then you're back to the point like we are.

537
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,180
It's all a conspiracy.

538
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,180
They're all out to get me and it's not fair.

539
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,460
That is correct.

540
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,920
They are all out to get you and it is not fair.

541
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,040
Fair is a river in Africa.

542
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,220
Fair is where you take your pig and hope you win a prize.

543
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,300
But if you quit looking for fairness according to Hoyle,

544
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,860
and look for fairness that you may have overlooked,

545
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,600
you might be surprised at just how fair things really are.

546
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
But you have to look underneath the surface,

547
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,900
underneath the clothing of existence, so to speak.

548
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,200
Thus the word subgenius.

549
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,620
There are three non-consertees of all York land.

550
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,400
Two breeds.

551
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,760
One parent and stress dahed.

552
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,800
Only the Husky.

553
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,280
Re Democrat and a hyper diet.

554
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,200
It's your charms.

555
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,920
They are Bob Dobbs, salesman of full-time.

556
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,960
Bob is calling.

557
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,760
On the over-ran phone.

558
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,200
Bob is calling.

559
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,720
Can't you hear that time-controlled tone?

560
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,640
For the spaceship, fix us the land.

561
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,220
Surf on the look plane with Bob all you can.

562
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,080
They are Bob Dobbs, salesman of full-time.

563
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:52,740
They are Bob Dobbs, salesman of full-time.

564
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,000
Bob Dobbs, salesman of full-time.

565
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,500
J.R. Bob Dobbs will take us all away.

566
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,300
No Bob with Bob.

567
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,240
Circus snow pants will have their name.

568
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,300
End of the world drills, superstition.

569
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,020
Pre-made mix of splice, pomich, man, and superstition.

570
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,180
J.R. Bob Dobbs, salesman of full-time.

571
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,360
See this up, Jedi.

572
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,840
Know that there are laws.

573
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,980
James and the Wind.

574
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
It's Bob Dobbs.

575
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,760
Bob Dobbs.

576
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,000
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

577
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,540
Salesman of full-time.

578
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,440
Bob Dobbs.

579
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,640
Salesman of full-time.

580
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,200
By Inviso Bob.

581
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,800
From the hairs in Bob's ears album.

582
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,760
Because that's what it's all about, isn't it, friends?

583
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,480
Bob's hairs.

584
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,160
The booth of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

585
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,960
Where you can learn more.

586
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,940
About how it is that Bob can be the ultimate capitalist.

587
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,560
And yet he's against the capitalist conspiracy.

588
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,720
That's because he was part of their conspiracy.

589
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,280
He was a rich man.

590
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,400
He didn't get into religion until after he had perfected sales.

591
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,460
Because what's the difference, you know?

592
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,520
But how could Bob does not buy?

593
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,600
He only sells.

594
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,760
How is this possible?

595
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,200
He is an economic monopole.

596
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,200
And you say it is a scientific near impossible.

597
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:24,260


598
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:24,740
It's a possibility.

599
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,040
But that is what he is.

600
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,340
He is not.

601
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,540
And it's like the goose that laid King Midas's paw.

602
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,200
Bob is.

603
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
When, uh, it's not that he's smart.

604
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,560
That's why it's called Church of the Subgenius.

605
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:46,120
Intelligence, as defined by the conspiracy, has nothing to do with this.

606
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,100
We think that's all been defined wrong.

607
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,860
What we're into is not intelligence but sense.

608
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,180
Common sense.

609
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,740
Pretty rare these days.

610
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,240
Sense.

611
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,060
Sense of humor.

612
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,940
Pretty lame most of the time.

613
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,740
And dollars and cents.

614
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,940
Which you have and oh Bob.

615
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,600
Bob.

616
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,260
I assign you an eternal fate.

617
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,840
I curse you with the ultimate curse.

618
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,660
May it seize you instantly as it leaves my mouth.

619
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,480
Never may you have a home and family.

620
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,980
Never caress a child of your own.

621
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,280
May your man prefer younger, prettier girls.

622
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,640
May he beat you as a housewife beats a rug.

623
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,520
May you never acquire bright alabaster or shining silver the delight of men.

624
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,920
May your roof keep leaking and no carpenter fix it.

625
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,520
May wild dogs camp in your bedroom.

626
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,860
May owls nest in your attic.

627
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,880
May drunkards vomit all over you.

628
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,500
May a tavern wall be your place of business.

629
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,640
May you be dressed in torn robes and filthy underwear.

630
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,540
May angry wives sue you.

631
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,280
May thorns and briars make your feet bloody.

632
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,140
May young men jeer and the rabble mock you as you walk the streets.

633
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:01,740
May all this be your reward for seducing me in the wilderness when I was strong and innocent and free.

634
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,540
I've got no money but I've got no bosses.

635
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:34,340
Stuck to the term known as thearm Databie embar когда empowerment mor Italy так

Instead of this church where my socks just rot

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:50,220
I wish I was stuck in a big ball of frog

641
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:14,600

I wish I was stuck in a big ball of frog

I wish I was stuck in a big ball of frog

I wish I was stuck in a big ball of frog

I wish I was stuck in a big ball of frog

653
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:30,020
Dr. Power, Princess Queen, Mr. Remo Remo Remo will crash the next, next game.

654
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:38,300
You don't have to follow me. Only you can teach me.

655
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,800
I smell the thing.

656
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:49,800
I smell the thing.

657
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,000
I smell the thing.

658
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,760
You need to be

659
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,980
Church of the subgenius

660
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,960
I explore you. Don't make a fuss.

661
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,220
I tell you one and one and one makes us.

662
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,780
I'm the Church of the subgenius

663
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,120
Like J.R. Bob Dobbs and Old Festus.

664
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,700
I'm the Church of the subgenius

665
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,260
Church of the subgenius

666
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,360
Church of the subgenius

667
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:29,260
Church of the subgenius

668
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,920
Lonesome cowboy dig. I love lemon.

669
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,440
A subgenius rants. That subgenius lies.

670
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,200
You don't have to follow me.

671
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,140
Only you can pee freely.

672
00:38:49,480 --> 00:39:09,780
Lonesome cowboy dig. I don't need to have a full isle.

673
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:17,120
Dr. Power, Princess Queen, Mr. Remo Remo Remo will crash the next game.

674
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


675
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


676
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


677
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


678
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


679
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


680
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


681
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


682
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


683
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


684
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


685
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


686
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


687
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


688
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


689
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


690
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,120


691
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,620
You will crash the next death game.

692
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,840
You don't have to follow me.

693
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,180
Only you can be free.

694
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:39,200
You gave me frop.

695
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,520
You gave me slap.

696
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,880
You gave me power from Bob Dobbs ball sack.

697
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,360
I'm every person.

698
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,280
You need to be so get on the bus.

699
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,980
Don't need to discuss much.

700
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,160
I'm the church of the subgenius.

701
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:05,220
I'm the church of I'm the church of I'm the church of the subgenius.

702
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,500
That's it.

703
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:11,500


704
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,220
This song is a brand new one from Norrell Preff.

705
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:23,560
And the collages of the preceding four or five minutes except for PR news by Lee Murr were also all by Norrell Preff.

706
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,940
That's spelled N-O-R-E-L.

707
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:27,600
Preff.

708
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,800
But now a new piece of music from Reverend James Cobblestone.

709
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,500
Did you have a vision?

710
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,300
Is something coming?

711
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,340
Oh yeah.

712
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,220
Something terrible.

713
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,460
Something very holy.

714
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,400
Something very awesome.

715
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,080
No he didn't even think of that.

716
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,740
Something very awesome.

717
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,540
Something very holy.

718
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,480
Something very awesome.

719
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,220
Something so holy.

720
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,200
Something very awesome.

721
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,940
Something very holy.

722
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,620
The sacristy was virtually a dump.

723
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,640
Very holy.

724
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,520
Something very awesome.

725
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,320
I have a great delight to come in this cathedral.

726
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,260
Very awesome.

727
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,040
Something very holy.

728
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,620
The chalice was always sticky and muddy.

729
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,720
Something very holy.

730
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,200
Something rotten still smells.

731
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,400
Something very holy.

732
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,240
It was a feeling.

733
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,120
Something very holy.

734
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,800
We want who you want.

735
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,800
We want something very holy.

736
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,720
Something very awesome.

737
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,620
Stand far away.

738
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,280
Something very awesome.

739
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,240
We decide that ours is the best and we put other people down.

740
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,580
Something very awesome.

741
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,560
Something very holy.

742
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,380
Something very awesome.

743
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,140
You're making the law.

744
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,100
Something very awesome.

745
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,840
Is there one law for the rich?

746
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,780
Something very awesome.

747
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,220
Beautiful things only spotlessly clean.

748
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,360
Something very awesome.

749
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:06,360


750
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,180
Something very awesome.

751
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,040
One without the other would be.

752
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,940
Very awesome.

753
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,740
Something very holy.

754
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,480
Something very awesome.

755
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,360
If you see a man dressed in fine clothes with gold rings on his hands.

756
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,120
Very holy.

757
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,960
Something very awesome.

758
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,780
Come near.

759
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,660
Something very awesome.

760
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,580
You'll be given a rap on your fingers.

761
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,400
Very awesome.

762
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,200
Something very holy.

763
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,860
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.

764
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,160
To walk in the power of God.

765
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:38,360
To beg for God's forgiveness God rest his soul.

766
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,620
To walk in the Father divine.

767
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,360
Something very awesome.

768
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,080
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.

769
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,580
Something very awesome.

770
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,900
To walk in the Father divine.

771
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:48,980
Something very awesome.

772
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,340
Something very holy.

773
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,740
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.

774
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,980
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.

775
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,120
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.

776
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,540
The choice is yours and the choice is mine.

777
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,540


778
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,540


779
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,540


780
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,560
The path is always both.

781
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,000
To walk in the Father Divine.

782
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,500
Wipe these things away as if they are superstition and they lead to nothing.

783
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,760
I'm exhilarated you're alone.

784
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,360
What's the future of the cosmos?

785
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,620
What is the nature of reality?

786
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,900
We still don't know.

787
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,080
Are we alone?

788
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,040
Contact us.

789
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,660
It's preposterous.

790
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,540
Until recently we had no idea, we had no idea.

791
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,040
We still are groping for answers.

792
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:01,980
So absurd.

793
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,120
We are now actively looking at the sheer size of an enormous billion, billion, billion, billion.

794
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,140
No one actually knows.

795
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,320
It's actually a hard hit.

796
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,800
Dance a little bit.

797
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,100
We've only been at it for a short while.

798
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,500
Billions don't get frozen all the time and boiled away.

799
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:27,100
Each species is somehow the result of some almost drunken random walk.

800
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,400
Move over here, move over here.

801
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,740
Stumbling aimlessly across a featureless terrain of possibility.

802
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:38,140
Life is basically lazy and is going to be limited for inorganic carbon-free.

803
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,820
We're going to be stuck at the level of pond life.

804
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,300
Stresses of various kinds may be building up in the system.

805
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,180
Build up, build up, crash.

806
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,060
Or it will crash.

807
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,720
This side is too large.

808
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,220
It's amazing.

809
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:50,820
We're wrong.

810
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,000
Maybe they always blow themselves.

811
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,040
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

812
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,600
I would love to be aliens.

813
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,660
Big-headed octopus-like billion.

814
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,460
Why?

815
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,060
Why are we here next Sunday at 8?

816
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,940
Why are we here next Sunday at 8?

817
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,620
Why are we here next Sunday at 8?

818
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,600
There's a special moment that comes.

819
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,660
When performer and instrument are at the start of their lives.

820
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,440
A baby.

821
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,540
15 years old.

822
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,980
It's funny I think as a...

823
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:21,820
But.

824
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:22,840
But.

825
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:23,740
Um.

826
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,580
Her.

827
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,180
And you can hear this in the Canadians.

828
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,220
Horse.

829
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,040
Wonderful racehorse.

830
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,400
Relationship with a horse.

831
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,540
Fuh.

832
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,240
Fuh.

833
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:37,820
Fuh.

834
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,180
A very intimate relationship.

835
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,220
Fuh.

836
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:41,640


837
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,400
Fuh.

838
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:44,860
Fuh.

839
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,080
Fuh.

840
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,320
Fuh.

841
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:46,540


842
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:46,540


843
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:46,880
Fuh.

844
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,320
Fuh.

845
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,860
Fuh.

846
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:47,860


847
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:48,860
Fuh.

848
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:48,940
Fuh.

849
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,560
Fuhh.

850
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:49,560


851
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:49,560


852
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:49,560


853
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:49,560


854
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,680
From PR News in Washington on one of the worst were rabbits.

855
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,420
There was no PR News.

856
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,560
You're listening to PR News.

857
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:02,000
Thousands of people in Colorado may of destroyed the creators of PR News in Washington.

858
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:45,400
We shall praise Bob till the end of days and smash the Church of the Soap Genius.

859
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:50,000
Praise Bob, praise Bob, save the pigs, we shall liberate them.

860
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,120
Praise Bob, praise Bob, you will not succeed.

861
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:02,080
Church of the Soap Genius, we are the PLF, the Pink Liberation Front.

862
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:11,180
And we shall succeed in our plans to smash you, your worthless pieces of poo.

863
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,200
Praise Bob.

864
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:23,660
Reverend Shane Smirker, uh-huh, in Australia, is responsible for that.

865
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:28,540
Before that, we heard Leigh Murr's special moments

866
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,060
and a preposterous Norell Preff cutscene.

867
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:37,360
But now, our new official Soap Genius Army Marching Song.

868
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,660
Yes, we have one! An army!

869
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,880
And a march, now that we have a marching song, we can have an army.

870
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:49,340
And this marching song, friends, is by Reverend Artemia Salina.

871
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,220
Ahem, that's true.

872
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,300
And when walked our beers, we have a surprise!

873
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:16,380
There she goes.

874
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,040
Well, that means the army is finally here.

875
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,040
Then, on a음...

876
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,400
Thearial Ancestral Oocenea, with her young blood andストofy hands,

877
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,740
will now take the lead in theücksspeed I heard.

878
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:30,740


879
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:31,220


880
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,280
Thank you.

881
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:12,860
Thank you.

882
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,900
Thank you.

883
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,760
Thank you.

884
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,020
Thank you.

885
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:02,640
Thank you.

886
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,700
Thank you.

887
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,380
Thank you.

888
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:32,780
Thank you.

889
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,320
Thank you.

890
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:20,620
Thank you.

891
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,140
Thank you.

892
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,500
Thank you.

893
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:31,440
From PR News

894
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,060
in Washington.

895
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,860
Washington, I'm sending a plume of poisonous fumes over the south end of Texarkana.

896
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,160
Uh, uh, uh, evacuate.

897
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,380
Powerball's multi-state lottery jackpot is $300.

898
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,880
Violence began immediately.

899
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,520
PR's bad.

900
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:46,080
PR's bad.

901
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,800
British people tested positive for bird flu.

902
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,640
Authorities say so far no humans are reported infected.

903
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,220
Three ducks and hens expressed shock and promised to protect the population.

904
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:02,880
Forecasters say the worst is the northeastern U.S., which has endured more than a week of PR news.

905
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:10,580
A slew of Norel Pref cuts there, plus Leimers PR news.

906
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:18,280
And you are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

907
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,460
For more information, friends, see subgenius.com.

908
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:27,100
This music in the background, which just ended and is now starting up again,

909
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:32,680
in a different way, is by Leimer Devotee.

910
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,880
Not the same as Leimer.

911
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:37,940
In fact, Leimer Devotee, I think, changes his name every month or so.

912
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,260
He was Joe for the last show.

913
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:47,060
But meanwhile, friends, now another song from the Psychoskeletons.

914
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:51,980
This is the Psychoskeletons remix of their Slack anthem.

915
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,100
Now the rocks have been ripped.

916
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,060
Cigarette butts.

917
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,120
On the ground.

918
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,620
Dist exacer, ba extracto,

919
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,580

causando menor門o,

921
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,000
shrimps like a four,

922
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,140

923
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,740

Krishna, Brahman, Allah, etc.

990
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:47,180
From PR News in Washington, unfilled with high school band students, President Bush praised Iraqis' insurgents for their peaceful roadside bomb in Ramdi

991
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,380

992
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,760
The official Chinese news agency reported that the Chinese government is now sending an urgent message to the world

00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,960

1010
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,000
Yeti

1011
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,480
Yeti? If there's one Yeti, there must be a whole civilization

1012
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,620
Yeti, human hide, when smell human

1013
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,500

Yeti

1020
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:19,740
No!

1021
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,360
Get me.

1022
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,020
Which once only existed as a pigment of the imagination.

1023
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,140
Let me out of here.

1024
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,080
There's nowhere to go, man.
