1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm king of at least six people, most of them security guards.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,080
I'm farting from upstate New York to Maine.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,400
And the mayor of Boston staggers home.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,000
Heavy wet farts.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,160
That's been a benefit.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,980
Farts today.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,680
On Wall Street at this hour, 152.

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,020
The White House says that this is PR News from Washington.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,380
The popular social networking internet website PR News has reached agreement with more than

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,620
145 sexual predators to protect $20 billion worth of weapons.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,980
An Israeli official is supposed to fly within 125 miles of PR News in Washington.

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,560
PR comes from low-income women's and children's and families.org.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:50,500
In a few generations, their legs will grow slim, their bodies thin, their tusks longer.

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,560
Goodbye.

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,560
The baby!

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,520
The baby!

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,500
Finish.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,280
Title two, directions four, inward filthy lusts.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,220
Direction one, drink wine or strong drink.

20
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,960
It is better for you than beer.

21
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,220
Direction two, think of tempting filthy objects.

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,800
Number three, eat windy meats.

23
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,940
Number four, copiously evacuate.

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,860
And if you do not, you perish.

25
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,260
Bite.

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,640
Number five, eat maggots.

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,380
Direction six, prepare to sodomize for their filthy lusts.

28
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,380
Direction seven, be corrupted with money nor perverted by flattery.

29
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,820
Direction eight, cause that pernicious deliriation in the brain.

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,700
Direction nine, produce temptations to lust.

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,860
Direction ten, let your apparel be suited to your disease.

32
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,360
Direction eleven, don't drink.

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,440
Don't think what your admired carcass will be when it is laying a few days in the grave.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,200
Direction twelve, go back when you see the bait.

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,560
Beaver.

36
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,020
Starring, starring Barbara Beaver.

37
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,540
Beaver.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:15,900
Beaver.

39
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,780
But dad.

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,440
You know, Beaver, your mother and I were very...

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,360
Ah, that you deliberately...

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,540
Nah.

43
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,580
Nah.

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,800
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,120
Well, Wally, I, uh...

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,140
I had a clop you won.

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,740
Ah, Wally, I don't think...

48
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,920
I thought I told you to shut up.

49
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,860
Yeah, well, uh, I'll just...

50
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:36,620
I don't know.

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,160
Okay.

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,160
Winnie the Pooh finds tail.

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,800
And then he put his head down and looked between his front legs.

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,840
I, Winnie the Pooh, will find tail food.

55
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,960
So Winnie the Pooh went off to find tail.

56
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,640
To the hundred acre wood.

57
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,120
L-O-L.

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,920
L-O-L.

59
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,160
Pooh looked at the knocker and...

60
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,800
Large somethings.

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,820
Pulled the knockers.

62
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,540
Ow!

63
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,440
The knockers.

64
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,600
Pooh looked at the bush.

65
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,400
Nailed it.

66
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,160
Nailed it.

67
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,940
Nailed it.

68
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,420
Nailed it.

69
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,260
So happily.

70
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:15,800
Ow!

71
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,780
Winnie the Pooh came over all funny.

72
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,280
Pooh found tail.

73
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,700
I said Pooh.

74
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,860
I found tail.

75
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:38,080
I want scarlet sin and the moral leper.

76
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,680
People think of full and complete sexual intercourse and every form of sexual deed

77
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,740
and think of fornication between a man and a broad or not.

78
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,620
Thou shalt fornicate in...

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,320
Body and behavior.

80
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,520
Or better, thou shalt engage in any sexual activity whatsoever.

81
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,660
And of course, let each wife sexually submit to very shameful, awkward, perverted, irremediable,

82
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,920
extended, intense sexual activity.

83
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:25,100
Utilizing the sexual parts in a sexual manner in total permanent sexual subjection to,

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,240
all forms of perverted sexual urges in our minds.

85
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,920
And of course, engage in perverted sexual perversions.

86
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:44,260
But, what one has to do is to plead with God to give one that gift of total sexual action.

87
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,820
Because otherwise, we need to get pornography to look at the strange woman and be seen her underwear.

88
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,820
As far as I'm concerned...

89
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,680
You can go too.

90
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,280
Go back to Tony's and that woman you were mooning.

91
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,880
Oh, knock it off, will you?

92
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,680
Now, you pulled a boner tonight and you know it.

93
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,500
Why?

94
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,820
My husband.

95
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:08,860
Huh.

96
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:41,520
inside out you associate with women don't have personal preparation financialick

97
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:41,640
Wow.

98
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:47,880
and

99
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,200
Anita

100
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,760
N

101
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:48,760


102
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,180
Thank you.

103
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,920
Thank you.

104
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,500
Thank you.

105
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,880
Thank you.

106
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,560
Thank you.

107
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,000
Thank you.

108
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,380
Thank you.

109
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,080
Thank you.

110
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:55,960
Thank you.

111
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,700
Thank you.

112
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,860
Thank you.

113
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,920
Thank you.

114
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,540
Thank you.

115
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,340
Thank you.

116
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,420
with our own organs as we will.

117
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,620
Well, all things bright and mutable.

118
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,260
So that would be like getting to fifth base

119
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,400
if someone were to palpate your pancreas.

120
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,200
If you have more than one sexual organ,

121
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,920
you can imagine...

122
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,000
That's like going all the way, but then some.

123
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,820
Oh.

124
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,360
I know what first base is, second base, third base.

125
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,960
In theory, I know what these things are.

126
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,700
And a home run.

127
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,600
Well, theoretically.

128
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,160
But pancreatic palpation would be...

129
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,620
the fifth base, I guess.

130
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,140
Beyond all the way and through to the other side.

131
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,660
Through, break on through, man.

132
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,540
See, I knew you were going to get it,

133
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,640
but think about your liver and your spleen.

134
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,900
And the myopic fund you can have reacting in such a way.

135
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,680
I mean, if you had one, you don't have much spleen.

136
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,940
Except I noticed when you bit my leg on the way here.

137
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,880
But outside of that, you see, not a spleenless man, but...

138
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,540
Not spleenless, but...

139
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,480
Not heavily spleen.

140
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,720
Yeah, heavily spleen.

141
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,000
We could say.

142
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,780
I've known a lot of people, I just call them heavenly...

143
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
Heavenly, hell no.

144
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Heavily spleen.

145
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,620
Now, friends, while I'm still thinking about the news of the cult...

146
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:09,940
It's a hands away from it.

147
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,120
You know, X Day's coming up, the end of the world.

148
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:13,960
Once again.

149
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,040
On July 5th, the planet will be destroyed at 7 a.m.

150
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,540
How many times is it going to end?

151
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,400
And if not, we'll have more, get more practice for that moment.

152
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Because as the...

153
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:23,620
Yay!

154
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,140


155
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,140


156
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,140


157
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,140


158
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,140


159
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,140


160
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,140


161
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,760
The lesson is, you don't know what day X Day.

162
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,160
The rupture could be any day.

163
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Any second now.

164
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,300
Any moment.

165
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,180
Are you ready?

166
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,160
Lesson one?

167
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,420
There is no lesson.

168
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,740
Anyway, you can...

169
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,100
So we're getting ready.

170
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,360
We're getting all geared up for our X Day drill in Sherman, New York, later on in the summer.

171
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:51,880
And I got so excited about it because I put up a pictorial on the Subgenius website,

172
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,140
which you can look at if you're interested.

173
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,820
And it's free.

174
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,940
It's a...

175
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,620
Also, just look at our...

176
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,880
If you look at our Vips page, then scroll down to the X Day part and you can't miss it.

177
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,240
It says, the X Days of your pictorial, adults only.

178
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:16,940
And it is in fact, the naked adults only pictures of our grandparents at X Days in the past.

179
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,160
Quite indeed.

180
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,540
Quite indeed.

181
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:17,840
It's...

182
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,420
They're really...

183
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,480
It's pictures from X Days of the 30s, the 20s even, the 30s and 40s.

184
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,140
So it's kind of old fashioned.

185
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,140


186
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,500
It's old fashioned.

187
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,020
But it's sexy.

188
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,180
Nice sepia tone.

189
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,760
Because even the subgeniuses of yore, well, if they hadn't been sexy, we wouldn't be here.

190
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,320
Now, would we?

191
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,900
I like the funny writing on the back of it.

192
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,460
Dearest mom and dad, I bet you'd have thought you'd never see me this way.

193
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,220
Signed your daughter Erna.

194
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:41,880
Erna.

195
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,520
What was it?

196
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:42,820
Erstwhile?

197
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,060
No, that was the guy.

198
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,320
Anyway, I love when they write off these little diaphragms to each other in Uniclaw language.

199
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
And they have before.

200
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,880
Well, you can't see those on these website pictures.

201
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,600
Because you can't flip the picture over and look at the handwriting on the back of the snapshot.

202
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,940
But I scanned all those old photos that your folks took at X Days and Prince of...

203
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,920
Everybody's, you know.

204
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,640
There's some...

205
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,340
And it's a lot of...

206
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,220
My great-grandpa looked great in like a hat and a pipe and nothing else.

207
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,640
That's right.

208
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,660
I couldn't believe that an old guy that I look at as a very old guy could actually be strutting around there like...

209
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,740
People wear more clothes there now.

210
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,860
Hardly anybody goes there.

211
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,680
Nobody goes completely nude at X Day.

212
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,240
Well, that's the nature of the world.

213
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,700
Everyone wears more clothes at all times because clothes are...

214
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,380
It's not the nature of naturists.

215
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,960
No, certainly not.

216
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,540
But who follows their followings?

217
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,380
Those are droppings.

218
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,160
You know what I'm saying?

219
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,780
That's how you find Bob.

220
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,020
You follow the droppings.

221
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,960
Follow the droppings.

222
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,360
And the cotter pins.

223
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,960
Yeah.

224
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,640
And the jello.

225
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,100
People forget.

226
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,840
You said before they were hand grenade cotter pins, not jello.

227
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,100
What else have we got coming up that I can announce because I'm not getting paid for it?

228
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,680
Hamburg Devival.

229
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,440
We're not going to be there, but if you friends happen to be in Hamburg, Germany on May 3rd, just follow the...

230
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:11,620
Look for the smoke and the flames and that's where the big Devival will be with all the Euro subs, which includes several American subs who can't go home to America.

231
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,720
Can you imagine?

232
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,300
We've stooped so low that our droppings won't even allow our alien friends to return to their homelands.

233
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,980
It makes you want to seep and cry like a tiny...

234
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,660
My droppings aren't stopping anybody from...

235
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,380
From doing anything.

236
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,040
I don't think.

237
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,920
Oh, I didn't mean in the sub-natural, I meant in the over-gross, or the uber-gross, I guess you would call it.

238
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,240
The uber-grossian-mentioner.

239
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,860
Speaking of uber-gross, what else?

240
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:49,360
Actually, people who are interested in uber-gross subgenius events may want to just look at subgenius.com and look at the news page because there are things coming up that we can't tell you about.

241
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,480
You understand?

242
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,000
That's how good they are.

243
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,700
We're not allowed to...

244
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,540
Are we allowed to tell about the Princess We Are Doe's band singing at the Hessler Street Fair this year?

245
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,440
That's for free, yes.

246
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:00,960
Yeah.

247
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,420
Revel will be at...

248
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,580
Ever revel-read, hopefully.

249
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,780
May 17th, the Hester Street Fair.

250
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,780
Hessler, even.

251
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,300
We can't tell you anything that does us any good.

252
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,460
That's the law.

253
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,580
But we're going to...

254
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,000
It's not a subgenius law, that's the human law.

255
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,220
No subgenius can do anything it wants.

256
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,920
That's the law.

257
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,620
That's the law of the land.

258
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,820
That's the law as it's written in the books now.

259
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And the Bible and the Holy Constitution.

260
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:34,260
And yet the 14th Amendment says that anything that more than one subgenius businessman does is therefore legal, becomes legal at that point.

261
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,220
Yet so she all be done to by thyself.

262
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,460
So if you're doing it by yourself, it might still be illegal.

263
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,120
But if two of us are doing it, then it's okay.

264
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,360
And what yet two businessmen do, only they do...

265
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,380
That law was written, it didn't say...

266
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,700
And it said businessmen, it did not say businesspersons.

267
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,920
There it is.

268
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,440
So, you know, it's that old double standard.

269
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:53,900
We have to take...

270
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,680
We can't take that at face value unless we're like a pack of two-faced liars.

271
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,260
We have to assume that that meant business...

272
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,900
You know how women used to have to call themselves men when they went to work?

273
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,640
And then they had to call themselves men in the afternoon?

274
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:15,340
And by the way, I'd just like to mention the fact that you forgot to plug my little thing that I'm doing at the Communist Party meeting of the Communist Party of the United States of America.

275
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,380
I didn't know that.

276
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,740
I didn't know that either.

277
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,520
Sure you didn't like it.

278
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,100
I knew you were a commie, but I didn't know that.

279
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,760
I've been emailing you guys all week.

280
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:29,140
I'm going to be speaking at the Grand Function with the frock fairies and sores of my comrades, my tovarishes.

281
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,920
Well, it's not really Russian.

282
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,080
We just call ourselves comrades.

283
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,860
We're going to be having the fish dinner...

284
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,960
Well, the fish luncheon afterwards.

285
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,880
And we're going to be having POC beer that's been in the basement for 40 years.

286
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,140
What's POC mean?

287
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,540
Pee-pee on Cleveland.

288
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,500
Or it used to mean Pfeiffer of Cleveland, but...

289
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,200
Pride of Cleveland.

290
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,720
Right.

291
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,860
I always said pride of Cleveland, but it really means pee-pee on Cleveland or poop on Cleveland.

292
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,700
Oh, that's just a vernacularism.

293
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,560
When we were childs we used to say that.

294
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:06,400
But I'm going to be speaking about the movement itself and also the fact that I think the subgeniuses, and many of them, should join me.

295
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,340
The commies?

296
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,580
Should become communist, like me.

297
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,680
That's like the opposite of Bob's.

298
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,860
Bob's like the ultimate god of capitalism.

299
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,180
Well, then don't you see the irony in the perfect six things?

300
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,860
Making money at the expense of the sucker.

301
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,260
Don't you see that's the succinctly perfect statement for the irony of the ironic thing?

302
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,140
Customer is the sucker of the world.

303
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,140
It is the sucker of the world, but as long as...

304
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,000
So why should we be interested in a bunch of commies?

305
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,180
Because we're all suckers.

306
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,780
Yeah, but some suckers are more equal than others, Dave.

307
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,260
And I'm one of those more equal ones.

308
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,320
So that means if I was going to be a commie, I'd be the commissar.

309
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,800
You would be dressed up in the pig suit.

310
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,560
I'd be the equal guy in the pig suit that got driven by a human chauffeur.

311
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,900
To the big barnyard in the Kremlin.

312
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,800
Well, I'm going to be wearing Lenin's...

313
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,460
I'm going to be wearing Lenin's overcoat, man.

314
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,920
I'm going to be talking to the mass...

315
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,800
I'm wearing Lenin's underwear right now.

316
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,220
Are you really?

317
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
My Lenin's, I call them.

318
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,600
Your Lenin's, Lenin's.

319
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,920
How long did it take you to get those things?

320
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,800
I guess they were real expensive on eBay or something, right?

321
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,820
They're so intimate.

322
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,700
Ah, the right state.

323
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,000
What's this noise in the background?

324
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,020
That's the rural war room.

325
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,600
It's the rural war room thing.

326
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,320
It's the rural war room machine.

327
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,000
It plays on and on and on.

328
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,760
You remove the crown with your thumb.

329
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,400
Your prehensile thumb that Bob knows.

330
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,560
No, not Bob.

331
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,920
That duh, duh knows.

332
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,880
That nature does not know.

333
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,500
That nature...

334
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,260
Remove your thumb from your eye.

335
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,140
Now stand near the door.

336
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,720
Move out of the door.

337
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,940
Move out the window.

338
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,740
Now flap your arms.

339
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,140
Flap your wings.

340
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,980
You can fly!

341
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,100
Yep.

342
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,300
You can fly, baby.

343
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,640
Just get with Bob and grow your wings.

344
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,580
I'm flying!

345
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,180
Grow the wings in your mind, man.

346
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

347
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,560
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,480
I'm sorry.

349
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,180
Bob, I'm sorry.

350
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,120
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:06,760
I'm sorry.

352
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,060
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,760
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:08,760


355
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,340
Bob is like a pink, glarp, normal.

356
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,040
He supports the conspiracy, sports class division.

357
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,360
He ought to be killed.

358
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,420
But he's a pretty nice guy for a personal savior.

359
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,700
I know he is.

360
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,380
To quote a drelloid mutant.

361
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,260
Get off my flight!

362
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,240
The late drelloid mutant.

363
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,340
The late, late drelloid mutant.

364
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,180
Oh, we're gonna be playing a song by the...

365
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:48,340
Later on in the show, we're going to be playing an ancient song that somebody found in a pile of 78s that appears to be a Church of the Subgenius Hillbilly gospel song from like the...

366
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,820
30s or the 20s or something.

367
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,640
It was on a wax record, but we'll get to that.

368
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,020
We can't figure out if it's an oaky or if it's actually like, you know, from West Virginia or something, man.

369
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,280
It's way up here.

370
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,580
We're trying to figure out the label.

371
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,260
I guess it was on the Sugarfest radio show.

372
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,700
Yes, we can't tell if it's an oaky or a pudding.

373
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,160
But I can't play that because it doesn't...

374
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,280
It may be a pudding.

375
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,900
It doesn't come up yet.

376
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,800
Like a pudding.

377
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:12,980
However...

378
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,400
Is it?

379
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,360
However...

380
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,320
Let's just see what happens if...

381
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,320


382
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:18,760
It's a story.

383
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,100
Hold it.

384
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,360
Love That Bob.

385
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,020
Starring Bob Cumming.

386
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,220
You're going to look sensational in a bathing suit.

387
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,740
I know that.

388
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,680
We're swinging.

389
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,420
Bob didn't take this.

390
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,620
Bob can take better pictures.

391
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,400
Take, take.

392
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,820
Rock and roll rears its ugly head.

393
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,060
Bob, Bob, rock and roll, rock and roll.

394
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,880
You're big.

395
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,080
Hold it, baby.

396
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,580
Oh, I'd love to.

397
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,420
Oh, peckers.

398
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,380
Peckers.

399
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,180
Peckers.

400
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,040
Well, Bob, I just found a way to get the guitar, Bob.

401
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,800
Hey, swell.

402
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,460
Swell.

403
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,040
Who could he be?

404
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,440
Who could he be?

405
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,020
Crazy.

406
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,680
Where can I get that kind of sausage?

407
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,880
Bob's rock and roll.

408
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,440
So Bob Bob.

409
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,060
No, no, please, please don't ask me to show it to you.

410
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,960
Guitar wizardry virtuoso.

411
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,620
You'll never get a girl with rock and roll.

412
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,900
Bob, the girl's flip.

413
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,220
That's so true, John.

414
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,200
That's so true, John.

415
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,260
That's so true, John.

416
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,300
That's so true, John.

417
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,300


418
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,300


419
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,300


420
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,300


421
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,340
Really, really, really.

422
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,160
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

423
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,940
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

424
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,980
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

425
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,140
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

426
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,620
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

427
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:23,800
Focus.

428
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,520
Focus.

429
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:24,920
Focus.

430
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,300
Focus.

431
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,200
The Center for Strong Homosexual Issues.

432
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,040
Internet pornography.

433
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,520
Pornography.

434
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,100
Let me wallow in ignorance.

435
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,220
Let me wallow in ignorance.

436
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,000
Anxiety.

437
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,520
Anxiety.

438
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:34,980
I need help.

439
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,400
You know, you know.

440
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,200
But I need to do it.

441
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,640
Lower and lower and lower and lower.

442
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,440
She.

443
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,740
All the way down to your zitter.

444
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,880
And she went, and I just felt really, however that worked, in touch.

445
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,660
I care about dogs.

446
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,180
Dogs.

447
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,420
Dogs.

448
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,840
Dogs.

449
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,120
Dogs.

450
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,200
We do hair.

451
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,900
We do hair.

452
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,560
It goes both ways.

453
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,000
But it's all paid for with public money.

454
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,460
So there.

455
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:55,960
So there.

456
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,700
So there.

457
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,520
It's been fun.

458
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,160
It's been fun.

459
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,080
Fun.

460
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,360
Fun.

461
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:00,600


462
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,060
Fun.

463
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,240
Fun.

464
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:01,400


465
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:01,520


466
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:01,680
Fun.

467
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:01,700
Fun.

468
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:01,880
Fun.

469
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:01,880


470
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:01,900
Fun.

471
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:01,900


472
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:01,940
Fun.

473
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,100
Fun.

474
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,100


475
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,100


476
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,100


477
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,560
Fun.

478
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,560
Fun.

479
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,400
Fun.

480
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,200
Fun.

481
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,200


482
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,200


483
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,200


484
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,200


485
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,200


486
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,200


487
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,200


488
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,200


489
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,940
I am chip.

490
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,320
A chip.

491
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,320


492
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,320


493
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,320


494
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,320


495
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,320


496
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,320


497
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,320


498
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,320


499
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,740
Everybody.

500
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:34,920
Bye-bye.

501
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,440
San Francisco.

502
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,500
San Francisco.

503
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,520
Oh, very...

504
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,000
The rest is rat version, rat version, rat version.

505
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,860
I don't like it.

506
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,360
Wait a minute.

507
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:13,860
Wait a minute.

508
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,740
No extra work.

509
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,540
You're in check.

510
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,540
What are you trying to pull, mister?

511
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,760
You don't think I'm telling the truth?

512
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,880
Don't be too long.

513
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,600
It gives me pleasure to...

514
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,680
San Francisco, I...

515
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,160
Oh, big story in papers.

516
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,800
Big trouble.

517
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,320
Hey, boy.

518
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,540
I've been very concerned.

519
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,040
I've been very concerned with you these past days, Victor.

520
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,900
What kind of dealings do you have with the director of the morgue?

521
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,780
Are you interested in corpses?

522
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,540
Oh, God, Fleets.

523
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,120
I shall really have to tell you the story of the inquisitive commandant.

524
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,680
The one at Belsam, remember?

525
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,700
They might believe that you want that atomic element to supply electric power.

526
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,380
But I...

527
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,640
What are you trying to say?

528
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,740
I don't know.

529
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,880
I don't know?

530
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,420
I have no idea.

531
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,060
I don't know.

532
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,720
Could I repeat what I just said?

533
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,220
Unless, of course, you could repeat it for me.

534
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,140
No, no, no, P.P.

535
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,300
Ah, do svitanya.

536
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,220
Shtova.

537
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,680
Shtova.

538
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,960
It's a nice deal.

539
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,280
It's...

540
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,920
It's a Russian bust.

541
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,300
It's a big deal.

542
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,680
I don't know.

543
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,540
I would like to smell my shoe.

544
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:45,780
Repeat.

545
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,020
I would like to smell my shoe.

546
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,020
Repeat in English.

547
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,160
I would like to smell your shoe.

548
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,240
I would like to smell your shoe.

549
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,100
Repeat in English.

550
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,720
I would like to smell your shoe.

551
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,520
I am the shoe smeller.

552
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:05,800
I am the shoe smeller.

553
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,520
That's the language of God.

554
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,460
The pure language of the angels.

555
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,740
Unaffected by three rows of teeth,

556
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,780
the animals who speak the language of God

557
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,860
are known for miles and miles in the Amazon basin

558
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,180
for releasing loud, unctuous quantities

559
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,560
of good old Mother Nature's food.

560
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,820
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

561
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,400
And as long as they worship,

562
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,480
they worship at the foot of the statue of the piped head,

563
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,080
they all is well in the kingdom of sweat and vigor.

564
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,160
Sha-la-ka-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

565
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,040
My shoe smell funny to you?

566
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,500
Repeat in Hintekorosh.

567
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,900
Sha-la-ka-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

568
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,460
The shoe is angry with me.

569
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,980
Sha-la-ka-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

570
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,020
Oh, my God.

571
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,520
Repeat.

572
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,000
Bob is the shoe.

573
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,280
Me-kip-a-lo-bo-bo Bob.

574
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,920
The shoe...

575
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,380
Me-kip-a-lo-bo-bo Bob.

576
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,760
Kani.

577
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,600
Kani.

578
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,340
Kani me-kik-kik-kik.

579
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,240
Kani is the high heel pi-hat-sha.

580
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,720
Repeat in Urdu.

581
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,140
Ur-ta-ta-pa-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

582
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,500
Kani.

583
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,720
And now in Panglossian.

584
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,740
Uh-oh.

585
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,440
Uh-oh.

586
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,720
Time to turn the background music up.

587
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,540
I don't know what to say.

588
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,680
Oh, look, Dave, you have to go let somebody in.

589
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,540
You have to go open the door.

590
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,380
Friends, it's just you and me listening while Dave runs the door.

591
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:32,380


592
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:32,380


593
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:32,760
Well, this unexpected invitation to...

594
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,560
Prince?

595
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,660
Oh, my God.

596
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,580
Maybe it's okay.

597
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,180
Fine.

598
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,060
Fine, you got no滾

599
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,040
Would you like to basically only do..

600
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,200
에

601
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,560
σ

602
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,880
Now how would youURDO them?

603
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,400
Now how would you like them?

604
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,800
Now, speaking of...

605
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,120
Shotzi, my little pearl.

606
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,460
I know that you are wearing lederhosen on your ears.

607
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,860
You're not supposed to notice or speak of the lederhosen.

608
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,080
Lederhosen are a personal part of women's attire.

609
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,640
And they're meant to be smelled by men with big, big hair.

610
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,960
And big noses.

611
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,740
And you know what a big nose means.

612
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,720
Yes.

613
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,660
Vegan nose hair clippers.

614
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:37,500
Does not want any other man to smell the lederhosen.

615
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,120
Would you like to languish in the aquarium with me for a short duration?

616
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,060
Does that line ever work?

617
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,480
Sometimes.

618
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,560
Yeah.

619
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,700
In Parfait, it is said,

620
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,400
Noshcap in handy, ratatal.

621
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,280
I knew a guy who would go into a bar and walk up to every single woman and say that to her.

622
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,700
And he would go,

623
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,460
I'm going to get slapped 30 times.

624
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,540
But sooner or later, he'd find one who'd go,

625
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,680
Yeah, baby.

626
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,640
Your place or mine.

627
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,680
Your friend went for the slaps only.

628
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,580
That's possible.

629
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,460
Highly likely in this case.

630
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:16,860
I don't know.

631
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,920
It was the only way he could score.

632
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,240
Wasn't he the one you called the two-tongued rabbit of Bob?

633
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,940
No, you're thinking of someone else.

634
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,960
That was the other guy.

635
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,740
He was working the percentages, man.

636
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,840
Now, let's...

637
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,840
We got this piece, this old record from...

638
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:34,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

639
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,380
Actually, she didn't send the record.

640
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,880
She sent an MP3 that she had copied from this record.

641
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,060
Our friend, Reverend Samantha,

642
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:49,520
who all the regular devotional goers would know Reverend Samantha.

643
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,980
She used to be the only girl at the Devo shows.

644
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,580
And that's changed.

645
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,320
But she was the first.

646
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,460
Anyway, she sent this song.

647
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,400
And a letter.

648
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,020
I'm going to read the letter.

649
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,360
Reverend Samantha said,

650
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:10,900
This little musical gem, which I found lying in a pile of old dusty 78s in the attic.

651
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,840
Kids, that means old CDs only before CDs were invented.

652
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,320
They were big wax discs.

653
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:25,180
It appears to be a Depression-era Church of the Subgenius hillbilly gospel song.

654
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,960
Can it be?

655
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,880
There's no reason why it couldn't be.

656
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,680
Although it's...

657
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,100
It's rare to find something from that part of the country.

658
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,840
Anyway, she says,

659
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,480
I could just barely make out the words on the record label.

660
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,940
It seemed to say something like,

661
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,480
Look away from the pinks to the billowing pipe.

662
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,500
That's the title of the song.

663
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,320
By the Mutant Mountain Boys.

664
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:55,220
Interesting how they got away with such politically incorrect names back then.

665
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,120
I think it's interesting how pristine it almost is.

666
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,500
I mean, when you look at it, it looks like it was just cut yesterday,

667
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:08,640
and yet it is one of those, like, old OK Bluebird type of, you know, renderings there on 78 RPM.

668
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,060
Well, we're going to play this.

669
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,540
She figured out the words to it, I think, because they're really hard to hear on this old record.

670
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,860
And kindly printed them for us to be able to...

671
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,680
Yes.

672
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,060
Who's kindly?

673
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,000
Who's kindly?

674
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,160
Let's see.

675
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,620
Is that another person involved?

676
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,480
No, that's me.

677
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,180
I'm kindly.

678
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,260
Kindly, all right.

679
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,640
She said, you know this...

680
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,800
This just might be the only existing copy in the world,

681
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,640
so here I am now spreading it like a virus.

682
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,660
I'm going to play it now, and the singers will sing along.

683
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,200
Look away from the pinks to the billowing pipe.

684
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,560
From your life of work and toil, look away.

685
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,460
There's a hole in your soul that's burning you alive.

686
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,940
We're slacked and we'll never decay.

687
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,320
Look away.

688
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,980
Send your chariot.

689
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,780
Look away.

690
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,920
For eternal sleep.

691
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,360
From the pinks to the billowing pipe.

692
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,600
Billowing pipe.

693
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,120
Look away.

694
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,040
Look away.

695
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,460
For the morning past.

696
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,940
From the pinks to the billowing pipe.

697
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,080
Billowing pipe.

698
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,060
Billowing pipe.

699
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,760
I saw a vision above.

700
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,580
Look away.

701
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,420
I can walk again.

702
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,140
Of course there's nothing really wrong with my legs

703
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,800
and a good old 10 ton crusher wouldn't care.

704
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,020
I need my body to be ripped off of the stones I put in life.

705
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,700
Self-responsibilities getting harder to bear

706
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,060
in your blind walk of life.

707
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:48,840
Solstice.

708
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,980
There's a hypnotic man who is beckoning from

709
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,520
with his disembodied head,

710
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,560
always there to stay,

711
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,140
Look away, look away

712
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,940
From the pain to the glowing heart

713
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,560
Look away, look away

714
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,420
From the pain to the glowing heart

715
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,180
I can almost see again

716
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,660
I can almost walk again

717
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,540
I can almost see again

718
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,240
I can almost hear again

719
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,120
I can almost, I can almost

720
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:40,400
If your conflicts with normals

721
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,560
Bring struggles and strife

722
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,640
Live onward your rantings ensue

723
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,440
Look away from the pain to the glowing pipe

724
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,040
It's raining in dives down for you

725
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:59,540
Look away, look away

726
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:05,780
From the pain to the glowing, glowing pipe

727
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,600
Look away, look away

728
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,060
From the pain to the glowing, glowing pipe

729
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,300
It's a beautiful, beautiful

730
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,940
Thank you, Reverend Samantha, for finding that.

731
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,900
And all the voracious loving, I must say, I've never met you,

732
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,000
but it seems to me if your knees were as knobby as your head,

733
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,020
I'd be in love once again.

734
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,720
Her knees are as knobby as her head, if I remember correctly.

735
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,420
They are not.

736
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,700
Her knees are perfectly sleek and beautiful.

737
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,060
Well, how about all these polygamists lately?

738
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,940
Back in Stane County, Texas, they've been running the polygamists.

739
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,780
They're hydrocephalic down there, and there's more than one of them, I guess,

740
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,240
and they're all married to each other.

741
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,960
And the smallest one is only five years old.

742
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,300
That's right.

743
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,700
And Grandpappy is pushing 109, but believe me,

744
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,880
he can still be an indirect old thumb on it.

745
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,280
You're not kidding.

746
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,100
I'm not. I'm trying not to be anyway.

747
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,900
Texas is a great place for cults.

748
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,060
You know, even the Mormons had to move down to Texas

749
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,640
to do their really cultish stuff.

750
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,480
Had to move out of Ohio and New York.

751
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,040
Well, now, I've heard,

752
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,900
there's been food riots in the news all over the world

753
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,760
because there's been an 83% price rise over the last three years

754
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,820
in foodstuffs in general for the entire planet.

755
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,860
Yeah, I thought it was 40, and I guess it was 40 in one year.

756
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,740
I thought it was 40% over three years.

757
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,380
That's right.

758
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,060
And that even includes us Merkins paying more,

759
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,640
and pretty soon everybody's going to be dead.

760
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,560
You mean you've been eating your Merkins?

761
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,400
You're so hungry you're eating a Merkin?

762
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,780
We've been driven to that.

763
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,480
There were times when we were so wroth.

764
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,620
I remember Mom and Dad were so,

765
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,780
they not only took in laundry and other children's ducks and stuff like that,

766
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,960
they also played with others' behavior models

767
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,100
just to survive, to get by the next day.

768
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,880
They ate chest Merkins, man.

769
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,180
Chest Merkin.

770
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,580
We had it on Thursday night with lasagna, man.

771
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,400
Chest Merkin, you know?

772
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,860
Well, they're literally friends.

773
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,000
There have been food riots all over the world lately.

774
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,060
Haiti, the Philippines, Egypt, Columbus, Dayton.

775
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,060
La Vie.

776
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,420
And you know every place is Dayton Place.

777
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,280
Yeah.

778
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,480
I say that because nobody would understand Payton Place.

779
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,800
The only old people know where Payton Place is.

780
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:44,220
Well, Dayton Place is where the three original alien sky choppers were regulated.

781
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,640
It was where they first crashed.

782
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,660
Yeah, they took them from Roswell, too.

783
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,780
And they used Roswell as a cover-up for the Dayton Place UFO crashes, saucer crashes.

784
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,860
Well, there was, at Wright-Patterson, remember?

785
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,820
Right, yes.

786
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,460
You said you inspected the bodies, and they argued with you about it.

787
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,480
Yes, it was all quite foul and disgusting.

788
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,040
It's weird when a corpse becomes animated right while you're arguing with it.

789
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,580
And yet charming somehow at the same time.

790
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,660
Well, you know, dead people do have a certain charm about them.

791
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,520
They're kind of distant.

792
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,200
There's been a debate lately about who do you like best,

793
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,180
the running, fast-moving zombies,

794
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,160
or the shuffling, lurching, stumbling zombies.

795
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,560
I'm not a big fan of the stiff zombies,

796
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,540
but I think it would just be too scary to have a long-legged, gazelle-type zombie just chasing you down.

797
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,040
And there's the hooker zombies.

798
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,900
That lure you in.

799
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,560
And the sails zombies.

800
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,980
Man, the speed zombies are the scary ones to me, man.

801
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,800
The speed zombies?

802
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,240
Speed zombies are the scariest of all.

803
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,800
Meth zombies.

804
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:49,420
Yeah.

805
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,900
Cochasa zombies were a big deal in Brazil when I was down there.

806
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,860
That was the local drink.

807
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,020
Cochasa zombies were real scary.

808
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,100
Cochasa.

809
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,320
Is it like, TJ, it's a sped-up beer that a native lady spit it up?

810
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:01,700
No, no.

811
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,860
That's a different beer.

812
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,760
It's made from spit.

813
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,340
A different beer, they call it.

814
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:13,100
Cochasa is sort of like tequila, but it's like a liquid-fluid thing that makes your brain messed up.

815
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,160
Yeah, it's made from potash or something.

816
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:15,840
I forget what.

817
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,400
Wow.

818
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,400
That is really, really hard to believe.

819
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,220
But there are zombies.

820
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,160
I can believe that part.

821
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,420
Literal.

822
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,300
I can believe that part.

823
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,160
You know, Cochasa zombies.

824
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,600
Those who have thoroughly deadened their brains with Cochasa.

825
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,120
I don't think I'm pronouncing that right.

826
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,800
I had one too many myself.

827
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,040
One too many zombies?

828
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,200
I came close to being, I have had a zombie.

829
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,860
What the hell is that?

830
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,380
When I was younger, when I was a young man.

831
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,660
Oh, you carnal, you little corny.

832
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,840
You have to cut their hands off because otherwise they'll scratch you and claw your eyes out and stuff.

833
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,520
Yeah, they have no idea of their strengths since they're just on temporal motor slabbling.

834
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,060
And of course they have to be nuzzled.

835
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,000
You have to muzzle them.

836
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,620
Yeah, because they want to eat your brain while you're nibbling at their ear.

837
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,140
And you, you know, the smell is not great.

838
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,400
And you don't want to do any like weird numbers.

839
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,660
And the bits fall off.

840
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,340
The bits falling off is not cool.

841
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,620
Yeah, call me when you guys are done with this conversation.

842
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:14,760
But can you imagine doing one of those like old sexual numbers, you know, they give them numbers and stuff like that?

843
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,620
Number 72.

844
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,520
Number 72.

845
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,560
Can you imagine doing 72 with a zombie?

846
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,360
What do you mean imagine?

847
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,120
Yeah, I can.

848
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
That's what I was getting at.

849
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:22,740
Yeah.

850
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,960
I'm from Texas, man.

851
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,320
That's not that big of a deal down there.

852
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,080
So, Ed Geins.

853
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,420
I've noticed people are kind of, kind of weak stomach up here.

854
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,080
They're kind of, kind of picky.

855
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,280
They are a body, visceral race of murderers and biters and biters.

856
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,660
That's us.

857
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,820
Ed Geins, Geins.

858
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,820
Praise Bob.

859
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,540
Praise Bob.

860
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,120
Praise Bob.

861
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,060
He led us in the way of the Texas businessman.

862
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,160
I thought you were going to say he led you into the desert instead of out.

863
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:50,760
And the zombie.

864
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:51,720
Yeah.

865
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,360
The Rogues Ouch.

866
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:53,720
Szemerov.

867
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:54,580
Szemerov.

868
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:04,340
Szemerov and you know, the Szemerov guy.

869
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:04,340


870
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,480
And they never lonely hang out with you.

871
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:11,860
Oh, no.

872
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,180
And they never leave, right.

873
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,940
No, but they never listen to us or anyone in the store.

874
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,060


875
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,060


876
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,060


877
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,060


878
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,160
I know they have a cuvier of all the freавайas.

879
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:18,180


880
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:18,940
What's it called?

881
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,080
Xyzulโ aus?

882
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:19,340


883
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:19,340


884
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:19,340


885
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:19,340


886
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,700
I don't feel mean to like brother, you know.

887
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,460
UFOs? It's kind of like one of those that sprang up around a tech shop?

888
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,260
Now, it so happens that if you put a video camera on the mysterious lights

889
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:34,120
and another video camera at a highway about 10 miles away across the desert,

890
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:40,200
the car lights seem to dictate how the UFO lights move.

891
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,820
And there's kind of, some people say that it's merely a mirage situation that's always in place

892
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:51,520
so that what appears to be mysterious lights flying around in the desert

893
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,840
are really just headlights from several miles away on the desert

894
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,640
bounced by atmospheric freak.

895
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,940
But that's as supernatural as the damn UFOs to begin with.

896
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,200
Yeah, right.

897
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,760
So it's like, what you gonna do?

898
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,220
Yeah.

899
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,500
What are you gonna do?

900
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,860
There's no fractal fissuring to create an illusion of a thermoscopy.

901
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,860
There's no way that you can get around it like it's flaming fire and you still can't see it.

902
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,160
I'm sorry, I'm frothing at the neck.

903
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,920
It's getting messy.

904
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,600
And so, they all remembered.

905
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:29,740
It wasn't the first time the little lady from Brazil had her star to tell.

906
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,800
Things were bad everywhere.

907
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,840
We took her back to Sao Paulo where she hoped to meet her father, Rex Rumroy.

908
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,560
He was a rum runner, all right.

909
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,800
He brought the last big bottle of booze up from Franquas and landed in Boston last week.

910
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,280
Yeah.

911
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,420
But don't ask me.

912
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:51,760
I don't know about it.

913
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,660
Ask this little lady right here.

914
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,100
The one with the exposed skull.

915
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,800
I think you're still sick.

916
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,760
I cannot speak.

917
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:05,200
My voice, vocal cords have been removed by lonesome cowboy Dave.

918
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,020
I cannot speak no more.

919
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,020
You're still sick.

920
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,400
That's it.

921
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,720
Good girl.

922
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,040
That's it.

923
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,420
Good girl.

924
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,820
Did it hurt?

925
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,980
I'm being paid.

926
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:17,740
I'm getting paid.

927
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,180
Find yourself again.

928
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:19,980
I'm not lost.

929
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,480
You're working yourself up into a...

930
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,140
Full-size nervous breakdown.

931
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,700
Serene, clear-eyed.

932
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,200
Let me take your photograph, will you?

933
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,180
Let me take your photograph, will you?

934
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,880
You're still sick.

935
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,220
Okay, I'm sick.

936
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,060
The symbolism.

937
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:38,860
No.

938
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,340
No.

939
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,760
Look, this whole thing is nothing but a hallucination.

940
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,000
Let me come with you.

941
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,180
No.

942
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,960
That's the end of the shaft.

943
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,060
No, I'd better phone the scientists.

944
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,460
I'll be in charge.

945
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,200
Petrified historic man.

946
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,740
But everybody will see her in her nakedness.

947
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:56,640
Nakedness.

948
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,380
What is time but a conception of man?

949
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,520
She's not an object of vivisection.

950
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,660
I will be in charge.

951
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,560
Well, we were all somewhat excited, I would say, and we still are.

952
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,740
How would you like to rap, rap, rap, rap, rap?

953
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,080
Oh.

954
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,420
Six, maybe seven.

955
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,780
This is quite common, John.

956
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,420
You have a fear of the future.

957
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,860
Is that why I scream?

958
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,060
You want it, yet you fear it.

959
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,280
Five.

960
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,400
Might be a winner.

961
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:21,500
Five.

962
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,560
I want him now.

963
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,660
Now, do you understand?

964
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,440
Get him!

965
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,840
Enlightenment comes more easily in the dark.

966
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,900
Oh, yes.

967
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,060
It smells funny.

968
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,420
Then drink your tea.

969
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,240
What are you doing?

970
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:32,660
Nothing.

971
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,280
Look.

972
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,960
Why all the games?

973
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,420
Can't you just get on with it?

974
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,260
What do you want us to do?

975
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,880
We want you to praise Bob.

976
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,380
My friends, that's all we ask.

977
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,480
Well, it's actually not.

978
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:50,240
That's far from all we ask, but that's the first thing we ask is that you praise Bob.

979
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,500
Where did I hear that?

980
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,480
What are you two muttering about over there?

981
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:59,860
We're just having a little discussion about folks with brain injuries returning to the

982
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,460
job as full-grown zombies.

983
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:08,080
You know, at where we work, zombies come back every day and have to be rehabilitated, and

984
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,900
it costs the boss lots of money.

985
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,400
Indeed.

986
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,280
And that's why we think Dobbs is our answer.

987
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,660
Because Dobbs is not only going to get rid of those pesky monkeys, but he's also going

988
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,860
to kill the administration of the company as well.

989
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,580
In fact, no one's going to be left alive but me.

990
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,620
Maybe that's not Bob.

991
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,320
Maybe that's just my own.

992
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,520
You know what I'm saying?

993
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:33,960
How often do we ascribe to Bob feelings that are really just our own?

994
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,520
You know how it is.

995
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:41,540
You go, well, I feel like having a hamburger or ice cream cones.

996
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,340
I'm sure Bob would feel the same way.

997
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,940
He'd feel like it was okay for me to have that ice cream cone.

998
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,540
I'm sure he would.

999
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,460
And you know he would.

1000
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,520
Yes, he would.

1001
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,540
He's like the Lord baby Jesus, at least that way.

1002
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,040
Too much is always better than not enough, Bob said.

1003
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,020
He was lying, but it sounds great.

1004
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:03,240
And that's all that matters in your proper religion, modern religion.

1005
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,800
Yes, you left off the antecedent found years later.

1006
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,160
That's the only thing that's important is the antecedent.

1007
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,860
Maybe that's what we ran over on the way here.

1008
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:13,860
Bob's antecedent?

1009
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:14,700
Yes.

1010
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,680
Remember that thing we smushed all the way that squealed?

1011
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,820
It was before the pipe, so it might have been the pipe.

1012
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,660
It could have been actually alive.

1013
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,440
It could have been physically in corpus columnum.

1014
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,880
Too much is always better than not enough, but it's almost as bad.

1015
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,980
It's much worse.

1016
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,860
Believe you me.

1017
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,040
Look down here.

1018
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,660
Ew, I don't want to look down there.

1019
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,880
Oh, look, there's plenty of skulls being opened.

1020
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,920
And they're putting little Bob implants in each one.

1021
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,560
Look at those biological urges down there.

1022
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,860
Yes, you can see them flashing on the rhythmosphat and the displays.

1023
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:52,360
And of course, if you jump over here, make a little bunny jump or else you'll be electrocuted.

1024
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,200
No, no, jump over there.

1025
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,280
That's not a bunny rabbit.

1026
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,500
That's an ugly baby.

1027
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,820
That's an ugly baby.

1028
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,500
That's all.

1029
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,840
That's all it was.

1030
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,600
Yeah, we wouldn't do that to a rabbit.

1031
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,640
Of course not.

1032
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,520
But a redheaded stepchild, anything goes.

1033
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,060
Is subject to immediate electrocution.

1034
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,720
Or is it elocution?

1035
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,720
Hi, I'm your favorite redheaded stepchild.

1036
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:25,880
And I'd just like to say in my perfect English that Bob has saved my career, whatever the hell that might mean.

1037
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,980
Your electrifying elocution?

1038
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,520
If only we could remember what your career was that he saved.

1039
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:32,740
And who it was.

1040
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
You could finally make some money off of it.

1041
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,840
In fact, we can't find it.

1042
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,220
He'll save your career, but he won't tell you what it is.

1043
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,820
That's Bob for you, man.

1044
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,500
He's a mystery god.

1045
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,320
He's a little bit of a...

1046
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,080
He's a conundrum wrapped in a mystery.

1047
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,420
Deceiver.

1048
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,480
A little bit of a coco pele child.

1049
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,160
The blanket of cloudy weirdness around it.

1050
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,800
They say Bob plays in mysterious ways.

1051
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,580
They say Bob sits around in mysterious waters.

1052
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,780
They say Bob plays with himself in strange places.

1053
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,740
They say Bob is a strange place.

1054
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,460
He has unusual choices of where he's gonna expose himself.

1055
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,720
And they say Bob smells worse than stewed poohs.

1056
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,540
Well, that's cause he smokes that pipe.

1057
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,440
Subject or the object.

1058
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,900
And he's got the real frop.

1059
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,140
He doesn't have some street marijuana or wog hemp.

1060
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,820
He's doing the real thing.

1061
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,120
Have a frop zip you locks.

1062
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:31,540
Marifazolupina.

1063
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,420
That's where that smile comes from?

1064
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:33,840
For short.

1065
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,840
Can I ask you a question?

1066
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,120
That's what Bob's smoking and that's what you smell when Bob wafts by.

1067
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,780
Where did it come from?

1068
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,680
I mean, the frop or the zip you locks?

1069
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,720
Can I ask you that one question?

1070
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,360
Oh, it comes from Tibet.

1071
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:54,680
It only grows in Tibet on the graves and droppings of dead Tibetan holy men or yetis.

1072
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,180
Full blood yetis.

1073
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,400
Under the light of a full moon.

1074
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:07,580
If it would grow on the droppings of a half-breed yeti, then we'd be up to our necks in real frop.

1075
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,500
But we ain't.

1076
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,940
We're not up to even our toenails in real frop.

1077
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,120
It's hard to get, friends.

1078
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,700
Maybe that's for the best.

1079
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,340
I don't know.

1080
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,540
The Chinese both want it because they don't have the frop or zip you locks.

1081
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,120
And that's why they want Tibet.

1082
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,540
Is that what you're saying?

1083
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:24,500
Starek!

1084
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,220
Yoo-hoo!

1085
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,560
Is this what I think?

1086
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,980
I feel like I'm on something.

1087
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,520
This is one of those shows that's messing with my head.

1088
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,640
It may be this rural war room background that's...

1089
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,480
I can see the Fuhrer in my mind.

1090
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,140
He's standing up there by the great map.

1091
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,120
That's Groucho Marx, isn't it?

1092
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,680
Oh, that's Captain Spalding.

1093
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,340
That's not Hitler.

1094
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,440
No, that's not Captain Spalding.

1095
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,300
That's Rufus T. Firefly.

1096
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,320
That was Charlie Chaplin.

1097
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,220
Oh, that was Germaine Greer.

1098
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,420
Whatever is Germaine to me.

1099
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,020
Countess St. Germaine!

1100
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,000
It was the scientific segue.

1101
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,820
It was the easy way.

1102
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,280
Ouch!

1103
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,080
Ouch!

1104
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:03,880
Ouch!

1105
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:08,100
I thought it was the occultist segue that hit you, Chit-Zone.

1106
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:13,100
Well, some of us are made of real DNA and others are made of...

1107
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,280
Constructed materials, if you know what I mean, Reverend Diamond Stank.

1108
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:17,680
I know, I know.

1109
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:21,540
We're not all cranked out to be.

1110
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:26,860
We're over here trying to help you with your show and you don't seem to pay much attention to us.

1111
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,820
And what show is this?

1112
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,900
Why, friends, this is Hour of Slack number 1149.

1113
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,660
Where days seem like minutes.

1114
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,000
Number nine?

1115
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:39,120
One of the most official voice boxes of the Church of the Subgenius.

1116
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:40,860
1149?

1117
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,040
Located in the intranet.

1118
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,860
That's at www.subgenius.com.

1119
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,240
Subgenius spelled sub-genius.

1120
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,680
And there is not an O anywhere in there except the .com.

1121
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,980
There's an O in the dot and an O in the com.

1122
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,660
Although you don't write out the dot.

1123
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,600
I suppose you could try that.

1124
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:10,520
Speaking of dots, we pulled out our magnifying glass recently and started searching for animalcules.

1125
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:11,920
Again.

1126
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,240
That's one of our hobbies.

1127
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:23,380
We like to look at hideous, crawling, writhing, abhorrent, formless things that live in everybody's backyard.

1128
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,440
Every square inch of dirt has hideous monsters.

1129
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,700
Right under your toes.

1130
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,460
The air you breathe.

1131
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,520
And under your nose.

1132
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:36,480
In between your eyelashes there are horrible, ugly worms chewing their way through your ducts.

1133
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,020
Your tear ducts.

1134
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,280
They live in there.

1135
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,920
There's these spiral gyro looking things with all kinds of horny things sticking out of them.

1136
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,100
They live in your lungs.

1137
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,060
Can you imagine?

1138
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,480
We scraped the newt cage last night.

1139
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,320
Princess Wee and I did.

1140
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,300
We went up to the...

1141
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,980
We have only one slave pet that we keep.

1142
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,120
A newt.

1143
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,000
They're very low maintenance.

1144
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,560
Fig is its name.

1145
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,940
He's about as big as your little finger.

1146
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,280
Yeah, he's not very big.

1147
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,740
But he's very, very old.

1148
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,260
Princess Wee acquired this newt 28 years ago.

1149
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,000
And for all we know it was a thousand years old then.

1150
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,100
Anyway, we wondered...

1151
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,060
I think it's a spirit creature by now.

1152
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,160
Yeah, well, no.

1153
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,240
He's still really there.

1154
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:18,960
Yes, he is.

1155
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:19,720
He eats on a daily basis.

1156
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,900
There's not much meat on him.

1157
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,700
I know he's well and all that.

1158
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,700
I mean, I think he's one of the old ones from before.

1159
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,140
Well, we wanted to see if maybe he was living with those.

1160
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,520
And what else was in the murky water before we cleaned his tank.

1161
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,100
So we scraped some crud off the side of the tank and put some of that on our slide.

1162
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,240
And took a look at it.

1163
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,200
And guess what, Dave?

1164
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:46,300
There was a horrible transparent nematode worm writhing frantically.

1165
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,780
Because its water was drying up almost as you watched.

1166
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:50,960
And...

1167
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,760
He was all speckly and 3D-y looking.

1168
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,180
You could see right through him.

1169
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,080
Writhing in pain.

1170
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,600
A tiny wee tubular life.

1171
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,780
That you can't see with the nude eye.

1172
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,280
But that little newt was no doubt...

1173
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,840
Kind of covered with them, I suppose.

1174
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,220
I would imagine so.

1175
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,980
We could scrape him, I suppose.

1176
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,220
And take a look.

1177
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,420
Probably subsists on them partially.

1178
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,700
You think?

1179
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,080
You think he eats them nematodes?

1180
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,140
I would imagine so.

1181
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,640
What if there's a secret parasite that's going to get on you now, too?

1182
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,980
And he's going to eat on your head and all the different parts of your body.

1183
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:32,800
That's the wonderful thing about looking through your own $30 kid's microscope.

1184
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,040
Because it's just theoretical in your mind.

1185
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,440
That there are microorganisms everywhere.

1186
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:40,920
Organisms.

1187
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,040
Organisms.

1188
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,540
Creeping through your nostrils.

1189
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,580
And coming in and out with your air.

1190
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,680
You're breathing tiny insect skeletons all the time.

1191
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,060
Did you ever scrape a breech baby for any such hematodes?

1192
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,460
That's next week.

1193
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,120
But we have...

1194
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,380
A project to project kind of thing.

1195
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:02,840
When you actually look at those things, you get a concrete knowledge of the fact that...

1196
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,020
Actually, I think Nenslo figured this out.

1197
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,180
This is what it all boils down to.

1198
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,940
All life, the universe, and everything boils down to this.

1199
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,680
Dirt is mostly poo.

1200
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,440
And poo is mostly corpses.

1201
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,500
So friends, it's the circle of life.

1202
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,100
It's not necessarily that poo is our corpses.

1203
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,340
You see, it's mostly poo and corpses.

1204
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,320
This is the detritus of the human condition.

1205
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:32,860
No, poo is corpses.

1206
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,060
It comes out of you while you're living.

1207
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,180
And dirt is mostly poo.

1208
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,400
And it is left behind.

1209
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,700
So the whole world, really, if you think about it...

1210
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,520
Is defecation.

1211
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,080
There's more of that than there is...

1212
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:47,440
There's more crap than there is living, breathing non-crap.

1213
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,060
This is like the poopiest conversation I've heard.

1214
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,040
Well, it's natural.

1215
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,160
It's a naturistical thing.

1216
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,140
It's something you don't tend to think about.

1217
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:01,840
But the biomass of those tiny creatures far outweighs the biomass of animals that you can see.

1218
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,440
But it's literally hoo-ha.

1219
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,200
I personally like to crawl around on them.

1220
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:06,380
And they smell funny.

1221
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,200
I mean, just think of these thousands and thousands of generations living on a mound of decay.

1222
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,220
And that it's making itself.

1223
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,540
We're self-perpetuating and self-engendering.

1224
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,480
Think of a sting.

1225
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,820
We'll live forever on our own feces.

1226
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,840
Well, they're living in my hair.

1227
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,680
They're living in my bowels.

1228
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,040
They're living between my toes.

1229
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,060
Things.

1230
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,140
Things, things, things.

1231
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,300
And yours too, friend.

1232
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,020
Listener, I want you, as you go to bed tonight,

1233
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:42,060
I want you to think about all those little monsters that live in between the creases of your body.

1234
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:46,080
If you didn't take a shower in the last 15 or 20 minutes.

1235
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,080
Oh, well, of course.

1236
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,660
And even then you wouldn't get most of them.

1237
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,320
I mean, a lot of them would still, would cling on.

1238
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,600
Like miniature Klingons.

1239
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,140
And on and on and on.

1240
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,500
The little cities in your ear canal.

1241
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:05,000
Those little tiny universes and malls and a room.

1242
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,960
The original theater in the crack of your behind.

1243
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,020
Think of it, man.

1244
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:14,800
You're a city of little tiny, little things.

1245
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,360
You know, I was doing okay until you mentioned the crack of the behind crack.

1246
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,500
That one crack.

1247
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,460
I was fine with everything until you said that.

1248
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,400
Now I'm disgustipated.

1249
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,200
I'm sick.

1250
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,360
Sickened.

1251
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,520
Where would you live if you were such a creature?

1252
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,700
I'd live in 1998.

1253
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:34,980
I'd live in 1998.

1254
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,580
Friends, that's where I'd be forever.

1255
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,960
And that's where we have to go now because the show is now coming to an end.

1256
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,000
We have to make room for show next.

1257
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,700
And so, say goodbye.

1258
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:47,840
Goodbye.

1259
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,060
Oh, dear listeners, parting is such sweet sorrow.

Enjoying our, yes, exactly.

1314
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:07,400
By the way, there were a whole bunch of weddings going on right there during the barbecue that day.

1315
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:12,100
Numerous, a number of the brides were all pregnant, which was quite interesting, in their dresses.

1316
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:19,920
And then, the thing is, right down the street, like, there's a, the house is at the end, sort of, of a street.

1317
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,540
And then it just turns to the left and dead ends at a church.

1318
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,780
Just maybe about 100 yards, not even that, 50 yards away.

1319
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:34,060
And so, all of a sudden, during our fabulous family reunion, a real wedding began to take place at the church.

1320
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:43,220
So, all of the brides ran out about, we're talking about maybe half a dozen pregnant brides, run out of the party and approach the groom.

1321
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,080
The real groom at the real church.

1322
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:51,640
And start throwing themselves on him about how he's their baby's daddy.

1323
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,800
And you've got all the ushers.

1324
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:55,700
Excellent, yeah.

1325
00:58:55,700 --> 00:59:00,880
The whole wedding party there, family, very, sort of a, it's a happy joyous family celebration.

1326
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,300
Children are getting married.

1327
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,200
What a lucky group they were.

1328
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,940
Six pregnant brides.

1329
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:05,480
Yeah.

1330
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,740
All that guy's responsibility.

1331
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,580
Well, yeah, he actually looked like he recognized a few of them, too.

1332
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,020
Yeah.

1333
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,500
He looks scared.

1334
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,860
That's what you get.

1335
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,760
I rise, the ugly baby.

1336
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:18,660
Baby.

1337
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,860
Bringing this forward.

1338
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:20,820
Baby.

1339
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,940
An ugly baby.

1340
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,720
Ugly thing.

1341
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:23,580
No, no.

1342
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,420
Nah, nah, nah.

1343
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,060
And this will be just baby.

1344
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:28,860
Baby.

1345
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,580
Baby.

Baby.

1348
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,580
This baby is ugly thing.

1349
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,500
I rise, the ugly baby.

1350
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:39,780
Across the nation, communities and the parents of Boy Scouts are observing Boy Scout Week,

1351
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,380
agreeing with the boys themselves that adventure, that's scouting.
