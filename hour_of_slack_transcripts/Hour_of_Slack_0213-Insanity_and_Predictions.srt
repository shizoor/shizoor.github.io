1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,400
One, two, three, four.

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,360
One, two.

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,960
Your body is not you.

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,780
There is something genetic.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,100
Yes, it's the curse.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,880
Men, our greatest fear is realized.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,340
We are under attack from superior consciousness.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,980
The subgenius hour of slack.

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,920
Oh, I got a live one here.

10
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,000
Are you nuts?

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,340
That is just exactly what they want you to believe.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,540
Run. Get out of here.

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,940
Save yourself.

14
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,980
It's too late.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,320
Yes, it's the curse.

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,540
It's the curse.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:17,180
There is a genetic interaction that makes that occur.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,920
I don't think that it's environment.

19
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,980
They have done scientific studies with monkeys.

20
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,620
And they have been...

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,940
They have been able to drive monkeys to frenzy with music.

22
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,800
If you think that God won't get you, well, you're wrong.

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,760
God won't get you.

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,040
No, not really.

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:55,580
And still ahead, Mayor Koch's proposed relocation of the homeless, homeless, homeless to abandoned gay bathhouses.

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,500
Monkey.

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,580
Monkey.

28
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,280
Monkey.

29
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,560
Oh, yes, dear friends.

30
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,100
Oh.

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,980
Well, we have to go.

32
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:19,680
I have to dedicate this hour of slack show, this hour of slack radio ministry, dear friends, to my guru, Terry Hoffman.

33
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,980
The Dallas Jam...

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Jane Jones.

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,440
Jones, who showed me the Purple Realm.

36
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,920
And because of that, friends, this is going to be sort of a general insanity show.

37
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,100
As Terry showed me, death is just like life, only less of it.

38
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,200
And since I know that my case of the sniffles is probably going to kill me anyway,

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,880
I've gone ahead and willed my possessions and my radio show to Terry.

40
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,440
Terry. Oh, Terry.

41
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,020
I am Zeus, and she is Hera.

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,660
The Dark Overlords have singled me out for spiritual torture,

43
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,180
but yet she, my guru, will save me.

44
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,100
For I get messages from her, Marcus,

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,780
and Malathion, the pesticide,

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,800
who taught me how to harvest my energies,

47
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,200
and who sold me crystals.

48
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,880
And she hates Bob, and so I know she's right.

49
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,920
Frankly, my dear, was there much romance between the nurses and the doctors?

50
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,840
Quite a bit.

51
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,080
Nurses have always been...

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,060
a very good quote-unquote lay.

53
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,940
Oh, yes.

54
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,840
Are people getting stupider, or what?

55
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,900
We all know the answer to that.

56
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:08,180
I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby, I'm your baby.

57
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:15,920
We're number one! We're number one! We're number one! We're number one!

58
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,240
We're number one! We're number one! We're number one!

59
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,580
Good morning, Bob! Good morning, Bob!

60
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,220
I'm Mr. Moe!

61
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,900
Moscow, it's hand!

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm here to ask the musical question!

63
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,020
Slackathon!

64
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,100
Slackathon!

65
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,420
Slackathon!

66
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,080
Slackathon!

67
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,100


68
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,900
Slackathon!

69
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,880
Dear friends, and...

70
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,880
Well, it's so good, so nice to be back.

71
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:16,740
This song, Slackathon, is by Dad's New Slacks, who actually have the other subgenius show in Portland, Maine.

72
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,280
And, in New York, New Jersey...

73
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:32,600
As you start your Amway business, it's important to realize that in addition to your sponsoring activities, the other key to your success will be consistent customer service.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,480
Yep.

75
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,040
We'll be back in 20 minutes.

76
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,720
Yeah, what?

77
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,700
We can take a break now.

78
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,020
Okay.

79
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,120
They're gone.

80
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,700
I got all the checks here.

81
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,620
Is the commercial running?

82
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,660
Smith downstairs.

83
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,060
Yeah.

84
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,340
Okay, I got all the checks.

85
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay.

86
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,740
The plane's waiting for us at the airport.

87
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,860
I got some of his tools too.

88
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,820
Good for you.

89
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,780
He took the check.

90
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,420
Yeah, that's right.

91
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,400
Okay, you got all the equipment in the truck?

92
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,100
Yeah, we're heading off to Dallas.

93
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,680
We're getting late.

94
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,380
Yeah, unless it's pretty good.

95
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,420
I want to melt him down.

96
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,060
Yeah, and we even took...

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,580
We even took Little Xandy's award.

98
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,160
Oh, makes me pee.

99
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,540
Makes me pee, but let's wait with the pee until we're on that plane.

100
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,340
I didn't get anything except a glass of warm Pepsi.

101
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,440
That's because of this case.

102
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:19,700
I didn't get anything except a glass of warm Pepsi.

103
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:19,700


104
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:19,700


105
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:19,700


106
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:19,720
I don't have anything except a glass of warm Pepsi.

107
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,240
You think it was really worth it, taking all that money,

108
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,980
taking all the foundation's money,

109
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,080
and trying to run away to the perfect planet?

110
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,460
Well, we better not get caught.

111
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,360
I hear those exes use real people to write their checks on.

112
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,580
It's true.

113
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,720
Look, there's one over there.

114
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,540
This is the crummiest spaceship I've ever been on.

115
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,640
It's all used.

116
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,580
Look at that water leaking right out onto your seat.

117
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,060
How much do these tickets cost, anyway?

118
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,820
How about $50,000?

119
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,120
I'll tell you, that planet better be more perfect than this ride.

120
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Yeah, we listened to the stewardess.

121
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,020
Yeah, we wrote the plan.

122
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,580
He doesn't even speak English.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,020
Good evening again, ladies and gentlemen.

124
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,280
This is your host for the next three hours of hard-asset rock music,

125
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,020
Dave Rabbit,

126
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,260
and my studio engineer, Pete Sadler.

127
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,700
For those of you who don't know me,

128
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,220
and for those of you who have just recently come into the Republic of Vietnam,

129
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,900
I'd like to give you a little information about it.

130
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,580
We're an underground radio station here,

131
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,380
and we say what we feel like saying,

132
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,660
and we bring the truth to the first-termers in the Republic of Vietnam.

133
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Just say no to reality, kid.

134
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,720
You know, I'm a little kooky, as you may have heard,

135
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,180
and this is Mecca.

136
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,500
I sought solace in the printed page, quite frankly,

137
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,980
for I'm very interested in the world of literature,

138
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,560
but the trouble is that all this knowledge I've got hold of is useless.

139
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,480
See a CBS special on marijuana.

140
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Get the habit.

141
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,400
Stay tuned to this channel.

142
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,580
Bob!

143
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,040
I feel as Bob!

144
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,460
And I feel respect!

145
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,260
Just say no to reality.

146
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,820
Am I the coolest or what?

147
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,020
Stop the music!

148
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,060
I'm back!

149
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,980
And look, Stoney's back with a surprise.

150
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,760
Ooh, what is it?

151
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,360
I've been wondering all day what the surprise is.

152
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,460
Haven't you, Clyde?

153
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,120
Uh, yup.

154
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,060
Follow me!

155
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,080
Uh, Stoney, don't you push to open that door?

156
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,340
Oh, yeah.

157
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,960
Are you all right, Stoney?

158
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,520
Normally, you're so cool.

159
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,260
Today, you're acting weird.

160
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,340
Never felt better in my whole life!

161
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,080
And it's all because of today's surprise.

162
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,340
Ta-da!

163
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,480
Is that marijuana?

164
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,020
Oh, yup.

165
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,340
Isn't that a drug?

166
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,480
Oh, yup.

167
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,800
Dotty, did you use that stuff?

168
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,580
Well, we've smoked cigarettes a few times, but never this.

169
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,120
You know, my parents said that if you start using drugs,

170
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,260
it can cause you all sorts of trouble.

171
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,320
Oh, Joey, chill out!

172
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,360
I've smoked a few of these already,

173
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,080
and they haven't bothered me at all!

174
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,020
Oh, yeah!

175
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,320
Oh, yeah!

176
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,700
Oh, yeah!

177
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,160
Oh, yeah!

178
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,080
Oh, yeah!

179
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,860
Oh, yeah!

180
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,600
Oh, yeah!

181
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,240
Oh, yeah!

182
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,500
Oh, yeah!

183
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:11,500


184
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:11,580
Oh, yeah!

185
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:11,960
Oh, yeah!

186
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,420
Oh, yeah!

187
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,140
Oh, yeah!

188
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,220
Oh, yeah!

189
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,580
Oh, yeah!

190
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,560
Oh, yeah!

191
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:16,660
Oh, yeah!

192
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,120
Oh, yeah!

193
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,340
Oh, oh, yeah, oh, oh...

194
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:29,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

195
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,700
Think your children are as innocent as the new puppy next door?

196
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,780
They know something you don't know.

197
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,120
They know that their American forefathers took drugs,

198
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,660
and you probably don't even know where your father is.

199
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,640
Nerdy Classroom Films presents

200
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,140
Ben Franklin, Hero for Huffington.

201
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,620
I wanted the woods and the Indians to sleep with me,

202
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,900
but I was afraid of the cold and made them sleep outside.

203
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,760
So I never felt the touch of a warm, naked Indian,

204
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,460
or in a cold, naked forest.

205
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,320
Ben Franklin, the only president of the United States

206
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,440
who was never president of the United States.

207
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,440
Was he an early drug user?

208
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,900
Let's see.

209
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,040
He wrote of it in Poor Dick's Conspiracy in 1761,

210
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,880
while still inapprenticed.

211
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,260
Apprentice Bookmaker in Colonial Philadelphia.

212
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,180
So I betook me to the Hashfire Inn

213
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,220
for a secret caucus of the hotheads,

214
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,840
rebellious libertines all lusting for life and liberty.

215
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,620
The real George Washington brought the hemp

216
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,420
and all the evening players.

217
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,620
We quickly proceeded to get there on the hurdles,

218
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,220
and young Tom Everson goodly stretched by the hemp,

219
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,140
which smoked us all like Boston's scrot.

220
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,620
What a fetid fervor of freedom.

221
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,140
Let's have a revolution.

222
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,080
They took Larry Sam, the tax collector,

223
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,320
to which Big Ben replied,

224
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,400
Fine, Sam, then we can invite over a bunch of immigrants and make cars.

225
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,340
Yes, 1761, hemp kindled a fire of American history.

226
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,320
Oh, oh.

227
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,160
Nerdy clockwork films.

228
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,880
History.

229
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,300
Oh, oh.

230
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,880
Oh, oh.

231
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,760
Oh, oh.

232
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:40,780
Oh, oh.

233
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:40,880
Oh, oh.

234
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:40,880


235
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:40,880


236
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:40,880


237
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:40,880


238
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:40,880


239
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:40,880


240
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:40,980
Oh, oh.

241
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,020


242
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:41,860
Oh, oh.

243
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:42,600


244
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:42,620


245
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,300
Oh, oh.

246
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:43,940
Oh, oh.

247
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,160
Oh, oh.

248
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,540
Oh, oh.

249
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,120
Oh, oh.

250
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,020
Oh, oh.

251
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,520
Well, today Stoney brought us a big surprise.

252
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,760
Oh, I just love surprises.

253
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,520
You wouldn't have liked this one.

254
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,560
It was drugs.

255
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,620
Oh.

256
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:58,820
Drugs?

257
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,040
Drugs?

258
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,380
Oh, oh.

259
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,720
Did you try them?

260
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,680
Are you kidding?

261
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,540
Would you?

262
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,220
Yeah, no, but I'm not as cool as you.

263
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,380
Well, if that's what it takes to be cool,

264
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,020
and I guess I'm not.

265
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,740
You see, dear, drugs hurt your body.

266
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,240
But even worse, they make it so you can't even think straight.

267
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,400
Yuck!

268
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,160
Now, Stoney, these fell out of your pocket.

269
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,280
Uh, uh, uh, you talking to me?

270
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,980
Ha, ha, those aren't mine.

271
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,320
Give it a break, Stoney.

272
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,680
You know not only are drugs stupid,

273
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,440
not only do drugs hurt your mind and body,

274
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,300
but they're against the law, too.

275
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,980
You better come with me.

276
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,700
We'll pick up your parents on our way to the police station.

277
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,240
My parents?

278
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,580
My parents? The police?

279
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,460
Hey, wait, I forgot those were against the law.

280
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,680
I didn't think I'd get caught.

281
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,140
Come on, Officer Quartz, give me another chance.

282
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,900
I can't do that, Stoney.

283
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,980
You'll have to ask the judge.

284
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,440
Judge?

285
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,580
Oh, oh, man.

286
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,340
Now I wish I would have said no.

287
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:47,080
And now, the Flintstone kids welcome First Lady Nancy Reagan.

288
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,960
The music you've been waiting for is coming right up.

289
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,100
But first, I want you to know that when you say no to drugs, you're not alone.

290
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,160
Like Freddy and Wilma, thousands of children have formed Just Say No Clubs

291
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,220
and have pledged to...

292
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,740
to lead a drug-free life.

293
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,500
The Flintstone Kids

294
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,700
The Flintstone Kids

295
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,240
The Flintstone Kids

296
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
The Flintstone Kids

297
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,440
The Flintstone Kids

298
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,440


299
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,900
There's a lot more like that on the 20th of Nov.

300
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,220
We have as appetizer, Annette Funicello.

301
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,940
You remember her. She's the Mouseketeer that outgrew Mickey.

302
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,640
Here's a sample of how she cuts the cheese.

303
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,200
Oh, I can't do it.

304
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,600
Oh, darn it.

305
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,720
Now, you want to do it the other way?

306
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,740
This way.

307
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,100
Oh, darn it.

308
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,320
Can't you see that he's dead?

309
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,540
Wait a minute, Bob.

310
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,180
Late that Saturday night, before retiring, I took out the snapshot picture of the sailor

311
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,460
and studied it until I could close my eyes and see this man's face as though he was standing in front of me.

312
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,160
Then I laid the photograph aside and prepared to concentrate.

313
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,920
First, I sat in the reclining chair next to my bed and relaxed my physical body until I could forget it entirely.

314
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,700
This done, I withdrew my weight.

315
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:07,240
I took my conscious mind's attention from anything in the room and focused it on the mental image I had in my mind of the sailor.

316
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,160
I spoke to him by name.

317
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,640
I said out loud in the privacy of my room,

318
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,200
Bill Yonker.

319
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
I love you.

320
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
I like to do this. I feel like Ann Landers.

321
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,340
It's kind of, you know, nice and sweet and tender and nice and...

322
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,740
Oh, God.

323
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,100
Go, go, go with a smile.

324
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:38,920
I'm a sailor.

325
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,000


326
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,580
I'm a sailor.

327
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:43,580


328
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,300
Well, it's a result of long practice, young man.

329
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,160
You'll find when you're my age that once you're pole vault on that thing, it kind of wears the tip off.

330
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,040
I heard that.

331
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,740
Look at these nurses. They're laughing at me.

332
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,600
Many of the people... People always laughed at me as a prophet.

333
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,020
However, many of the people that laughed at me yesterday are not laughing as loudly today.

334
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,080
And it doesn't sound like good, clean laughter to me.

335
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,080
Sounds somewhat salacious.

336
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,960
Now we hear the ultimate orgiastic organ music of Flat Waller on Jupiter and his rubber band.

337
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,180
Yes, it seems she can't get enough of the outhouse or the inhouse.

338
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,800
Or, I guess, Jane or Hyperthrates here on the show.

339
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,960
Jane or's crack house with the lovable puppets like Junkie.

340
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,740
Sammy the submachine gun.

341
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,420
Copper.

342
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,940
Is Jane or's crack house an automated segment of the program that we could just put on automatic pilot?

343
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
Well, it's right there.

344
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,860
Well, we haven't written...

345
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,280
It's on automatic pilot. The rocket away is right there.

346
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,540
Oh, all right. I'll just go on.

347
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,100
And we'll just kind of back and forth it for the moment.

348
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,280
Well, I haven't written it yet.

349
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,140
Okay, well, we haven't written what I'm saying right now yet.

350
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,420
Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

351
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,740
Oh, excuse me. I'm not...

352
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,480
Excuse me. Excuse me.

353
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,760
I just can't...

354
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,920
Excuse me.

355
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,720
Yeah, Doug, I'm thinking about taking a break, too.

356
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,180
Okay.

357
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,920
I mean, I mean, puzzling evidence.

358
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,180
There. Oh, thank you. Thank you.

359
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,140
I didn't mean to call you Doug.

360
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,980
I really do that, huh?

361
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,340
Well, I'm really glad to hear it.

362
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,300
All the audience is all falling around the floor now.

363
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,460
They don't care about the whole image.

364
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,280
On shore, the people seem to be greatly excited.

365
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,600
So was I.

366
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,460
To eat?

367
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,640
No way.

368
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,320
They were dressed scantily as people are everywhere at the beach.

369
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,080
But they jab it in a language I knew I would never understand.

370
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,940
Oh, forget it.

371
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,120
Okay, I've got a test.

372
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,500
I've got a test.

373
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,960
Now, I'd like to hear the answers to this test, okay?

374
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,360
Be ready at the end of the test.

375
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,140
It's kind of a...

376
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,200
It's a couple...

377
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,780
It's best...

378
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,200
Huh?

379
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,320
What?

380
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,520
The answer is golden lake.

381
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,140
No, no, no.

382
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,740
This is a real tricky test.

383
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,200
This isn't one of those trick tests or trick...

384
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,700
This is even trickier than that.

385
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,020
Okay.

386
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,460
Tick, tick.

387
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:55,460


388
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:55,560
Tick, tick.

389
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:55,600
Tick, tick.

390
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,700


391
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,700


392
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,700


393
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,700


394
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,700


395
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,700


396
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,700


397
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,700


398
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:55,700


399
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,920
Test 999.

400
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,640
This is the lies personality profile test.

401
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,580
You're the first ones to hear this.

402
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,460
You are...

403
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:04,960
Okay, test.

404
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,160
You are involved with a religious cult.

405
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,400
You founded the cult as a means of critiquing organized religion with the idea that it would

406
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,460
only exist on paper.

407
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,080
It started out as a joke at first but soon turned serious as thousands of pathetic individuals

408
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,540
began to cling to you and your close friends for support and comfort.

409
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,700
The head of your cult is not even real.

410
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,860
You made him up but nobody around you seems to believe it.

411
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,280
More and more people join your cult every day but you never seem to have any money to

412
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,080
show for all the work you now find yourself burdened with.

413
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Your friends promise riches and wealth for any who join and your recruits demand their

414
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,240
due from you even though they have no idea who any of them are or what they...

415
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,040
Even though you have no idea who any of them are or what they are like.

416
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:53,200
You go to a lawyer to seek copyright and liability protection for your joke cult but are instead

417
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,680
informed that you now have a lawyer.

418
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,500
You have a legal obligation to deliver on all the promises your friends made to the

419
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,620
cult members or face fraud charges.

420
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,580
In addition, you are now responsible for any official church activity taken by members

421
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,100
even if you are unaware of said activities.

422
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,840
The IRS now notices you and, since you are not an officially tax-exempt church, demands

423
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,980
an audit of your cult finances.

424
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,320
You are driving to the post office in a distraught state of mind to pick up even more applications

425
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,200
for membership.

426
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:30,680
You are not paying attention when a middle-aged man in a business suit steps out from between

427
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,260
two parked cars.

428
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:39,400
Just before you hit him, you notice, or seem to think you notice, that this man looks identical

429
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,060
to the fictional figurehead of your cult.

430
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,380
You feel your car run over the man.

431
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,500
What do you do?

432
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,900
Back up over at him!

433
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,440
The way I see it, Bob...

434
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,740
Somebody has to be the Antichrist.

435
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,280
Why not me?

436
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,600
All you do is put your body into an ice chip and serve on a date with your uncle Christ.

437
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,100
That's like Americanity to me.

438
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,280
Drive back over him.

439
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,420
No, what you do is you scoop him up into an ice chip...

440
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,580
You save him and you make pork chops out of his dead meat.

441
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,740
I haven't killed Bob since long before.

442
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,780
I last wanted to.

443
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,820
I'm going to skin him and make him into a rug.

444
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,040
The ultimate hamburger.

445
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,060
A nice suit.

446
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,780
A nice leather suit.

447
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:35,300
Did the subgenius foundation ground Bob up and make him into the ultimate hamburger?

448
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:35,860
Yes, they do.

449
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:03,580
I'm going to make him into the ultimate hamburger.

450
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:14,300
I'm going to make him into the ultimate hamburger.

451
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,420
Later, damnit.

452
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,460
Oh, hey, whoa.

453
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,420
I'm going to make him into the ultimate hamburger.

454
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,220
I'm going to make him into the ultimate hamburger.

455
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,440
Excuse me.

456
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,260
I have a feeling there are times when he sees it that way.

457
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,840
And this is not the jump in hell anyway.

458
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,720
It's just that when I turn off the van, I can hear the sound of a car.

459
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,260
It makes me cough.

460
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,740
Everybody breaks down.

461
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,120
It's almost as if...

462
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,200
We are...

463
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,700
Lost Souls Incorporated.

464
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,140
Lost Souls Incorporated.

465
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,740
Bobby Wobby sat on the wall.

466
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,580
Bobby Wobby had a great fall.

467
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:09,860
A list of geniuses, horses, and men couldn't put Bobby Wobby back together again.

468
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,040
Well, I think we've sort of degenerated.

469
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,600
And, uh, decayed down into the proper, uh, frame of mind.

470
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,500
But for what?

471
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,780
Pills!

472
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,740
Pills! Pills! Pills and froth!

473
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,380
Give him, give him, give him!

474
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,180
Oh, you think you want the pills and froth, do you?

475
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,880
Pills!

476
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,740
He actually said he wants the pills!

477
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,920
The young man wants the pills!

478
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,020
Should we give him the pills?

479
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:49,900
No!

480
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,460
Give him half a pill.

481
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,100
He'll find out what it is.

482
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,280
They want to see the pills.

483
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,980
Don't you?

484
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,540
You want to see the pills, don't you?

485
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,240
This is just like pornography.

486
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,720
I'm sweating for pills.

487
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm just sweating for pills.

488
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,720
It's just like pornography.

489
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,660
It's like you're gonna sit there and beat off while we give this guy the pills.

490
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,820
Go into it!

491
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,580
I'm not gonna do it.

492
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:26,360
You want to plant the pills in a mountain excrement, make him buy the excrement, make him buy the shovel, and make him dig for his pills.

493
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,900
How much have we said?

494
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,140
He's musking for pills.

495
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,860
I'm talking about, have you said anything wrong?

496
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,320
Keep bustin'.

497
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,460
And where, and where is the Batman?

498
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,920
What would you like to know?

499
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,440
We won't tell you now.

500
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,480
Why can't we tell you about this, Franky?

501
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,840
No, Bob, it's not the answer.

502
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,260
But even if we did tell you, how the fuck it up?

503
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,320
This cult is the only one in the program that's called zombies.

504
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,120
It fills the hole it's left behind by Frank's cells.

505
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,160
You destroy it.

506
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,000
You didn't see them anyway.

507
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,020
When you join this exalted order of swimmers, blasphemers, and true believers,

508
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,960
we'll study time control and memory.

509
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:20,360
We'll know the technique until even you will be free to pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

510
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,880
Believe or die.

511
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:32,280
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled findings will usher in a spiritual rebirth and cascade of astounding riches and power to those in the know.

512
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,540
While billions of disturbing conspiracy dooms cry and tell on Earth.

513
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,160
Mr. Reagan thinks there should be more religion in this country.

514
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,660
Well, then we got a religion for him.

515
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:52,100
We can't subject this young man to the pills for less than 50 cents a viewer.

516
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,380
And you're gonna have to wait around for eight and a half hours before the pills come on.

517
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,840
I was struck by the spirit of Bob, and I am purchasing.

518
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,760
Burn it! Burn it! Burn it! Burn it! Burn it! Burn it!

519
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,380
Burn it! Burn it! Burn it!

520
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,720
Oh, when you wanna burn it, that's when we can't!

521
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,540
For Christ's sake!

522
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,520
H5.

523
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:30,860
H7.

524
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,360
Pretty nasty, ain't it?

525
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,680
Well, what you been listening to?

526
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,640
For the last half hour here on the Subgenius Radio Ministry,

527
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,940
Hour of Slack has been a general collage

528
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,900
by St. Byron Werner.

529
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,740
Puzzling evidence.

530
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,400
Dr. Philo Drummond.

531
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,520
The Firesign Theater, little bits of that.

532
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,940
Paul.

533
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,640
Paul, what does that mean?

534
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,860
Paul Mabridis?

535
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,580
Michael Townsend from the

536
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,240
Portland...

537
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,720
Portland, Maine.

538
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,580
Subgenius show.

539
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,780
He did the songs there.

540
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,680
The songs you've been hearing.

541
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,460
The evil, that's right, stony

542
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,960
routine there.

543
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,280
Eeeez.

544
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,640
Ah, what else?

545
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,980
Yeah, the Subgenius Fantasy Fair

546
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,640
revival.

547
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:41,060
Three, four, five, six weeks ago.

548
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,660
And some...

549
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,420
material from the Rat Cave Subgenius Show

550
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,200
in Richmond, Virginia.

551
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,800
Old Rat Cave.

552
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,040
What's coming up will be much of the same,

553
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:59,440
plus the collages from WHRW Radio

554
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,060
and St. Louis' Brain Sandwich Show.

555
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,320
But, ah...

556
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,580
I know you wanna know what's coming in your future,

557
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,300
dear friends.

558
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,740
I know you wanna know the prediction.

559
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,060
I know you wanna know the predictions for the New Year as well.

560
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:16,900
Well...

561
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,300
Aborigines.

562
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,620
What?

563
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,600
Aborigines.

564
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,040
I, Draco, King of the Dragonmen,

565
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,040
Master of the Heavens,

566
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,940
from this moment on,

567
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,080
shall rule over the cave!

568
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,760
Your fate is here.

569
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:39,080
It was at this point that the hypnotist made the decision to take his subject over the hump.

570
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,440
He decided, that is, to find out whether Ruth Simmons,

571
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,640
in deep hypnosis,

572
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,900
might possibly be conscious of events

573
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,240
which had taken place even before her birth.

574
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,100
As a preliminary step just prior to the prenatal regression,

575
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,020
the subject was once more directed to see scenes which had taken place in infancy.

576
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,840
The hypnotist asked her to recall some scene which had taken place at the age of six,

577
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,420
then at the age of five,

578
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,420
and then at four,

579
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,440
three,

580
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,440
two,

581
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,720
and one.

582
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,700
Now, to continue with the tape recording.

583
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,320
I woke up in the hotel lobby,

584
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,840
the smell heavy and calm holding me,

585
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,220
holding a different body molded to the leather chair.

586
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,540
I was sick, but not needle sick.

587
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,300
This was black smoke gin.

588
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,080
The sailor, still sleeping.

589
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,760
He looked very young under a wispy mustache.

590
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:35,000
I woke him up and he looked around with slow, hydraulic control.

591
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,620
His eyes, unbluffed, unreadable.

592
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,580
Let's make the street.

593
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,300
I'm thin.

594
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,020
I'm thin.

595
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,960
And I believe that the day we come to the closing of this dispensation,

596
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,060
we're going to see, get ready,

597
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,360
what I'm talking to you about today is the most up to date thing that I could talk to you about.

598
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,860
We're living in the closing moments of this dispensation.

599
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:04,180
Our favorite area for clairvoyance has always been in the field of science and medicine.

600
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,440
The amazing predictions of such men as Jules Verne and Osterdamers

601
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,100
have left succeeding generations dismayed.

602
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,020
Morris Woodruff has been consulted by many of the most outstanding popular figures of today.

603
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,940
Many whose names we are not at liberty to reveal.

604
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,460
A few, such as Leslie Howard, who have failed to take heed, have suffered.

605
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,580
It is a simple matter of the printed record.

606
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,440
And now, here are my predictions.

607
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,660
Listen.

608
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,300
Listen carefully.

609
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,980
Join me in knowing the headlines of tomorrow, today.

610
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,680
Listen now to the headlines you will be reading in the coming, pre-published,

611
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,360
prediction period.

612
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,380
School built on sweet potato pie.

613
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,460
Gee, that's a headline.

614
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,180
We don't report the news, we write it.

615
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,160
And next thing I know, they have trapped a gray flannel suit on me,

616
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,040
and I am sent to this school in Washington to learn how this writing the news before it happens is done.

617
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,940
I saw that as the Mayan caper with an IBM machine,

618
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,660
I don't want to be caught short in a gray flannel suit when the lid blows off.

619
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,400
So the district supervisor calls me in and puts the old white schmaltz down on me.

620
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,160
Now kid, what are you doing over there with the niggers and the apes?

621
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,960
Why don't you straighten out and act like a white man?

622
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,660
After all, they're only human cattle.

623
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,840
You know that yourself.

624
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,080
Hate to see a bright young man fuck up and get off on the wrong track.

625
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,600
Sure, it happens to all of us one time or another.

626
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:39,640


627
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:45,420
Why, the man who went on to invent shitola was sitting right where you're sitting now

628
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,660
25 years ago when I was saying the same things to him.

629
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,420
Well, he straightened out the way you're gonna straighten out.

630
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,620
You can't deny your blood, kid.

631
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,600
You're white, white, white.

632
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,260
My boy Bob

633
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,800
My boy Bob

634
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,000
My boy, my boy, my boy Bob

635
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,500
hahahaha

636
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,980
hahahaha

637
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,600
hahahaha

638
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:20,660
hahahaha

639
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:22,920
hahahaha

640
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,440
This ought to bring in the crowds alright.

641
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,800
ahh!

642
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,660
ah

643
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,220
oh

644
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,320
oh

645
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,240
my friend you're the best.

646
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,920
You have given the devil a complete victory.

647
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,680
I want to die.

648
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,960
It's not a good omen when Goldfish commits suicide.

649
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,300
Your life is over.

650
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,540
So is mine.

651
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,100
Well, once they get past that spiral drive...

652
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:11,940
It's so dizzy.

653
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,900
Yeah, they don't know.

654
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,120
And then there was another car backing out.

655
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,580
So the car waiting to get in that space was blocking the ramp, so I couldn't get up.

656
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,460
I had to get out and yell at some Chinese guy for a while.

657
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,920
Yeah, I called him a gook, okay?

658
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,520
Merry Christmas.

659
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,060
Woo, woo.

660
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,620
Woo, woo.

661
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,400
Ah, ah, ah.

662
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,400
He's really freaking out.

663
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,020
Yuck.

664
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,640
Yuck.

665
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,560
Yuck.

666
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,680
Yuck.

667
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,980
Yuck.

668
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,060


669
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,580
Yuck.

670
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,580
Yuck.

671
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,960
What is running those machines? Jump in, Jigger! It's the Dragon Man!

672
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,500
It must be 20 feet long by 10 feet high.

673
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,480
You shall die!

674
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,520
Wow, that was close. He's a walking flamethrower.

675
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,240
Uh-oh, here come a few of Draco's pretty boys.

676
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,220
He'll get you, pretty boy.

677
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:42,660
You know what's coming up for you in 1990, dear friends?

678
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,580
I'm afraid it ain't a pretty, pretty sight.

679
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,320
Not what you're used to.

680
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,920
According to the word of Dobbs in the Book of the Subgenius,

681
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,940
Chapter 12, Dateline for Dominance,

682
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,000
1990, civilized people losing faith in modern medicine.

683
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,060
Traveling medicine shows hawking wonders.

684
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,320
Drugs, miracle cures.

685
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,720
Psychic healing, frequently seen around shopping malls.

686
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,140
Synthetic food wars.

687
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,860
Horse, cat, dog, and rat meat sold openly all over U.S.

688
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,840
Cannibalism practiced in rural areas.

689
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,000
Roach excrement processed and packaged as diet supplement.

690
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,700
Brazil invades United States, driven back by civilian armies.

691
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,020
After government...

692
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,680
Military forces fail.

693
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,740
Where do we run?

694
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,340
Where do we run?

695
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,740
Atlantis rises from the middle of Kansas.

696
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,720
Ancient Dobbs heads found carved into the ruins.

697
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,520
Apparent prediction of Bob over 8,000 years ago.

698
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,320
Gangland-styled wars between Christian sects.

699
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,660
All following different false jesi.

700
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,660
The Greatest of the Greatest.

701
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,800
The Greatest of the Greatest.

702
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,100
The Greatest of the Greatest.

703
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,720
Common cold, cured by magic spells.

704
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,660
Foundation scientists...

705
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:16,860
Subgenius Foundation scientists, after cracking DNA's code within the code, develop...

706
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,860
...instant mutation process.

707
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,960
A slightly risky method of producing homemade overmen, which will attract many teenagers

708
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,220
into the church of the subgenius.

709
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,160
Crashed UFOs.

710
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,160


711
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,160


712
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,160


713
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,200
Crashed UFOs.

714
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:41,020
Recovered from Bermuda Triangle by anonymous Fort Worth millionaire provides undeniable proof of space conspiracy.

715
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,520
By this time, over 60% of adult Americans have been abducted by UFOs.

716
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:03,800
Anti-family movement, although starting to lose ground to subgenius, is still powerful enough to make bestiality a P.E. option in many public school systems.

717
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,180
Anti-family movement, although starting to lose ground to subgenius, is still powerful enough to make bestiality a P.E. option in many public school systems.

718
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:11,880
Attempts to make adultery mandatory- fails as Bill is blocked by Bob, directed Senate subcommittee.

719
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:30,240
Add last Philly's

720
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,580
gains admiration of the world through military triumphs.

721
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:42,680
Oddly, Bob himself throws his support behind the anti-Bob.

722
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,420
Other predictions friends, earthquakes in every corner of the globe, a Vatican move

723
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:57,240
to Mexico City, Bob will control all major TV networks plus ITT, Summa Corporation, Texas

724
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:04,500
Instruments, General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, Ekankar, Ford, McGraw Hill, Simon & Schuster,

725
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,580
General Motors, and Texaco.

726
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,500
Polygamy legalized in the US due to Dobbs influence.

727
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,440
Think it sounds good?

728
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,340
Boy, if you've got another thing coming.

729
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:37,080
Don't trust anybody, don't trust me, don't trust children with scabs on their knees,

730
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,020
don't trust people living in jail, don't trust a woman with a big fat tail.

731
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,660
I shouldn't have to tell you that people will rant, like that old saying about a bird

732
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,400
and a cow.

733
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:56,580
Don't trust beggars, don't trust thieves, don't trust people with green on their teeth,

734
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:02,920
don't trust men in a barber shop, don't trust the fat man with the flag at the top.

735
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,780
When you're not there and not behind your back, I like to stick them in the brain with

736
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,620
a carpet tie.

737
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:17,160
Don't trust teachers, don't trust you, don't trust babies that say, pick a boo, don't

738
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,540
trust the folks known as Ma and Pa, don't trust a girl wearing her sister's bra.

739
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,400
Stay at home and don't talk on the phone.

740
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,560
Don't look at me.

741
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:26,560


742
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,080
I'm not the one to rant, big or no.

743
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,280
Dear friends, that was Bad Boy Billy Batson.

744
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah, you know occasionally we like to play you some spaz singing.

745
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,880
I mean singing by spaz sticks.

746
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,900
And Bad Boy Billy Batson definitely qualifies for that.

747
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,740
In fact I've got another song by him called Donna Epps.

748
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,960
To me, spaz singing, you know it's a small genre but it's the true folk music really.

749
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,540
Sorta like Nirvana Dave, the guy that was ranting at our most recent revival, heard

750
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,860
in the background sometimes tonight.

751
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,440
And me, for that matter.

752
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,960
You know, there's old Gray in her dove winged hat.

753
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,220
There's old Green in her sewing machine.

754
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,260
Where's the Bob in it?

755
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,660
Well here's Bad Boy Billy Batson.

756
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:32,080
He loves Donna Epps and I think this is a sincere song.

757
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,280
And this is my new musical hero for him.

758
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,080
She smokes a lot, starts with cigarettes and throws a pack on the ground.

759
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,140
I slip it in my pocket when no one else is around.

760
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,600
She walks away like a goddess out of a dream.

761
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,240
I'm covered up in a black dress.

762
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,240


763
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,240


764
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,020
I'm stuck by a wall of a plastic screen.

765
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:01,600
To never have a seen another like beside all this old tree girl.

766
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,920
She's got to be the night wonder of the entire world.

767
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,160
I don't need nobody else.

768
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,780
Cause I love a girl named Donna Epps.

769
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,680
I start to melt when I look in her eyes.

770
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,220
If I can't have the rock of me life.

771
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,240


772
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,240


773
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,940
Suicide

774
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,300
I don't need nobody

775
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,060
Helps cause I love a girl

776
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,160
Named Donna Helps

777
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,540
Nobody

778
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,960
Helps

779
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,140
Just Donna Helps

780
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,220
Are you still listening friends?

781
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,160
She comes to hell and drops her strands on the ground

782
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,560
I slip it in my pocket when no one else is around

783
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,940
Exposing my two colors not knowing how she'll react

784
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,780
It might give off negative vibes and I couldn't handle that

785
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,840
My heart's like a volcano that's about to burst

786
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,500
She could give some beauty tips to Miss Universe

787
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,080
I don't need nobody else

788
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,420
Cause I love a girl named Donna Helps

789
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,680
I start to melt when I look in her eyes

790
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,400
If I can't ever rock them it's suicide

791
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,960
I don't need nobody else

792
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,380
Cause I love a girl named Donna Helps

793
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,760
Nobody

794
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,040
Helps

795
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,700
Just Donna Helps

796
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,380
Nobody

797
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,460
She puts a piece of gum in her mouth And throws a wrapper on the ground

798
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,800
I slip it in my pocket when no one else is around

799
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,580
Watching her as she walks away drifting far from me

800
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,840
Wanting to take her in my arms and love her passionately

801
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,120
Words will never express my love so true

802
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,220
She could send a perfect message to me

803
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,940
I'm taking back to beauty school

804
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,800
I don't need nobody else

805
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,820
Cause I love a girl named Donna Helps

806
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,300
I start to melt when I look in her eyes

807
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,140
If I can't ever rock them it's suicide

808
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,620
I don't need nobody else

809
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,140
Cause I love a girl named Donna Helps

810
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,000
Nobody

811
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,120
Helps

812
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:53,120


813
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:53,120


814
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:53,120


815
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:53,420
I don't need nobody else

816
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,160
Just Donna Helps

817
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,160


818
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,720
Just Donna Helps

819
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,720
Don't you love it dear friends

820
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,880
Bad Boy Billy Batson

821
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,020
A great new subgenius

822
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:14,780
We probably won't be playing that many songs by Bad Boy Billy Batson but man I know that you're glad to have that one in your collection

823
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,280
Uh can I speak to Jesse?

824
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,420
Yeah one second

825
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,100
This is bad boy Billy on the phone, in fact.

826
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,720
Not Tim with a T, Jim with a J.

827
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,420
Huh?

828
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:52,920
Bowie?

829
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,040
You don't know me?

830
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,600
You don't?

831
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,100
What you up to?

832
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,820
You working?

833
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:01,600
Really?

834
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,460
I just thought I'd call you.

835
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,240
Working hard?

836
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,260
You don't know me?

837
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,660
How come?

838
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,060
You still love me?

839
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:17,980
Love?

840
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,080
You still my baby?

841
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,000
You don't know me?

842
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,080
I just talked to you, you know?

843
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,920
This is how a real subgenius makes a date, friends.

844
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,060
I want you to listen close, you know, make notes of that.

845
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,320
This is a special privilege for me to share with you via this tape.

846
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,060
Yeah, me too.

847
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,000
As I travel around the country and participate in the biblical counseling movement,

848
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,680
I find that people have a lot of questions that they ask about biblical counseling.

849
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,880
And one of the things that we want to do in this particular tape is to...

850
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,140
One evening I was walking along Hollywood Boulevard.

851
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,440
Nothing much to do.

852
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,040
I stopped and looked in the window.

853
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,300
I saw a stationary shop.

854
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,400
I went into a Five and Dime to get a root beer.

855
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,940
To make me feel better, he offered a free root beer.

856
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:27,900
I said,

857
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,380
No, thank you.

858
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,280
And cried out,

859
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,460
Praise God.

860
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,360
The devil is on earth.

861
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:40,000
And doing his work beautifully.

862
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,540
Oh my.

863
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,460
We've been listening in for so long.

864
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:05,800
We've got six major utiliseFT花out.

865
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:17,400
My periodic

866
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,800
We are attempting to reattach...

867
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,800
Anyway, like we were saying, we've never been cruel to colleagues.

868
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,420
Come on, yeah.

869
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,040
Everybody calm down now.

870
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,600
Take a stress pill and relax.

871
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,920
I think you should take a stress pill, Dave.

872
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,600
We could get in a lot of trouble for this. Be quiet.

873
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,820
Live! Live!

874
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,520
It's rather like opening a tin of sardines.

875
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:55,280
But you know, there's always a little piece in the corner you can't get out.

876
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,060
Open, sir.

877
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,600
Everyone, this is getting out of control.

878
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,620
This is a little bit too disorganized, too noisy.

879
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,300
Wonderful!

880
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:09,860
The lady came in and asked us to be quiet so they could hear the filk singers in the other room.

881
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,060
I'm feeling the luck plane crash!

882
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:16,760
No survivors!

883
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,060
Let's have an anti-filk song.

884
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,180
Bob's gonna kill the elves.

885
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,080
Bob's gonna kill the hobbits too.

886
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,020
The unicorns.

887
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,120
The Mr. Spocks.

888
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,400
He'll kill everything.

889
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,820
The mother filkers.

890
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,820
Also pet rocks.

891
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,520
He'll kill the unicorns.

892
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,620
He'll kill the care bears.

893
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,020
He'll kill all who rival his sales.

894
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,700
He'll kill Captain Picard.

895
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,660
Captain Kirk too.

896
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,260
He'll kill Sulu.

897
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,080
He'll kill Uhura too.

898
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,600
He'll kill the Enterprise.

899
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,060
He'll kill D&D.

900
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,020
He'll drag Gygax by a hank of his hair.

901
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,260
He'll kill the Batman.

902
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,520
He'll kill the Batman.

903
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:23,820
We should make fun of those nice people who come to these conventions and pay money to enjoy the nice fantasy that takes them away from their world of no girlfriends or boyfriends.

904
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,560
Of total loneliness.

905
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,240
Of thinking they're ugly.

906
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,580
Of not having a girlfriend.

907
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,400
Of not having enough money.

908
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,520
Of being overweight or too skinny or having bad skin.

909
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,000
Or not having a good job.

910
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,420
Or having to worry about the murder of the president of Lebanon.

911
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:47,800
Or the horrible deaths of the subgenius priests in El Salvador.

912
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:48,520
China.

913
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,580
The Chinese.

914
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,340
The starving minions.

915
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,680
It's a bummer, man.

916
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,700
It's a bummer.

917
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:55,200
It's a bummer.

918
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:55,940
It's a bummer.

919
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:56,060
It's a bummer.

920
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:56,780
It's a bummer.

921
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,000
It's a bummer.

922
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,560
It's a bummer.

923
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,300
It's a bummer.

924
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,580
It's a bummer.

925
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,700
And it's a bummer.

926
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,740
It is a bummer.

927
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:07,760
It is a bummer.

928
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:08,180
And it's a bummer.

929
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:08,680
It's a bummer.

930
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:08,860


931
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:08,860


932
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,360
We listened.

933
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:10,560
That's enough.

934
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:10,560


935
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:10,560


936
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:10,560


937
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:10,960
It's all bullshit.

938
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:10,960


939
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,060
Look at how long you guys sifted around.

940
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,520
Man, when I was able to socialize, I was always out on the streets,ミ chaudductge

941
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,400
that I res karmao up agar igor.

942
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:14,900
Look out!

943
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:15,920
Look out!

944
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,120
Look at how I looked at that?

945
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,680
Look at how I looked at papa tonesio!

946
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,780
Look at my bra metal.

947
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:27,820
Look at that mini nose now showing how faqз he is.

948
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:37,140
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I wanna bust that body, oh yeah, oh yeah, I wanna bust that body right.

949
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:45,140
Which means that these tape recordings I'm making are for the sake of future history, if any.

950
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:51,440
Dr. Christian Barnard, prominent heart surgeon, is here to address a medical convention about his now famous rear transplant.

951
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,660
My boy, my boy, my boy Bob, my boy Bob.

952
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,420
At first they didn't take you seriously, good.

953
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,640
Then they began to be frightened, good.

954
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,640
They kept their opinions to themselves, good.

955
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,820
They stopped joining clubs, good.

956
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,420
They informed on their friends, good.

957
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,780
But you went on and on and on.

958
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:17,000
Now they're beginning to ask themselves, maybe I'm next.

959
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,580
Where will it lead to?

960
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,380
Nowhere.

961
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,380
Hi, doctor.

962
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:21,840
Doctor!

963
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,660
No, doctor, I beg you.

964
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,220
Does this hurt?

965
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,180
Does this hurt?

966
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:25,540
No!

967
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,880
Doctor, doctor, please.

968
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,280
No, wait, can you wait just a moment?

969
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:30,860
Here, just relax.

970
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,600
No, don't.

971
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,280
Doctor, would you wait just a moment?

972
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:33,640
Just relax.

973
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,620
I have something to tell you.

974
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,840
I don't think we should go on today.

975
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,800
I think you're too upset.

976
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,220
Doctor, doctor, please.

977
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,660
Doctor, doctor, I didn't mean it that way.

978
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,720
Doctor, listen to me.

979
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,360
You, my friend, are nothing but a freak.

980
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:51,820
Oh, Dad!

981
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:53,840
Dad!

982
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,540
Mr. Parker.

983
00:51:59,720 --> 00:51:59,820
Huh?

984
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,320
Suddenly, Professor, you interest me.

985
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,180
I just can't stop throwing up.

986
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,200
I can't stop throwing up.

987
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:10,580
Oh, Bill!

988
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,220
Leave him.

989
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,480
Quick, buddy.

990
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,080
So when are we going to smoke that dollar bill?

991
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,760
It depends on how much you want.

992
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,640
Yeah, that's a shame.

993
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,640
I mean, it didn't come out before he died.

994
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,040
God.

995
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,980
Oh, we were talking about the other member of our band.

996
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,560
Oh, yeah, the drummer that...

997
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,500
No, no, no, no, no.

998
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,640
The one that fired...

999
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,580
Well, there's two other members.

1000
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,600
But don't say, think back, you might not be listening.

1001
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,060
He blew up on stage.

1002
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:33,960
I mean, he exploded.

1003
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,780
How did he do that exactly?

1004
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:36,520
Head-launching.

1005
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:43,100
Yeah, it was like a head-launching, but with nine irons and stiff woods, you know, like

1006
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:43,860
it should have been done.

1007
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,040
Okay, I...

1008
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,340
He likes to play Russian roulette with a .45 on break.

1009
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,320
But, you know, it's a bummer.

1010
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,120
It really is a bummer.

1011
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,920
I'm not here to make a profit.

1012
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:56,640
I'm here to beat you.

1013
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,020
I'm here to beat you, prophet.

1014
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,800
I want to turn everybody on.

1015
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,100
I quit.

1016
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:02,760
You do.

1017
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,700
Oh, friends, what you've been waiting for.

1018
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,280
The Swingin' Love Corps is doing Paranoid by Black Sabbath.

1019
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:51,740
Can you feel the damage, Frank?

1020
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,460
Bring it to Jersey.

1021
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,240
Oh, yeah.

1022
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,620
I have a plan for the has-been

1023
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:56,620


1024
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:56,620


1025
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:56,620


1026
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:56,620


1027
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:56,620


1028
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:56,620


1029
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:56,620


1030
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:56,620


1031
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:56,620


1032
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:56,620


1033
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:08,360
Yes friends, and you can write for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1034
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:13,040
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find.

1035
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:18,940
I can see the things that make you happy, so I can be like you.

1036
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:29,480
And you can find those things at the post office box number that I'm about to give.

1037
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:35,880
I'm giving you all some time to get your little piece of paper, your napkin, and your pencil ready.

1038
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:40,480
Before I give you that number to which you can write and say,

1039
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,960
Bob, send me free information, just free stuff, that's all I need.

1040
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,260
Because I'm seeking.

1041
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,860
I am here with love and I will try.

1042
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:57,240
Happiness I cannot feel and look at me is so unreal.

1043
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,900
I know as you hear these words telling you now,

1044
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:16,960
I tell you to enjoy life.

1045
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,200
I wish I could.

1046
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:18,920
But it's too late.

1047
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,680
It's too late.

1048
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,680
Oh, thanks, Dr. Drummond.

1049
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,060
Can you believe that's Dr. Milo Drummond?

1050
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:37,560
Dear friends, you can write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1051
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:46,120
Once again, just slide that letter out of your front pocket into the mailbox.

1052
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,560
Address to Bob.

1053
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:47,800
Bob.

1054
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:56,400
140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1055
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,560
Hello out there in radio land.

1056
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,660
Trail here with a few words to the wise.

1057
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,060
And especially the stupids who need it.

1058
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,880
Election day is approaching.

1059
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,280
Your opportunity to guide this great nation's future.

1060
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,560
No doubt you've all heard the hype to do your civic duty and go vote.

1061
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,360
But that's a bunch of baloney.

1062
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,440
It takes far more than just showing up to flip a lever.

1063
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:25,260
In fact, my papa always said, never vote for a man unless you know his middle name.

1064
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,220
Well, he said other things too.

1065
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,160
But the point is, you need to study both candidates and learn both sides of the issues.

1066
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,280
From sources other than the boob tube.

1067
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,840
Now if that's too much trouble, do your country a favor and don't vote.

1068
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,500
After all, America needs intelligent leadership, not mass mediocrity.

1069
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,980
So do your homework for your homeland.

1070
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,980
And be prepared for election 88.

1071
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,420
Learn before you turn that level.

1072
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,480
And keep America safe from dumb-mocracy.

1073
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:56,740
The American Dream

1074
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,240
Jim, you said nobody's perfect.

1075
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,200
I said I wasn't perfect.

1076
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,500
Where was I?

1077
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:08,920
My apologies.

1078
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,840
25th of December, Mr. President.

1079
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,480
I agree. I agree.

1080
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,140
This is Data Bull by Michael Townsend.

1081
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:29,300
Well, he can have another ten seconds if he wants to.

1082
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,200
I'd hope this had been a little friendlier in the evening.

1083
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:41,040
I'd wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him, but I think now we're, uh, we got the lines too carefully drawn here.

1084
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:47,100
Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal. I think we can agree on that.

1085
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,440
I think we can agree on that.

1086
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,060
I think we can agree on that.

1087
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:56,960
But did I, uh, did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Benson ought to be your running mate?

1088
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,480
You said that three people on your ticket?

1089
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,660
No, I think the debate ought to be between you and I.

1090
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:08,260
Gentlemen, I was given some bad word a moment ago. There is time for one more question.

1091
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,180
I'll miss fail.

1092
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:10,500
Woo!

1093
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,200
You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?

1094
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:14,880
No.

1095
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:22,440
I always ask that of all my prey. I just like the sound of it.

1096
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:38,160
That was Debatable by Michael Townsend from the, uh, Portland, Maine area.

1097
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:39,680
Yeah.

1098
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,200
One, two.

1099
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,100
I would be a happy little soul.

1100
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,280
I would be a happy little soul.

1101
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:59,400
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.

1102
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,480
Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean.

1103
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,420
Oh, boy.

1104
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,320
No, no, Mrs. Tucker, everything will be okay.

1105
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,280
Oh, but you don't understand. I've just got to have this job.

1106
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,240
Well, I'll go over your application again and let you know.

1107
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:11,440
Oh.

1108
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:17,500
Most Americans think that the typical person on welfare is a lazy, promiscuous woman

1109
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:24,320
who has gone out and acquired, uh, seven, eight, nine children in order to, uh, avoid working.

1110
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,440
That she is living it up, that she has stakes in the freezer, that she might even have a very nice automobile,

1111
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,540
perhaps even a Cadillac parked out behind the housing project.

1112
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:38,280
There are those, and they will go unnamed here, who sit back and see our success,

1113
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:44,100
and they try to peddle the tired, old cliché that helping the economy means helping the rich.

1114
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,060
Basically, I want to see Reagan get sent to the men's shelter in the Bowery,

1115
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,800
so they know what it's like to be poor.
