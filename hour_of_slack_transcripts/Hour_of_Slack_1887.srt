00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
From NPR News in Washington, I'm under direction of an independent administrator.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,600
The Justice Department says it has pee.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,700
Senior Obama administration officials want to keep the pee.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,500
Tom Pirelli says the department finished pee remains this weekend.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,900
The Justice Department continues to investigate whether pee broke the disaster.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,200
Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen has resumed drilling a pee well that's slated to intercept the end of this week.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,620
Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen says...

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,320
President Obama says people can rest along the Gulf Coast.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,400
We're excited that fish can go back to work. In fact, we had some yesterday.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,020
President speaking as he welcomed taking a break.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,420
But House Republican Leader John Boehner says...

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,640
Demanding and asking the question, where are the American people?

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,460
Boehner told NBC the way to stimulate the economy is by cutting hiring this morning.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,420
Oscar-winning actress Patricia Neal is aimed at preventing...

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,020
tens of thousands of public school teachers and state and local government workers from NPR News in Washington.

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,300
Is this thing on? It is, huh?

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,920
It is on, and so are you.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,060
You can scoot it over closer to your face if you want.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,520
Oh, how many times have I fallen for that one?

20
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,600
How many times have you fallen for that one?

21
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,240
Too many. I'm starting to wear a pillow on my ass.

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,120
Helps on the landings.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,660
Well, we have a great deal of material to go over today.

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,980
Some of the old tried and truisms need to be tried out once more.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,620
Hashed out and beaten against the rocks and left out to dry.

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,160
Are you leaving too, Susie?

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,300
No, no, I'm not fleeing. I'm redistributing my wealth.

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,180
All right, well, let's have an even distribution of that.

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,560
I brought enough for the whole class.

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,460
Bounteous booty and begin our introductory religious lesson of instruction.

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,460
Welcome to the third 13X Day live hour of slack.

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,620
Which will sound really different the next time you hear it.

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,280
Well, yes, it will be specially augmented, but what about the background?

34
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,780
Do we have that today? Background?

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,820
Oh, background music?

36
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,680
Yeah, the background music track. There it is.

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,160
All right, now you see it.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,700
It's a wonderful party.

39
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,540
It's wacky.

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
Yeah, we're all having a great time.

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,300
It's the unending cocktail hour here at X Day 2010,

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,620
the 13th X Day of beautiful summer weather here at the Brushwood Campground

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,940
where things are getting out of control.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
Whoa, it's wacky, wild, goofy, wiggly.

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,340
I've never been in control in Brushwood.

46
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,040
That's what's so wonderful about it.

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,260
Let us not disabuse the unenlightened of their long-cherished, if pathetic, beliefs.

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,300
Mmm.

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:03,120
Of course, control, unillusioned, superimposed over the hideous, indifferent face of the universe.

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,060
But we live by such illusions.

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,240
At least I know I do.

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:08,980
Mmm.

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,760
That's how you pull the wool over your own eyes.

54
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,260
Yes, with the realization that although you can never truly know unless all the factors are considered,

55
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,880
you also can never know all the factors.

56
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,200
So you just have to guess at it.

57
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,540
Mmm.

58
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,720
Make a good guess.

59
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,640
And right then, and I tell you...

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,780
That's them again.

61
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,000
I wish there was someone to help me get out of this.

62
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,360
Yeah.

63
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,680
And I said, choo.

64
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,860
He goes, uh, I'm still eating it.

65
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,680
Uh, huh.

66
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,540
Give us a little bit of, give us, give us some, some, a little bit more about this.

67
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,100
Bob, Bob, Bob.

68
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,820
Bob's Slack.

69
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,280
Um, uh, um, sounds simple.

70
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,760
Bob, you there?

71
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,060
He can, he can barely walk.

72
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,280
In other words, the show has been canceled.

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,540
Yeah, and we have a...

74
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,520
Have you no sympathy for the blind audience?

75
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,380
Well, it's traditional that we have no sympathy for the blind audience.

76
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:25,500
Well, I'm not sure.

77
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:25,940
I don't know if that's true.

78
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,780
They don't expect us to.

79
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,460
That's what I'm doing.

80
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,900
That's why they're listening.

81
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,000
I can barely stand to listen to your show.

82
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,200
You have so little sympathy.

83
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,540
Sorry.

84
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,360
Yeah, I mean...

85
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,780
It takes me, it takes me like three days to edit one of those two hour shows.

86
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,740
I can't listen to it when I'm listening to it.

87
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,320
Just for that one minute that's good.

88
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,280
I have to turn, I have to take the headphones off while I'm doing it.

89
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,920
Your shows are really hard to masturbate to, Stang.

90
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,840
It's really rude.

91
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,300
So you...

92
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,340
Oh, you mean, Stang's show is hard to masturbate to.

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,540
I'm glad you made that clear.

94
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,220
Well, we're hoping to change that with the...

95
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,220
I always choke the chicken to Dr. Hall and Philo, though.

96
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:57,860
Yeah.

97
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,260
They always make me get my nut and pull my toes.

98
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,460
We have had testimonials that people do get off listening to our show.

99
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,440
Well, I told you about masturbating Sean.

100
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,200
Long known.

101
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,840
We got masturbated himself to death listening to our show.

102
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,780
The thing is, I don't intend to...

103
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,860
My show has more masturbators than yours does.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,780
I can't help it.

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,200
I don't know.

106
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,340
I don't know how many...

107
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,720
We have higher quality masturbators, though.

108
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, I'll bring you that.

109
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,000
Yours are still alive.

110
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:20,600
The highest quality.

111
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,120
The most lovely.

112
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,200
We've tested our masturbators.

113
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,200


114
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,200


115
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,020
Our masturbators, through opinion research firms, have found that...

116
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,700
Firms.

117
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
Their knowledge is in-depth.

118
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,260
They know exactly what they like, what they want.

119
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,200
Now, do you know which person they masturbate to the most?

120
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:41,700
I know.

121
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,480
I'm sure each of you guys knows exactly which is the most popular.

122
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,920
Yes?

123
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,940
They only masturbate to me in prison.

124
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,100
Nothing?

125
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,120
It's a moot point.

126
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,840
No point in arguing with such geniuses.

127
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,020
We're just talking in a historical fashion.

128
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,840
I will not eat.

129
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,800
Hallelujah.

130
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,220
Here's the secret.

131
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,460
I no longer live.

132
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,640
Metamorphosis.

133
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,860
All right.

134
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,900
Come on.

135
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,320
So, you know, I...

136
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,400
Messing around with the girls.

137
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,580
Getting our girls pregnant.

138
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,080
Yeah, I'm not.

139
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


140
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


141
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


142
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


143
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


144
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


145
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


146
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


147
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


148
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


149
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


150
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


151
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


152
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


153
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


154
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,080


155
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,540
No more sex.

156
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:23,540


157
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:23,940
I'm not.

158
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:23,940


159
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,200
Uh...

160
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,380
Amen?

161
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,660
Amen.

162
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,940
And thanks, Reverend Heart Ignition.

163
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:40,760
Friends, aside from the Lemur Cuts at the beginning, all of the collages in this 1270th hour of Slack

164
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,660
Art by Heart Ignition.

165
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,440
So glad to have him back in the saddle.

166
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,600
Now, you know, friends, I like to edit these shows down so that nothing lasts longer than

167
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,820
three or four minutes tops, well, except for the live blabber shows where we're in the

168
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,900
studio because we need to whip one out fast and get caught up.

169
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,360
Well, this one is sort of like that.

170
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,980
At 13X Day, we did a couple of hours a day of rambling live shows on stage, as well as

171
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,300
hours and hours of preaching and live music, but I'm finding myself hard-pressed to edit

172
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,880
it, and one reason is that some of it is insipid drivel, and it's hard work making that sound

173
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,120
like a silk purse.

174
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:27,080
But I came upon one stretch of recordings that I feel should, despite its sow's ear

175
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,700
nature, be left more or less uncut.

176
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:36,860
One morning at 13X Day, July 3rd, Dr. Howell, Reverend Susie the Floozy, Dr. Philodrummon

177
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:43,100
and I started doing a show in front of many patient individuals, and, well, most of it

178
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,280
was good.

179
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,040
It was insipid drivel, too.

180
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,040
Maybe we needed more coffee.

181
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,940
In fact, you'll hear us get more coffee.

182
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,780
But after a little while, lonesome cowboy Dave showed up, and that's where it turned

183
00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:01,180
into an old-timer, subgenius, fundamentalist, back-to-the-pamphlet, classic-inspired insipid

184
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,580
drivel.

185
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,780
Because suddenly here you had almost all the key subgenius radio show blabbermouths of

186
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,940
our 30-year history all in one place at one picnic table.

187
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:17,700
Well, puzzling evidence and Phineas Narco were missing, and lies and your brogue friend

188
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,720
are big sissies.

189
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,760
But here at one picnic table on a little rascals-looking stage, you had Reverend Susie the Floozy,

190
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,360
veteran of hundreds of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse shows on WREK in Atlanta, who incidentally

191
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,280
did not wear her shirt for some of this presentation.

192
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,820
You had me and lonesome cowboy Dave from Hour of Slack in WCSB Cleveland, and you had Dr.

193
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,920
Howell from the Puzzling Evidence Show.

194
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:49,000
And the Ask Dr. Howell shows in Berkeley and San Francisco, with his co-star and actual

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,700
first and only overman and co-sub-founder of the Church of the Subgenius, lead singer

196
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,660
of the Swingin' Love Corpses, webmaster of QuiveringBrain.com, director of the Subgenius

197
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:06,840
Film Festivals, and close personal friend of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself, Dr. Philo Drummond.

198
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,620
All those people in one place.

199
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,900
Now we'll also hear some music and sermons by Reverend Dr. Howell.

200
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:20,480
I'm Dr. Howell, and I'm the host of the Uncut and Unfettered Skinner-Breaking Master Recording

201
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,900
Itself from 13X Day.

202
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,980
I was gonna point out a theory that I have, or really it's just an observation, and friends,

203
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,580
this is not a value judgment, about monster fans versus comics fans.

204
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,660
Sometimes it's the same thing, but I'm more of a monster fan.

205
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,880
Now I've noticed the primary image that goes on in the comics is the image of a monster.

206
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


207
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:41,880


208
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:50,020
The image that goes with monster movies and books is a great big ugly guy carrying a pretty

209
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,540
girl wearing very little clothing.

210
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,580
Carry on monster.

211
00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:00,620
Whereas the primary image for comic book fans is two men in tights grappling with each other.

212
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,460
Hitting each other.

213
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,880
Like I say, I'm not making a value judgment, but I'm a monster fan.

214
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,740
Did anybody watch Octoman the other night?

215
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,400
Sure enough.

216
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,700
He picks up the girl.

217
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,940
And starts plodding along with her for a long, long time.

218
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,920
You know, you gotta have that.

219
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,400
The carry.

220
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,460
It was so dark.

221
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,800
The Creature from the Black Lagoon.

222
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:19,960
It was a very dark movie.

223
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,340
Not even the same species.

224
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,460
But when he sees Julie Adams, he has to pick her up and just carry her along.

225
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,000
Who wouldn't?

226
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,520
Yeah.

227
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,620
Well, I would, but.

228
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,700
Well, I think your observation about men grappling.

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,780
Didn't you say you met Julie Adams?

230
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,160
Yes.

231
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,660
Is that turning you on, Dr. Drummond?

232
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,820
Well, I have to, I have to, it just seems so odd that you would make that up.

233
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,300
No, but.

234
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,300


235
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,180
Men grappling versus monsters, fondly.

236
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,360
I never noticed it before.

237
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,080
Reverend Stang?

238
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,860
Do you know how I was talked into meeting you for the first time, Dr. Drummond?

239
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,120
This is historic.

240
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,020
My sister-in-law said.

241
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,760
You mean you had to be talked into it?

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,840
These people that I knew in Austin have moved to Dallas, Stang, and you should go see these

243
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,980
folks because you'd really hit it off with this guy.

244
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,880
And I said, I hate everybody.

245
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,540
buddy I don't want friends and she said well this guy's different now she goes he's into comic books

246
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:30,140
and Captain Beefheart now to see if that describes every subgenius but at the time I didn't know

247
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,940
anybody else I knew lots of people who like comic books and lots of people who like Captain Beefheart

248
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:44,040
it was the crossover that made that it was the that foreign index key that made it easily

249
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,580
retrievable by that one odd character in the crowd that there's a whole bunch of here

250
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:57,760
I went over to your house in in Dallas and and and then he showed me what was even better than

251
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:04,560
the comic books his collection of kook pamphlets and that was when I

252
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:04,920
knew I was going to be in the comic book world and I knew I was going to be in the comic book

253
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:04,920


254
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,220
that Philo and I were true Yeti mates.

255
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,020
Because, you know, Captain Beefheart

256
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,120
and comic books and a big collection

257
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,620
of Jack Chick comics.

258
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,720
Now you're talking.

259
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,900
Chick tracks attract chicks.

260
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,980
So it wasn't long before

261
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,960
we were cranking out Coop pamphlets

262
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,480
and horrible music.

263
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,660
And bad comics.

264
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
Which is the church.

265
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,220
We learned from the great.

266
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,920
The great.

267
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,940
Philo introduced me to Bob.

268
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,460
I did not know anything about it.

269
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,760
But he had been recruited

270
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,980
before anybody else.

271
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,900
Isn't that incredible, ladies and gentlemen?

272
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,140
Can't avoid that guy.

273
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,120
Captain Beefheart helped bring us together.

274
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,660
Now I heard that Bob kidnapped Philo

275
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,740
when he was a young boy

276
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,800
from a W.T. Grant's restroom.

277
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,580
And like kept him in Tucson

278
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,540
and raped him for 20 years.

279
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,980
It's amazing the stories you hear

280
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,040
about people's childhoods.

281
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,700
I heard it was a Woolworth's restroom.

282
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,340
I heard that it was a wolf.

283
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,580
He was a wolf cub in those days.

284
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,540
Hey look, there's...

285
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,400
Oh my God!

286
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

287
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,800
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

288
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,680
So here he is.

289
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
Oh look, he's not so lonesome after all.

290
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,260
We thought we were gonna have to get ragtime cowboy chubs.

291
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,880
Hey, I can tell he's been wrestling.

292
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,780
He's got that bandaid across his forehead

293
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,000
where he bladed himself

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,080
so he'd bleed, you know, for the show.

295
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,720
You're gonna peel that bandaid off?

296
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:33,920
You're gonna peel that bandaid off?

297
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,520
You're gonna peel that bandaid off later

298
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,960
and bleed for everybody, right?

299
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,100
Boy, there's a bunch of old people up here now.

300
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,780
That's right.

301
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,980
Hey, now I got this little half erect mic again.

302
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,040
How'd this happen?

303
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,900
It's only half erect, yeah.

304
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,960
What's BFC stand for?

305
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,040
What's that banging against the table?

306
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,820
Susie will show you how to work that thing.

307
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,960
I can't believe it says

308
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,920
I never made that connection before.

309
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,060
There are no connections here now.

310
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,200
BFC.

311
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,120
Yeah.

312
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,420
Dave, can I get your cup of coffee?

313
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,000
Surely.

314
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,540
Okay.

315
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,940
We got it.

316
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,580
And the lard to put in it.

317
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,540
Oh.

318
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,000
Ah.

319
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,240
Oh.

320
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,340
Ah.

321
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,620
Ah.

322
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,200
Ah.

323
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,360
Ah.

324
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,280
I'm not used to that.

325
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,800
Did everyone have their beans and lard this morning?

326
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,400
It's so big.

327
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:21,400


328
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,040
Did you?

329
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,460
So we've been waiting for you.

330
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,800
You had your beans and lard this morning?

331
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,280
I love you so much.

332
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,040
Did you have your beans and lard this morning?

333
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,480
Why?

334
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,540
Mrs. Mammy Whistle, you.

335
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:33,900
Thank you.

336
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,420
I'm sitting there with the unguentine hair.

337
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,580
Did you have too much this morning?

338
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,340
Too much.

339
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,140
You're a nice old fella.

340
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,600
Thanks, Pappy.

341
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,920
All right.

342
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,720
Creaming your coffee.

343
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,480
So just the new guys get coffee?

344
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,480
There's some new rope clusters if you need those.

345
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,820
What about those of us that have been here before?

346
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,680
Do we get coffee?

347
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,020
Do we get any coffee?

348
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,600
You can surely get it.

349
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,720
Yeah, you can go over there and get that.

350
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,160
Where is it?

351
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,680
I'll get you coffee.

352
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,020
Bim bam.

353
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,180
Bim bam.

354
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,600
Actually.

355
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,940
From the coffee service.

356
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,720
It's right back there.

357
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,560
I think I'm going to squat down here.

358
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,020
That's in keeping.

359
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,100
Let's have the woman serve the coffee.

360
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,720
Nothing to do with Joe DiMaggio.

361
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,440
No, I don't need any cream in my coffee this time.

362
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,920
Don't want no sugar in your pudding.

363
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,820
Hey, guess what?

364
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,760
There's no coffee.

365
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,240
It was all a sham, a mockery.

366
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,300
This is filled with dark colored mucus, man.

367
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,760
Just drink it.

368
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,160
Drink up.

369
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,980
You look like a professional wrestler, Dave.

370
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,440
You look like a professional wrestler.

371
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,560
You've got cups.

372
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,000
You can pretend like you're drinking coffee.

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,740
You've got the bandaid on your forehead, you know.

374
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,980
Like you're getting ready to take it off during the match, you know, when somebody gives you a chair shot.

375
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,080
Well, we're going to have coffee and we're going to have a lot of things.

376
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,560
I don't think we need to quarrel over coffee.

377
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,180
And we certainly don't need to talk about the trevination scar here.

378
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:00,740
We're going to have coffee.

379
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:00,740


380
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,260
Which was a poor attempt, I tried my best.

381
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:03,860
No, thanks, I won't use the cream.

382
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,200
You know, lonesome cowboy Dave, I appreciate your scar.

383
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,180
No, no, it's perfectly fine.

384
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:16,700
But I have to say it must pale besides the great scar of Legume, which has been on display for the past couple of days.

385
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,200
But it's a fine, righteous scar.

386
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,600
Where is Legume, is he here?

387
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,840
He's back there, that scarred master.

388
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,860
I saw him earlier, there he is, yeah, man.

389
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,840
Has he shown his scar yet?

390
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,560
He has shown it.

391
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:25,940
He's been showing that scar.

392
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,660
I'll show it to you, by appointment only.

393
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,720
His butt crack goes all the way up the back of his scar.

394
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:30,720


395
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:30,720


396
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,960
spine up over his head, down the nose, across the lips, and down the front again, and he's

397
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,900
got a camel toe.

398
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,620
That was one hell of a surgery.

399
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,560
You've got a zipper.

400
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,600
You need a camel toe.

401
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,320
He's got two camel toes now.

402
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,820
I think they just chainsawed him down, froze him first, and kind of...

403
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,160
I see him back there looking up here.

404
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,940
Look, he's nodding his head.

405
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,900
He's not happy.

406
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,720
He died five times, and they didn't bring him back.

407
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,140
He doesn't like this particular conjecture.

408
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,060
This angle, this tangent.

409
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,220
Not while he's drooling like that.

410
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,200
Cowards die many times before their heads.

411
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,060
Although I saw his eyebrows go up that time.

412
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,000
The valiant never tasted death but once.

413
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,780
Dr. Leguim had his operation.

414
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,980
He was cut in half vertically.

415
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,900
Yeah.

416
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,720
He was cut.

417
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,780
He was bifurcated.

418
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,980
That was the only way to get that deep down inside.

419
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:20,900
Yeah.

420
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,320
That reminds me of that old Justin Wilson joke.

421
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,880
Remember?

422
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,000
He said they had a car wreck.

423
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,620
Yeah.

424
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,780
He asked his wife after the wreck, he said,

425
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,880
Honey, is you hurt?

426
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:39,380
She said, Oh, I'm cut from all the way up here to all the way back here.

427
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,220
And he said, I know, but is you hurt?

428
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,260
Anyway, you had Justin Wilson.

429
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,940
You had to pee there.

430
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah, you had to pee there.

431
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,100
He was no Bill Hicks.

432
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,320
You had to have been him.

433
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,040
You're supposed to finish it with I guarantee.

434
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,160
I guarantee.

435
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,880
That's apparently where everybody knew they were supposed to finish.

436
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,500
I'm going to sell you a pair of pants as well.

437
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,880
They hadn't laughed up to that point.

438
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,760
That's when they would laugh.

439
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,000
That's pink humor.

440
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,700
Nothing funny.

441
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,940
But as soon as the catchphrase comes up, they know they're supposed to robotically laugh.

442
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,460
You know, that was during that time of double entendre.

443
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,900
You couldn't really say that stuff.

444
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,680
Oh, I remember those days.

445
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,800
You know, you had to layer it on real heavy.

446
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,680
The days of sociopaths and double dildos, man.

447
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:25,040
Yeah, you get like Jeb and Cousin Easy doing the golf game where it's like, okay, you grab your putter.

448
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,540
Yeah, that guy that painted the pictures, but they were totally.

449
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,740
But it was for women that were painting in the nude.

450
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,420
Or men.

451
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,660
Painting men and women in the nude.

452
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,120
I painted in the nude a lot.

453
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,120
All those rocks I did.

454
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,780
Oh, yeah, I got one of those rocks.

455
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,820
Yeah, I painted those rocks naked.

456
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,300
I got a rock with a pipe on it.

457
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,580
And used to leave the studio doors wide open so everyone could see.

458
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Well, you painted those rocks?

459
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,400
I thought those were the angel turds.

460
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,780
Well, I shat them out first, and then I painted them.

461
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,300
Oh, God.

462
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,400
Don't worry.

463
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,140
The angels shat them out already.

464
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,440
It's stagecraft.

465
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,980
The artwork was stagecraft.

466
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,760
I'm sorry to disabuse you.

467
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,120
I wanted to abuse you.

468
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,880
It was an angle, not an angel.

469
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,660
It was misplaced.

470
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,580
I'm going to find out what's supposed to be going on right now.

471
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,940
Well, we already had Biceys read the schedule.

472
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,460
You'll have to catch up.

473
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,100
Pay more attention.

474
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,000
These peanuts.

475
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,320
You missed the naked stuff.

476
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,260
I got here late.

477
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,680
I didn't mean to get here late.

478
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,460
There was a lot of naked stuff.

479
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,520
There was.

480
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,300
It was great naked stuff.

481
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,500
Could it be replayed in front of us right now?

482
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,280
No, it could not, because we do not photograph it.

483
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,140
That's part of the law there.

484
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,580
The girls won't take their clothes off if they know their grandmas

485
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,080
are going to be able to see it on the Internet tomorrow.

486
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,800
We have to take mental pictures.

487
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,400
Back before grandma was on the Internet,

488
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,520
oh, they'd show off their titties to every boy with the camera.

489
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,120
But then granny got on America Online

490
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,120
and immediately looked up subgenius.com.

491
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,180
I'm going to see what my little granddawn television does.

492
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,400
See?

493
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,520
The show's gotten better.

494
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,580
The TV has been up to.

495
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,400
Oh, grandma's not a natural blonde.

496
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,700
See, that's all it takes to improve the show.

497
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,200
Oh, my God, there's my granddaughter televangel

498
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,820
wrestling naked on a giant American flag.

499
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,920
With Janer.

500
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,260
With all you boys.

501
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,460
You're with Janer.

502
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,700
Sex on the American flag.

503
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,800
Sex through the window pane.

504
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,820
Janer was given his chance.

505
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,660
I know what, y'all.

506
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,360
Oh, what was this about not snapping pictures?

507
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,020
Well, you know.

508
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,340
Yesterday, yesterday we lied and told the radio audience

509
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,460
we were all naked, but this time we're not lying.

510
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,520
Is there a neo-Nazi rally for peace tonight in Brotherhood?

511
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,600
A rally?

512
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,200
A neo-Nazi rally for peace in Brotherhood?

513
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,940
A political demonstration here at Brushwood?

514
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,700
I think we're beyond petty human politics.

515
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,380
That's correct.

516
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,860
No one here is a Whig or anything like that, eh?

517
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,360
That's correct.

518
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,640
We've left it all behind.

519
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,280
We've flipped the Whigs.

520
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,500
We've flipped the Whigs.

521
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,460
We've left the Federalist tissue paper in the toilet where it belongs.

522
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,200
It's time to join the ex-humanite party.

523
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,940
The ex-humanites shall rise from the ashes.

524
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,680
And believe me, you're all a bunch of asses from what I can see right now,

525
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,880
if we're even thinking of it.

526
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,700
Yeah, well, I'm like a phoenix rising from the asses.

527
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,980
It ends a physical body.

528
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,740
It has raised a spiritual body.

529
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,180
And there is no such thing.

530
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,940
And staying reached for his face.

531
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,140
Ensure and certain.

532
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,500
Ensure and certain.

533
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,580
And hope of resurrection.

534
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,320
The day after tomorrow.

535
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,320
I wanted for us more nuts.

536
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,020
The love.

537
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,020
It's one more.

538
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,440
Would you think of it, Dr. Howell, it's always propounded as to be the day after tomorrow.

539
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,140
When will the world end?

540
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,200
When will this new thing come about?

541
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,680
When will we all be lifted up into some sort of potty chair?

542
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,560
Some giant fuzzy potty chair made out of strange musicians?

543
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,920
We have a date and a time.

544
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,700
A date and a time.

545
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,660
Here comes the candy.

546
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,120
A specific date and time?

547
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,480
Candy!

548
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,280
Look at all the lovely, sugary candies.

549
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,800
There's peanuts on the microphone.

550
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,260
There's butterscotch.

551
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,660
And there's chewy nougat.

552
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,640
There's blisters on the bare butt.

553
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,540
What's the point of this?

554
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,800
Oh, well, it's x-ray.

555
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,220
There's a weird cackling sound coming from the bushes.

556
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,080
I more like the gets best by putting them between my boobs first.

557
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,420
What the hell is this?

558
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,800
Even on Halloween I never saw

559
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,420
It's got a creamy center

560
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,540
Which is disgusting

561
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,220
It does, I generally steer clear of those

562
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,640
You can poke your tongue right through it

563
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,820
But I just gotta try it

564
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,520
Go on and give it your best try

565
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,440
I always have to tongue pork these

566
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,260
I think

567
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,460
I think

568
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,320
Therefore I stink

569
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,700
You're drinking coffee

570
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,200
You could have candy and coffee

571
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,560
Like they have in Amsterdam

572
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,520
Here's Smarties, these will make you smarter

573
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,680
Brain candy

574
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,760
Those are rabbit pellets

575
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,220
Then you line it

576
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,820
Put the lemon head in there

577
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,480
It's sort of like a tootsie roll

578
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,520
I'm gonna save this bit of honey

579
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,720
For later

580
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,120
Look Mary Jane

581
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
That's another thing I hated

582
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,620
When you radio DJs get on and start talking

583
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,240
About how yummy the food is

584
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,920
That you're eating

585
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,740
And the poor radio listeners, all they have to eat

586
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,080
Is that sound coming out

587
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,440
I thought it was

588
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:24,540
I thought it was

589
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:24,540


590
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,880
What's the part of our show that you like, Reverend?

591
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,260
Yeah, tell us something good

592
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,900
Tell us something that you like about it

593
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,300
Why all this bitching about other radio shows?

594
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
The silent parts, right?

595
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,820
I'm the main one, I have to talk that way

596
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,100
There's gotta be something

597
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,660
I mean, if you were recommending our show to somebody

598
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,320
What would you say?

599
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,420
We were taking a breath, right?

600
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,400
I would say that listening to the Puzzling Evidence show

601
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,180
Is like walking through a dream

602
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,760
A world in which you were at the party

603
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,540
Of the most clever, smart, and smart people in the world

604
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,120
And you're the spontaneous surrealist

605
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
To compete, it's like

606
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,960
You could ever imagine

607
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,120
It's like all of them talking at once

608
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,440
With the sound effects turned up way too loud

609
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,520
It's like attacking an evil monster

610
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,100
With a tiny little sausage

611
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,160
It just can't be done

612
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,260
But you valiantly try

613
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,560
You hold that sausage aloft

614
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,260
And then layer on some unlistenable pop music

615
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,220
Japanese pop

616
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,300
I'm sorry

617
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,000
Thank you

618
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,520
You certainly are

619
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,640
I just don't get into it

620
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,080
What do you think?

621
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,920
There's a phone call coming in?

622
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,780
Is Washington calling?

623
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,220
Has Washington called yet?

624
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,200
Background pictures

625
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,760
When are we gonna have to start getting entertaining?

626
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,260
Have we warmed up enough yet?

627
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,440
It's been the last three hours, hasn't it?

628
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,560
Well, we got the background picture

629
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,020
And we got the background music

630
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,320
The band wants their microphones back

631
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,400
I'll put my shirt back on and we can begin

632
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,040
The band wants their microphones back

633
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,320
Which band?

634
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,600
Who wants to fumigate them this time?

635
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,680
Has anyone in the listless audience

636
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,380
Spouted one of these unusual tumors lately?

637
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,680
I mean, just out of the clear blue

638
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,140
It just pops out real hard

639
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,840
And it like points at different radio frequencies

640
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,360
Does anybody know?

641
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,100
I got one

642
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,560
I had that once

643
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,940
It's more like a three more

644
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,700
I had that once

645
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,340
I can cut it out with a big knife

646
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,880
I can help you out with that if you need some help

647
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,660
Can't you just bite the head off it and split the core out?

648
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,960
We do a biopsy

649
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,660
You look like you've got the shangs for it

650
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,460
Could you give it a try?

651
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,500
We do it just like that, you know?

652
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,620
We don't like a biopsy but we

653
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,700
How can you tell that's bi?

654
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,920
We forego all the scientific part of it

655
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,820
How did you stumble over that?

656
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,620
I had no idea

657
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,900
We'll be right back

658
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,600
Boggles

659
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,800
Well, thank you

660
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,800
Boggles my mind

661
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,160
Dave, I noticed that you're wearing a bandage over your third nostril

662
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:53,300
I told you that and I told the listless audience that that was a kind of a poor attempt

663
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,340
He's got a scar

664
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,820
He was lancing a boil

665
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,920
To treponate my third eye

666
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,380
Oh, I thought that had already been done

667
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,200
How valiant

668
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,260
You're a do-it-yourself third eye treponation?

669
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,820
Well, after the miscalculations on the first 14 tries, I suppose something had to be done

670
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,620
I mean, people say I fidget with it too much

671
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,700
But how can you fidget with it too much?

672
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,360
It's not a fun thing to fidget with

673
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,340
Fidget is like a tool tool

674
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,080
Fidget?

675
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,980
It's hard to reach her

676
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,540
Yeah, that's what it is

677
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,440
It's a horn stub

678
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,960
Yes, it's a horn

679
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,160
An antler root

680
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,600
It is growing and growing daily

681
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:42,060
And by the time 5 a.m. in the morning on the 5th, it's 4 a.m. and some a.m. in the morning

682
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,460
This antler will bloom like a giant rose bush

683
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,720
I think it would be cool to have an antler sprouting from your head

684
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,280
I wanted a giant penis to sprout from your head

685
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,900
Because I knew it would be a symbol of masculine power

686
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,480
People don't ever

687
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,460
It could make you very popular too

688
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,720
It could pop you right up there

689
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,560
Yeah, you'd be like on the top level of popularity with a huge penis sprouting from your forehead

690
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,360
If it was a small one, you'd have to join the many minions of underachievers

691
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,620
If it was a small one, you'd just be apologizing for it all the time

692
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,900
Oh, I thought you were just going to say you would be a politician

693
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,260
Well, you're just a politician, right?

694
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,260


695
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,920
You don't need that to be a politician

696
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,540
They've proven that you don't really need anything

697
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:33,540
Actually, these special glasses Bob sells, you can see the penises sprouting out of the politician's head

698
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,480
It's like they live, but not too badly

699
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,460
I've actually been to the halls of Congress

700
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,200
And they have a water fountain there that says power on it

701
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,140
And you just sip on it, and it just makes you really powerful

702
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,140
That's the one of the cherry whites only

703
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,580
And it makes you know everything

704
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,320
It's a lot better, more bitter than everybody

705
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,620
Is that the one of the cherubim urinating on everyone's head?

706
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,740
They will at your request after you sip off of this water fountain

707
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,500
Did you drink some?

708
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
No, I'm not allowed, I'm not an elected official, so I don't get a chance to

709
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,220
I'm just one of the pleads

710
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,580
He's an erected unofficial

711
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,360
That was behind Rocknar's campaign

712
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,100
He hoped, if elected, to taste that Perian spring

713
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,560
I told him he wouldn't be able to resist it

714
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,060
Well, he wouldn't be able to resist the money anyway

715
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,000
You have to go back, it's like the most addictive

716
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,940
Liquid crack?

717
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,280
Liquid, it's more than liquid crack

718
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,800
A real Ponce de Leon, huh?

719
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,220
It's like liquid crack heroin

720
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,380
It is a fountain of juice

721
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,220
That tastes good and smells good too

722
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,600
Well, you're making me thirsty as you described the process

723
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,140
One sip and you become twice as thirsty as you were when you first drank it

724
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,760
Political waters, so deep, so murky

725
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,460
The water of Bob

726
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,800
The water of Bob

727
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,560
But it's worth it because you're so much smarter after that

728
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
The yellow water of Bob

729
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,500
And you know so much more than everyone and so much better than everyone

730
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,180
Say for instance you had to perform an instant

731
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,440
And you know then that it's true, you are better than everyone

732
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,380
And this trickles down onto your feet

733
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:13,320
It only trickles down into the one individual who's actually sipping of the special sauce

734
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,980
Bob's pee, I mean water, can trickle up

735
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,680
It's more like blood dripping from an abused rectum

736
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,540
It's a special water fountain, you can only get it in these few areas, you know?

737
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:27,720
You have to go, there's a bunch of old guys standing in line waiting to drink on it again

738
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,180
Yes, step right up, senor

739
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,780
This is the water of youth, the fountain you have dreamed of for so long

740
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,020
There's vendors that service the line while you're in it

741
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,160
Only one cup per passenger

742
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,780
You know there's guys selling hot dogs and drinks and stuff while you're waiting in line to sip on that

743
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,640
Yeah, but those aren't real, those aren't real people or not people

744
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,340
Well, they're vendors, you have to get a

745
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,000
They're vendors

746
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:49,560
Yeah

747
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,520
They're cyclocyborgic vendors, you know?

748
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:52,520


749
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:52,720
They're vendors

750
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,320
They look like people and have all the irritating

751
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,080
Cyclocyborgic?

752
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,060
And have all the irritating qualities of a normal vendor

753
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,800
Cyborgician

754
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,900
Too much onions, not enough

755
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,700
Unlicensed vendors

756
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,420
Get away from me, screw off

757
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:04,880
I'm gonna die, die, die

758
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:12,780
That's the way it was back in the year 1395 when Grandpappy fell out of this hole right

759
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,120
here

760
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,300
And when he did, he brought back many secrets, one of which is

761
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,940
I don't know what it's called

762
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,780
My baby

763
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:22,880
Dad?

764
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:23,940
That's easy for you to say

765
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:29,400
But in today's modern world it's all tied up with a bureaucratic tangle of regulatory

766
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:36,520
structure, making it impossible to put up a taco stand without trespassing on somebody's

767
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,500
copyright or legal liability

768
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Code 601 and 1 half No hot dogs beyond the wiener wagon friends around the pale

769
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,840
What is going to cut through all the red tape?

770
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,760
What Alexandrian sword?

771
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,520
The bad guys?

772
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,440
the Gordian tangle caused by busybodies,

773
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,020
goo-goos, and nosy parkers.

774
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:04,220
Well, I think that the key word in your statement of solution

775
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,280
would be sword. It takes a sword

776
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,380
to cut through that knot. That was Alexander's

777
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,140
solution. An oblique sword. Hey, Reverend Suds, how's the coverage

778
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,660
on the CD recordings?

779
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,080
That was...

780
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,800
Okay, so in a few minutes we'll need to shut up

781
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,800
long enough to flip the CD. I love that

782
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
new, quick-moving technology.

783
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,840
Humans 16. That was the score last night,

784
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,780
but if you take a look again at what happened, there have been a lot of discrepancies in the

785
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,580
film and the footage. Number one here, the first thing, it was a bad call

786
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,640
as J.R. Bob Fosse

787
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,660
emerged from the bushes and ripped one of the very,

788
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,040
very hapless, unlikely first-time submitters to the cause.

789
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,260
Tore his head neatly off his shoulders and then ate the neck

790
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,240
juice. But you said that was

791
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,520
J.Nor Bob Dobbs, not J.R. Bob Dobbs. J.Nor B.Wall.

792
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,360
J.Nor Bob Dobbs. May.

793
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:16,040
He's going a little bit far with that one. That one is implied by the Church of the Sub-Jainer,

794
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,060
if you'll think about it for a moment. Because according to the doctrine of the Church

795
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,820
of the Sub-Jainer, everyone is a member, and that would include

796
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,900
Bob Dobbs. He would be Sergeant J.Nor Dobbs. Even members of

797
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,040
the Church of Don? Yes. The only one who can't be a member of the

798
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,100
Church of the Sub-Jainer is, of course, J.Nor. According to

799
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,220
the rules created by Nen-slo, Ascended Nen-master,

800
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,860
or as some call him, Sergeant J.Nor Nen-slo.

801
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,960
Assassinated Nen-master Nen-slo.

802
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,800
All members of the Church of the Sub-Jainer are allowed to address each

803
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,700
other as Sarge, Sarge, and take the name Sergeant

804
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,000
J.Nor followed by your actual name. Can they say ma'am?

805
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,600
Captain? Sarge J.Nor.

806
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,980
Sergeant J.Nor. Sometimes a thousand

807
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,860
twangling instruments about the water. He's the most non-joiner

808
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,020
of non-joiners. Hey, but if we're talking about Jainer, that means I can't use it on my show.

809
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,920
We're talking about Nen-slo. That has hurt me. How come there's been so much talk about

810
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,720
Jainer this time, which is all unusable? I'm talking about Nen-slo.

811
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,760
Well, we can dig it. Because it makes us feel free to say the

812
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,720
unusable. To say the unspeakable. What we're not usually

813
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,300
allowed to talk about or even mention. We're talking about Shaft.

814
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,820
But it's X-Day. The uneditable. And you can always, should we

815
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,100
survive X-Day in some way, you could always put

816
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,360
pork slap. Who has an instrumental version of Shaft?

817
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,480
I should have one taped to my leg. We could also use the oblique channel

818
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,700
and we could just refer to it as M-HER-IT-ISH, non-joiner.

819
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,880
You could bleep it out. Weep?

820
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,900
Weep it out. Weep. Weep and bleep.

821
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:07,700
That's the cry of the unused radio man. Bleep that you may not

822
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,240
weep.

823
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,500
Can you see with those eyes crossed that way? Bleep the hell out of it.

824
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,160
What the bleep do we know? God, was that the most

825
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,520
horrible movie. The movie irritated me. I just wanted to stab the screen

826
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,680
with a big knife. Four minutes

827
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,700
until we have to shut up long enough for Potter and Ostril to

828
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,340
change the high speed duplicator. Yes, four minutes.

829
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,560
And then it's two minutes of, that's when everybody

830
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,900
gets really, really funny. As soon as I know the recorder's off.

831
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,600
As sure as nothing is happening. Yes, we haven't been saying much.

832
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,840
The little laugh-o-meter has been down to below zero

833
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,380
for quite a while now. I think we ought to just get very, very quiet and pretend.

834
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,540
D. Lister. I don't know about

835
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,680
the rest of you, but I have been out there in the world of the pinks and the normals

836
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,160
preaching the word of Bob. Praise Bob!

837
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,320
And the most frequent question that I am asked

838
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,260
is how can I get slack?

839
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,860
If you have to ask, then you cannot get slack.

840
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,800
Because slack is not something that you can

841
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,780
strive to attain. Am I right?

842
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,120
Slack is something that comes to you when you least expect it.

843
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,160
And if you are asking for it, then

844
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,400
you will never get it. It's kind of like sex in that way, isn't it?

845
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,260
Yes!

846
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,140
Well, those of you who have not experienced sex yet, I guess can't really answer that question.

847
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,760
Sorry. But anyways,

848
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,220
the slack that

849
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,860
I have been experiencing here has been the best slack that I have

850
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,520
had. But yet, I'm sure there's better slack out there.

851
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,980
Am I right?

852
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,920
Yes!

853
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,900
Because there's always better slack than what you have had.

854
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,000
Because there's no limit to the

855
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,340
quality of the slack that you can experience.

856
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,180
No limits! No limits! Because if there was a cap

857
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,000
on the slack quality, then once you

858
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,080
achieve the limit of slack,

859
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,180
then what else would there be to live for?

860
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,220
There would be nothing! Exactly, brother!

861
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,840
Until the fucking exes get here, which we hope

862
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,460
they will do in less than 36 hours, then we must

863
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,600
strive to not care about our slack,

864
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,600
and that's how we will get our slack.

865
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,280
But also, the people that are out there,

866
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,040
that are here, that are just wandering around,

867
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,180
milling around, just doing whatever the fuck they want, that is

868
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,160
slackful! I will admit that is slackful. However,

869
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,440
there should also be some helping out with everything.

870
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,160
Right? Volunteering. Is volunteering a good thing, Pisces?

871
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,920
It certainly is. Is that good slack from volunteering? There is a

872
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,920
definite slack reward for volunteering, yes.

873
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,160
If you give away that slack, you'll get it back!

874
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,720
Thank you! If you didn't hear that, if you give the slack,

875
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,080
you get it back! You can help out

876
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,640
in many ways. Pick up trash that you see.

877
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,180
That will give you slack.

878
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,820
Help at the bridge desk, or the slack shack.

879
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,100
Swag shack, whatever. That gives you slack.

880
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,540
But,

881
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,100
as Reverend Sex Mortis said,

882
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,420
the most important thing is to not

883
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,720
FUCK WITH ANYONE ELSE'S SLACK!

884
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,600
Because fucking with someone else's slack

885
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,080
is the anti-slack!

886
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,920
And nobody wants the anti-slack.

887
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,460
So, here's Jenny Lester!

888
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,460
Thank you, Robot!

889
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,220
Ladies and gentlemen, for the past 10 years,

890
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,360
we've heard nothing about, on TV, except about, we're Americans.

891
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,000
Right? And we're the biggest, we're the toughest nation

892
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,980
in the world! Fuckin' A, man! We're a bunch of pussies!

893
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,180
You go to some place, and you get lousy

894
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,900
service, and you say, I'll show them. I'll fill up this little

895
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,720
4x8 car that goes to somebody in the corporate office.

896
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,000
We need to take a fucking clue from some other country. You know, I was reading

897
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,120
the paper about five years ago. In Argentina,

898
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,860
a bunch of passengers were stranded at the airport. You know how they

899
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,840
have to do it to you? You know how they do it to you?

900
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,920
You leave at the airport, no plane. They burn down the fucking

901
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,440
airport!

902
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,740
That's how they do it! Fuck that 5x8 car!

903
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,340
You burn down the fucking restaurant! You don't like that steak?

904
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,080
Fuckin' Americans. How many Americans does it take to change a

905
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,780
light bulb? Sixteen!

906
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,240
That's right. You need two of them to complain because the light bulb

907
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,500
burned out. You need two of them to blame the government.

908
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,160
You need three of them to

909
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,060
hire illegal aliens to change a

910
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,800
light bulb because they're too fucking fat and lazy to do it themselves.

911
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,260
You need another two to go on Fox News and blame Obama.

912
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,320
How many is that? I lost count. Well, you need the rest of them. The rest of them

913
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,020
got to complain because the illegal aliens done took the job, even though they would never

914
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,140
stoop as low to change a light bulb.

915
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,300
They need the rest of them. They said they have

916
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,120
to change a light bulb unless they get like a secret no big contract

917
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,400
and a tax break, but they will change a light bulb without that.

918
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,580
We're fucking pussies!

919
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,740
I'm sick of it. You know what? The conspiracy

920
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,120
has been bullshitting us since I was a little kid. Because when I was a kid

921
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,740
in first grade, you used to show all these movies, what the future is going to be like.

922
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,460
Hey, the future is going to be perfect! We're going to have flying cars.

923
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,280
We're going to have, uh, flying cars! We're going to have flying cars! We're going to have flying cars!

924
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,640
We're going to have flying cars, we're going to have talking dogs that go,

925
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,520
what, old wretch?

926
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,380
We're going to have houses on the moon.

927
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:59,660
Well, I'll tell you what, I'm looking around, I ain't got no fucking flying car yet!

928
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,840
I want my fucking flying car!

929
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,260
Fuck the conspiracy!

930
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,780
I want my fucking flying car!

931
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,420
I want it now!

932
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:22,540
Last night I heard a prominent subgenius angry because he hadn't received his flying car.

933
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,440
His flying car?

934
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,080
His flying car, yes.

935
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,720
Yeah, it was Reverend Skull.

936
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,640
Reverend Skull was complaining about not getting his flying car.

937
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,520
I must say, that was an unusual rant for you.

938
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,500
That was not your normal sermon.

939
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,660
There were a lot more vocabulary words in it.

940
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:40,800
I can see your...

941
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,280
More than one.

942
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,640
In English.

943
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,640
I kind of feel the same way about the whole flying car thing, though.

944
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,760
I wish I had one.

945
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,700
I was really impressed by the ranting last night.

946
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,740
But I did hear that they're kind of like clearing the way through the FCC on that issue.

947
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,100
Not the FCC, the FAA.

948
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:56,720
FAA.

949
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,780
They did build flying cars, but they had to stop manufacturing them because no one can use them

950
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:07,140
because the moment your flying car takes off, it becomes an aircraft and you have to file a flight plan

951
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,740
and you're in another level of...

952
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,920
But now we have the internet.

953
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,300
Yeah.

954
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:11,400
So...

955
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:11,680
FAA.

956
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,940
So you instantly file a templatized flight plan on the internet and that takes care of the government paperwork.

957
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,560
And also there are plenty of sebaceous cysts and lots of crowns in the hallway.

958
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:27,420
So you need to get the invisibility thing worked out and then it all becomes a moot point.

959
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,020
The flying cars they came up with were good, too.

960
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,220
Hugh Hefner bought one.

961
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,320
They have a cruising range of 300 miles.

962
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,020
They fly.

963
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,820
They do everything you think, except they're totally illegal to use.

964
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,560
But that's what I was saying.

965
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,100
The FAA has just...

966
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,920
Just recently...

967
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,740
Belly dancers.

968
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,420
...come up with some standards...

969
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,120
Jeez, falling from the sky like it was some kind of...

970
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,200
...to help ease the...

971
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,860
I don't know what's happening.

972
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,040
We're going to have to wrap it up for two minutes here.

973
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,700
Okay, we have to wrap it up while the radio runabout turns over.

974
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,200
And so we leave you with the beautiful sounds of recorded music.

975
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:05,180
We'll be back in two shakes of a fish's tail, ere the Leviathan can swim a league.

976
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:41,060
We'll be right back.

977
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,280
We'll be right back.

978
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,640
I knew that smiling grin, and there he was.

979
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,780
Bob's come back home to us again, I said.

980
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,880
Bob's come back home to us again.

981
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,780
But something sinister was afoot.

982
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,280
There was this coldness in my soul taking root.

983
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:57,080
And I wasn't 100% sure of what was to happen or be.

984
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,580
But that wasn't Bob.

985
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,180
And he was coming right for me!

986
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:25,340
And I didn't quite understand what was going on.

987
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:29,280
There were descriptions of even animals that who suddenly panned out the entire shelf,...

988
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:29,320
of the meteor capita.

989
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:34,240
She was finding aНuks, their main happiness, Anks, she said.

990
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:34,240


991
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:34,240


992
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:34,240


993
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,900
There was no shocking reason that she didn't meet her G südkennels Person.

994
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,080
In this命eprotein phenomenon.

995
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,080


996
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,180
I'll tell you one of my favorite stories.

997
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,140
I don't put jeans on.

998
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,240
Come on, look at me.

999
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:57,860
Get radical.

1000
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,400
If you want to do that, that's fine, but I don't.

1001
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,780
We're going to stop you, Bob.

1002
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,240
All right.

1003
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:04,820
Woo.

1004
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:05,580
Okay.

1005
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,640
Bob, come on.

1006
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,400
Kill Bob.

1007
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:09,680
Bob.

1008
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,040
You're looking at me like you didn't get it.

1009
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,940
No, we get that a lot, friends, and we got that cut from Heart Ignition.

1010
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:24,400
Before that was Priestess Pisces and Six-Fisted Tales of Connie at 13X Day, Thursday night,

1011
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,180
making it all up as they went along, as is this music in the background.

1012
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,780
Six-Fisted Tales that night included Reverend Angry Larry, Reverend Suds Peshaw, Reverend Phil,

1013
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,000
Senator Speck, Dr. Philo Drummond, and Reverend...

1014
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,600
Bunny Day.

1015
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,080
Stang just drained a gallon out of that thing.

1016
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,800
You see that?

1017
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,440
That's because he's going to turn that useless water into powerful coffee.

1018
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,320
But damn.

1019
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,460
Powerful coffee will be produced out of that water.

1020
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,240
Stuff just floating in the water.

1021
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,160
Yeah.

1022
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,520
Animalcules.

1023
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,600
Animalcules?

1024
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:00,840
Foraminifera.

1025
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,000
Foraminifera.

1026
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:04,800
Gyroscopa.

1027
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,380
Tiny diatoms.

1028
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,820
Spider squids.

1029
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,800
Ding futzers.

1030
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,720
And whirligigs.

1031
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,840
Gyna-cola.

1032
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,740
Nyah-nyah-nyah.

1033
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,060
Only microns in diameter.

1034
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,460
Frost-bitten fleas.

1035
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,980
Hard-bitten fleas.

1036
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,360
Arguments with hard-bitten floozies.

1037
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,800
This is X-Day Radio.

1038
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,280
That's right.

1039
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:35,420
The legend burned across the land, blazing like a burning brand or whatever, for X-Day.

1040
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,980
Dr. Howell, how long has the legend gone on?

1041
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:46,480
Well, as long as there were brave, hardy sons of the soil hacking and chopping their way

1042
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,980
westward through the great American landscape.

1043
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,260
Chopping Indians and eating fires.

1044
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,120
This was a wonderful time in our country.

1045
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,240
And they just, they've landed here again for your listless pleasures.

1046
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:06,040
Yes, they built general stores and sutleries, laid railroads down across the prairies.

1047
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,200
Conestoga.

1048
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:07,780
Toga.

1049
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,780
Tiny Oaks.

1050
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,360
And hacked open waterfalls, and built the great American slag heaps.

1051
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,280
Dug up the gold.

1052
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,080
Argued with the acoustics of the soundboard.

1053
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,360
Ran the phone easiest.

1054
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,540
And took out the Copal and Tungsten.

1055
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,700
I don't believe it, he's gonna drain more.

1056
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,040
Recreated humanity in a little tiny drop of water.

1057
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:28,840
Water.

1058
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:29,640
Imagine.

1059
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,140
Or don't.

1060
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,920
Just where universes are in that drop of water.

1061
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,800
The source of all life.

1062
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:45,760
of strange little one-celled organisms and everybody knows what is flagellates and rotifers.

1063
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,720
You can do smelly.

1064
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,620
So those rotifers were washed out of the coffee urn.

1065
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:58,140
In any case, it's going to get warm for them in a few minutes.

1066
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,160
And then they'll be ready to drink.

1067
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,340
You see, sterilization, pasteurization, that does work.

1068
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,700
You can scour the little buggers out of there.

1069
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,680
Ask me, Lois Pasteur.

1070
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,960
I was the one who invented this shit.

1071
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:14,900
Really, I was.

1072
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,420
And they sneered at Louis Pasteur.

1073
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,660
They sneered and snickered.

1074
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,560
If there are these little bugs, why can we not see them?

1075
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,520
Why cannot we argue with them?

1076
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:35,720
I think the little bugs are in your mind, monsieur, between your eyes.

1077
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,140
Look!

1078
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,160
One of them is wearing a punching bag and a blowhorn.

1079
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,880
And a tiny derby hat with a little umbrella.

1080
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,960
And he's waving it at us, can't you see?

1081
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,500
Wave back, quickly, quickly.

1082
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,180
Too late, he died.

1083
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,100
His life cycle was too short.

1084
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:58,620
The only way to prolong the life cycle would be to pump more rotifers back into the water.

1085
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,920
Pack them in amber.

1086
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,620
It's, look, this tiny vial of urine.

1087
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,320
Of Dobbs's urine.

1088
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,120
It's all the rotifers.

1089
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,280
That's all the rotifers we need.

1090
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:13,560
So, Herr Van Leeuwenhoek was startled to see, looking through his experimental microscope,

1091
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,860
the tiny waving Dobbs inside each sperm.

1092
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,620
Now we have to change to the Dutch accent.

1093
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,280
Then he had to provide more sample and more and more sample.

1094
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:28,300
He kept pumping that sample out.

1095
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,760
Yeah, you've seen those little, those old engravings.

1096
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,580
I can do this all day.

1097
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,980
Especially when there's no connection.

1098
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,180
No connection.

1099
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,760
That's the most important part.

1100
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,600
Just let it slide slickly around from hemisphere to hemisphere.

1101
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,380
Slopping back and forth.

1102
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:57,240
Yes, your brain is like a washing machine and the agitator inside disturbing its contents is Bob.

1103
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,780
It's that pipe that's going around and around.

1104
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,940
Making that chugging noise.

1105
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,420
No one else can hear that.

1106
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:05,960
That is you.

1107
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,720
Yes, well, now I can hear it, but that's like an illustration of what it's like.

1108
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,600
Makes it hard to sit on it during the spin cycle.

1109
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,720
Oh, the spin cycle, you vibrate, you go to pieces all over.

1110
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,240
I don't know.

1111
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,460
I did it.

1112
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,060
I evened the slate.

1113
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,480
How I didn't bust myself all to hell is beyond me.

1114
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:34,380
On Saturday mornings, I'd stand on our front porch, and as the kids came by, I'd beat up and cuss.

1115
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,560
I pulled a grenade out and threw it.

1116
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:38,960
Bodies.

1117
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,500
More than a dozen horses had been killed.

1118
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,160
God.

1119
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,380
Dead horses.

1120
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,740
Chunks of beef.

1121
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,960
At least it wasn't me.

1122
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,320
Incontinental drift.

1123
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,100
Do you have that?

1124
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,240
Incontinental drift, yeah.

1125
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,140
It's a chronic problem.

1126
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,260
That's why we have this event outdoors.

1127
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,240
Some planets.

1128
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,300
So much of it.

1129
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:04,340
Incontinental drift.

1130
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:04,360
So much of it.

1131
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,920
Some of us have these leakage issues.

1132
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:06,600
We got it.

1133
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,340
Is anybody here?

1134
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:08,880
Dispersal.

1135
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,420
Dispersal.

1136
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,620
Arguments with wigs.

1137
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,380
These are all things we have to watch for.

1138
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,200
We have to stay on the steadfast.

1139
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,200
And on the standfast.

1140
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,980
We have to stand fast against these things, and for them, too, if they're necessary.

1141
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,880
It says, stand fast for what you believe in, and sit down on your own stool.

1142
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,180
Now, the world is scheduled to end the day after tomorrow, right?

1143
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:33,920
But.

1144
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,200
Yes.

1145
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:41,000
I've read some end of the world paranoid stuff about that oil zit, the Mother Earth zit, the oil volcano.

1146
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,100
But what's the point?

1147
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:53,000
It was so paranoid that to read this guy's rants, you'd think that it's going to be a close tie between the exes getting here in a day and a half,

1148
00:52:53,120 --> 00:53:01,020
or whether the waves of oil will be splashing over this far inland and submerge Brushwood.

1149
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:03,700
Wow.

1150
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:03,880
Wow.

1151
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,020
Wow.

1152
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:04,180
Wow.

1153
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,740
The concept of, well, we don't know how much oil is in there.

1154
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:13,180
What if there's more oil down there than there is of water in the oceans?

1155
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,280
It could be that the whole, you know.

1156
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,400
It's the end of the world.

1157
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:22,160
For all we know, the whole earth is filled with oil, and that's just where it's squirting out now.

1158
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,460
Maybe we could work out a deal with blood for oil.

1159
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,780
I heard that was a thing.

1160
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,640
I'd rather see waves of blood.

1161
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,560
Now, that would be cool.

1162
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,100
Just a big bucket, a big barrel of oil.

1163
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,700
That would be really cool.

1164
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,160
We could work out a deal of buns for oil.

1165
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,680
Or no, wait, I'm sorry.

1166
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:41,860
It could possibly mean the end of the world in a very, very short period of time.

1167
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,040
Somebody said they had stuffed up that leek.

1168
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:47,160
That was Legume.

1169
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:51,400
Legume said they got a wedding band over it or something, right?

1170
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,840
Some pork and some Kraft cheese.

1171
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,380
He did say they put a wedding band over it.

1172
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,940
So they were married.

1173
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:04,380
In a short time, moved to Binghamton Springs.

1174
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:09,800
There they lived for approximately 23 seconds before the insecticide.

1175
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,980
Actually, speaking of that particular problem,

1176
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,200
it's not just like one hole that needs to be plugged up anyway.

1177
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,120
The entire bottom there is porous and it's under mud.

1178
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,460
It's under loose mud.

1179
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,200
It's hard to tell what the bottom is.

1180
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,860
It could be coming up in many different ways.

1181
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,900
And messing it, shaking it.

1182
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,700
Shaking it around may open it up more so that more oil rises up.

1183
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,380
I lost track of things.

1184
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,640
You're not talking about me, are you?

1185
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:42,140
Don't forget, you know, where the plate tectonics, where the plates are separating,

1186
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,760
there's actual magma coming out of the earth.

1187
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,760
We've got to plug that stuff up too.

1188
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,760
Because magma is not good for anybody.

1189
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:51,740
You've got to clean your plates.

1190
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:55,460
Everybody I know who's ever gotten magma on them has died from it.

1191
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,100
I know.

1192
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,380
Forget all those stupid Hollywood movies.

1193
00:54:59,400 --> 00:54:59,460
It's highly poisonous.

1194
00:54:59,460 --> 00:54:59,920
We're worried about that.

1195
00:54:59,920 --> 00:54:59,920


1196
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,420
We're worried about oil.

1197
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,740
Where they almost fall into the volcano.

1198
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,100
There's magma coming out.

1199
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,900
Oh, I almost got the lava that's right there on me.

1200
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,560
He'd be cooked.

1201
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,660
He'd be flash cooked before he could say that sentence.

1202
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:16,020
From rock that's heated to glowing heat, it's right there.

1203
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,720
It doesn't matter if you don't get any on you.

1204
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,680
You can drink crude oil and live for a few hours.

1205
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:25,200
But if you drink magma, you're going to die almost instantly.

1206
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,000
The earth is just going to kill you anyway.

1207
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,820
Somehow or another, you're going to die.

1208
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:37,120
We live by sufferance on the thin skin around the dangerous, toxic, molten interior of the earth.

1209
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,860
Yeah, we're worrying about all this microscopic stuff, you know.

1210
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,160
One might worry about it in some degree.

1211
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,000
What about that asteroid that's supposed to hit here and like...

1212
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:49,260
That's loose pieces of the solar system that haven't been sorted out yet.

1213
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,960
That's the day after tomorrow, after we leave.

1214
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,380
See?

1215
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,500
There's an asteroid that's going to be hitting the earth.

1216
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,860
That's the sock from an asteroid.

1217
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:59,700
We'll be gone and we'll be looking back thinking, ah, we made it.

1218
00:55:59,720 --> 00:55:59,920
Just...

1219
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,280
Just in time.

1220
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:05,340
Boy, how ironic that the world ended when that asteroid was going to take care of it all anyway.

1221
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,700
I think the delay was for that reason.

1222
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:15,920
So that we could have more gleeful satisfaction of knowing that everything we were leaving behind is being destroyed.

1223
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,860
It's not as if there was only a fixed amount of glee to go around.

1224
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:20,480
Right.

1225
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:24,960
And you can engender so much more glee by imagining each and every catastrophe.

1226
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,820
Start and give them like numbers and then put little letters like A.

1227
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,660
How it expands.

1228
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,460
Like, there's the Gulf oil spill.

1229
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,660
There's the potential...

1230
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,520
11 zeros at the end of it.

1231
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,760
There's X-Day.

1232
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,580
And there's so many of them.

1233
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,620
Yeah, if you put enough numbers there, it becomes meaningless anyway.

1234
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:47,780
Well, there are many possible instant deaths that we could all suffer.

1235
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,360
For example, gamma ray bursts could occur.

1236
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,760
Gamma ray is very bad.

1237
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,580
Don't forget radon gas in your basement.

1238
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,140
It's just leaking out.

1239
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,020
You don't even know it.

1240
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,020
You're sleeping down there.

1241
00:56:59,160 --> 00:56:59,640
Yes.

1242
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,700
You're in a football game.

1243
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,140
Leaky basements.

1244
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,020
You think you're having a good time.

1245
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,700
You're sniffing up radon gas.

1246
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,100
Your own self-inflicted flatulence.

1247
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,240
Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya.

1248
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,000
Lunch meat.

1249
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:09,740
Flatulence.

1250
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,960
Bad barbecue.

1251
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:13,820
Et cetera, et cetera.

1252
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:14,520
Barbecue.

1253
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,500
Rashes, particularly around the butt.

1254
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:17,740
That's just wrong.

1255
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:18,820
Thank you for your program.

1256
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,420
Yucks.

1257
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,080
Your own self-inflicted flatulence.

1258
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:25,380
So many people are dying from their own self-inflicted flatulence.

1259
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:29,560
I heard about a guy who fell asleep inside his sleeping bag in his farts.

1260
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:30,240
Killed him.

1261
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,760
He had suffered from...

1262
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,640
The lighter was leaking as well.

1263
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,940
All those garlic and jalapeno sandwiches.

1264
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,600
It's not the flatulence itself.

1265
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,120
It's that it displaces all the air.

1266
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,520
He died of a fatal self-dutch ovening?

1267
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,880
Yeah, a dutch ovening.

1268
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,160
It sounds more like a burrito, doesn't it?

1269
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:47,840
A double dutch oven.

1270
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,900
Rolled up in the pig in the blanket.

1271
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,620
That's another reason you should not smoke in bed.

1272
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,220
You have a cigarette lit.

1273
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,220
I can't help that.

1274
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,240
Well, Philo, you're just handing me your rules, man.

1275
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,440
I don't like all your rules.

1276
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,720
I want to smoke in bed if I want to.

1277
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,660
I want to smoke in bed, yeah.

1278
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:02,920
That's all, smoke in bed.

1279
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,160
So, do you smoke before sex?

1280
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,600
Let's all get in bed right now and smoke.

1281
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,460
Or during sex or after sex?

1282
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,220
I don't know.

1283
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,060
I never looked.

1284
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:08,720
Ah.

1285
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,260
Weep, weep.

1286
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,340
Drink up and tip your waitress.

1287
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,700
Our next show's at 2.

1288
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,020
Actually, Susie, our next show is next week.

1289
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,560
Of course, our last thousand shows are archived at subgenius.com

1290
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,420
where you can learn everything about the Church of the Subgenius.

1291
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,540
And our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1292
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,240
That's subgenius.com.

1293
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:39,980
Our award-winning books and old CDs and videos are all still in print.

1294
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,800
Can you believe it?

1295
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,040
You can also find links to lots of freebies of all kinds.

1296
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,860
That's subgenius.com.

1297
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,640
This has been the Hour of Slack.

1298
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,280
Praise Bob.
