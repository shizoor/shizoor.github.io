00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
And welcome, dear friends, to the Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,340
Praise Bob!

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,840
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,360
Turn on the machines. This is Radio Yerevan.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,000
Wake up, puppet boy!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,680
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,680
There is absolutely no other possibility.

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,140
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,220
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

11
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,180
The Subgenius Hour of Slack!

12
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:29,700
The practice of hallucinatory drugs was big back in then and they were hearing these messages that the Beatles were placing backwards.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Bob, I'm so...

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,680
We smell Bob.

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,400
A silver lock.

16
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,580
Well, friends, I'm married. I'm not a virgin anymore since the last show.

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
But enough of the future, friends.

18
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,500
There's a pics of the wedding and so forth on the sub-site as there are logs of these shows.

19
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,920
But tonight we're going into the past.

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,980
I'm playing a rerun of Ancient Hour of Slack show number four.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,800
51.

22
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,380
The beloved anti-drug special.

23
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,140
Part one, take one.

24
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,840
And next week we'll be following that with the pro-frog special.

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,480
And these shows, friends, are truly old.

26
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,540
These are from 1986.

27
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,460
Only the names of the presidents have been changed and yet nothing has changed, friends.

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,320
Except that back then we said man instead of...

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,900
Dude.

30
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,740
But in this ancient show, friends, we'll be hearing from puzzling evidence.

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,640
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

32
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,580
Doctors for Bob.

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,540
Buck Naked.

34
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,960
The Rainmakers.

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,380
D.K. Jones.

36
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,800
Dick Gregory.

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,220
Steppenwolf.

38
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,180
Nina Hagen.

39
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,440
The Fireside Theater.

40
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,400
Art Linkletter.

41
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,240
Alice Cooper.

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,240
Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh.

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,180
St. Palmer Vreedies.

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,400
Frank Zappa.

45
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,800
And, uh...

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,620
Oh, friends.

47
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,160
Oh, the last poets.

48
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,120
Alan Watts.

49
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,020
Dr. Philo Drummond.

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:13,100
And beautiful collages by, uh, Hell Pope Huey, Byron Werner, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

51
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,900
So, uh, let's go back, back, back in time to that anti-drug special.

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,520
This one's for Dr. X.

53
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,200
May he rest in peace.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,360
Now, you're saying...

55
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,080
What?

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,840
Now, now...

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,380
Now, Reverend Stang, what is this?

58
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,740
The subgenius anti-drug special?

59
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,400
What is it?

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:44,640
The Church of the Subgenius joining with the conspiracy on its big fad of anti-drug mega-hype

61
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,060
and holier-than-thou witch-burning?

62
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,320
And I answer, nay, nay.

63
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,700
This is the anti-mega-hype we're hyping.

64
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,820
Not that we've ever condoned drug addiction.

65
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,340
Of course not, friends.

66
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,460
This is a church.

67
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,560
The only drug you need is Bob, my friend.

68
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,480
Bob will get you high and keep you there.

69
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,760
No, we're just anti-certain drugs, just like the conspiracy is.

70
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,540
They only hate the drugs that they're not on.

71
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,320
Death to pushers.

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,320
That's what Ronald and Nancy, if that really is her name, Reagan, say.

73
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,420
Death to pushers.

74
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:27,920
Oh, yeah.

75
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,360
And yet, dear friends,

76
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:37,700
they continue to use the United States government to support the tobacco industry

77
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,620
and the alcohol industry.

78
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,920
Oh, oh, but we're only against drugs, they say.

79
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,280
There's nothing wrong with being able to have a little drinky-winky now and then, is there?

80
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,740
And one cigarette never killed anybody,

81
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,560
unless it's lit right next to a leaky tank full of church air.

82
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,340
That's what Ronald Reagan said.

83
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:08,240
Oh, death to marijuana pushers, but subsidize the tobacco industry and the liquor industry.

84
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,940
Oh, friends, you know, lips that have touched the bottle will never touch mine,

85
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:25,400
though I do partake occasionally of the holy frop admixture prescribed by my personal physician,

86
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,980
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,140
But like Bob himself said,

88
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,660
I frop that others may live.

89
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,540
And, friends, frop ain't one of those conspiracy street drugs.

90
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,740
Uh-uh, but we'll be talking about frop later, maybe even next week.

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,940
I know, I know y'all want to know what frop really is and how to get you some,

92
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,720
but we're just going to have to listen.

93
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,660
You're going to have to listen real, real close in stereo headphones tonight, friends,

94
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,100
if you even want to gain but an inkling.

95
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,120
Drugs have become an escape for a nation of ignored youth.

96
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,000
Many parents too busy to stop, listen, and love.

97
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,460
.

98
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,980
.

99
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,900
.

100
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,900
Bob said I'm going to give you drugs.

101
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,640
Bob said I'm going to give you pills.

102
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,320
Bob said I'm going to free him from the law.

103
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,320


104
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,860
He's a false flag of the conspiracy.

105
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,900
He's a son of a .

106
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,960
He's a God that sat down.

107
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,220
He's a .

108
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,880
.

109
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,900
.

110
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:42,900


111
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,900
And so she had found the answer to her question by herself.

112
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,240
OK.

113
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,480
Bye.

114
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,280
Here comes Mrs. Darhaugh again in her nice soft dress.

115
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
Hi, Mr. Valium.

116
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,580
Hi.

117
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,220
Well, today, we're going to make sure that everybody feels okay.

118
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,520
That's a really long picnic they're having.

119
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,060
Yes.

120
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,260
They're eating Kool-Aid and pills.

121
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,960
Oh, baby, have a leg.

122
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,560
Yeah.

123
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,760
That's the hour.

124
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,880
Miss Valium.

125
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,980
How are you?

126
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,940
Well, I'm sad today.

127
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,260
Yeah, there's pills.

128
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:21,760
Pills.

129
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,720
Pills.

130
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,680
Pills.

131
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,260
Pills.

132
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:25,540


133
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,140
Pills.

134
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,180
Pills.

135
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:27,820
Pills.

136
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,440
Pills.

137
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,040
Pills.

138
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,280
Pills.

139
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,300
Pills.

140
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,300


141
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,300


142
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,300


143
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,300


144
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,300


145
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,300


146
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,300


147
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,300


148
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,300


149
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,300


150
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,300


151
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,120
Pills.

152
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,140
Pills.

153
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,920
Talking about pills.

154
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,080
Pills.

155
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,080
Pills for the bad and pills for the good and pills for the young and misunderstood.

156
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,040
Yeah.

157
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,680
Pills.

158
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,840
Pills.

159
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,140
Talking about pills now.

160
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,780
Pills.

161
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,460
Pills in my hair.

162
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,200
Pills in my...

163
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,180
Pills in the woods and pills on the rocks, yeah, pills

164
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,580
Pills, we're talking about pills now

165
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,920
Pills, pills always tell me things to do

166
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:20,140
Pills are better friends than you, yeah, pills

167
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Pills, we're talking about pills now

168
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,740
Pills, my friends the pills

169
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,780
Pills, we're talking about pills now

170
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,120
Pills, we're talking about pills now

171
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,060
Pills, we're talking about pills now

172
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,520
More pills

173
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,000
And that's just the sort of thing I was talking about exactly, gentlemen.

174
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,240
Ladies and gentlemen, hello to you in Dallas, Texas.

175
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,640
This is the secret Reverend Bleepo Abernathy speaking to you over the airwaves of your local radio station there,

176
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,720
courtesy of...

177
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:57,880
this is the secret Reverend Bleepo Abernathy speaking to you over the airwaves of your local radio station there, courtesy of...

178
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,480
this is the secret Reverend Bleepo Abernathy speaking to you over the airwaves of your local radio station there, courtesy of...

179
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,660
staying and the Reverend Buck Naked, for which I am glad to present this opportunity to myself to speak at this time.

180
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,100
First of all, I want to say that none of the pills are ever good enough, as you all know.

181
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,320
And as you're out there, you know, you cannot feel anything without some sort of pill.

182
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,160
Now, that pill could be, of course, you know, your average, you know, vitamin or dexatrim or something like that.

183
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,720
Or it can be Jesus. It's any kind of pill that you mention at all.

184
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,020
We don't want to get too specific here, but let's just face it, friends, you're all looking for a pill.

185
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,320
And I don't know. I don't know.

186
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,360
And we're not talking a quart of pills. We're talking a bucket of pills.

187
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,360
Which is sometimes...

188
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,240
Some people relate to half an old-fashioned bathtub full of pills.

189
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,700
Like, sometimes, I don't know how much quarts of pills go for in Dallas right now.

190
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,300
I think in New York, you can get about a half a handful of pills for what, like a pint of pills might cost you in Austin.

191
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,100
Or Chicago.

192
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,040
But we're in Dallas now, so we're talking quarts of pills.

193
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,040
But this is just...

194
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
Heliopters full of pills. These are all legal.

195
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,780
They're not drugs. These are herbs.

196
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,320
They've been smuggled in by Tibetan lamas, which have been working for Bob for centuries.

197
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,460
I heard they put them on the bellies of sea turtles at one point.

198
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,420
They put them in the Atlantic.

199
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,140
They put them on your tongue. They put them on...

200
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,080
They might put them on your nose.

201
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,500
You can put them in your shoes.

202
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,700
And Bob makes the best pills ever. What?

203
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:27,920
He loves me.

204
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,660
Yeah!

205
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,060
Yeah!

206
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,320


207
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,100
Get pills!

208
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,580
Yeah!

209
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,420
Get them!

210
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,400
Get them pills!

211
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,260
Get them pills!

212
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,540
And you feel... you feel wise.

213
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,020
Your heart feels wise. You're buying.

214
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,680
And you know that you're the only one, and the rest of them are wrong, and you're the only one that's right.

215
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,280
And that's how you're supposed to feel, because you got the pills of Bob in you.

216
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,920
That's right.

217
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,240
Possess these children with the fire of thy holy way.

218
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,460
Fill them with the blood.

219
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Fill them with the blood of your passion.

220
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,180
That will enable their weak spirits to move in pursuit of your holy work.

221
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,300
Oh, go on!

222
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,500
Do me in, you bastard cowards!

223
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,040
We don't want to live anyway.

224
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,040
Not in a stinking water like this!

225
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,680
Oh?

226
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,120
And what's so stinking about it?

227
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,920
It's a stinking water because there's no law nor order anymore!

228
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,680
It's a stinking water because it lets the young get under the water!

229
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,260
And the old runs you down!

230
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,220
Oh, there's no water for an old man any longer!

231
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,180
What stuff about water is it at all?

232
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,540
Men on the moon?

233
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,300
And men spinning around the earth?

234
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,480
And there's not no attention paid to earthly law nor order no more?

235
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,980
Oh, oh, dear little lad, I fought for thee.

236
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,520
In the US today, one of every ten high school seniors uses marijuana daily.

237
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,080
Thirty-five percent of all students use drugs at least once a month.

238
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,940
It isn't all the illicit, illegitimate market that's the problem.

239
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,900
We have a panacea in America that is a clear philosophical problem.

240
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
And it's not just the American people that are suffering from it.

241
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,280


242
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,340
The farmer, he got wild.

243
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,620
The bricklayer got plastered.

244
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,000
The mechanic, he got tanked.

245
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,720
And the construction worker got blasted.

246
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:54,380
And Daddy beat up Mommy and broke her collarbone for good luck.

247
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,960
And Daddy beat up Mommy and broke her collarbone for good luck.

248
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,700
And everybody's drunk.

249
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,500
And everybody's wasted.

250
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,780
And everybody's drinking on the job.

251
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,580
The car beast man got crashed.

252
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,280
The janitor got messy.

253
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,980
The taxi driver got smashed.

254
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,980
And the waitress, she got tipsy.

255
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,840
In Kansas City, New York City,

256
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,720
Gravy City, itty bitty city.

257
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,080
Now everybody's drunk.

258
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,860
And everybody's wasted.

259
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,240
And everybody's drinking on the job.

260
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,960
Well, there are a lot of people out there.

261
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,880
There's a whole lot of places that I ain't been.

262
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,480
A whole lot of things that I ain't seen.

263
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,000
A whole lot of things I'll never be.

264
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:09,980
The generation that would change the world is still looking for its car keys.

265
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,960
Love that's in here?

266
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,180
That's probably all I wanna hear.

267
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,960
That's nothing to me.

268
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,780
Security was right

269
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,380
Yeah, the Secret Service got lit

270
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:04,840
The FBI, CIA, D.S.O.I., USA

271
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,060
Everybody's drunk

272
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,880
And everybody's wasted

273
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,180
And everybody's sold

274
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,360
And there's nothing that's gonna change it

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,400
Cause everybody's drunk

276
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,180
And everybody's wasted

277
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,500
And everybody's drinking on the job

278
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:19,340
And everybody's wasted

279
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:46,100
And everybody's wasted

280
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:19,340
And everybody's wasted

281
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:49,120
And everybody's wasted

282
00:17:49,360 --> 00:18:19,340
And everybody's wasted

283
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:49,340
And everybody's wasted

284
00:18:49,360 --> 00:19:19,340
And everybody's wasted

285
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:48,340
And everybody's wasted

286
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:19,340
And everybody's wasted

287
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:28,480
And everybody's wasted

288
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:19,340
And everybody's wasted

289
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,800
And everybody's wasted

290
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,080
And everybody's wasted

291
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,780
And everybody's wasted

292
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,520
And everybody's wasted

293
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,860
And everybody's wasted

294
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,120
And everybody's wasted

295
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,840
And everybody's wasted

296
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,080
And everybody's wasted

297
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,060
And everybody's wasted

298
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,320
And everybody's wasted

299
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,060
And everybody's wasted

300
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,080
And everybody's wasted

301
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,480
And everybody's wasted

302
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,340
And everybody's wasted

303
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,900
And everybody's wasted

304
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,340
And everybody's wasted

305
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,160
Because they've manipulated us to the extent that these educational institutions ain't nothing but tricks.

306
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,240
Why?

307
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,980
Well, I didn't tell you this before, but he's an egg salad addict.

308
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,160
You mean he's hooked on it?

309
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
He's hooked. He's got a chicken on his back.

310
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,840
Yeah, well, too bad for him.

311
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,960
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

312
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,820
As far back as educated men have recorded their history,

313
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,260
veils have been lowered to disclose a vast new reality,

314
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,240
rents in the fabric of man's awareness.

315
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,420
And somewhere in the endless search of the curious mind

316
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,620
lies the next vision, the next key to his infinite capacity.

317
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:45,220
There's reason to believe that incessant stimulation of the reward or pleasure centers of the brain

318
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,800
will lead to a...

319
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,580
a resetting of the pleasure threshold so that ordinary enjoyable things

320
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,480
no longer stimulate that area, or if they do, they aren't effective,

321
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,900
and one can't enjoy ordinary life so that all one has left are the chemicals.

322
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,100
If we keep using drugs the way we are, we're going to go down the chemical dumper.

323
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,920
Well, you look puzzled, Peter.

324
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,300
Oh, then you're still plain Peter Wayne.

325
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,740
But don't worry.

326
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,740
You'll all be crystal clear as soon as you pop.

327
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,140
Awesome.

328
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,500
Consciousness expanding.

329
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,180
Properly induced CE will give a subject full awareness of capabilities never known before.

330
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,940
The doses have been somewhat shorter for me the last time or two.

331
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:53,540
You know I've seen a lot of people walking around with tombstones in their eyes.

332
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,240
But the puts don't care.

333
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,160
Ah, if you live or if you die.

334
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,720
You know, my boy, if it's drugs you want, the old doctor can help you out.

335
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,480
Right this way.

336
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,660
Hey, get your hands off me.

337
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,480
I don't want to leave.

338
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,120
Then roll up your arm and bend over.

339
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,840
Do you want regular or premium?

340
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,360
Oh, this is ridiculous.

341
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,240
You guys are nothing but a pack of cards.

342
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,000
Drink me.

343
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,300
Eat me.

344
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,320
Choke me.

345
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,200
Must be some way out of this.

346
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,700
I'll change the air.

347
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,360
That's what I'll do.

348
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:33,680
Let's see.

349
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,840
What have I got left on the climate control?

350
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,080
Uh, dust storm?

351
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,720
No.

352
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,980
Bet in wilderness?

353
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,940
Land of the pharaohs.

354
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,560
Land of the pharaohs.

355
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,460
That sounds great.

356
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,640
Tots of them.

357
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,660
Land of the pharaohs.

358
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:54,660


359
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:01,660
Tots of them.

360
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,960
Land of the pharaohs.

361
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,980
Land of the pharaohs.

362
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,240
Land of the pharaohs.

363
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,480
Land of the pharaohs.

364
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,460
The man gets共 Suzanne.

365
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,500
Man!

366
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:17,640


367
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:17,640


368
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:17,640


369
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:17,640


370
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,000
The people, the ceiling, come down!

371
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,540
And the table, it's always deeper and deeper.

372
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,920
And the words, and their meaning!

373
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,740
Mama! Papa!

374
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:45,960
The madness is a journey to hell.

375
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,360
The brain is ill.

376
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,200
And it's weak.

377
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,720
In ever-changing dimensions.

378
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,600
Where the evil nights live.

379
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,200
God!

380
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,560
And the damn...

381
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,980
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

382
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,760
The pusher!

383
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:27,560
...the world there, and you still found the time to make the nicest peccary pie in all of Lombok.

384
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,680
Oh, darling, I'll remember when the least of your problems used to put you right to sleep!

385
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,360
Oh, not anymore, Matt!

386
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:41,460
Today's modern-now-a-go-go woman just pops these simple little pills called Angadream.

387
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,700
Swell demonstration, eh, Sarge?

388
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,200
It's routine.

389
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,000
Maybe.

390
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,860
But if the chief ever caught me taking these pills, he'd snap my head off.

391
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,440
Here, try one of mine.

392
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,100
Oh, yeah?

393
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,540
Yeah, the chief himself's been on these for a week, and he's a chain...

394
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:54,720
Good.

395
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,920
Open your mouth, Jeff.

396
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,420
No, I don't like pills.

397
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,940
It really does help.

398
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,180
Mom!

399
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,460
Take the trouble, I'm falling asleep.

400
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,160
Jesus, what a wonderful problem.

401
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:11,780
The haunting reality is that any one of these addicts, prostitutes, or runaways could be your child.

402
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,740
There was me.

403
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,880
That is Alex.

404
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,700
And my three droogs.

405
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,140
And their enemy is the God-centered family.

406
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,360
An 18-year-old teenager named Diane, living here in Hollywood, took her life.

407
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,340
She was under the influence of LSD.

408
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,980
She had experimented with it as a result of peer pressure from her friends.

409
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,420
This young lady had everything in the world to live for.

410
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,160
She had just won a Grammy award.

411
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,240
She was signed for a television series.

412
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:53,440
Today, drugs and alcohol have replaced baseball and football as the national pastimes.

413
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,060
We are producing a country without a future.

414
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,140
Any punk will tell you there is no future.

415
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,500
They don't think about it.

416
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,440
They wallow in this now operating theater.

417
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,760
They only have the present.

418
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,940
I can't hold my breath any longer.

419
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,200
In front of the policeman?

420
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,280
I have no choice but to go with him.

421
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,660
See what he has to say.

422
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,480
I'll minister to him.

423
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,320
I've tasted the dew on the lips of sweet death herself.

424
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,480
You were right, Paul, when you said that someday we'd all live in the treetops.

425
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:55,560
like apes, like monkeys, like rodents, like vermin, like the squirrel that has found itself electrocuted.

426
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,680
On my electric fence, the one I use to keep Zandy inside, and the dogs, the squirrels can't take the voltage.

427
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:14,160
They fry, they die convulsing, suffocate, because their lungs can't take in another breath.

428
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,380
But yet, their brains are aware of the terror.

429
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:31,500
My little boy walked out one morning, he said, Daddy, is the squirrel sleeping? Is the squirrel sick?

430
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,360
I said, No!

431
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,760
My child, the squirrel's not sleeping, the squirrel's not sick. The squirrel is dead.

432
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:46,920
The squirrel will not come back, the squirrel can be fixed. It turned into a skeleton. A squirrel skeleton.

433
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:57,740
My son said, Father, I want to be like that squirrel. I too want to be a skeleton.

434
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,940
You can't arrest me, officer. I'm not drunk.

435
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,660
I might be half-ass drunk, but I'm not drunk.

436
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:03,660


437
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,300
So eee!

438
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,460
Half-ass drunk.

439
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,200
Hell, you know who you are.

440
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,540
You know who I am.

441
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,420
When you got a hangover and it's all hung over back.

442
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,140
Shaded in your girlfriend's car.

443
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,460
Half-ass drunk.

444
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,020
Just you and me.

445
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,620
Sergeant Carter haircut, Gomer Pyle hookups, living off a LSD.

446
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,180
Half-ass drunk.

447
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,880
And I'm feeling blue.

448
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:59,680
Well, a flood come in and it washed away my din and my water bill's still past due.

449
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,980
Half-ass drunk.

450
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,440
I called my boss.

451
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,160
I ain't feeling quite right.

452
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,960
Well, it can't be Monday, cause I don't remember Sunday and my hands are slipping Saturday night.

453
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,360
Sweet love, Saul.

454
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,920
Half-ass drunk.

455
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,540
And I'm drunk as sh-

456
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,460
Well, I used to have a job, but I'm sick of getting robbed.

457
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,460
So I finally just up and quit.

458
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,800
And on my head I fit.

459
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,400
Half-ass drunk.

460
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,240
And on my head feels odd.

461
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,360
Well, baby needs food, but his daddy needs a lewd brother.

462
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,060
Baby better find himself a job.

463
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,340
Half-ass drunk.

464
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,880
Half-ass drunk.

465
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,580
Half-ass drunk.

466
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,640
Half-ass drunk.

467
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,220
And I'm having fun.

468
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,120
Stopped on a hill, cause I had to take a pill, but I couldn't quite find my tongue.

469
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:37,380
have a hash bunk hell i can see well they said the light was red now a couple of folks well there was

470
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:43,020

471
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,520

472
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,460

473
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,280
through his nose you know and that was the only way he could breathe and well there's this one

474
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:03,200

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,400

477
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:21,380
find pieces of the same person on the front and back of the same car i mean it i just don't

478
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,520
understand they ought to run some kind of scientific test i don't even see how that could

479
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,720
even happen

480
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,200

daddy he's been gone for so long

488
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:54,660
he's gone fourteen days

489
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,260
i could never see him again

490
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,260


491
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,880
could have been gone for more

492
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,580
held up in an intensive air war

493
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,340
lying on the floor

494
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,340
i was gone for all those days

495
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,860
but i was not all alone

496
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,240
i made friends with a lot of people

497
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:32,280
in the danger zone

498
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:41,580
see my lonely life i'm cold

499
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,620
i see it every day

500
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,160
see my own life my dead soul

501
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,880
since i've gone away

502
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,240
i've been a fool

503
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,240


504
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,240


505
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,240


506
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,240


507
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,880
i don't think of her

508
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,140
as easier

509
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,600
and the world

510
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,500
company

511
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:05,500


512
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,520
marvel

513
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,240
you'll imagine how ró速

514
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,080
bro

515
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:35,320
Heroin was legal, but possession of coffee was punishable by up to 50 years in jail.

516
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,960
In other words, friends, think of a world where you could run down to the nearest convenience store

517
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,420
just about any time of day or night and purchase any amount of liquid heroin you wanted.

518
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,480
A whole bottle of heroin would be about three bucks.

519
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,860
Or you could go down to a heroin den and sit and shoot up with all your shooting buddies

520
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,360
until about 2 a.m.

521
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,140
Then you'd get on the expressway and drive home.

522
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,540
Or, for that matter, folks, think about in the heroin world,

523
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:12,300
where imagine that the authorities making heroin so much a part of their business world

524
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,820
that nobody closed a big business deal without having a few shots of smack with the client.

525
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:24,180
When there'd be billboards all over the roads for the coolest brands of heroin

526
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,640
showing beautiful models.

527
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,420
Skin popping next to a waterfall.

528
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,940
And on TV, well, not only would there be all these ads showing your favorite sports heroes

529
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,260
shooting their favorite brand of heroin,

530
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,140
but in any party scene, any scene of any TV show

531
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,360
where people were shown relaxing or having a good time,

532
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,100
well, they're always taking just a few little sniffs of smack.

533
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,540
Now, the leaders of a world like that would have to be pretty insane, right?

534
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,620
I mean, it'd be obvious that the leaders themselves were not only heroin users

535
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,420
but stood to gain quite a bit from the whole population,

536
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:09,620
aside from a few anti-heroin fanatics leaning on this substance to relax.

537
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,240
But let's take it a step further, friends.

538
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,700
Imagine if these people made coffee illegal.

539
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,080
Because they said it was addicting.

540
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,040
And it led to harder stuff like espresso.

541
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,840
But yet, untold, millions of people had been drinking coffee for thousands of years.

542
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,820
And no one had ever OD'd.

543
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,960
You drink it, and it sharpens you up a bit, and then later you crash a bit.

544
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,640
But it was so illegal that the smugglers are getting fantastically rich

545
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,660
having contraband coffee beans flown up from South America.

546
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,440
And there'd be this whole subculture of bean heads.

547
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:50,240
People that were into coffee, and partly as a rebellion against the establishment.

548
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:55,660
And the whole reason that coffee led to harder stuff like espresso or NyQuil

549
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:00,800
was because to buy coffee, you had to go to a coffee dealer's house,

550
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,220
a pusher's house, where you'd encounter people who were espresso users.

551
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:10,900
And on top of that, a one-ounce bag of coffee beans would cost like a hundred bucks

552
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,800
just for an ordinary Maxwell house grade.

553
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,920
And people'd be arrested and spend their whole lives in jail,

554
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,440
maybe even be executed for using coffee, which is relatively harmless,

555
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,840
while this whole planet of junkies was going scot-free.

556
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,080
And President Reagan would be up there.

557
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,060
You'd see him in the news at, you know, partying with world leaders,

558
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,880
all of them snorting a bit of smack and shooting up.

559
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,900
Imagine what a horrible, topsy-turvy world that would be, friends,

560
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,660
where they made a powerful, central nervous system depressant,

561
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,460
not only legal, but glamorous.

562
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:52,780
While an organically grown, harmless bean off of a bush

563
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,840
could wreck your life only because of coffee.

564
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,860
Because of the laws against it.

565
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:04,180
But, but, we're an enlightened people here.

566
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,900
So just forget that little allegory, you know.

567
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,540
Let's not get depressing about it, friends.

568
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:20,420
Let's just lean back with a good, stiff drink and forget it.

569
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,120
Something was missing.

570
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,280
It was my pills.

571
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,280
I wonder if that guy Bob took them.

572
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,000
I guess I better run over there.

573
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,880
We're down this dark river.

574
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:34,680
Doug, Doug.

575
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:34,900
Yeah.

576
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,680
Oh, yeah, okay, what?

577
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,300
Down here.

578
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,380
Oh, okay.

579
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,200
Where are we going?

580
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,120
The dark river.

581
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,920
Where are we going?

582
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,460
Tunnel ride.

583
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,320
Don't worry.

584
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,140
Just, like, hand the guy a quarter.

585
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,460
That guy took all my pills.

586
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,680
Yeah, well, don't worry about those pills.

587
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,280
You don't need those pills anymore.

588
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,800
Okay.

589
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:55,840


590
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,520
Well, I still got my tape recorder and my camera.

591
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,220
You don't need those anymore, either.

592
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:00,900
Give them to me.

593
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,720
Come on.

594
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,060
Whoa, look out.

595
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,560
Whoa.

596
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,140
Doug.

597
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:15,080
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

598
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,980
Kind of young, kind of wild.

599
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:23,200
Charlie's enormous nose will get saw white.

600
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,600
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

601
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:24,740
Charlie's enormous nose will get saw white.

602
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,840
A girl got a nose.

603
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,520
She's got a very large nose.

604
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,260
But it's all white.

605
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:35,140
She once was okay, but she's been blowing it quite a bit.

606
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,380
Of course, our friends are extra large.

607
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:47,780
And we can only assume as to how she's been choosing it.

608
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,180
Charlie's enormous nose will get saw white.

609
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,840
The girl got a nose.

610
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,500
She's got a very large nose.

611
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,360
But it's all white.

612
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,780
She got stuff all around the home where she was just moving.

613
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,380
They call it the nose.

614
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,580
They call it the nose.

615
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,640
They call it the nose.

616
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:20,720
And when it finally runs away, I guess you'll probably drive a truck in.

617
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,960
They used to call it the nose.

618
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,060
They call it the nose.

619
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,280
They call it the nose.

620
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:33,360
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

621
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,880
Kind of young, kind of dead.

622
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,880
Charlie's disgusting brain will get saw black.

623
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,280
The girl got a very dead brain.

624
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,040
It won't come back.

625
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,860
She used to convey, but then she took an extra hit.

626
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,820
Of course, our friends are extra large.

627
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,020
Our extra jump.

628
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:04,820
And they were terribly excited while they watched her do it again.

629
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,620
Charlie's disgusting brain will get saw black.

630
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,060
The girl got a very dead brain.

631
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,760
It won't come back.

632
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:22,480
She got dirt all around the home where they dunk her boxing.

633
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,800
They call it the nose.

634
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,080
They call it the grave.

635
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,360
They call it the grave.

636
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:32,920
They call it the grave.

637
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,800
Riches go to places and in for a totally bullshittin'.

638
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,520
That's why they call it the grave.

639
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,740
They call it the grave.

640
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,680
They call it the grave.

641
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:09,160
And all around at the side of the grave stood Charlie's friends who could not save this stupid girl from the way she behaved.

642
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:20,260
But among the mortars and the frowders, a cry for her ain't enough.

643
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,080
And among the mortars.

644
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,660
And along the street.

645
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,040
And along the street.

646
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,560
And along the street.

647
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,580
No, I ain't got a grave.

648
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,100
No, I ain't got a grave.

649
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,120
No, I ain't got a grave.

650
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,460
No, I ain't got a grave.

651
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,620
No, I ain't got a grave.

652
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,680
I'm going to be a...

653
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,340
Birdland!

654
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,240
The brother wrote on the rotted baseball wall

655
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,400
Right next to the sign that read, please don't pee in our hall

656
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:18,540
And then he reached in the slide and he pulled out the tiny transparent bed

657
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,980
The one filled with the chopped white powder the junkies call skag

658
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,800
He sighed as he hit the big vein in his arm

659
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,160
And his mind took off on Bird's musical charm

660
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,780
Now Brother Bird was blowing embracable youth

661
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,600
Like only he was hip to his secret he knew

662
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:42,660
Wow, the brother said as he slipped up into a nod

663
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,860
Bird sure eases the pain

664
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,720
Now I want to hear Brother John Coltrane

665
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,600
He tried to get up but his body wouldn't move

666
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,560
His mind told him his senses were in a groove

667
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,660
Finally Bird withdrew and train took over in a spiritual debut

668
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:05,840
His heart began to pound as he dug the bar sound

669
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,260
Damn, Bird and Train, show knock was down

670
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,580
And then he looked up and saw that the box wasn't even on

671
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,700
And it was damn near dawn

672
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,960
I'm high

673
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:42,460
I'm havin' it, and actin' like a little bitch

674
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,860
That've made me get up out here

675
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:43,900
Will it last for seven days

676
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:43,900


677
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,120
Tired of getting it

678
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,380
To the point, and I ain't got a clock

679
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:47,840
FRANito 1 году, raman

680
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,220
Technical problems and prevention

681
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:48,260
Win the show, to you I say

682
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,940
Why been hard work when I lost my spirit already?

683
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,580
Can't be any use

684
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:58,880
I go, I go, I go, I go, shit, give me some dough, so I can buy me some smack, and get

685
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:06,040
back on the fast track, he slipped off into a nod, and the sounds became odd, and he could

686
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:12,040
no longer hear train or bird, he could only hear the loud unspoken word, get back nigga,

687
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:18,020
you're black bro, but I'm beautiful he said, and then he suddenly realized that he was

688
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:24,580
dead, and he was being lowered into the ground, and couldn't utter a single sound, and his

689
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:30,840
family and friends were standing around, with their heads hanging down, crying and

690
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:38,020
carrying on, cause their beautiful black song was gone, no, I'm not dead, his mind said,

691
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:46,200
don't bury me, cause I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I

692
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:53,820
didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I

693
00:47:53,820 --> 00:48:04,500
didn't, and then he realized, O.D., O.D., O.D., O.D.

694
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,880
I know Mr. Green.

695
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,280
I know.

696
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:25,620
Do you?

697
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,060
I know.

698
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,620
I know.

699
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:48,720
Go to it, boys.

700
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:56,740
But this young girl, 14 years of age, in the eighth grade, recently took 50 pills to take her life.

701
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,260
She has slipped her wrist and she's been into heavy drugs.

702
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,820
I've got super dynamic overdrive.

703
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,480
I'm operating in 10,000 revolutions.

704
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,080
My motor is being preserved because I'm operating in supernatural overdrive.

705
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,540
I am certain you know what reality is.

706
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,840
No matter what.

707
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,000
What I do to change it.

708
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,700
Normal I remain.

709
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:29,720
Normal can be just as bad as riding in a wheelchair.

710
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,020
Today, serious heresy is a deviant state of consciousness.

711
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:46,800
Not so much deviant opinions as having a kind of experience.

712
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,020
But I think it's a very important state of consciousness.

713
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,680
Which is different from regular experience.

714
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,840
We are taught what experiences are permissible.

715
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,440
And therefore, if a person has so-called strange experiences,

716
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,720
and endeavors to communicate these experiences to other people,

717
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,480
he is looked at in a very odd way and asked,

718
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,560
Are you feeling all right?

719
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:17,020
Because people feel distinctly uncomfortable.

720
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,500
When they realize that they're in the presence of someone

721
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,620
who's experiencing the world in a rather different way from themselves.

722
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:27,700
They call in question as to whether this person is indeed human.

723
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,800
They look like a human being.

724
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:35,280
But because the state of experience is so different,

725
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,900
you wonder whether they really are.

726
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:42,020
And in rather the same way, in a very everyday kind of circumstance,

727
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,020
when you're sitting in a bar drinking,

728
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,160
and you find you have a drunk next to you.

729
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,100
And he turns to you and says,

730
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,740
I say,

731
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:56,760
And you sort of move your stool a little way away from this man.

732
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,300
Because he's become, in some way, what we mean by non-human.

733
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,260
We expect a high of about 65 degrees tomorrow.

734
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,440
Increasingly cloudy skies once again, with some rain in the forecast.

735
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,880
So I found this little dish, crawled in, and I must say I'm happy.

736
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,060
Good night, boys.

737
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:14,400
Good night, boys.

738
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,540
Bob's got you hooked.

739
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,440
Bob's got a monkey on your back.

740
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,260
Bob's doing something spooky again, ain't he?

741
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,320
That's what you're listening to.

742
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:26,960
Yeah.

743
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:29,060
Yeah.

744
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,460
This is the kind of Bob that comes up out of the shadows.

745
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,340
This is the kind of Bob that follows you home.

746
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:41,380
This is the kind of Bob that calls you up in the middle of the night and hangs up and sees you.

747
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,100
Hey, Doug, let's kill Bob.

748
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:43,700
You're welcome.

749
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:44,880
Yeah, hell yeah.

750
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,340
Yeah, hell yeah.

751
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,240
Yeah, hell yeah.

752
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,020
I have an espresso machine in there.

753
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:50,620
Espresso.

754
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,440
Now, what do you do?

755
00:52:51,700 --> 00:53:01,760
I feel the need to express myself into a cup and then pour it back into the spot in which I want to pour it into my shoes.

756
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,360
And I will be reborn again.

757
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,080
A man of caffeine.

758
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,900
Y'all get your little whiskey, get your little snort, get your little reefer, get your little...

759
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,720
You serious?

760
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,940
You're playing people.

761
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,720
People that's fixing to kill you puts the drugs out here for you.

762
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,380
How many of y'all know that?

763
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:17,920
Let me see your hands.

764
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,540
Some of y'all got your hand up and got a reefer in your pocket.

765
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,620
And we sat in the Corova Milk Bar trying to make up our razzle-dolls what to do with the evening.

766
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,580
The Corova Milk Bar sold Milk Plus.

767
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:37,400
Milk Plus, Bellacet, or Synthamesc, or Drencrum, which is what we were drinking.

768
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,380
This would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.

769
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,340
And they got your hands so messed up everybody got in their hide and don't like nobody else's.

770
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:55,660
Yeah, the whiskey drinkers have always looked down on the wine-o's.

771
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,660
Reefer smokers now got an attitude about whiskey drinkers.

772
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:07,040
All at once the cocaine snorters think they're more sophisticated than the reefer smokers.

773
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,580
And the coffee drinkers hate them all.

774
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,740
A lot of the evangelicals...

775
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,460
The local leaders seem to have forgotten that.

776
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,780
Now we understand the drunk.

777
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,880
We know what's the matter with him and it'll wear off.

778
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:27,200
But when quite unaccountably a person gives a representation that he's suddenly got the feeling

779
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,720
that he's living in backwards time.

780
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,680
Or that everybody seems to be separated from him by a huge sheet of glass.

781
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,800
Or that, um...

782
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,240
He...

783
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:51,120
He's suddenly seeing everything in unbelievably vivid, detailed, moving colors.

784
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,360
You say, well that's not normal.

785
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,580
Therefore there must be something wrong with you.

786
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,380
We like you and should ignore you.

787
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,720
But instead...

788
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,380
Makes...

789
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,520
Oh god, it hurts. My headaches come back.

790
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:10,360
Oh!

791
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,100
Oh!

792
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:13,420
Oh!

793
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:14,780
Oh!

794
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,720
If his headaches keep up...

795
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,040
Fuck, I'll go down in the medicine fish hole.

796
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,020
I'll go in the medicine fish hole.

797
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,820
If I have to.

798
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,820
That's not even a case.

799
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,520
Oh.

800
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,400
Do you have any aspirin?

801
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,020
No, I'm Bob.

802
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,840
No, I'm Bob.

803
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,740
No, I'm Bob.

804
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:37,800


805
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:37,800


806
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:37,800


807
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,620
No, I'm Bob.

808
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:38,760
...

809
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:40,820
AHHHHHHHHH.

810
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,420
Team lavaed states dude reading comments

811
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:43,920
Wooooo do it!

812
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:53,420
A light from the sky settled over them trees

813
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,360
It left this wire in my head that customized me

814
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:08,420
The wire in my head, it advises me

815
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:16,000
Better living through bio-circuitry

816
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:31,380
The wire in my head has found me new friends

817
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,380
They meet at the airport where the old

818
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,400
Firefighters go

819
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,500
And the freeway ends

820
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:47,560
And we lay down our lives for the power it sends

821
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:54,500
I got a wire in my head and so do my friends

822
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:01,080
The wire, a big business opportunity

823
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:08,400
The wire benefits me

824
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,580
Financially

825
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:17,160
The wire in my head gets me good deals

826
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:24,160
I drive a real solid car and I eat fancy meals

827
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:32,500
You can bet I'd kill any sucker who squeals

828
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,180
I got a wire in my head and I like hell

829
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:46,980
I got a wire in my head and I'd install it for free

830
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,880
Better living through surgery

831
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,960
I got a wire in my head

832
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:06,720
I got a wire in my head and I like hell

833
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:35,980
I got a wire in my head and I like hell

834
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,900
And that's on Paris Records.

835
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,140
Yes, Paris Records presents Made Up in Texas.

836
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,920
Wirehead Conspiracy.

837
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
You can pick that one up here and there.

838
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,900
Oh, yes, dear friends.

839
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,000
You know, time is running out.

840
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,980
It's so sad that time has to run out on the hour of slack.

841
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,340
You only get that hour of slack a week.

842
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,980
And it is a shame.

843
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,280
Ain't it a shame?

844
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,660
But you can learn more about the hour of slack

845
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,540
at everything else.

846
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:06,700
Everything else.

847
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:13,320
that has been played on here by checking out www.subgenius.com

848
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:24,580
or write to Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

849
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,600
This has been Hour of Slack number 788,

850
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:32,180
a rerun of Hour of Slack number 51 from 1986.

851
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:36,420
The music in the background is from Zumbo Fropland,

852
