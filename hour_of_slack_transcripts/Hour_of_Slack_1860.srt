1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:18,380
Ah yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang helping to answer the question, what is slack?

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:25,140
Now, alongside your normal everyday life, there's another life, one in which you have slack.

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:35,680
Man was born with original slack, yet most so-called civilized peoples don't believe in it, and their most learned scholars cannot even comprehend it.

5
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,280
And that, my friend, is why the idiot is closer to the divine.

6
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:47,960
Slack is something for nothing, that unreachable goal, that perfect hamburger towards which all seekers strive.

7
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,240
And to seek it, one must travel the path of least resistance and learn to try, never to try.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,020
Now.

9
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,900
Now, my friend, slack can neither be created nor destroyed.

10
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,020
If you don't have slack, it's somewhere it shouldn't be.

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,580
Who's got it, friend?

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:11,100
If you don't know, then, my friend, your only sane move would be to repent, quit your job, and slack off before you're too far gone.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,940
Praise Bob.

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,460
Help me, somebody.

15
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,640
Let there be slack.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,780
It's chaotic.

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,780
It's chaotic.

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,780
It's chaotic.

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,220
It's chaotic.

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,080
It's chaotic.

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,340
It's chaotic.

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,560
It's chaotic.

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,740
It's chaos.

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:34,740


25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,240
Chaos.

26
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,920
것처럼

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,360
the

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,280
yeah

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,740
Yeah, Old呂

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,040
You

31
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,620
Hey cats

32
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,080
Let's listen to me.

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,800
There's a place down in Texas where the hip people meet.

34
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,940
They got lots of slack.

35
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,520
Come along, you will see.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,580
It's the place called the Church of the Subgenie.

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,600
Yeah.

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,460
That's right, ladies.

39
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,340
You want to live forever?

40
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,880
You gotta sleep with Bob.

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:00,580
But hey, after all, isn't there a little Bob in all of us?

42
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,260
The place called the Church of the Subgenie.

43
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,940
Bob.

44
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,460
Bob.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,560
Bob.

46
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,900
Bob.

47
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,160
Bob.

48
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,520
Bob.

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:36,640
Bob.

50
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,060
Bob.

51
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:39,600
Bob.

52
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:39,680
Bob.

53
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,480
Those other religions, they want 10% of your income right off the top.

54
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,680
They want you to provide for them in your will.

55
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,240
They want you to pressure your government for billion dollar contributions.

56
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,620
They want you to double your taxes so that they don't have to pay any.

57
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,260
And what does Bob ask for?

58
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,440
30 lousy bucks.

59
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,620
They're the ones with the extravagant cathedrals, the lush synagogues, the giant mosques.

60
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,180
And what do we have?

61
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,080
One hour a week on noncommercial radio.

62
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,660
One hour a week.

63
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:19,660


64
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:19,660


65
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:19,660


66
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:19,660


67
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,520
Now, forgive me if I go out on a limb here, but doesn't that sound just a little lopsided?

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,660
Of course not.

69
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,620
It sounds a lot lopsided.

70
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,060
But we got something they don't have.

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,720
It's called slack.

72
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,780
And I don't mean the artificial slack they try to market for a profit.

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,280
Hey, folks, play the lottery and win free slack.

74
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:43,680
Uh-uh.

75
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,160
I'm talking about real slack.

76
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,900
Internal slack.

77
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:48,700
Slack.

78
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,740
Slack from within.

79
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,720
The kind that feeds on itself like a breeder reactor.

80
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,240
It radiates a warm, fuzzy glow that lights up our lives.

81
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,200
It's an inner peace they will never know.

82
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,020
And therein lies the basic difference in our religious philosophies.

83
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,740
They stress pain, suffering, and sacrifice because on the outside they have everything,

84
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,240
but on the inside they have nothing.

85
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,680
They're morally bankrupt.

86
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,420
Empty shells.

87
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,640
Just poor, pathetic souls tormented by inner demons of guilt and self-loathing.

88
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,060
But we Sagini, we are the exact opposite.

89
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:39,180
While on the outside we have so little, on the inside we have everything.

90
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,840
And that's why we're smiling and Bob Dobbs is smirking.

91
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,800
Because we're rich with slack.

92
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,680
Slack.

93
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,260
And for all their money, it's not for sale.

94
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,840
Herein is the word of Bob.

95
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,760
Praise Bob.

96
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,220
Amen.

97
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,840
1, 2, 3, 4.

98
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,720
All the way up, man.

99
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,060
Four.

100
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,740
Five.

101
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,160
Six.

102
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,160


103
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,260
Eight.

104
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,940
Nine.

105
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,180
Ten.

106
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,680
11.

107
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


108
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


109
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


110
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


111
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


112
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


114
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


115
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


116
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


117
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


118
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


119
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


120
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


121
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


122
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,680


123
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,260
12.

124
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,460
13.

125
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,180
14.

126
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,320


127
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,540
16.

128
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,260
17.

129
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,260


130
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,260


131
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,260


132
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,260


133
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,960
22.

134
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:39,660
23.

135
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:39,860
24.

136
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,640
25.

137
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:40,680
26.

138
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,040
27.

139
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,320


140
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,320


141
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,740
30.

142
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:42,740


143
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:42,740


144
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,060
33.

145
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,480
34.

146
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,320
35.

147
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,160
36.

148
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,540
37.

149
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:47,740
38.

150
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:47,760
39.

151
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,500
40.

152
00:06:59,340 --> 00:06:59,820
41.

153
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,400


154
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,440
43.

155
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,440


156
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,080
45.

157
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,540
46.

158
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:01,920
47.

159
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,260
48.

160
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,220
49.

161
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:03,740
50.

162
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:03,740


163
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,040
52.

164
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,220
53.

165
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:05,220


166
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,100
55.

167
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,280
56.

168
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:06,900
57.

169
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,240
58.

170
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,240


171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,480
60.

172
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:08,540
61.

173
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:08,560


174
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,080
63.

175
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,260
63.

176
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:10,940
64.

177
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,760
65.

178
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,260
67.

179
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,260


180
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,660
67.

181
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,020
68.

182
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,560
69.

183
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:21,560


184
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,500
71.

185
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:22,980
72.

186
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,560


187
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,180
74.

188
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,180


189
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,180


190
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,180


191
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,180


192
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,200
78.

193
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,380


194
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:25,540


195
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:25,580


196
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:25,860
82.

197
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,280
83.

198
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,580

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,840

200
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:29,840


201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000


202
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,260
87.

203
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,260


204
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,280

205
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,440
88.

206

207
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,800

208
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,540
91.

209
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,640
92.

210
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:42,640


211
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,820
92.

212
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,180
93.

213
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


214
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


215
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


216
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


217
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


218
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


219
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


220
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


221
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


222
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


223
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


224
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,180


225
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,660
90.

226
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,840
91.

227
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,100
91.

228
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,340
90.

229
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,240
82.

230
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,240


231
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,920
63.

232
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:03,960
93.

233
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,680
84.

234
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,660
87.

235
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:07,820
88.

236
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,760
93.

237
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:10,880
84.

238
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,160
95.

239
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,160


240
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,040
Take you up

241
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,780
It looks like Johnny's gonna give me up

242
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,360
Knocked down to the ground

243
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,760
And kicked in the dirt

244
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,020
You're a coward

245
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,540
And this is shit

246
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,060
Johnny Garland is still the guy

247
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,640
And that's the look the other way

248
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,080
Johnny Garland

249
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,200
Is still the guy

250
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,900
Johnny Garland is still the guy

251
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,660
And that's the look the other way

252
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,960
Johnny Garland

253
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,000
Is still the guy

254
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,140
This isn't a song about school children

255
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,580
It's not a song about Johnny

256
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,280
This is a song about a class struggle

257
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,740
This song is about the haves and the have-nots

258
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,680
You know, when you're a have-not

259
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,820
You rip off the haves with everything you can

260
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,480
And when you're a

261
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,980
You rip off the haves with everything you can

262
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,560
When you're a have

263
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,580
A have

264
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,400
You exploit the have-nots for every

265
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,200
Lever you can get from them

266
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,020
For as little amount of money as possible

267
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,560
Yeah

268
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:20,400
Yeah

269
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,300
That's it

270
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,820
That's why Johnny got robbed

271
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,040
That's why

272
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,040
Boys would be boys and boys can't be cruel

273
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,820
Johnny shouldn't take his valuables to school

274
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,600
Boys have hope and boys have heart

275
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,080
Johnny and his money gonna have to pound

276
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,860
Johnny's penis was with a cricket bat

277
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,620
Johnny's wallet was a little fat

278
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,460
Now his broken body lays on the ground

279
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,020
The Bible reads, you'll never find

280
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,860
Johnny Garland is still the guy

281
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,460
And that's the look the other way

282
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,160
Johnny Garland is still the guy

283
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,760
Johnny Garland is still the guy

284
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,500
The head has to look the other way

285
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,780
Johnny Garland in School Today

286
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,360
Johnny Garland

287
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,540
He's still there

288
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,580
Johnny Garland

289
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,580
Johnny Garland

290
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,640
Johnny Garland

291
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,740
Johnny Garland

292
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,680
Johnny Garland

293
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,820
Johnny Garland

294
00:10:36,820 --> 00:11:00,060
Oh, my God.

295
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:14,860
The Swingin' Love Corpses, dear friends, live at Off-Broadway on May 11th, 1991.

296
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,540
Today, however, is October 18th, 2002.

297
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,880
And at least it is in my time here in recording past.

298
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,460
And this is Hour of Slack number 860.

299
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,640
Now, friends, before the Swingin' Love Corpses,

300
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,320
we heard Papa Joe Mama preaching.

301
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,120
And before that, a place called Church of the Subgenius.

302
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,000
And I can't remember who did that.

303
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,640
That and other pieces in this show are from ancient hours of Slack,

304
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,760
taped off the radio by Dr. Humdinger.

305
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,840
Praise Dr. Humdinger.

306
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,700
Taped them off the radio back in the day

307
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,820
and turned them into 13 CDs of his favorites,

308
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,640
which he gave me at X-Day,

309
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,620
which are easy for me to pull for this show,

310
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,680
instead of going back to the original master tapes,

311
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,260
which I don't even know which ones they are.

312
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,920
And this, friends, is what we call Subgenius Progress.

313
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,560
Suppose someone cried,

314
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,060
Halt!

315
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,660
Stop this progress!

316
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,700
Suppose I shouted to the world,

317
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,180
Make an end to this progress.

318
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:27,960
I could talk.

319
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,860
Talk.

320
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,500
Radio is everywhere.

321
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,380
This modern world is full of voices.

322
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,620
And a master craft is everywhere.

323
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:34,620


324
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,800
And I have the right to talk.

325
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,820
But will they listen to you?

326
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,660
They'll listen just then.

327
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,420
If I shout,

328
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,500
Arise!

329
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,260
Awake!

330
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,960
Stop this progress before it is too late!

331
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,800
You want all the marvels cause you're not supposed to be wrong.

332
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,860
Your ass will be in trouble when Big Daddy comes home.

333
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,840
You give them all to him, then how you want them back?

334
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,920
The guides of the master are performed by a hack.

335
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,020
Was it you who said to him that it was okay?

336
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,240
You bought yourself security by selling your rights away?

337
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,540
Was it you proclaiming there are only shades of gray?

338
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,600
What will you do now?

339
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,460
You think that you're in your own grave?

340
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,900
The life you took for granted, is there anything left to save?

341
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,840
You put it out of your mind, you chicken-cheeked tea-save,

342
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,380
That the fact of the matter is, A equals A.

343
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,980
Big Daddy's gonna drag you and beat you to the club.

344
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,060
The one that you gave him, saying, I don't need it, bub.

345
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,120
A heavy price to pay for an apartment and a meal.

346
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,300
What difference does it make if everything's unreal?

347
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,800
Was it you who said that he could kiss your ass?

348
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,840
Not if he's falling for the con, why not give it a try?

349
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,540
Now you find yourself kissing your own ass.

350
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:54,940
Goodbye!

351
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,440
Bon voyage!

352
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,940
Have a nice trip!

353
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,620
You were such a damn fool!

354
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,160
You lost your grip!

355
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,820
What the hell does it take,

356
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,840
To get you to awaken?

357
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,180
No matter what you say,

358
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,840
A equals A equals A equals A equals A!

359
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:53,500
Black is black, white is white, day is day, night is night.

360
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,420
Nature is what it is, regardless of what you would like.

361
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,960
Man, I'm sick of your nonsense.

362
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,140
Go take a hike!

363
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,460
And follow me!

364
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,200
This isn't the Christmas I brought in my life

365
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,480
And on this mountain did I go

366
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,140
Just to really get to know you

367
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,140


368
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,140


369
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,820
Never, ever time to ĩ

370
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,400
Stop talking too much!

371

ZOOGS RIFT

385
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,060
ZOOGS RIFT dear friends

386
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
starting with this show I'm going to play

387
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,120

00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,140
order and that song was

390
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,740
A equals A

391
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,240
this is coming off of a

392
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,620
30th anniversary

393
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,620
2 CDR set

394
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,740
that has 175

395
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,700
ZOOGS RIFT

396
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,160
songs from 1971

397
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,320
to 2001

398
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,520
the great, great ZOOGS RIFT

399
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,080
and now friends a word

400
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,440
from Reverend Tesla Coyle

401
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,240
there is

402
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,160
concern and discussion this morning that

403
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,300
maybe hypnosis is a shorter range

404
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,900
weapon the Washington area

405
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,880
sniper may have used it in his last shooting

406
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,020
Monday night police may have used more

407
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,060
than one vehicle and or two shooters

408
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,000
in previous attacks but a

409
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,980
witness to the seven corner shootings is using

410
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,980
cult AR-15 or Ruger

411
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,040
Mini 14 what does it mean and

412
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,040
how does that whole scenario lay out to you

413
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,060
where's Tim Harvey

414
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,740
Mick Oswald when we

415
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,400
made him

416
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,000
I was trying to conflagute

417
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,040
those names together too where is

418
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,660
he though now that we truly need him

419
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,460
he's at sniper school

420
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:07,960
I think

421
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,560
don't

422
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:11,960
leg up

423
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,200
the suburban area that

424
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,260
no we can't do that can we you know Mr.

425
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,240
Sister pointed out that somebody gets

426
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,380
killed in Washington DC every

427
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,440
day on the average anyway

428
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,540
so why are they so upset

429
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,800
well they usually know who's doing it to them

430
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,440
and why right it's suburban

431
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,020
usually it's people who

432
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,620
people who live in the back

433
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,580
well anyone who lives around

434
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,560
crackheads it's like well sir is

435
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,560
you right for being poor

436
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,340
well sure of course people get shot there

437
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,460
well duh or living

438
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,380
in those neighborhoods trying to be multi

439
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,460
cultural actually what I wanted

440
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,280
to do is get poor and start

441
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,980
taking crack he said I

442
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,560
suspect what it is is there's a kind of a

443
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,780
bag limit

444
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,460
of about five or so

445
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,540
per well they've moved the bag limit

446
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,460
up to nine right now Predator that

447
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,700
movie Predator I didn't even think about it

448
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,460
that's what they're not telling us these

449
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,180
people are having their spines ripped

450
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,300
out their heads removed

451
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,500
mysteries of the

452
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,440
unexplained

453
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,320
drunk from cups of

454
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,640
scum

Craven Bob the Hunter

460
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,320


461
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,140
Wes Crane the Hunter

462
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,640
Wes Crane

463
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,780
Bob Crane the Humper

464
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,800
Hey dude first rule of sniper club

465
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,120
don't talk about sniper club

466
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,560
right

467
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,260
you'll be dead

468
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,800
yeah that's what I said

469
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,360
won't change a thing

470
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,840
just go back to bed

471
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,760
it may happen as you're scrolling

472
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,640
down the street

473
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:35,640


474
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:35,640


475
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:35,640


476
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:35,640


477
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:35,640


478
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:35,640


479
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:35,640


480
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,780
it may happen in the middle of a blissful sleep

481
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,880
it may come after years and years and years of pain

482
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,820
it may hit you too quick to register in your brain

483
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,720
it may find you in a belly full of lead

484
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,280
but sooner or later

485
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,940
you will have to be dead

486
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,240
you'll be no more

487
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,680
oh what a bore

488
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,080
can watch TV

489
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,780
or even go to the store

490
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,680
you may find someone else's

491
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,060
political blaze

492
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,120
you may walk into a lethal dose of

493
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,840
cabarets

494
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,880
you may shoot up something that's a bit too pure

495
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,900
you might catch a disease that has no cure

496
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,680
you could have lots of comedy

497
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,080
if it's the ultimate war

498
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,520
but a man tries

499
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:35,640
to kill you

500
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:35,640


501
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,160
you'll be no more

remember friends

507
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,100
you will die

508
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,720
while there are many dangers in the world

509
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,720
the threat from the most serious dangers

510
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,640
of our age

511
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,560
are controlled by a murderous tyrant

512
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,340
to kill thousands of people

513
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,660
and we do

514
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,020
by its past and present actions

515
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,340
by its technological capabilities

516
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,020
by the merciless nature of its regime

517
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,200
and its drive

518
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,320
toward an arsenal of terror

519
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,600
the United States is unique

520
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,940
this is ridiculous

521
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,400
and it only grows worse with time

522
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,780
so there's so much war

523
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,620
the war mongering

524
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,260
going on

525
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,420
it's really sad actually

526
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,640
it's more than ridiculous

527
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,480
it's totally horrific

528
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,860
to see so many people

529
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,160
nobody wants to have peace

530
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,680
and give peace a chance

531
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,300
and get along

532
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,580
and make love not war

533
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,680
everyone just wants to go to war

534
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,540
they love to hear those huffy words

535
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,760
I've heard it's a real peace nick

536
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,960
he's really into it

537
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,540
his two sons are too

538
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,300
they're really cool guys

539
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,200
to go party with

540
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,940
who's a peace nick

541
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,640
especially the older son I hear he's a gas out at the dinner table

542
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,600
who is this now you're talking about

543
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,240
oh the Hussain's

544
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,600
oh the Hussain's yeah they are

545
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,060
those guys are quite partiers

546
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,640
they are known for their party

547
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,760
they party across Europe

548
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,180
in Paris they know them as

549
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,560
anyway but I know Bush's daughter got 10 days

550
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,440
for doing a slammer and a stinky in a hole

551
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,020
I mean at least Jeb Bush's daughter

552
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,900
got 10 days did you hear about that

553
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,520
no they keep those bits of news

554
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,920
smothered pretty well

555
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,000
was it for cocaine

556
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,540
was it coke or smoke

557
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,100
what was it some sort of

558
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,880
I don't know she's a little dope head

559
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,480
I don't think so

560
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,700
he's probably smuggling it in from Cuba

561
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,660
yeah right

562
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,480
he's probably getting the good bud

563
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,180
they got the Miami mafia working for him already

564
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,120
don't you guys feel like our president

565
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,020
and his disgusting family

566
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,480
are in need of support

567
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,160
everyone does not want the war

568
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,520
I just heard broadcast

569
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,680
on Cleveland News today

570
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,560
that

571
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,440
35% of the

572
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,140
American people

573
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,000
want change in our government

574
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,940
I don't believe it I think they all want war

575
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,860
35% that's nothing

576
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,940
that's nobody everybody else is perfectly happy

577
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,840
when they would march the prisoners through the street

578
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,820
everyone else is being silent

579
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,800
they just want another football game

580
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,820
to root for

581
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,900
the fall of Baghdad

582
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,380
we're gonna run that back right now

583
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,620
you take a look here

584
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,920
it's like Cleveland Pittsburgh games

585
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,000
you know

586
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,600
it's what the US vs Baghdad

587
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,580
the ultimate rival

588
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,900
Washington vs Baghdad

589
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,320
keeps getting smaller and more elucidative

590
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,560
Super Bowl 2 coming up

591
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,640
next week it's the French

592
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,980
the week after that it's the pioneer huskies

593
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,660
from normal

594
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,260
and certainly

595
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,600
it'll be

596
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,640
also

597
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:05,640


598
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,680
I'd be on the color TV All my friends would be talking about it

599
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,160
I'd be a star, there's no doubt about it But my life's such a drag

600
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,240
I wanna be a football hero so bad

601
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Well I'd be so highly respected For my football playing abilities

602
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,920
I'd get autographs and interviews And the stories in the newspaper about me

603
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,760
There's commercials on the television With running through albums just like O.J. Simpson

604
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,900
Oh I wanna be a football hero I wanna hear the crowds cheering for me

605
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,980
I wanna be a football hero I want to be on the color TV

606
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,980
All my friends would be talking about it I'd be a star, there's no doubt about it

607
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,020
But my life's such a drag

608
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,500
Well I'd be on the color TV All my friends would be talking about it

609
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,080
I wanna be a football hero so bad

610
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:16,960
Well the sound of the crowd is so enticing Oh the thrill of it all would be so exciting

611
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,660
I wanna be a football hero I wanna be on the color TV

612
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:39,660


613
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:39,660


614
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,360
Life's been so boring lately The days go by and they're all just the same

615
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,340
I go to work and I come home Just another faceless name

616
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:54,620
Life could be much more intriguing If I could just make it in the big leagues

617
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:01,320
Oh I wanna be a football hero I wanna hear the crowds cheering for me

618
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,480
I wanna be a football hero I wanna be on the color TV

619
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:11,520
All my friends would be talking about it I'd be a star, there's no doubt about it

620
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,660
But my life's such a drag I wanna be a football hero so bad

621
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:28,300
I wanna be a football hero so bad

622
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:33,460
I wanna be a football hero I wanna be on the color TV

623
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:33,460


624
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,740
It's been so boring lately This world I've always anything just with it

625
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,820
I wanna be on the color TV I wanna show what I can do

626
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,100
I could make it make me a star With no doubt in my life

627
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,340
BelgianIC все же 애 그럴 헤이드

628
00:29:50,340 --> 00:30:00,760
No team that's done a shit As far as I care

629
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,360
doses I need my du assignments

630
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,620
Oh, Football Hero by the Pink Boys.

631
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,180
Led by Dr. X, one of the earliest subgeniuses.

632
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,440
Friends, ah, well, enough of, you know, this war stuff.

633
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,700
It just makes me want to hide and escape.

634
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,900
Don't worry about it.

635
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,380
Don't worry about it.

636
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,840
The spirit of Bob Crane is speaking to your children.

637
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,940
Hey, no problem. Don't worry about it.

638
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,220
He is dancing in the pale moonlight.

639
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,020
You're not going to fight.

640
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,660
Don't worry about it.

641
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:56,220
Pointing to his hair and his glistening pubis as he sings in a high bird-like voice.

642
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,600
Just let them do what they want to do.

643
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,960
Don't worry about it.

644
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,080
Make your body a vessel of this great land.

645
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,580
Sign up.

646
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,200
Line up and enlist today.

647
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,620
You are needed for Uncle Sam's war machine.

648
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,540
Did you hear about, like, they used to do LSD experiments on the soldiers?

649
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,820
And I guess there's some secret Prozac experiments.

650
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,160
That's what happened to Elvish.

651
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,740
Yeah, and they didn't know what their proper dose was, so they were overdosing soldiers.

652
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,880
Well, they were also giving them, what do you call it?

653
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,760
They had to give them LSD.

654
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,220
Biological.

655
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,400
They had to break out the old stash of LSD to bring them back.

656
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,640
Yeah, so they could withstand the biological warfare experiments.

657
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,640
That's from that Prozac coma.

658
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,260
At first we doused them out of the tox.

659
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,880
Now we're going to give them some acid and see how they took to it.

660
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,980
Where do you think Dr. Legume came from?

661
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,220
I thought he was the spawn of hell and came out from under a rock.

662
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,420
That's what everybody says.

663
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:55,200
He was in those army experiments where they gave them these drugs that they thought might give them psychic powers

664
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,580
because the Russians were studying that and were way ahead of them.

665
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,120
He's telling the story of the fly.

666
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,500
Dr. Legume took psychic warfare.

667
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,780
You're going to flip and fly like one of the little god's children of the air.

668
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,680
Look at your feet.

669
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,780
They're already getting bigger like a pair of duck.

670
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,960
Unfortunately, the mutant power that Legume got was the ability to read guinea pigs' minds.

671
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,840
Yeah, and also read backwards.

672
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,200
And this is how he gleans the future from the mind of a guinea pig.

673
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,320
He actually reads people's minds.

674
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,880
Very, very arcane.

675
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,120
Very arcane.

676
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:30,520
Very real.

677
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,760
And only entrusted to a few mutated genes born into the...

678
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,420
War guinea pigs.

679
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,340
War pig.

680
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,660
The pigs.

681
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,280
Are you being fattened up to be a war pig, Private Pyle?

682
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,320
Are you going to wear those epaulettes like barbecue sauce?

683
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,200
Private Pyle.

684
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,700
You know, what are they going to do?

685
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,240
They can't...

686
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,700
It's kind of hard to bring the...

687
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,120
As kids, you don't have to worry about the draft coming back.

688
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,140
You just don't have to worry about the draft coming back.

689
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:08,380
Because this American Army and Navy, they all know that American children are a bunch of little fat asses.

690
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,080
They would never cut the training, you know.

691
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,060
It's got to be a volunteer force, you know.

692
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,960
It's got to be gung-ho people, you know, just do it, Nike, you know, shtick going.

693
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,060
But this is how the corporate state has sliced our freedom.

694
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,520
And the rest are all the little fat bodies.

695
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,340
Disgusting little fat bodies in front of television sets.

696
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:27,880
That's me.

697
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:28,840
Soaking up.

698
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,840
They don't want me.

699
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:30,920
They don't want me.

700
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:30,920


701
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:30,920


702
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,820
Nestle Crunch Bars.

703
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,420
I'm a disgusting fat body.

704
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,740
Gray, flaccid skin.

705
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,760
I'll stay home.

706
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,600
Moistened by the pale light.

707
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,060
Forehead.

708
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,800
The artificial light beamed in from the great Centurion Pactor.

709
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,960
There they lie, eating television.

710
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,280
Either that or they're going to send the fat bodies over.

711
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,220
And don't give them guns, just give them knives and forks.

712
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,880
Yeah.

713
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,520
Yeah, give them silverware.

714
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,640
Just give them computers.

715
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,340
A wave of fat bodies rolling into Baghdad.

716
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,560
With knives and forks.

717
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,080
With silverware.

718
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,800
Getting ready to eat, you know.

719
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,060
Ring, ring, ring.

720
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,960
Fire at work.

721
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,740
We are not halal.

722
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,120
We are pigs.

723
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,360
The American, the attack of the American fat body.

724
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,620
Slurred.

725
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,320
Pigs.

726
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,360
Thork slurred.

727
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,740
Slurred.

728
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,200
Pigs.

729
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,240
Thork slurred.

730
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,640
Hey.

731
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,140
Pigs.

732
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:24,920
Thork slurred.

733
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,360
Slurred.

734
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:26,780
Pigs.

735
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,820
Thork slurred.

736
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,660
Shtick to your ribs.

737
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,360
Slurred.

738
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:31,840
Slurred.

739
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,080
Thork slurred.

740
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,300
Thork Slipped.

741
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:34,920


742
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:36,600
Pigs.

743
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,000
Thork Slurred.

744
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Like lying with bloody demons.

745
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,400
Slurred.

746
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:41,940
Pigs.

747
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,960
Thork slurred.

748
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,440
Slurred.

749
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,120
Thork slurred.

750
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,040
Hey.

751
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,160


752
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,160


753
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,160


754
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,940
This is a car.

755
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,680
S-S-Slack Pigs.

756
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,860
Pork Slack.

757
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,480
By Heart Ignition.

758
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,580
And friends, uh, by the way, this music?

759
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:05,020
we've been hearing in the background throughout the show is by the flying ryan brothers and you

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:44,840
imagine the letter o like a star like a sun like a blazing beacon of bobness

765
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:52,660
floating in the endless night of pink fear and pinker embarrassment and self-loathing

766
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:03,740
imagine the glorious letter o floating like a donaty bountiful beauteous beacon in that endless

767
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:16,480
darkest night imagine now another b a brave and bold letter b chasing around and around that o

768
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,320
until we have a blazing band of golden b slice across this band

769
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,340
glance

770
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:31,900
across this disc of b-ness into the heart of onis and emerge again and again into eternal b

771

775
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,520
Now turn the record over.

776
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,060
Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?

777
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,900
Well, we could join together in prayer.

778
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,660
Uh-huh. But is there anything useful we can do?

779
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,740
No.

780
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,940
It is the subgenius sacrilege!

781
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,700
And yet, in the interest of open theological debate,

782
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,320
we will consider just this once the question of what if we're wrong.

783
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,200
Now, theoretically speaking, not that it is statistically probable,

784
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,120
but hypothetically imagine, if you can, a world come July 5th, 1998,

785
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,260
where there is no excess invasion.

786
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,200
Oh, it's painful. It's painful, dear friends, I understand.

787
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,840
But remember, this is only theoretical.

788
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,860
A planet that is not surrounded by an angry alien spacecraft

789
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,680
that is not surrounded by an angry alien spacecraft

790
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,300
A globe not littered, a globe not completely polluted

791
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,360
with the corpses of conspiracy dupes.

792
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,060
Oh, dear friends, it would be a sick society

793
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,980
still dominated by pinks and normals.

794
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,380
An earth where corporations, governments, and well-equipped armies

795
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,760
still loyal to the system continue to uphold the status quo.

796
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,940
They fight to maintain their tight totalitarianism.

797
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,200
They fight to maintain their tight totalitarianism.

798
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:22,400
They fight to maintain their tight totalitarianism.

799
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,740
Oh, it's a nightmarish vision, indeed, one that makes my head spin,

800
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,700
but one we will contemplate nonetheless in the interest of free and open debate.

801
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,180
Yes, dear friends, this dark future of Dobbsian defeat

802
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,940
and conspiracy conquest,

803
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,000
this desperate future where the last of genius forces

804
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,200
are holed up in the underground bunkers

805
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,680
awaiting the final onslaught by conspiracy mercenaries

806
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,100
is a vision we do not want to contemplate,

807
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,660
but will this one last time.

808
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:50,900
but will this one last time.

809
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,880
As the Kelvin bombs explode far above on the planetary surface,

810
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:01,900
staying in his subgenius generals huddled beneath a flickering light bulb,

811
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,320
pouring over maps of subgenius tunnels, subway tunnels, and underground sewers,

812
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,820
examining any and all possible attack routes,

813
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,440
they will be determined, determined to fight to death

814
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,180
and take the maximum number of normals with them.

815
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,080
Yes!

816
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,760
Why?

817
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,780
Because we hate you!

818
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,260
They will be dedicated to honoring Bob through a dignified Dobbsian death.

819
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:40,120
It is even, it is then that some weak of heart heretic will step forward,

820
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:44,640
probably some Bobby who always dreamed of being a real subgenius warrior for a long time,

821
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,400
but when the chips are down for Dobbs wants to cash out,

822
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,660
this week will be the day.

823
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:50,660


824
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:50,660


825
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,500
The skilled wannabe Bobby will show his first real courage

826
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,280
when he steps forward and whines,

827
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,180
but Reverend Stang,

828
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,060
BUNKER!

829
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,600
you promised we'd have something to show for our, for our membership fee.

830
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,560
The bunker will fall silent like a tomb.

831
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,900
The collected gas will cost the barrel of

832
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,520
Daniel Webster will proclaim the same answer I gave the Christian in the parking lot,

833
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,520
and that is

834
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:20,860
this.

835
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,720
Even in hell,

836
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,580
we'll have the one thing the conspiracy tried to deny from us all our living lives.

837
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,160
The one human right they'll never be able to take from us again,

838
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,740
no matter how much they lie about what we did or what they didn't do.

839
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,540
It's the one virtue Christians will never obtain,

840
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,920
no matter how much they beg, pray, or grovel to their God.

841
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,560
I'm talking about respect!

842
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,660
Selfishness!

843
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,000
Out of respect!

844
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:59,760
The only commodity that can't be bought, traded, negotiated, or stolen in any of the conspiracy marketplaces.

845
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,680
Appreciate it!

846
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,140
Hallelujah!

847
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,540
It's a concept foreign to all pinks and normals who serve the system.

848
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:18,380
They may have stolen our freedom, our slack, and even our lives,

849
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,560
but by virtue of our very default,

850
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,880
we've earned a self-respect they can't even pretend to want.

851
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,820
And you want to know why?

852
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:26,960
Why?

853
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,200
Because their religion is based on submission,

854
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,460
while ours is based on independence!

855
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,160
Yes!

856
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Praise Bob!

857
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,920
Give me a praise Bob!

858
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,360
Praise Bob!

859
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,320
Praise Bob!

860
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,220
So that, dear friends, is our answer.

861
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,540
That's what we get even if we're wrong.

862
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:50,540


863
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:50,540


864
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,340
Come judgment day,

865
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,760
the honor and dignity of self-respect earned through a lifelong fight for independence and freedom.

866
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:04,840
Only the devil could possibly resent a man for wanting to be free.

867
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,860
Any God that wouldn't want his followers to be free is no savior,

868
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,040
but a tyrant,

869
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,460
an enslaver of souls,

870
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,640
a devil in disguise.

871
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,820
And that leads me to my question to the Christian.

872
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,260
It's terribly original, so brace yourself for it.

873
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,100
What if,

874
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,700
what if you're wrong?

875
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,780
Come judgment day!

876
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,500
Please think carefully before you answer, dear friends.

877
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:50,520
What if you're wrong?

878
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:50,520


879
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:50,520


880
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:50,520


881
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:50,520


882
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:50,520


883
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:54,820
Because remember, your very soul dangles in the balance.

884
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,480
And it is the word of God.

885
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,820
Praise Bob!

886
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,480
Amen!

887
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,680
Praise Father Joe Mama!

888
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:07,660
Oh yes, dear friends, praise Father Joe Mama!

889
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:14,220
Friends, what Father Joe Mama was saying about that one side of the conspiracy,

890
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,780
it makes you wonder,

891
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,160
it makes you wonder which side of the conspiracy is running things.

892
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,800
I started getting paranoid about,

893
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,480
well,

894
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,920
the, the, the masons, let's say.

895
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,900
Let's just say.

896
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,880
For all I know, I'm really worried about the Illuminati.

897
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:38,840
But, you know, it started with that America Online logo,

898
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,360
which is a triangle with a circle in the middle of it.

899
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,080
Looks just like the old eye in the pyramid,

900
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,060
or the eye above the pyramid.

901
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,140
You know? And, uh,

902
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,980
I mentioned that to my friend Emot.

903
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,100
And Emot said,

904
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,780
Oh, that's just the beginning of it.

905
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,080
Haven't you noticed those, uh, triangles and the eyeball shapes are just everywhere?

906
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:06,420
And in fact, they've even gotten quite obvious about the, the names of these businesses.

907
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,640
You guys ever notice the, the red arches,

908
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,060
the, that form a big M of the Sonic hamburgers?

909
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,260
Get it? Sonic?

910
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,160
Masonic?

911
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,400
I think I'll have Masonic Burger now.

912
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,620
Or, he goes,

913
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,780
Did you know that Philip Morris cigarettes and General Foods were both owned by this gigantic conglomerate,

914
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,040
Kraft Foods?

915
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,220
Kraft?

916
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,180
The, as in,

917
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,920
The Kraft?

918
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,160
Yes, friends.

919
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,140
And, not to mention, when they replaced that Popeyes, uh,

920
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,960
place next door with Church's fried chicken.

921
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,820
Uh-huh. But it doesn't stop there.

922
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,520
If you look around, next time you drive through town, friend,

923
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,340
just keep your eyeballs open.

924
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,980
You may see things you didn't want to see.

925
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:58,800
Buildings, one after another, that look like, well, like the Temple of Solomon.

926
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:07,140
With, if it's not the arches, it's that Temple of Solomon shape that you see etched onto Masonic aprons and symbols.

927
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,800
Uh, my old supermarket nearby here, Menards, I, he pointed out, looks just like that.

928
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:17,100
Wal, all of the Sam Walton stores, Walmart, Sam's, Hypermart,

929
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,300
they're in the grand Masonic design, my friends.

930
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,100
Uh, computer places, uh, Computer City, Discovery Zone,

931
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,180
the best, uh, Best Buy stores, all subtle Masonic symbols,

932
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,820
and go buy your local, uh, water pumping station.

933
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:40,840
The gas company, uh, the gas company in most small towns is in the same building as a Masonic lodge, my friends.

934
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,580
The electric company.

935
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,940
They all,

936
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,040
all,

937
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:53,340
all of them, my friends, are part of one conspiracy or another, you know, and,

938
00:45:53,400 --> 00:46:00,300
but what do they, what, we, you try to talk about things like this and they call you, well, the polite term,

939
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:11,260
conspiracy researchers, or conspiracy buffs, or conspiracy nuts, or conspiracy coots, or conspiracy crackpots, my friends.

940
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:17,080
Those, those are the real polite terms for, uh, the folks who attempt merely to look.

941
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:25,100
They're the ones who try to lift the veils, peer under the rocks, and pry into the business of the, uh, authorities, uh, so-called.

942
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:34,580
What I want to know is, friends, how come the conspiracy researchers get worse pressed than some of the conspiracy perpetrators?

943
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,060
Heh, it must be a conspiracy.

944
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:45,280
Uh, and you know, I can wax as sarcastic as the next guy about some conspiracy theories.

945
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,180
I like to think I'm skeptical to the bone.

946
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:55,960
But, I actually do believe a large percentage of those conspiracy theories.

947
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,840
Heh, heh, heh.

948
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:10,460
And worse still, I believe in the conspiracy, yes, the plot, by ordinary, normal, everyday people to label conspiracy researchers as loonies, or as a part of a conspiracy.

949
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,260
Now, contrary to unpopular opinion, friends,

950
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,280
it's still possible to use mass media to expose mass media conspiracies,

951
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,140
but you have to couch your expose carefully.

952
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,520
You have to make it look like a, a satire, or a comic book, or a radio show,

953
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,920
like this one, which is pieced together from the dead parts of history books.

954
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,400
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

955
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,880
And of course, some conspiracy theories are just that.

956
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,360
They're just theories, improbable, paranoid, predicated on few facts.

957
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,700
Like the one about the Masons creating the Greys.

958
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,260
They've obviously got it mapped out.

959
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,780
Others are founded on pure coincidence.

960
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,760
And these, I would consider kooky, wouldn't you?

961
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,000
But then, you know, one man's a paranoid lunatic is the next man's dedicated researcher.

962
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,860
And, uh, you know, the problem is the domino effect, though.

963
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,740
There's those who see conspiracies everywhere, literally everywhere.

964
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,680
The crazy old bircher lady who fears commies under her bed isn't just a stereotype.

965
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,160
Nor is the religious nut who sees Satanists everywhere.

966
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:27,460
Nor the UFO cultist who mistakes something that could be cured with Prozac for messages from the Space Brothers.

967
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,440
But you know, there might be something to some of it.

968
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:42,080
And once you're fairly sure of one conspiracy theory, it starts to tie into neighboring conspiracy theories.

969
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,240
And pretty soon you'll believe in quite a few conspiracy theories.

970
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,800
And you start to sound like one of those nuts.

971
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,120
Unless you're selective about who you tell it to.

972
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:59,020
And that's one of the things that inclines you towards the conspiracy view of history.

973
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,000
It's the way the more trusting people around you respond to the very idea.

974
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:10,520
You know, try discussing the CIA's more heinous misdeeds in polite society.

975
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,220
People edge away.

976
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,040
You've got a friend in bar.

977
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,340
You've got a friend in bar.

978
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,700
Just follow the pipe.

979
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,200
He'll take you there.

980
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,600
Two planets trending out somewhere.

981
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,980
Jump on the luck way.

982
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,160
And you'll find.

983
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,120
You'll leave the conspiracy.

984
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,320
Conspiracy nukes.

985
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,580
Far behind.

986
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:53,160
And if you think this is all just a scam.

987
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,940
You'll be wishing you believed when the sh** dissapeared.

988
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,900
As we kill you.

989
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:02,840
Pinks.

990
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,940
So gleefully.

991
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,400
You've got a friend in bar.

992
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,960
You've got a friend in bar.

993
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,920
When the X's come out of the sky.

994
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:31,360
And all the media crevins start to die.

995
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,820
All you fools with your pathetic jobs.

996
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,320
Will wish they'd listen to the words.

997
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:47,720
And if you never said in your thirty bucks.

998
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:53,280
It's gonna look like you'll get royally fucked.

999
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,220
With a mole's in lead.

1000
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,200
And a bar.

1001
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:06,160
You've got a friend in bar.

1002
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,300
You've got a friend in bar.

1003
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:11,860
You've got a friend in bar.

1004
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:20,640
Bar's revelations are the sign of its peak.

1005
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,940
Reveals the subgenius.

1006
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,440
Destiny.

1007
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,200
Cast out false prophets.

1008
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,560
Extra meditate.

1009
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,100
So set thirty bucks.

1010
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,860
Before it's too late.

1011
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,780
For you've.

1012
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,280
Got a friend in bar.

1013
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,040
You've got a friend in bar.

1014
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:55,380
July 5th, 1998.

1015
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,500
Seven a.m. I can hardly wait.

1016
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,720
The six goddesses will take me away.

1017
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,020
I'll party down with Jesus and Jane.

1018
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,260
Half-pain.

1019
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,260
Sex hurt with the horn of a Babylon.

1020
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,860
Front to the gills.

1021
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,380
The party rages on.

1022
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,340
Full of.

1023
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,840
Eternity.

1024
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:36,220
You've got a friend in bar.

1025
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,800
You've got a friend in bar.

1026
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,200
You've got a friend in bar.

1027
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,720
You've got a friend in bar.

1028
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:54,240
You've got a friend in bar.

1029
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:01,220
Well, I heard the American military, especially in the special forces guys,

1030
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,000
their likelihood of beating the crap out of their woman

1031
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,760
and creating domestic violence is five times higher than the national average.

1032
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:10,660
Wow.

1033
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,360
Now, we're not very.

1034
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,960
I can't believe there's that many uppity women around.

1035
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:14,720
Yeah.

1036
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:15,740
That's such a shame.

1037
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,900
Especially on a military base like that where they ought to show their face and not their ace.

1038
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,880
I mean, show their ace and not their face.

1039
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,020
Well, they're just putting them through a little basic training.

1040
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:25,520
That's all.

1041
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,140
They got to learn how to tear that M16 apart and put it back together in five minutes.

1042
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,960
They got to put the socks on the right drawer.

1043
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,460
They got to put the socks on the right.

1044
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,300
Five minutes?

1045
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,520
You get five minutes?

1046
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,820
Oh, I mean it's five seconds.

1047
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,520
You're going to be dead in five minutes.

1048
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,800
Yeah, you'll be dead in five minutes.

1049
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:40,840
You'll be dead.

1050
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,920
The whole state will be dead.

1051
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,100
The whole north coast will be dead and wiped out by the time you get that gun put back together.

1052
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,940
I think that's what's going to happen to America.

1053
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:53,000
I can just see millions and billions of soldiers unable to use their guns or put them together

1054
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,540
sitting around errantly going .

1055
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,000
Oh, this is the wrong.

1056
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,480
No, wait a minute.

1057
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:57,900
I got to .

1058
00:53:59,460 --> 00:53:59,820
Geez.

1059
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,180
No, that's just the reserves.

1060
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,340
We have reserves?

1061
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:04,440
Yeah.

1062
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:04,560
We have the reserves.

1063
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,540
The regular army, they don't know how to do it.

1064
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,600
Private Lonesome, you make me sick.

1065
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,540
You are the slowest soldier in this force.

1066
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,880
Give me 25.

1067
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,420
I'm going to cut your balls off so you can not infect the planet.

1068
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,640
25 reach arounds right now.

1069
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,020
Down on your knees, private.

1070
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,540
Down on your face.

1071
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:31,640
The mankind accordion of Lonesome Cowboy David placed on his duffer bag.

1072
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,500
Fat body.

1073
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,440
You're the oreo cookie in this room.

1074
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,520
You're the circle jerk, private.

1075
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,720
He knew enough to wear his helmet on his ass so the flak wouldn't come up through the

1076
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,500
bottom of the helicopter and remove the top of his skull.

1077
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:49,060
Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like,

1078
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:49,060


1079
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,660
What kind of a sandbox is this?

1080
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:52,960
I know.

1081
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,680
I don't know if I feel comfortable in here anymore.

1082
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,080
It is a stinky sandbox with very, very bad kitties.

1083
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,860
This is like really, really, really out there, man.

1084
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,200
The kitties ate all the lamb chops and all of the tuna.

1085
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:04,420
I don't know.

1086
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:04,420


1087
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:04,420


1088
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:04,420


1089
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:04,420


1090
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:04,420


1091
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:04,680
I don't know.

1092
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,520
And now it is coming out the wrong type.

1093
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:07,720
I don't know.

1094
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:08,240
I'm telling you, private.

1095
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,100
Sir, five foot nine, sir.

1096
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:10,880
Five foot nine.

1097
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,820
I didn't know they stacked that high.

1098
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,540
There is nothing more un-private than a private in the U.S. military.

1099
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,700
You are about as public as they get.

1100
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,920
We can always go back to this.

1101
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,260
Private Dobbs, Ben Nolan's friend.

1102
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,840
Pull that pipe out of there.

1103
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,380
What have you got that pipe up in there for?

1104
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,840
Would you get that pipe?

1105
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,900
Let me take a look inside that box.

1106
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,660
What do you got in there?

1107
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,340
You got a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

1108
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,820
big, big, big, big.

1109
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,960
I can't believe you wrote that in four and a half minutes.

1110
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,500
I can't believe you wrote that in four and a half minutes.

1111
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,540
Well, it is sad.

1112
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,360
You got more than me.

1113
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:53,840
Well, the shackles are going back on as time to fix some more road, to clear some to drain

1114
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,560
some more deltoids.

1115
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,460
I'm going to drain my deltoids all afternoon.

1116
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,980
Come in there and drink water with me or something.

1117
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:04,320
In that as well.

1118
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:04,320


1119
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:09,720
No, I'm not giving you any water until you finish your work.

1120
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,320
Lord, give me a drink of water.

1121
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,780
No, no, no.

1122
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,240
And no candy until you finish spinning the road.

1123
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,860
Who's that riding?

1124
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,320
I don't know.

1125
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,360
He wrote the book on the seventh sea.

1126
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,420
You know Christ and 12.

1127
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,740
I'm scared.

1128
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,080
Every land away.

1129
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:35,760
Say, watch with me when I walk.

1130
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,060
Till I go yonder and pray.

1131
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,200
Tell me who's that riding?

1132
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:41,540
Who?

1133
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,180
Tell me who's that riding?

1134
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,940
Who's that riding?

1135
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,520
He wrote the book on the seventh sea.

1136
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,780
Who's that riding?

1137
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,600
Tell me who's that riding?

1138
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:00,660
I don't know.

1139
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,320
Who's that riding?

1140
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:04,940
I don't know.

1141
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,900
He wrote the book on the seventh sea.

1142
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,620
Well, I wish we'd known him.

1143
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,980
He called us in.

1144
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,940
At least the sun.

1145
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,340
Till next week.

1146
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,160
Through the clouds.

1147
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,480
And the dark clouds are rolling away.

1148
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,280
Just as soon as that blue sky appears.

1149
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,420
Keep your head on tight.

1150
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,880
You're back to the wind in your sack.

1151
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:29,280
You can see clearly.

1152
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,060
From here.

1153
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,880
From the end of the globe to another.

1154
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,000
Your scope has grown.

1155
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,140
Your eyes are bigger than those dishes.

1156
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,360
Oh yeah.

1157
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,180
It's full.

1158
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:40,960
Oh ho ho ho ho.

1159
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,080
That's right.

1160
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,600
The magic disinformation.

1161
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:48,180
The kind that makes your genes swell.

1162
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,820
You're too fat.

1163
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,080
You're too small.

1164
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,180
You're too everything.

1165
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,080
You're going to pray.

1166
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,320
My brains of you.

1167
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:31,060
God's a clean'tle.

1168
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,060


1169
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,060


1170
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,060


1171
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,000
Bye valey.

1172
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,680
Bye.

1173
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,880
Bye.

1174
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:37,800
Thank you for watching!
