1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:12,280
We interrupt this program to activate the emergency subgenius power of sparking.

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:29,200
Yes dear friends, we have lots of stories and sub-nanigans tonight, but first, just a little girl talk from his most recent release.

3
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,120
Let's get started.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Death's construction.

5
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,840
Get out the way, bitch.

6
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,820
Get out the way.

7
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,400
In the fields, a body's burning.

8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,160
Get out the way.

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,440
As the war machine keeps turning.

10
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,520
Get out the way, bitch.

11
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,520
Get out the way.

12
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,620
Death and hatred to mankind.

13
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,840
Get out the way.

14
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,720
Poisoning their brainwashed minds.

15
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,440
Oh, Lord, yeah.

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,520
Oh, no.

17
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,980
The fight's out.

18
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,740
I'm about to punch your life out.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,340
Get the fuck back.

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,480
Guard the grill.

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,440
It's a room.

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,880
We can't stay still.

23
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,380
I've been drinking and busting, too.

24
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,040
And I've been thinking of busting you.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,620
I'm not your motherfucking forehead.

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,960
And if your friends a bitch, tell me both days.

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,920
Causing confusion.

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,060
Disturbing the peace.

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,580
It's not an illusion.

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,840
We running the streets.

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,040
So bye-bye to all you groupies and gold diggers.

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,680
Is there a bumper on your ass?

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,600
No, nigga.

34
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,360
I'm doing 100 on the highway.

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,900
So if you do the speed.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,920
Then me get the fuck outta my way.

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,500
I see your eye hardly ever caught sober.

38
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,180
And you about to get ran the fuck over.

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,100
Boo bitch!

40
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,580
Get out the way.

41
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,200
Get out the way, bitch.

42
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,280
Get out the way.

43
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,460
Boo bitch!

44
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,020
Get out the way.

45
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,540
Get out the way, bitch.

46
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,700
Get out the way.

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,820
Boo bitch!

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,360
Get out the way.

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,880
Get out the way, bitch.

50
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,020
Get out the way.

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,200
Boo bitch!

52
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,660
Get out the way.

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,200
Get out the way, bitch.

54
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,300
Get out the way.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,740

133
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,660

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,720
Keep it down

143
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,460
Keep it down

144
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,400
Keep it down

145
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Keep it down

146
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,120
Keep it down

147
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,120


148
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,420

149
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:52,440
Keep it down

150
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,440


151
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,660
Keep it down

152
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,600
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

153
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,160
Yes.

154
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,640
Yes, dear friends.

155
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:17,740
Last week we were reading from The Agent and Mr. Dobbs by Reverend Teeters LaVerge.

156
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,260
Actually, it's a document that Reverend LaVerge found.

157
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,260
Well, he came into possession of this document.

158
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:37,880
It was written in 1962, but was found in 1989 on the body of a transient party clown

159
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,720
that had been shredded and had to be assembled back together, which was not easy.

160
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,320
We read part one and a little bit of part two.

161
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:54,560
Last week, and I decided that even though I'm not in the studio with the fancy microphones at WCSB,

162
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:06,700
my studio at home here in the Slacker Mansion with this microphone is close enough for subgenius work.

163
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,820
That's what she said.

164
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,540
So we will continue.

165
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,660
Actually, I'll read the last paragraph from last week to help refresh your memory.

166
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,680
The agent, the unnamed agent, had fallen in with Mr. Dobbs.

167
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,780
I awoke, I'm not sure when, on a garbage-strewn beach in some tropical or subtropical location.

168
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,840
I recall the sound of ocean waves breaking on the shore and that of a mambo band.

169
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,520
I almost choked when I was offered a daiquiri by the dictator F blanked out, C blanked out.

170
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,720
We assume Fiddle.

171
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:53,500
Fiddle Castro, and I'm just going to say that from now on, who is sitting next to me on the beach towel.

172
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,980
I drank the beverage only out of a severe thirst.

173
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,500
It was tasty, however.

174
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,340
You can't beat good Cuban rum.

175
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,560
Sitting on the other side of me was Dr. Oswald, who was removing the cash from my wallet,

176
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,300
mumbling about, that damn Bob never pays me on time.

177
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,200
I was so overwhelmed that I did nothing to counter his actions.

178
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:24,840
Fiddle Castro kept serving me daiquiris, and so in a very short time, I found myself intoxicated again.

179
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,800
Though my actions may seem un-American, bear in mind that I considered myself still undercover.

180
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,980
I eventually extricated myself by saying I needed to urinate in the ocean.

181
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:45,640
While doing my business, I was startled by Mr. Dobbs shooting up out of the water in front of me like a deranged dolphin.

182
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,700
His pipe miraculously still smoking.

183
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:56,380
He mentioned that the water was quite a bit warmer here, and if I would not mind if he lingered to warm himself up a bit.

184
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,300
I, of course, never told him of the source of warmth.

185
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:08,720
I was startled again by what I initially thought were Mrs. Dobbs, Connie's, hands rubbing a strain out of my back.

186
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,620
Bob sat in the water in front of me smiling while I felt all the tension being massaged.

187
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:15,620


188
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:15,620


189
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,440
I could barely breathe.

190
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:28,540
It was incredibly relaxing until a slim, grey hand popped another Dobbs Co. pill in my mouth and smoothed it down my throat.

191
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,100
It was not Mrs. Dobbs!

192
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,760
It was that damnable, grey creature from that horrible first night at the Dobbs residence!

193
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,240
Bob found my confusion and fear amusing.

194
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,560
He laughed and jumped up and down the water screaming,

195
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,360
Bob wants one too! Bob wants one too!

196
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,860
Mr. Dobbs received a large handful of pills.

197
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,680
Pills, by the way, is spelled with one L throughout this manuscript.

198
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,400
Strangely, the pills seemed to sober him up,

199
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,400
unlike in my case, where the hallucinations began in earnest again.

200
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,880
For I could have sworn I saw Mr. Dobbs soon after,

201
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,100
absentmindedly battling a giant shark,

202
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,740
while lecturing both Fidel Castro and Dr. Oswald

203
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,280
on some convoluted concept he called slack.

204
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,540
The next event I clearly remember was having martinis in a jet

205
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,360
with Mr. and Mrs. Dobbs, the president and his wife,

206
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,740
and that abominable gray creature.

207
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,700
Mr. Dobbs was bemoaning the reliability of Dr. Oswald

208
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,900
while the president was assuring him that,

209
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,020
though he had attention,

210
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,860
he didn't see to whine about being left out,

211
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,680
that all in all he was reliable.

212
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,420
Mrs. Dobbs, the president's wife, and the gray

213
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,500
were defining the future from the entrails of a squid.

214
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,140
All three seemed deeply concerned.

215
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,560
Feeling bold and being sick of the constant drugging that was taking place,

216
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,520
I stood up and demanded to know what was really going on.

217
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,080
Initially, I was ignored until I tried to grab the pipe out of Mr. Dobbs,

218
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,220
who was sitting on the bench,

219
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,680
and I was told that the pipe was in the middle of Mr. Dobbs' mouth.

220
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,220
It would not budge.

221
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,640
It was like it was part of his bone structure,

222
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,360
but it did grab his attention.

223
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,100
He looked at me straight in the eye.

224
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,080
His constant grin seemed to get bigger,

225
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,720
and his face dissolved into a mass of tiny luminescent dots.

226
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,860
It was then that I knew he had the power.

227
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,180
I backed away in fear and awe until the president beckoned me over,

228
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,000
stuttering in his annoying New England accent,

229
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,100


230
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,780
It's all right, son.

231
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,880
Bob's got things under control.

232
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,520
I thought to myself that this buffoon, this magician, this slacker has things under control,

233
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,600
but it appears that he did or does.

234
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,840
I was then quickly sold.

235
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,240
I, myself, was sold, like in an auction, by our president to Mr. Dobbs

236
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,280
for a stack of Styrofoam cups and a game of tic-tac-toe,

237
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,420
which Mr. Dobbs declared he had to win,

238
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,540
and...

239
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,240
a carefully chosen doughnut from a squished box that lay at the president's feet.

240
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,340
I felt exhausted.

241
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,520
I felt that I somehow had let down my country,

242
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,960
even though I was, in essence, commanded by our president to obey Mr. Dobbs.

243
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:36,560
It pained me to think that I was sold to this man-god-beast for some junk.

244
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,620
Then I remembered my oath.

245
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,580
Then I remembered all the junk

246
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,680
laying around Mr. Dobbs' mansion.

247
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,720
The severed heads.

248
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,860
I was just part of a bigger plan.

249
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,420
I knew then it was my duty to play the game through.

250
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,480
Still, my insides burned with shame.

251
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,120
For the rest of the flight, I sat brooding.

252
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,140
Nothing could bring me out of my funk,

253
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,900
not Mr. Dobbs' childish and obvious magic coin tricks.

254
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,600
I knew very well he had it in his hand when he pulled the quarter from behind my ear.

255
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,620
Neither the president's poor impersonations of cartoon characters could pull me from my funk.

256
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,640
It was only the pills that got me in the swing of things,

257
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,400
and that was a shame to me in and of itself.

258
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,920
The Dobbses, the Greys, and I were dropped off in Miami Beach,

259
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,800
where the Dobbses had a residence,

260
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,160
while the president mentioned that he had to go to some secret base in New Mexico

261
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,860
until things, quote,

262
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,780
cooled down a bit.

263
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,920
Unquote.

264
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,020
The Dobbs' residence was not at all like their mansion.

265
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,960
It was small and neat.

266
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,860
I was ushered into the bathroom and told to take a shower,

267
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,860
for according to Bob, I smelled like, quote,

268
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,560
the older ones on a binge.

269
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,020
The shower immediately sobered me up, and I found that I was famished.

270
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,840
Dinner, however, was a disappointment.

271
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,320
It was cold rice with a bit of rat meat.

272
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,740
Bob said he had learned this hangover remedy from one Uncle Ho,

273
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,360
and that I'd better get used to it.

274
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,920
It was disgusting.

275
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,120
I feigned eating, hiding the half-chewed scraps in my napkin.

276
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,340
Bob did not eat, but puffed away on his pipe.

277
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,980
Connie, however, ate with gusto.

278
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:35,300
After dinner, I insisted that we go to this tiki lounge I knew of nearby for ham and pineapple.

279
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,760
I told him it was on me, though I had no cash after Dr. Oswald's thievery.

280
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,100
This excited Bob to such a degree that he jumped up on the table

281
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,420
and started to do his Friday night dance again.

282
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,400
It took Connie some time to quiet him down.

283
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,900
That is the end of part two of The Agent of Mr. Dobbs,

284
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,280
written by an unknown agent, delivered into our hands by Reverend

285
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,980
Titus La Verge.

286
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,940
It goes all the way up to part seven,

287
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:19,560
and there's more after that, but we will read part three next.

288
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,780
Welcome into Bavaria. Everybody dance.

289
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,360
You've heard that everyone is six degrees from Kevin Bacon.

290
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,600
But do you know the six degrees of Grand Exalted Mason?

291
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,100
For everyone and everything has around it curled

292
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,300
the tentacles of the secret masters who control the world.

293
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,680
I rule you, you rule me, someone rules us secretly.

294
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,960
It's a vast conspiracy, the Illuminati polka.

295
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,660
For several thousand years now they've worked behind the scenes.

296
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,960
They laugh when we buy Dockers, we've all got designer jeans.

297
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,000
They know if you'll get the girl or pass the SAT.

298
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,580
It's kinda like the Truman Show combined with DMD.

299
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,000
I rule you, you rule me, someone rules us secretly.

300
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,260
It's a vast conspiracy, the Illuminati polka.

301
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,280
Everybody's bank account is serviced by Zinone's.

302
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,960
The Masonic Temple gets the mortgage payment for your homes.

303
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,180
Command the race at Kepcidon from being caught too soon.

304
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,520
But Crowley and Blavatsky run Wall Street from the moon.

305
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,860
I rule you, you rule me, someone rules us secretly.

306
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,140
It's a vast conspiracy, the Illuminati polka.

307
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,780
The media say everything is awful, but that's okay.

308
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,040
It turns out that Fox Mulder is really Kaiser Soze.

309
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,340
If men in black are in your tub or birds consult your cab.

310
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,560
Duck your head, try not to think, and wear this tinfoil hat.

311
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,020
I rule you, you rule me, someone rules us secretly.

312
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,440
It's a vast conspiracy, the Illuminati polka.

313
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,520
The entertainment industry just got the atom bomb.

314
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,780
Dick Cheney and Alicata run in line with your mom.

315
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,080
Your DNA's on CDR, so heads up PDQ.

316
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,480
You may not have a hope in hell, but at least you got a clue.

317
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,940
I rule you, you rule me, someone rules us secretly.

318
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,180
It's a vast conspiracy, the Illuminati polka.

319
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,500
I rule you, you rule me, someone rules us secretly.

320
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,260
It's a vast conspiracy, the Illuminati polka.

321
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,460
It's a vast conspiracy, the Illuminati polka.

322
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,160
It's a vast conspiracy, the Illuminati polka.

323
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,560
Finord.

324
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,200
Finord indeed.

325
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,140
Hey, if that stuff was real, you wouldn't have heard the finord.

326
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:57,360
Anyway, that was Tom Smith with a song called the Illuminati polka.

327
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:03,280
I have no idea what album it's on, because I copped that off a YouTube music video.

328
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,260
But it is Tom Smith.

329
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,940
Tom Smith and Illuminati polka.

330
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:18,860
Next, we are going far, far back in time to 1970 to return to our heroes, the Firesign Theatre.

331
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:28,460
In some clips from their second Radio Hour Hour, as copped from the new book and disc release called Duke of Madness Motors,

332
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:35,240
for which Reverend Taylor Jessen re-found and remastered all of his works.

333
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:45,760
The most ancient recordings of those proto-subgeni, those precursors, those progenitors known as the Firesign Theatre.

334
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,720
With an R-E at the end.

335
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,780
Dot com.

336
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,440
What?

337
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:58,820
Well, here's number one of the vegetable drugs from 777 Revisited by Aleister Crowley, whose bite is as bad as his bark.

338
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,740
The number one is Elixir Vitae.

339
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,240
The attribution to Kether is due to its omnivore.

340
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,240


341
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,840
The number two is the form of virtue.

342
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,760
Number two, cocaine pertains to...

343
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,320
That's the end of the story.

344
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,720
That must be the end of the story.

345
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
That's all there is to it.

346
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,380
Being sheriff, it comes natural for me to do it.

347
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,600
And you see, most of Spawn City are up against the law some ways.

348
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,280
So when it says out, they mostly hunts their holes.

349
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:32,400
I've heard tell, fellas, they've a newfangled notion in Spawn City for referees to wear some sort of dude white coat fixin'.

350
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,060
So they don't get messed up with the boys playin'.

351
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,800
That's what they says.

352
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,080
But, you know, I don't guess I'm yearnin' to cover my guns with no fool thing like that, eh?

353
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,700
Right, fellas?

354
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,040
Right, right, right.

355
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,440
It's a dandy fine mark for them, uh, odd-oddicated hogs.

356
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:45,800
That's right.

357
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,860
I've taken this kind of bluff from Spawn City.

358
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,560
But you see, the boys around here are sure ready to bluff any feller.

359
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,740
It's all bluff.

360
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,660
They're up on the bluff, as a matter of fact, they're part.

361
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,920
That's not a bluff, that's a beaut.

362
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,120
Bluff from top to bottom.

363
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,140
It's just a whole system of life.

364
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,680
Bluff.

365
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,240
Bluff.

366
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,560
A man just bluffs himself out of the cradle and onto the floor.

367
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,280
Yeah.

368
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,920
He just bluffs himself, his legs, into carryin' him around when he gets sick of crawlin'.

369
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,180
Yeah.

370
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,500
And he gets to it and yaps and bluffs his mom into carryin' him.

371
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:09,840
Yeah.

372
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,880
Yes, sir, it ain't no difference, young or old.

373
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,100
We just start right in to bluff somebody from the first.

374
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,820
If it's only to yap when we're brought into the world as if we hated it and was kickin' to get out of it quick, right?

375
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,920
Look at, look at a fellow when he gets into courtin', eh?

376
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,140
I got Orton, oh yeah.

377
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,400
Ain't that the biggest bluff of all?

378
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,660
I got bluffed by a mulatto in Singapore.

379
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,640
That's right.

380
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,260
Well, he gets right alongside some female gal and he pitches your orange body himself, such as it brings.

381
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:32,260


382
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,320
the blush of shame to the features of George Washington, right?

383
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:34,940
Yeah.

384
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,120
Make, uh, Niasse hate himself.

385
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,200
He just makes her believe he's just whatever fellow her sense knows he ain't.

386
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,820
And she, bluffin' herself like mad, bluffs herself into believin' she believes what he believes she believes,

387
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
what nobody else believes about him.

388
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,440
He's fixin' her up with the truth there.

389
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,820
And the kid's come along and he sure got to bluff harder than ever.

390
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,920
Kid, he's take a heap of bluffin'.

391
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,440
When he's got a litter of six, it just means he's got to bluff six times as hard.

392
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,020
Takes a heap of bluffin' to make a house a home.

393
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,080
So he goes on till death gets around. Can't bluff death.

394
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,680
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,640
Which is the reason you gotta get off the earth.

396
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,160
Yeah.

397
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:02,900
Oh, yeah?

398
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,620
And you're fixed that way, other folks come along and bluff ya.

399
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,620
Your friends get around and tell ya they're a heap sorry.

400
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,800
The kiddies come right along and make ya feel you're treated and bullied and acted square by them.

401
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,440
And the gal you bluffed in the mirror and ya gets around and snivels and bluffs you've been a real dandy husband to her.

402
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:16,740
Yeah.

403
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,420
Doctor Bluffs you, you ain't gonna die.

404
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,960
And the parson comes and talks kingdom come and Bluffs you, you're gettin' right there.

405
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,720
Then death gets a drop on ya.

406
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,860
You go right down and out.

407
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,480
Everything's bluffed, sir.

408
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,620
Till you get up again, the muzzle of a gun.

409
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,260
Then your thumbs get up quick and you bluff yourself in the air.

410
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,260
That bluff is one of them things you'd hate like pissin' a hand out to a blind mule.

411
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,400
Which I says life sure won...

412
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,860
Durned long bluff.

413
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,860
That's a bureau.

414
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,760
That's a bureau of western mythology.

415
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,620
That's one of the most boring things I ever heard.

416
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,040
That's...

417
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,700
Well, it was supposed to be the second...

418
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,080
No, it was good.

419
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,380
The second act was supposed to be boring.

420
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,900
That's the Sheriff of Dyke Hole.

421
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,100
That's your reading from the Sheriff of Dyke Hole.

422
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,540
That's really neat.

423
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,340
I didn't really mean that about it being boring.

424
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,840
I was asleep all... awake all the time.

425
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,500
I do know that tonight's broadcast was brought to you by the forces of darkness.

426
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,400
Makers of the world's governments, religions, and corporations.

427
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,520
And by your golf ball and honey mixture, Alien Smegma Pine.

428
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:19,260
For patients out of this world, building a new race in this lifetime is hard, and nothing gets it as hard as an Alien Smegma Pine.

429
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,640
And by Hirsch, which works in miniature nuclear weapons warehouses.

430
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:31,480
Home of the Mini-Mag, the Pocket Thunder, the Baby Neutrino, and many other fine pocket-sized nuclear weapons that fit in your... in your pocket.

431
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:31,480


432
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,920
And the pants pocket, uh, stand.

433
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,760
Any questions?

434
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,980
Any rags, any bones, any bottles today?

435
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,420
Oh yes, the little girl there in the back.

436
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,120
How are we going to have a quiz on this day, sir?

437
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:55,500
Oh, the quiz that they'll give on this will come on Judgment Day, my friend.

438
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,660
They'll say...

439
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,420
Did you not attend the subgenius?

440
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,080
Steve Ivo in July of 1999?

441
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,360
Well yeah, Lord, but I was just, I mean, it was just a show, that's all.

442
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,920
Play back the tape.

443
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,360
He laughed at the jokes made at the expense of me, the Lord God Almighty.

444
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,840
What shall we do with him?

445
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,380
Throw him into the lake of fire?

446
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,440
Oh yes, Lord, please, throw me into the lake of fire.

447
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,560
Just whatever you do, don't throw me into subgenius hell with all those...

448
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,460
naked people and that party going on down there.

449
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,960
Oh, so that is his greatest fear, subgenius hell.

450
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Throw him into the blackest pit of subgenius hell.

451
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,180
Yes, Master, yes, Master.

452
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,500
Praise God!

453
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,280
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah.

454
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,040
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah.

455
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,140
Only one day is left.

456
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,640
Only one day.

457
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,520
We are leaving the others.

458
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,580
We are going away.

459
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,040
We are going to the end of the world.

460
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,040


461
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,040


462
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:45,460
The day we all steer, animals we are, possession is lost.

463
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,820
Our souls are from the wild and wings to reach the sky.

464
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,820
Let the sun fall into the ocean.

465
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,660
Let the earth erupt in flame.

466
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,440
It is enough to have the strength and knowledge

467
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,420
to raise our dream machines into the sky.

468
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,020
Let them sleep who do not know.

469
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,740
The final day is here.

470
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,880
The very last.

471
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,040
And we leave at dawn.

472
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,340
The day we all steer, animals we are, possession is lost.

473
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,340


474
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,340


475
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,340


476
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,300
There is no force, no money and no power

477
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,780
to stop us now and change our fate.

478
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,580
Now every problem is destroyed.

479
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,520
We raise our hands and bodies to the peak.

480
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,820
Into the universe, towards the stars we go.

481
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:30,180
Through life and death and time.

482
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,480
We make the general expression pass through this force.

483
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:31,480


484
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:31,480


485
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:31,480


486
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:31,780
No

487
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,200
Machines we are sending to the skies above us all

488
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,180
And leave behind those who don't know of the final day

489
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,020
We live in sleep, those who don't know we live at dawn

490
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,020
We are driven by the B-Machine

491
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:09,180
Who are the B-Machine that never stops

492
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:17,180
Machines we are sending to the skies above us all

493
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,840
And leave behind those who don't know of the final day

494
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,500
We live in sleep, those who don't know

495
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,700
Every day we live in dawn

496
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,300
We are driven by the B-Machine

497
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,520
Who are the B-Machine that never stops

498
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:45,020
B-MACHINE

499
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,480
This is Mommy

500
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,180
And the

501
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,860
Lady

502
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,040
1970 in the Fireside Theater's

503
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,440
second Radio Hour Hour,

504
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,900
with Phil Proctor delineating

505
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,760
the way the pink girls and

506
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,840
boys live by the system

507
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,140
of bluff.

508
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,880
Did you know that the pink

509
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,700
girl was found dead in her love nest?

510
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,900
Victim of a brutal attack, no

511
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,900
doubt. Yeah, yeah. They didn't say

512
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,840
who the brute was, but I think he

513
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,780
was the schlumpfer who used to ride back and

514
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,780
forth between West Melbourne and Spitzberg.

515
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,840
I think that was the fella, yes. Ever since

516
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,480
he started spreading those rumors,

517
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,580
about the head schnifter,

518
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,760
there's been a great repercussions

519
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,640
all through the state. You know, I've been hearing

520
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,860
about the schnifter more on the radio this week

521
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,700
than ever before. Do you have one of those

522
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
underground radios? Yes and no, I have a very

523
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,880
small radio, but I keep it in my house.

524
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,760
It's still safe in the neighborhood

525
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,620
where I live. Do you know where I keep my radio?

526
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,760
Where do you keep it? In the potato pit.

527
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,840
In the potato pit?

528
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,840
Yeah, listen. Oh yeah, could I have another one of those,

529
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,660
please? Thank you. Would you like one or two

530
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,520
of these? Yeah, two of those, please. Would you like it with the

531
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,740
lumpen cream? Yeah, the lumpen cream. Yeah, here with the lumpen

532
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,100

Ah, the stoned ranger

594
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,700
is back with us. Yes, wonderful fellow.

595
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,700
Shall I do another one?

596
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,380
Tonto, I think I hear a truck.

597
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,640
Ride on up ahead and find out what

598
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,140
a truck is.

599
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,720
Urantia is of

00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,740
origin in your son.

601
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,700
The Euravia. And your son...

602
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,240
When are you going to settle down here?

603
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,740
...is one of the multifarious offspring of the

604
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,820
Andromeda Nebula, which was one

605
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,860
time organized as a component part of the

606
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,720
physical power and material matter of the local

607
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,480
universe of Nebadon. Yes, mistress.

608
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,920
And this great nebula itself took origin

609
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,580
in the universal force charge of Spacer

610
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,200
and the super universe of Orvanton.

611
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,380
Thank you, Orvanton. Long, long ago.

612
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,440
Long, long ago. Thank you, Jesus.

613
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,240
At the time of the beginning of this recital,

614
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,640
the primary master force organizers

615
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
of Paradise had long been in

616
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,480
full control of the space energies which were later organized

617
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,520
as the Andronover Nebula.

618
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,440
Thank you, Jesus. The Andronover Nebula.

619
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,460
It was beautiful. 987 billion

620
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,040
years ago. Billion.

621
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,540
Associate force organizer and then acting inspector

622
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,640
number 811,307.

623
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,920
811,307

624
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,720
of the Orvanton series traveled out from

625
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,860
Ubarista. 9-0-0-3-8, Jesus. 9-0-0-3-8.

626
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,540
Reported to the ancients of days that space

627
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
conditions were favorable for the initiation of

628
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,680
materialization phenomena. Who cares? Who cares?

629
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,740
In that certain sector of the then easterly segment

630
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,540
of Orvanton. Oh, thank you,

631
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,240
Jesus. 900 billion years ago, the

632
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,320
U-Versa archives testify. Thank you, Jesus.

633
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,600
There was recorded a permit.

634
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,940
A permit was recorded. That's a lie. That's a lie.

635
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,340
There was recorded a permit issued by the U-Versa Council

636
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,580
of Equilibrium. That's a lie. That's a lie.

637
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,360
To the super universe government

638
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,420
authorizing the dispatch of a force organizer and staff

639
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,340
to the region previously designated by inspector

640
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,220
number 811,307.

641
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,360
Thank you, Jesus. Comma 307,

642
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,380
the Orvanton authorities commissioned the original

643
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,440
discoverer of this potential universe to execute the mandate

644
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,820
of the ages of days. He's a liar.

645
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,500
For the organization of a new material.

646
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,700
Portuation, Jesus.

647
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,640
Now I want to tell you.

648
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:40,140
This is part three of the agent and Mr. Dobbs.

649
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,980
The music, by the way, in the background is the soundtrack

650
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,260
from the Kenneth Anger movie called Lucifer Rising.

651
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,640
No connection. Just happened to be a nice long piece of music.

652
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,100
No reason we picked a music of that

653
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:07,240
title performed by that particular set of former Manson family inmates of a

654
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,500
prison. This music was recorded on death row.

655
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:19,380
Anyway, to further on here in the agent and Mr. Dobbs part three.

656
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,960
Bob decided that we would walk while Connie would take their pedicab.

657
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,020
I had never seen a pedicab service here.

658
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,960
And our great nation, although I was beginning to be immune to the insanity

659
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,960
that permeated my experience around the Dobbs.

660
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,280
Is it?

661
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,280
I actually vomited a little in my mouth when I saw the creature that was pulling

662
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,160
the pedicab.

663
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,960
It was a and here it's blacked out again.

664
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,140
A H blanked out.

665
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,060
His mustache was shaved, but it was him.

666
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,360
I could see the stitch mark scars around the top of his head where his brain had

667
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,040
been reinserted.

668
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,220
I was always led to believe that the Soviets burned his body,

669
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:08,260
but sold his brain to us in exchange for the secret that those folks we found in

670
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:15,920
our blanked out New Mexico sold us in exchange for the bodies of their comrades.

671
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,320
What a revelation.

672
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,520
As is known, I lost my big brother to the Germans in the big one.

673
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,620
So every cell in my body wanted to strangle that terrible thing standing by the curb.

674
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:34,840
But seeing him dressed in a tutu with rabbit ears on his head, I was moved to pity.

675
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,980
It was quite obvious that he was near brain dead at this point.

676
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:44,800
He could also, I might add, haul that pedicab pretty damn fast in those six inch stiletto heels.

677
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:51,480
Further down the sidewalk on that moonlit humid night, I had to finally admit to Bob that

678
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,880
Dr. Oswald had stolen all my money.

679
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,120
Bob snickered and nodded knowingly saying,

680
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,320
He is a little worm, but I've got plans for him.

681
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,580
I was pondering this potentially dangerous comment when Bob suddenly stopped and bent

682
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,940
down to tie his shoe.

683
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,480
I then walked to the front when a brick from nowhere hit me square in the head.

684
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,420
Thank God for the steel plate I had placed there after the accident.

685
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,720
For if Bob had not stopped to tie his shoe, I'm sure that he would have been brained.

686
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,960
Although now I wonder if he could ever.

687
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,520
He has the most persistent luck of any man I've known.

688
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,860
When Bob had finished tying his shoe, ignoring my yelps of pain and the violent flow of blood

689
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,780
flowing down my face, he came back up with a wallet.

690
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,380
Miraculously he said that he knew this man, the owner of the wallet, one Dr. Tim Leary.

691
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,700
It would seem that they were old friends.

692
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,800
Bob mumbled to himself that the SOB owed him.

693
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,000
He was a little bit of a fool.

694
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,240
He had to take all the cash from the wallet, a Sandal Warehouse charge card, and a folded

695
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,800
slightly blue tinted piece of paper that was perforated into many small squares.

696
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,320
This object Bob seemed most excited about for he shoved it into his mouth and mumbled

697
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,940
something like let him try to read my mind again.

698
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,260
He then started to chuckle.

699
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,240
He chuckled until we walked into the Tiki Lounge.

700
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,600
At least we had over a hundred dollars in cash.

701
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,380
Bob was already seated at a table with two cabana boys dancing for her.

702
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,100
Bob took me by the arm and led me up to the bar where, filling one hand with a wad of

703
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:48,280
colorful Monopoly money and the other with a wad of strange smelling sticky tobacco and

704
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,600
a chewed up old pipe, he told me to frop up a bit and get something to drink.

705
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,680
He glared over at Connie.

706
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,980
He hitched up his pants and mumbled that he had a little bit of money.

707
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:57,980


708
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,980
He said, I had to take care of a few things.

709
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,800
And damn those boys stole my dance moves.

710
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,460
I found myself engrossed in this strange tobacco.

711
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,140
It was not as the youth of today call Mary Jane.

712
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,960
It had a foul odor and taste, but for some reason I found that it not only soothed my

713
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,240
spirit but that the pipe seemed to be stuck in my mouth.

714
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,620
I was not clenching my teeth down on the stem, yet I could not extract it.

715
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,960
It was as if it gave me a cold.

716
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,320
It was as if it glued itself to my mouth.

717
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,180
That fact made eating dinner rather difficult.

718
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,380
I apparently was oblivious under the influence of this weed when I heard the sounds of breaking

719
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:38,820
glass.

720
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,720
I knew it must be Bob.

721
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,540
Surely enough he had pushed all the plates and glasses off the table and was dancing

722
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,340
with the boys on the table top.

723
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,780
Connie looked away apparently in disgust as she filed her nails with what looked like

724
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,060
the severed hand of a gorilla or some other sort of great ape.

725
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,960
Bob then threw the paper away.

726
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,240
It was a big one.

727
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,240


728
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,860
And I was surprised to find that the paper was covered with a salt shaker which hit me

729
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,040
square in the forehead causing it to bleed.

730
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,520
I must now add that no one had mentioned the fact that my face was already covered in fresh

731
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,740
blood or that I was not wearing trousers.

732
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,980
Bob had still not given them back to me yet.

733
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,340
He yelled to me,

734
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,640
Get those damn Mai Tais.

735
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,620
I have a powerful thirst.

736
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,620
I proffered the monopoly money to the bartender in my fropped up state.

737
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,920
He looked at Bob and back to me.

738
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,940
He shook his head.

739
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,100
He produced a picture of the drink.

740
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,320
There was fear in his eyes.

741
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,600
Is this Bob a member of a criminal group?

742
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,000
The criminal group that does not exist?

743
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,860
It may have been some strange influence of the frop but the 20 feet and the few seconds

744
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,300
that it took to get to our table seemed more like a mile and an hour.

745
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,920
I wonder now if there was not some sort of space-time distraction.

746
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,140
I was not sure if I was being misled by the frop.

747
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,460
When I arrived at the table it was neatly set with plates of appetizers which very much

748
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,440
looked and tasted like flambéed monkey brains.

749
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,980
Tasty though.

750
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,440
Bob's were raw.

751
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,100
Plus there was a youngish looking man that was introduced as Timmy Boy.

752
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:25,320
Bob said that he had big jumbo, big giant colossal plans for him.

753
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,900
He was a big guy.

754
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,580
He was a big guy.

755
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:27,920
He was a big guy.

756
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,660
There was a shopman by the street there named Dr. Tim Leary who's wallet Bob had found on

757
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,100
the street.

758
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,760
I began to wonder if I were being set up?

759
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,100
But reviewing the strange luck that Bob seemed to have I had to admit to myself that maybe

760
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,340
this guy was, more than extraordinary.

761
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,080
He already had shown that at least as much power as the President.

762
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:56,080
Bob did give Dr. Leary back his wallet but claimed that some young punks jumped us.

763
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,920
He pointed convincingly to his phone that they forcibly show to his face.

764
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,400
to my bloody head and shirt stating that my bleeding head was good. I still don't understand

765
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,300
what he meant by that. Dr. Leary tore through his wallet in an angry manner. He grabbed Bob by the

766
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:16,440
wrist stating, not asking, you took the blotter? Bob just stuck out his tongue with the messy,

767
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,540
faded, and chewed wad of paper sitting there. His tongue was extraordinarily long and lizard-like.

768
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:29,260
He snapped it back with a grin. Dr. Leary drew his hands back to himself and pouted. Dinner went

769
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:35,520
surprisingly well. The conversation was adept and civilized, though the Dobbs seemed to have a

770
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,960
language of their own which Dr. Leary and I could somehow follow. The other two disconcerting issues

771
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:48,160
I remembered was that every time I tried to pour a drink for myself, Bob would knock it out of my

772
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,600
hand stating, frat before booze, you can't lose.

773
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,240
Booze before frat, you'll wish you were f***ed dead.

774
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:05,560
The other issue I had was that what I thought was Connie's smooth hand rubbing my knee,

775
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:13,000
she is a knockout, was however, of course, not hers and no, not the gray either. It was that

776
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,880
damned A blanked out, H blanked out, A-H, under the table begging for scraps. I kicked the thing

777
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,520
away, but out of mercy did give it to him. I didn't want to be a burden to him, but I didn't want to

778
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:29,320
give it the cold monkey brains that I could not finish. This f*** has the odd ability to make one

779
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:36,120
hungry but at the same time make the act of eating very, very strange and uncomfortable. I wanted to

780
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:43,300
chew the food but was not able to swallow it. Bob, on the other hand, did eat heartily. A half a pig,

781
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:50,320
all of the raw monkey brains, a light bulb, I do not know where he got it. The tropical flower set

782
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,500
in the table and what I feared to think was a bird's nest. I did not know what I was doing, but I

783
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:52,500


784
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,040
did not know what I was doing. I did not know what I was doing. I did not know what I was doing. I

785
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,040


786
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:04,680
was a human heart raw. A-H had to pull us all back to the Dobbs bungalow. I did not pity him at this

787
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,480
point. For the whole trip back, Bob kept looking up at the night skies, pointing out constellations

788
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:17,980
that were not there, muttering Gort, Klatu, Veranda, Nixon, or something. Whatever was in

789
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,220
the monkey brains he ate sure seemed to have relaxed him, for when we got back to the house,

790
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:28,080
the Grey had messed it up while we were out to dinner. Bob seemed pretty peeved, but accepted

791
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:34,920
this situation with grace. He put on some very strange music on the hi-fi, lounged back into an

792
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,380
easy chair, and lectured me. I quote as best as I can remember.

793
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:52,040
Young man, thou hast muchly to unlearn. I sayest thus out of pure spite. Thou hast,

794
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:01,720
disunderstood everything I haveest revealedest to thouest, which in mine eyes is unre-unnerving,

795
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:09,580
and thou dost screw me over? I replied, Mr. Dobbs, I was sent on a mission that you requested.

796
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,540
I have only held back one truth, and that is that you are a wanted man, wanted by our great nation

797
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:22,060
to smite our enemies. I was told that you have the powers to do that. Then why don't you?

798
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,520
Bob wriggled around in his chair. I feared another dance session emerging,

799
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:36,140
but he seemed un-Bob-like nervous. Look at you, monkey boy. I just ate the brains of your great,

800
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:42,580
great, great uncle with a bit of lime juice. Do you want to de-re-unevolve back into our

801
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:50,200
natural state, or evolve into a pile of ashes? I sat staring at his classical face,

802
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,120
pondering what he had told.

803
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:59,340
Not ask me. His face and body began to shimmer, flicker like a film projector gone haywire.

804
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:07,360
Bob scrunched his face up and let out a fart that literally shook the house. This emission

805
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,940
propelled him up into the air, to the point of hitting his head on the ceiling.

806
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:16,020
He slowly descended back to the exact spot he had previously been sitting.

807
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,620
A change came over him. His eyes had glassed over, and he looked confused,

808
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:25,580
as would an elderly man with dementia. So, he said out of the blue,

809
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:30,240
let's get some hookers. I know of a great place next to Cape Canaveral.

810
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,920
And friends, so ends part three of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs.

811
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:49,200
We will resume with The Agent and Mr. Dobbs part four later. The music in the background, once again,

812
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,600
is from the film The Agent and Mr. Dobbs.

813
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:50,600


814
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:59,140
From Lucifer Rising by Bobby Boussilel. I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing his name right,

815
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,860
but he was one of the main musicians in this. One of the Manson family. I think he was executed

816
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:12,800
or died in jail or something. And this music was done for the movie Lucifer Rising by Kenneth Anger.

817
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,660
Praise Bob, and now this.

818
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,580
The Attorney's Schedule on D-Day.

819
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,820
And Channel 2, Mel Noel. Oh, these are these talk shows.

00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:31,060

That's 90 minutes.

822
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,460
He's going to be on.

823
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,200
This is all the night?

824
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,820
Yeah, this is, right. And then there's that guy on Channel 7, Bishop Fulton Sheen.

825
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:45,440

00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:58,940

Evelyn brought me two coffee cakes.

834
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,520
Why don't you go back to your room?

835
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,180
The donuts, they were very good.

836
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,480
Sunday, April 2nd, I went to Evelyn's free store.

837
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,560
Would you take her back out to the garage, Mel?

838
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,380
I got a dollar from my money.

839
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,780
I had a nice time.

840
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,340
Take her with you.

841
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,520
I had one can of beer.

842
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,920
Oh, God.

843
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:28,220
And on Channel 5, movie, drama, Beyond Help, 1948, a stutterer wins the Medal of Honor,

844
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:31,040

90 minutes.

848
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,060
That's that Bulgarian actor.

849
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:37,420
Yeah.

850
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,220
The bulbous one.

851
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:39,960
Yeah, right.

852
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,340
Taras Bulbous.

853
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,440
Channel 11, there's a movie.

854
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,240
Oh, this is good.

855
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:44,920
I've seen this.

856
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,740

857
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,220

858
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:48,660
90 minutes.

859
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,120
Nice one.

860
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:49,700
It's very upfront.

861
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,560
Takes a long time for us.

862
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,620
There's another good one here on Channel 13, movie, adventure drama, First Man on the Moon,

Right.

868
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,420
One hour, 45 years.

869
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,080
That goes on.

870
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,680
At 1 o'clock in the morning on Channel 2, there's a movie, comedy, Get Your Hands Off

871
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,980
Me, 1952.

872
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,500
The Brunts, a young couple, soon find out that getting a baby means some changes in

873
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,300
their sleeping arrangements.

874
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,180
90 minutes.

875
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,180
Channel 3, there's news with Adolf Schicklgruber.

876
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,580
Channel 4, movie, mysterious.

877
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,520
Oh, this is good.

878
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,560
The Fuse of Doom, 1934.

879
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:33,060

880
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,460
Zeppeler tube.

881
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,160
That's dubbed.

882
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:35,900
Really?

883
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,480
It's dubbed, yeah.

884
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,140
A Wrigley, the serial von electric blessfühn.

885
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,260
Two hours, 45 minutes.

886
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,120
One of those German expressions.

887
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:44,580
Right.

888
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,000
On Channel 5, there's the community security review discussion.

889
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,760
That's with Debuto, isn't it?

890
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,240
On Channel 7, noose.

891
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:51,900

00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,140
The Nun, 1947.

895
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:04,700

896
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:12,160
Joe Masso, Tito Reina, Lily Sanchez, and Buns Rigatetti, my favorite actor.

897
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,320
Buns Rigatetti.

898
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,620
Buns Rigatetti did such a wonderful job in The Glass Thigh.

899
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,620
Did you see him in that?

900
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:17,940
Yes.

901
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,800
Gentlemen, it's very difficult.

902
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,680
It's very difficult for us to talk.

903
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,120
It's a stable when you keep talking.

904
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:21,740
All right.

905
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,240
Will you continue with your report, Bill?

906
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,480
You take Poland and I'll take Grammarly.

907
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:30,620
She tells me the small sun bear was wandering briefly along the streets of Los Angeles.

908
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

909
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,840
And then they returned to captivity.

910
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:33,800
Ha, ha.

911
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,520
Senior Ammonium Control Officer Robert Volker said the bear...

912
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,460
All right, you bear, hands up.

913
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,820
...had been purchased from a pet shop by a West Los Angeles resident.

914
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,760
Okay, put the bear in the back of the car.

915
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,820
...that friendly beast escaped, you know.

916
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,400
And they said that they wouldn't have picked it up even if it hadn't been roaming freely, they said.

917
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,580
Okay.

918
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:48,900
Of course.

919
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,180
They wanted it.

920
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,800
Got to get some bears, yes.

921
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,940
Up against the wall there.

922
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,820
Is that the trouble?

923
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,260
Sure.

924
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,620
Could I have another one of these, please?

925
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,900
Yeah, that's good.

926
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,340
New, new, new demonstration on Channel 13.

927
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:06,680

928
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:15,280
An archbishop hopes to gain control of a device capable of short-sheeting the Earth's electric current

929
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,240
and stopping things once and for all.

930
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:27,080
Philip Progberg, Peter Brimfnick, Harry Anslinger, and Anselmo Pedrazi.

931
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:27,620
Two hours.

932
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,000
And here's the last thing on the tube, 11 movie, astonishing.

933
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,440
Look out for that great big bird, 1958.

934
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,760
Two teenagers discover the secret of the universe on a blind date.

935
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,340
That's with Barbara Bobo and Animal Clackers.

936
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,020
Hmm.

937
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:04,920
I understand, gentlemen, what Jean-Paul and Claude want here is an explanation exactly

938
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,580
of the government.

939
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,820
Would we keep this brief, please?

940
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:10,880
Yes.

941
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,820
Would we just get to the...

942
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,480
What's happening?

943
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,240
Put this in my seat!

944
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,040
Please!

945
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:16,600
Oh, my God!

946
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:17,240
Sit down.

947
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:17,800
Sit down.

948
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,420
Sit down.

949
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,060
Boy, I thought someone had replaced me there for a minute.

950
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,920
I wouldn't have had no identity.

951
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,380
If it was your doppelganger.

952
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,560
Oh, it would have been awful.

953
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:26,660
Yes.

954
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:27,740
Gentlemen, we can't get this...

955
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,040
The chairman is going to read the cheese.

956
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:29,720
Be quiet.

957
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,880
Okay, the big cheese.

958
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,220
I know we're here to...

959
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:32,420
Schnifter.

960
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,580
Yeah, the schnifter.

961
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:34,480
Okay.

962
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,280
To find out as much as possible about the organization of the United Snakes,

963
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,940
as we possibly can, and this meeting, our fourth,

964
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,280
we are taking up, of course, the administrative branch of the government.

965
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,740
Would you mind saying, please, don't you blame us?

966
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,260
The in...

967
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,580
The in box of the administrative branch.

968
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,200
And today we're dealing with the Bureau of Detergents.

969
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:03,920
Now, the Bureau of Detergents is divided into two major subdivisions.

970
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,200
Shoes and the Federal Bureau of Marijuana.

971
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,100
That's yours, Harry.

972
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,760
That's yours there.

973
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,240
Right.

974
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,060
Got that?

975
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,460
Could you go a little more slowly, please?

976
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,320
Then shoes.

977
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,280
Okay, shoes.

978
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,520
Shoes.

979
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:17,520


980
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,900
From shoes...

981
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,620
From shoes we go directly to industry, as everyone knows.

982
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:28,220
And industry is divided into four great subdivisions.

983
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,100
The Belt Buckle Reclamation Service.

984
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:30,900
Oui.

985
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:31,880
Merci bien.

986
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,040
The Regional Wall Board.

987
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,460
The Eugene Petler Fund.

988
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,960
And the Secretary of Communism.

989
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,360
Yeah, of course.

990
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,320
Okay, I think I've got all that.

991
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,440
Would you go ahead, please, now?

992
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,700
The Capitalist Pigs.

993
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,720
Bull's Pizzles.

994
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,000
Bull's Pizzles.

995
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,740
Just a shoe, you nasty...

996
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:50,640
I...

997
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:51,380
I...

998
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:51,860
Turn the hell back.

999
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:52,900
I...

1000
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,260
I...

1001
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:53,560
I...

1002
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,020
I...

1003
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:54,460
Cut off his microphone.

1004
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,520
It's all right, you can go ahead.

1005
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:55,760
Thank you.

1006
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,580
I will.

1007
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,560
There's something wrong with the microphone?

1008
00:50:59,060 --> 00:50:59,780
I started...

1009
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,100
I started...

1010
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:00,520
I started...

1011
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:00,520


1012
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,960
I'll talk that way to me.

1013
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,040
I'll talk that way to me.

1014
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,100
Go ahead.

1015
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:02,940
It's okay now.

1016
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,340
You can go on.

1017
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,040
Cut me off.

1018
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:04,980
I'm sorry.

1019
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,840
Department of...

1020
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:05,880
I'm sorry. Department of...

1021
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,140
I'm going.

1022
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:06,620
I'm going.

1023
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:06,680
Yeah.

1024
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:13,600
Ex and balances goes immediately to the Shoes and Fishermen National Bank.

1025
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,120
Shoes and Fishermen National Bank.

1026
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,520
That's the natural bank actually.

1027
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,300
That's the little half-man, you see, moving down there to the left.

1028
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:18,920
I think the most important part of the...

1029
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,120
I think the most important part of the...

1030
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:19,120


1031
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:19,920
Those three petroleum trucks.

1032
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:20,340


1033
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:25,520
The government to discuss for our own purposes today is the Bureau of Bums.

1034
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,060
Would everybody be in agreement with that?

1035
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:27,820
You bet.

1036
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:28,620
You bum!

1037
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,880
...of the main left vertical that was marked on the good old...

1038
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,460
He's drunk.

1039
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,720
Yeah, I'm drunk at the moment.

1040
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:34,940


1041
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,060
The Irish...

1042
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,760
Ever since we gave him independence, they've been doing nothing but drinking.

1043
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,540
Yes, take care of him, please.

1044
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,200
Now...

1045
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,080
First, this is...

1046
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,440
No, no, no.

1047
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,000
This is a very good example of how we deal...

1048
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,140
how we deal with itinerant persons or bums...

1049
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:46,860
Is it my deal?

1050
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,480
...in the United States.

1051
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,940
Now, here, for example, is this bum over here.

1052
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,260
Itinerant bum.

1053
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,120
Now, he immediately...

1054
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,640
You're welcome.

1055
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:01,320
He will immediately go to one of two places, either the Bureau of Uninhabited Pyramids or the Bureau of Lost Hope.

1056
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,120
Which would you like?

1057
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,600
Oh, well, I think for a start, I would take...

1058
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,500
...on the left one would be the Pyramid One.

1059
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,180
Boom!

1060
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,860
Well, that's a bad choice.

1061
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:09,320
Boom!

1062
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,480
That's a bad choice.

1063
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,480
All choices are bad in the United States.

1064
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:12,880
The Bureau of...

1065
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,320
...Uninhabited Pyramids, of course, will take one to...

1066
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,100
directly to the Department of...

1067
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,460
or rather the Bureau of Cripples in Tomorrowland.

1068
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,720
An unfortunate place to be.

1069
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,660
Cripples in Tomorrowland.

1070
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,860
That's one point for the Cripples in Tomorrowland.

1071
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,820
You have to have a foot pass.

1072
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,700
We go on through that.

1073
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,040
What?

1074
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,620
I don't have to have a foot pass.

1075
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,820
You do to get to the Committee on Nameless Terror.

1076
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,320
You do?

1077
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,200
Yes, yes.

1078
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,560
What if I'm a foot pad?

1079
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,500
Well, beyond the Committee on Nameless Terror...

1080
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:41,060
the last and lowest and meanest department of the United Snakes remains just one.

1081
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:41,680
Yeah?

1082
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,820
The one-eyed whistling queer.

1083
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,380
As a Gregarious with your moon in Uranus and your son in college...

1084
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,280
congratulations!

1085
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,180
But as a person typical of your sign...

1086
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:07,560
you are cautious and concerned about those close to you...

1087
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,720
and in the typical manner of a cautious Gregarion daddy...

1088
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,080
keep in close touch with your loved one lest he go astray.

1089
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,060
I'll remember that.

1090
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,420
Hire a private detective.

1091
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,520
Do I have to write these things down?

1092
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,540
Yes, it's better for you to do that on your hands.

1093
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,900
So when you go to a palmist you can tell him the same stuff.

1094
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,720
You're undoubtedly a strong influence on all those around you.

1095
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,660
Would you mind sitting across from me please, a little farther?

1096
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,320
Anything you'd like.

1097
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:33,700
As a Gregarious fits the face in Leon that makes you even more open-faced than a sandwich.

1098
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,580
You seem to have some mayonnaise on your nose there, fella.

1099
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,280
You're ever-loving, extroverted and inexhaustibly boorish.

1100
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,240
Oh, that's partly right and partly wrong.

1101
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,840
Yeah, I'm sure that's what you think.

1102
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,880
You are the gay blade of the Zodiac...

1103
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,360
but your problem can be cured if you go to a psychiatrist.

1104
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,920
As a matter of fact, I do that on the side. We'll talk about it later.

1105
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,520
You ought to see what side he does it on with the leg lifted.

1106
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,700
Your outrageous good will and infectious hepatitis...

1107
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,140
may scandalize your less enterprising companions...

1108
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,040
and create secret enemies all around you.

1109
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:03,800
Secret enemas.

1110
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,160
Secret enemas all around you.

1111
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,200
But what of it?

1112
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,760
Paranoia never paid the rent, as they say.

1113
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,180
And although things may look bad now...

1114
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:11,180


1115
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,180
Remember, they could be a lot worse and probably will be.

1116
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:14,880
The aquariums.

1117
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,500
So, as if you don't change your ways...

1118
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,980
and due to the subtle but persistent influences of nepotism...

1119
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,220
which rules the flabby part of your thigh...

1120
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,740
and is bulldozing his way into your house of lords.

1121
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,780
So, let's drop this defensive facade...

1122
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:30,760
and open your heart, smart guy...

1123
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,480
to the well-intentioned advice of others like me.

1124
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,000
I'm listening.

1125
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,000
Don't be so stubborn.

1126
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,220
Ask someone your respect for their point of view.

1127
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:37,620
I did.

1128
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,480
After all, you can always reject it later...

1129
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,120
and you probably will.

1130
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:40,760
You're such a loser.

1131
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,600
Nonetheless, you're a natural-born sportsman, buddy.

1132
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,880
You've got a good sense of humor.

1133
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,260
And like Charles Edelman...

1134
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,860
the Australian badminton champion...

1135
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,140
also born under your sign...

1136
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,260
and he was crushed by it...

1137
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,700
you can excel in everything...

1138
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,240
from wife wrestling to shoplifting.

1139
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,420
But all this indecisiveness is not good for your karma.

1140
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,240
And you've got to decide soon...

1141
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,100
before it's too late.

1142
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,660
Speak up.

1143
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,520
And while you're making up your mind...

1144
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,980
you've got to be aware of the suspicious vibrations all around you.

1145
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:04,160
Look out!

1146
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,620
And try, if you can, to avoid morbid situations midweek...

1147
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,180
that may engender lust or envy in others.

1148
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:09,760
I've been watching...

1149
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,520
Beware of walls.

1150
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,420
There is apt to be much unrest in the early a.m.

1151
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,500
so it would be wise to keep your door securely bolted...

1152
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,340
and stay indoors for most of this coming month.

1153
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:18,740
Putter around the house.

1154
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,500
Do those things you've put off for such a long time.

1155
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,640
Attend to manual and service chores.

1156
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,200
If you have a gun, oil it.

1157
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,440
Your birthstone is slate...

1158
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,140
your flower corn smut...

1159
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,460
and your colors, rotted peach and puke.

1160
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,920
The word for the rest of your life...

1161
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,140
I can't even pronounce.

1162
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,280
It's so long.

1163
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,640
It's difíin'.

1164
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:39,640


1165
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,200
I walked back up to the Grassy Knoll again....

1166
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,440
and started heading back down.

1167
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:48,960
I left that group of wacky xanos...

1168
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,880
and the Gazebo and the Sodbuster's museum...

1169
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,460
and that wing-ding nut-bhlenger on the accordion.

1170
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,420
I just didn't know what to think, you know.

1171
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,360
Coming up here, hanging around with the grass and the trees.

1172
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:14,180
it's just natural but these people were talking different and I don't know I'm I'm just interested

1173
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:21,920
in sitting around and and picking my nose and spitting and stuff like that and well it just

1174
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:30,460
made me think an awful lot golly my head got big and well I never knew I had so many ideas

1175
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:37,980
I began to think about writing them down or taking some pictures or getting the tape recorder or

1176
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:46,920
something and then things but well I know I didn't want to mess with them I just wanted to be natural

1177
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:55,200
you know sitting out here with the old rocks watching the clouds roll by but that that old

1178
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:00,440
stranger with accordion why he made me feel like

1179
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:10,640
a little different I I kind of got excited and well I liked it a little bit it never happened

1180
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:18,900
like that before suddenly I began to reflect on my whole life why it was like a rock or

1181
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:28,700
or a polka no my life wasn't like a polka but here it was again and God Almighty

1182
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:42,640
puzzling evidence did that on cassette long before any of us had shows and it shows how it

1183
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:50,140
all fits together Firesign Theater Hour of Slack the Kennedy assassination and uh all the other

podcasts anywhere.

1192
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,200
Thank you.

1193
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,400
Now it's time to

1194
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,520
say goodbye.

1195
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,320
Why? Because we

1196

like you. Goodbye.

1197
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,600
No, no, no, no, no,

no, no. This ends the

1199
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,420
formal questioning. Please undress.

1200
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:00,560
Thank you.
