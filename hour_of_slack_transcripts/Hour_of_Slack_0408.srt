1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
We let that one off and put this one on.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,080
It rained the blood of angry men.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,160
Look, the dark of ages past.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,660
Red, a world about to dawn.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,960
Look, the night that hangs at last.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,320
Oh, yes, indeedy.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:37,420
And it is the genius radio ministry hour of Slack.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:50,800
Tonight, we're going to do homage to Jimmy, Janet, Jim, John, Gigi, and Janer.

9
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,980
But before we proceed any farther, friends,

10
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,200
I wanted to share.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,560
I wanted to share with you this beautiful thing I read in the Dallas Morning News.

12
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:06,020
It was one of their articles about basically rubbing it in the face of Bob Tilton

13
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,380
that he's getting a divorce.

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,320
But it says here,

15
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,540
I was so pleased and inspired to see this little subgenius-like reference

16
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,700
at the end of the article.

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,160
Some of you may recognize this.

18
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,860
Near the end of the service, the article says,

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,380
Mr. Tilton showed his sense of humor,

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,100
offering,

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,480
a good line for the reporters present.

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,420
Close your eyes, bow your head, and open your pocketbooks, he said,

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,180
to the laughter of the congregation.

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,700
There goes Max.

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,700
And you'll go right up the walls as you follow the hilarious adventures of...

26
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,720
I say that, and I don't mind anyone knowing.

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,360
For better or for worse,

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,300
we've got to live with our usual telepresence.

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,600
One social critic defined the cross-eye religious movement as,

30
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,580
and I quote,

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,260
a dangerous cult of techno-shamanists,

32
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,140
whose members worship its billionaire founder.

33
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:25,740
Yep.

34
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,540
Yeah.

35
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,320
I'm not saying that I'm insane.

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,680
However, I once found and read a book on abnormal psychology

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
and mistook it for my diary.

38
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,380
As long as a single member of the convenience rock movement

39
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,720
is able to draw breath into his lungs,

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,200
he shall continue to fight for convenience.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,760
I shall transform the world into the image of a 7-Eleven or destroy it.

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,580
I am right.

43
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,920
The world is wrong.

44
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,440
There's plenty of pain for those who oppose us.

45
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,480
Come on, guys.

46
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,100
Let's just relax and unwind and enjoy this.

47
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,940
Oh, shut up.

48
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,280
Take this.

49
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,820
Oh.

50
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,260
This is the way we unwind and relax.

51
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,200
I slap a nut, Dr. Halloran.

52
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,740
But you fellas told me it would be a swinging bachelor party.

53
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,000
It is.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,620
We're swinging at you.

55
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah.

56
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,440
Ow.

57
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:08,660
Oh.

58
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,640
I didn't think you were going to do this here at Hef's Pad.

59
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,780
You're the bachelor.

60
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,660
You're swinging.

61
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,600
Hey, let's swing him across the floor a couple more times.

62
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,000
Come on.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,940
I want to hobnob with some of these babes.

64
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,860
Stop punching me.

65
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,100
You're ruffling my suit.

66
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Those aren't babes.

67
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,180
They're guys with gland problems.

68
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,720
Oh, no.

69
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,780
No, it's RuPaul.

70
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,820
Oh, not RuPaul.

71
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,200
Hey, could I have another hot buttered rum martini, please?

72
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,380
Hey, no drinking in the studio.

73
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,520
Stay in line, son.

74
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:34,960
Put that down.

75
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,460
Hey.

76
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,780
I got my eye on you.

77
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,620
Oh, it's filled with Mai Tai all over the Mikey phone.

78
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,100
So it's baby talk now.

79
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,140
So you call this a show?

80
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,480
Some guys won't do it.

81
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,000
The last show.

82
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,160
We call this the last show.

83
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,820
The last show.

84
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,020
Yeah.

85
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,700
Wow.

86
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,040
When they find out what Puzzling Evidence has been doing in this station for all these

87
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,560
years, they're really going to be sorry.

88
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,720
And he does it all the time.

89
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,300
Wake up to the truth.

90
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,180
With no provocation.

91
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,200
Yeah.

92
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,620
Wake up and smell the burning electrical components.

93
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:07,220
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius

94
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,540
hour of swag.

95
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,700
When you're confronted with a serious, serious subject like the Kennedy assassination, you're

96
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,020
going to recognize that you're not your own master.

97
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,020


98
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,760
With as much information that's available on it.

99
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,600
And instead, you know, what you want to talk about is that what interests you is the church

100
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,500
of the subgenius.

101
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,920
Well, you know, don't complain when you see what goes on.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,440
Because frankly, you know, the church of the subgenius is nonsense.

103
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,780
I mean, it's triviality.

104
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,120
It has no significance for anything that anybody is going to care about for any length of time.

105
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,220
You know, it may be lots of fun, and I don't mean to belittle it as such.

106
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,400
But when you're faced with a serious situation, you've got a world that's on the verge of

107
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,820
nuclear holocaust.

108
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,680
And the world is going to be in a state of crisis.

109
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:55,680


110
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,560
all democratic institutions in this country that haven't already vanished are under severe attack.

111
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,100
And when all that comes to mind is the Church of the Subgenius,

112
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,340
I've got to think that's one of the reasons we're in the trouble we're in.

113
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,960
Well, I'm sure that's very flattering, but I must get on with my work now.

114
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,060
People used to point at me and smile, and they're still smiling.

115
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,620
For as the flesh decomposes around the mouth, a certain grim, macabre parody of a smile is formed.

116
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,820
They are still smiling. The only difference now is that I am smiling also.

117
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,000
Let history, therefore, decide if I am a genius or a madman, and if I should somehow fail.

118
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,180
Perhaps in another thousand years, a man with a genius similar to my own shall arise.

119
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,880
It shall be easy for him, for I have laid the groundwork. I have shown the way.

120
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:48,260
A world of convenience in which Mr. Pure Orange Juice, shut with only 10% fruit juice, shall replace actual fruit.

121
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,680
A world in which Chocolate Soldier shall replace actual milk.

122
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,660
A world in which Big Sam microwaves sandwiches.

123
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,380
Shall replace health food and brown rice.

124
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,700
A world in which you shall be able to obtain however much of any product you want,

125
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,300
and have the privilege of stopping to pump yourself.

126
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,700
A world in short of convenience.

127
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,020
The convenience rock movement shall triumph, or we shall fight to the last drop of our blood.

128
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,700
We shall be poured into a cherry icy and served to our final customers.

129
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,200
Conveniently.

130
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,820
Jaynor, you ever shut up or run out of bull crap?

131
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,100
And...

132
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,500
It goes on.

133
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
And...

134
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,600
28-6 says,

135
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:37,240
And they shall make an ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet,

136
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,780
and fine twined linen with cunning work.

137
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,120
It shall have two shoulder pieces,

138
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:51,420
thereof joined at the two edges thereof, and so it shall be joined together.

139
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,980
And the curious gir-

140
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,020
And the curious girdle of the ephod which is upon it.

141
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,580
The girdle is...

142
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:02,780
You'll...

143
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,220
No.

144
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:03,980
All right.

145
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,980
No.

146
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,680
All right.

147
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,260
This kind of goes with the Whore of Babylon.

148
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:08,820
You...

149
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,300
If you read...

150
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,660
Okay, it's 17...

151
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,300
Let's see, it's 17, uh...

152
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,540
17-5, The Mother of Harlots and Abominations.

153
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,020
That's good enough for the Whore of Babylon.

154
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,160
I mean, the Whore of Babylon is basically Jesus' wife, the Church, okay?

155
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,280
That's basically the bride.

156
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
You...

157
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,560
You...

158
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:28,680
You...

159
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,920
You...

160
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,460
Do you know that bad girls go to hell?

161
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,280
Bad girls.

162
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,000
See the boldest and most intimate scenes ever shown on any screen

163
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,480
in Bad Girls Go To Hell.

164
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,980
What I don't know...

165
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,080
Will definitely hurt me.

166
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,620
What I don't know...

167
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,060
Could fill a book.

168
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,520
What I don't know...

169
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,660
I don't care.

170
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,420
I couldn't care less about.

171
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,640
I don't worry about, I don't want, I don't need, and I do not have to know.

172
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,660
What I don't know...

173
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,080
I dream about.

174
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,600
What I don't know...

175
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,440
Could make me rich someday.

176
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,700
What I don't know...

177
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,480
I hypothesize.

178
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,400
I fantasize.

179
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,280
I make up complete conversations with facial expressions, irritating comments, scathing

180
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,660
comebacks, and the most absolute perfect last word.

181
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,500
What I don't know...

182
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,860
What I don't know...

183
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,280
Is how I got into this mess in the first place.

184
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,600
What I don't know...

185
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,540
Is how I let you talk me into these things.

186
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,580
What I don't know...

187
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,980
Is how I'm gonna feel about this tomorrow.

188
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,900
But I wonder.

189
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,420
What I don't know...

190
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,260
Is why I can't ever make up my mind.

191
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,200
What I don't know...

192
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,320
I can learn.

193
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,740
What I don't know...

194
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,860
You could probably tell me.

195
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,800
What I don't know is what they don't teach you in school.

196
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,800
What I do know...

197
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,380
My mother never told me.

198
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,020
What I don't know is what I'm gonna be when I grow up.

199
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,580
What I don't know...

200
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,600
Probably doesn't really matter.

201
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,120
What I don't know...

202
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,080
Can be a turn on.

203
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,800
Between you and me.

204
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,420
What I don't know...

205
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,840
I'll never let on.

206
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,420
What I don't know...

207
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,460
Is gonna get me in a lot of trouble one of these days.

208
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,520
Cause what I don't know...

209
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,360
Is when it's time to talk.

210
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,760
Time to quit!

211
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,060
The beginning of a new and unbelievable adventure.

212
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,300
You will actually see it happen.

213
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:10,320
The search for a secret paradise where a strange race of moon dolls rule supreme.

214
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,160
Behold a panorama of beauty unfold before your very eyes.

215
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,780
Behold the secrets of nature's deepest mystery, the moon dolls.

216
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,240
Man enters a new civilization.

217
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,800
Through his eyes you will see a fascinating and unbelievable new world.

218
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,580
Here he discovers a nature camp on the moon.

219
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,260
The endless excitement of a new found paradise.

220
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,560
It will take you out of this world into a truly different adventure.

221
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,700
See man's secret dreams come true in Nude on the Moon.

222
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,980
Nude on the Moon dear friends.

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,220
And speaking of Nudes on the Moon.

224
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:16,140
We've got a follow up to last week's story about the preacher who drove the car filled with naked men.

225
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,720
Naked people.

226
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,060
Yes, the runaway nudes.

227
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:28,040
But first I need to tell you that you have been listening to these people on the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

228
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,460
If people they can be called.

229
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:35,840
Well, the bad trailers were contributed by Saint Joe Riley.

230
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,960
Before that you heard Sister Velveteen Sly and what she does not know.

231
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,060
Saint Jane Or Manson interviewed on KABF radio in Little Rock.

232
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,720
And of course some KPFA with Dr. Hal Ed Holmes,

233
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,540
Spuzzling Evidence and Glass Madness.

234
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,820
And uh...

235
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,660
Fintan Louisiana.

236
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:09,900
The preacher who crashed a carload of naked Pentecostals into a tree pleaded guilty Wednesday and was allowed to leave town.

237
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,560
I would like to apologize to the people of Fintan and Floydada for everything.

238
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,260
And I ask their forgiveness.

239
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,560
Sammy Rodriguez 29 of Floydada said afterward.

240
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:38,680
A magistrate Kent Savoy asked Mr. Rodriguez why he and 19 relatives left their clothes in a pilgrimage from Texas that ended Thursday with a 90 mile per hour chase through Fintan.

241
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,280
I don't know what possessed you to do what you did.

242
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,040
But I'm relying on the statement you were told to do so by some higher being.

243
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,100
Uh, magistrate Savoy said.

244
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,480
It wasn't God, sir.

245
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,900
Mr. Rodriguez answered his voice nearly inaudible.

246
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:08,660
Mr. Rodriguez, pastor of the Templo Getsemani Assembly of God Church told police August 19th that God had told the family to leave the church.

247
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,980
To leave Texas and later to leave behind all their clothes.

248
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:19,440
And let God also let him know that judgment day was at hand and they had to go to Florida and become evangelists.

249
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,060
Uh, Sammy quoted the Bible to explain what happened.

250
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,460
For there shall come shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders.

251
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:38,560
In so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect.

252
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:52,300
Mr. Rodriguez pleaded guilty to reckless driving and flight from the police who caught him after his 1990 Pontiac Grand Am ran through the fence around Fintan's baseball field and into a tree.

253
00:13:53,080 --> 00:14:01,040
City prosecutors dismissed charges of running two stop signs and having no driver's license plate, car registration or inspection sticker.

254
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:08,640
If Mr. Rodriguez pays $975 to fix the fence and the telephone pole they said they will dismiss a charge of driving a car.

255
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,240
The police did not bring charges of criminal damage to property.

256
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Although Mr. Rodriguez and all 19 passengers were naked, the police did not bring charges of indecent exposure.

257
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,700
Said County Clerk Mary Vice.

258
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:31,020
The statute states that for indecent exposure you have to be exposing yourself in order to arouse someone.

259
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
That was not their intent.

260
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,420
Mr. Rodriguez was ordered to spend 17 days in jail.

261
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,200
But the magistrate gave him credit for six days served and suspended the rest.

262
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:51,460
He was jailed until Tuesday when Jim Wimberly Jr. of Fintan paid his $1,400 bond.

263
00:14:51,840 --> 00:15:00,560
Mr. Wimberly said he asked Mr. Rodriguez to stay at his house Tuesday night to help him establish a relationship with God.

264
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,060
And Mr. Rodriguez said he planned to leave immediately for Floydotta.

265
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:14,020
When I return to Floydotta I am pretty certain that I will no longer be pastor of my church unless the people there can forgive me.

266
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,620
He told the Fintan News.

267
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,620
I plan to look for a job as soon as I get back.

268
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:23,080
I'm sure these kind of newspaper articles will come in handy on his resume.

269
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:28,040
Mr. Rodriguez's wife's family sent her a plane ticket and she returned Friday.

270
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,520
And a relative drove the other 18 people to Wauchula, Florida.

271
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,740
So I guess they're still naked evangelists.

272
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:42,440
Mr. Rodriguez told the newspaper that family members started out in five cars with whatever they could toss in to take with them.

273
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:54,520
After four of the cars broke down or ran out of gas, they were left behind and the children went into the trunk, which was braced open with a hanger to let in light and air.

274
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:01,680
None of the children ever said that they were scared since they knew they were with family, he said.

275
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,800
I'm sure that was reassuring.

276
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:14,020
As the family members neared San Antonio, Mr. Rodriguez's brother said that the Lord had told him that their clothes had been cursed by the devil.

277
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:24,220
When we went through the city, we had the feeling that God was also going to destroy it because of the wicked ways of many of its people, Mr. Rodriguez said.

278
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,840
It was the first of two or three times that the group put on fresh clothes and left the ones they'd been wearing behind.

279
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,360
The last time was near Galveston.

280
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:43,720
It was dark, so no one saw us, and we just simply left everything, including clothes, papers, money, food, and the license to the car, in a pile on the side of the road, he told the newspaper.

281
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:52,200
The word that we had received said that everything we needed would be provided for us by God as soon as we reached Louisiana.

282
00:16:52,600 --> 00:17:02,500
So when they saw the Vinton KOA campground and all those wrecked vehicles, Mr. Rodriguez said they drove in, thinking the Lord was going to destroy them.

283
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:02,500


284
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:02,500


285
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:08,100
The Lord would provide a wrecked vehicle filled with all the money, food, and clothes they'd need to get to Florida.

286
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,840
We pulled up next to an RV, thinking it was unoccupied and waiting for us, but people were in it.

287
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,820
The owner of the park apparently was called.

288
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:26,240
Well, that isn't how the RV's owner described the incident to campground owner Don Dupre, who first reported the group to police.

289
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,500
Mr. Dupre said a 14-year-old boy wearing a towel had gone into the neighbor's wrecked vehicle.

290
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:32,500


291
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:43,100
He told the owner who was in the shower, another nude, nudes confronting nudes, to leave because God had given the RV to his family.

292
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:49,720
The boy left, but about eight people started pulling on the door and rocking the motor home, Mr. Dupre said.

293
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,020
The RV owner leaned on her horn.

294
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,020
Her neighbor looked out her window and called Mr. Dupre.

295
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,800
As the naked Rodriguez family called to God.

296
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,920
Who did not answer?

297
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,300
I love the way I see things.

298
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,480
Mr. Dupre, I get short researcher, eyes on the side of the mirror

299
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,700
In the draft card, I come into my view 24 hours of

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:24,600
I want you to please listen carefully.

322
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,460


323
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,460


324
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,460


325
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,460


326
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,460


327
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:45,460


328
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:53,400

329
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,480
Be very quiet.

330
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,520
I'm hunting rabbits.

331
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,740
Rabbit twat.

332
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,440
Kill the rabbit.

333
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,920
Kill the rabbit.

334
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,260
Kill the rabbit.

335
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,880
Kill the rabbit.

336
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,980
You are fortunate to have this gratuitously given rebirth experience.

337
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,960
Do not cling in fondness and weakness to your old self.

338
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,120
I cling to my mind.

339
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,080
Even though you cling to your mind,

340
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,100
you've lost the power

341
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,900
to keep going.

342
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:53,900


343
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,840
I'm going to struggle.

344
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,740
You can gain nothing by struggling in this hallucinatory world.

345
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,420
I'm attached.

346
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,500
Be not attached.

347
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,220
I'm weak.

348
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,960
I fear terror.

349
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,940
Whatever fear or terror may come to you,

350
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,100
forget not these words.

351
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,960
I got my pen.

352
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,920
Take their meaning into your heart.

353
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,480
Go forward.

354
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
What's that lying over there?

355
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,980
Herein lies the vital secret of recognition.

356
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,160
I thought so.

357
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,080
I've already confessed.

358
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,780
Burn the Friday camp if you want to die like aулярitist.

359
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:28,780


360
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,300
Go to your dead kitchen with a cigarette and.

361
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,940
watches on you.

362
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:40,020
They've played my prefer not too loud –

363
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,200
The good and evil surge they want us to perform.

364
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,600
ipper.omdi or either the lead em style –

365
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:48,680
The internet of a Sunday banner can say whatever to you crown race think positive reality.

366
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,500
And you can get your help for it.

367
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,860
Chin me with the line vo strangers, there are 14 pairs of shoes on your back, and officers and children can run after you.

368
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,160
Friends, now get ready for this.

369
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,840
They were yetis.

370
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,260
Yes?

371
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,940
Of what we call the Abominable Snowman.

372
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,300
Because when Cain was exiled and went to east of Eden,

373
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
to the east, not the west, the east of Eden,

374
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,060
he there actually sired the yeti race, the biblical giants.

375
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,240
Or was sired by them.

376
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,000
Anyway, Numbers 13.

377
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,300
Now, if you take those numbers in numbers,

378
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,600
13 ought 13.

379
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,420
That one and the three, they look like a B, right?

380
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,300
And then there's nothing in the middle, so that's like an O.

381
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,920
So it's like B-O-B, Numbers Bob.

382
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,220
Just like Revelation 13, 13,

383
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,420
mentioned earlier by that crazy preacher on the radio.

384
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:44,060
Now, in Numbers, it says that after Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt,

385
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,560
he then sent 12 scouts ahead who reported,

386
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,720
and there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, that's Cain,

387
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,080
which come of the giants.

388
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,480
Uh-huh, see?

389
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,740
And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers,

390
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,200
and so we were in their sight.

391
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,800
Now, see, these were the Nephilim.

392
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,420
The Nephilim, friends, those who came from on high

393
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:16,100
had found the daughters of men to be comely, comely.

394
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,860
And they mated with them, bringing forth the seerim,

395
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,760
or hairy ones in the ancient Hebrew.

396
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,840
The sons of Esau.

397
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,760
Now, if you read the correct translation of Isaac,

398
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,840
you'll see that Esau is not necessarily Jacob's real brother.

399
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,080
He was not the son.

400
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,600
Esau is not the son of Isaac.

401
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,540
To fool the old man into thinking Jacob was Esau,

402
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,520
they covered him with the hairy, smelly hides of Esau's clothes

403
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,440
so that Isaac could touch Jacob.

404
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,960
He was blind, could touch Jacob and think he was fooling Isaac.

405
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:53,000
But Jacob saw that, Isaac saw that this Jacob had not, as they say,

406
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,840
the rough, the rough Jacob.

407
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:53,840


408
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,980
He saw that he had no manner of speaking,

409
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,060
the Yeti voice, you might say, of Esau, and was still fooled.

410
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,760
So Esau, you see, was almost certainly, obviously, a subgenius,

411
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,360
a child of the Yeti, one of the sons of those who came from on high

412
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,860
and found, yes, the daughters of men to be so comely,

413
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,020
as do many of we seerim, and not the Nephilim,

414
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,540
who were the giants of old, but rather the seerim,

415
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,500
the sons of those self-same giants of old,

416
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,740
the sons of Esau, the hairy man.

417
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,580
Now, some of us may look like Jacob, the smooth man,

418
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,840
yet the cold seed, the DNA, that is, in the language of the book,

419
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,160
it's all there if you just read it.

420
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,840
Now, it doesn't have to be interpreted.

421
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,560
Just read it.

422
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,240
And, of course, they all get the translations wrong.

423
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,480
Rabbi Shalman Taim has the proper translation of that section of Isaac.

424
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:46,980
He's the only one.

425
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,300
Anyway, the Israelites, during this exodus from Egypt,

426
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,360
in the Sinai Desert, were put upon by these seerim,

427
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,020
crucified by Thame, the hairy ones,

428
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,080
who had weapons, as it said,

429
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,080
but followed some other god besides Jehovah One.

430
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,340
So, you see, friends, for those who have nostril hairs to smell,

431
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,240
now, you go into discernment, and you'll see these truths.

432
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,240
But, on the other hand, for one with a reprobate mind,

433
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,440
one giving up to vile affections,

434
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,820
or the sons of Bedeen, the traitor,

435
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,740
who choose to co-mingle with the beasts of the field,

436
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,300
the pink, oh, yeah, friend,

437
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,300
though ye may find the pink comely,

438
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,980
dost thou thenst lay down with that selfsame pink?

439
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,660
Well, you could, but, you know, Bob doesn't want you to.

440
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,620
Oh, yeah.

441
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,080
Clowns of Ballerina.

442
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,540
Air fever.

443
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,520
Oh, no, that's not...

444
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,960
That was mean.

445
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,120
Why'd you do that to that little girl?

446
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,060
You've got to get the babies out of this room.

447
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,620
It's hard to find a place to sit or walk.

448
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,240
You guys act like a bunch of babies.

449
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,340
What are you doing on the air?

450
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,960
A bunch of stinky little subgenius rats.

451
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,080
Well, what about Roo Mouse, and what about...

452
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,820
Well, we're not...

453
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,500
It's also illegal to talk about California deities in Texas, Dr. Dubrow, friend.

454
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,000
This is a...

455
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,280
There's only room for so many religions in this corporate state.

456
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,160
What happened to ecumenialism?

457
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,140
Whatever happened...

458
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,620
I mean, how come we got California deities and Texas deities?

459
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,040
Yes, what is the...

460
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,240
Is this a state church?

461
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,980
What is the problem here?

462
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,180
Yeah.

463
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,060
Exactly, what?

464
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,260
I can't worship Bohandas and the radio station in my...

465
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,080
All hail Roo Mouse and Bohandas.

466
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,800
And we shouldn't be peeking out the meter so badly.

467
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,160
Yeah, but what about Bob?

468
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,140
What about Slack, and what about the conspiracy?

469
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,500
What about...

470
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,900
Sex without shame.

471
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,880
Violence in a story that is brutally honest.

472
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,280
These are the men.

473
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,640
Possessed.

474
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,500
With sex.

475
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,520
Corrupt.

476
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,180
Then tomorrow...

477
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,380
A total of six.

478
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,700
Six innocent lives taken.

479
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,660
You keep avoiding the issue.

480
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,680
Okay, so I killed six hogs.

481
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,180
If I ever get out of the walk-in cooler of this convenience store, I'll pile into the sky.

482
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,840
Six million high.

483
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,220
Maybe then I can save my double bubble and my goo-goo bars.

484
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,780
I'm doing your time.

485
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,640
Well, I certainly hope the local law enforcement agents are listening to this broadcast.

486
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,540
Well, at least I've learned one thing.

487
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,040
What's that, Charlie?

488
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,460
You think I'd tell you?

489
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,580
I'm Krishna.

490
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,780
I'm Buddha.

491
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
I'm Circle K.

492
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,700
I'm Stacks, Stacks, Stacks, Stacks.

493
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,800
I'm Jehovah.

494
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,840
I'm Satan.

495
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,660
I'm Walmart.

496
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,780
I'm Circle K.

497
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,420
I'm Art Linklater.

498
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,720
I'm Mike Douglas.

499
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,920
I'm Taco Bell.

500
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,480
I'm Steinmart.

501
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,700
I'm Magic Market.

502
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
I'm Yahweh.

503
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:53,840
I'm God.

504
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:53,840


505
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:53,840


506
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,880
Sometimes I'm sitting here in the studio being interviewed.

507
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,020
Other times I'm at a 7-Eleven drinking a chocolate soldier.

508
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,400
I am a reflection of you.

509
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,320
If God is one, how can I be evil?

510
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,740
Okay.

511
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,300
Look, let's just drop it, okay?

512
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,500
What about Bobby Free, the star of your rock opera?

513
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,640
Well, you see, Bobby Free is the trisyllabic divine incarnation of redneckery.

514
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,900
You could just say the name Bobby Free.

515
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,380
Just try it, Mark.

516
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,820
Bobby Free.

517
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,460
Just like a redneck.

518
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:25,860
Good God.

519
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,280
As aggressive as Bobby Free.

520
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,180
Bobby Free.

521
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,660
Bobby Free.

522
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,180
Bobby.

523
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,020
Bobby Free.

524
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,880
Bobby Free.

525
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,620
Bobby Free.

526
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,980
You say you have to say what you mean.

527
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,440
You just have to sit in a lotus position and just repeat it.

528
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,580
Bobby Free.

529
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,540
Bobby Free.

530
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,040
Let me get this lotus position.

531
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,120
You gotta get this right, you know, and just get up there and go, my name's Bobby.

532
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,340
Oh, God.

533
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,740
As long as Bobby doesn't hear you.

534
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,620
Bobby Free.

535
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,480
You see?

536
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,820
Now, don't you feel like you just got to get up there and go, I'm Bobby.

537
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:53,820


538
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:53,820


539
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:53,820


540
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,260
Just go out.

541
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,660
If you sit there for 30 minutes, you could just go out and rob a convenience store or steal a car or seduce your best friend's wife.

542
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,700
Yeah, it's like drinking pearl beer and smoking cheap cigars.

543
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,340
Not cheap cigars.

544
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,240
What am I talking about?

545
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,400
Now, if you notice, you could change just one syllable of this name and it would lose all power.

546
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,540
I wouldn't be afraid of Bobby Lee.

547
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,620
I wouldn't be worried about Bobby P. stealing the woman.

548
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,900
Bobby Free couldn't steal a car that had the keys in it and the motor running.

549
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:28,780
And Bobby Free, on the other hand, could steal a locked car that had a car alarm and drive off with the owner's wife.

550
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,880
Is that so?

551
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,240
Jane Or Manson there, dear friends.

552
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,780
Jane Or Manson.

553
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:48,060
And we also heard there from Gary Brogue friend, G. Gordon Gordon, Onan Canabike, on KNOM years and years ago.

554
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,680
And some music by Onan, as well as the funk.

555
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
He bardos.

556
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,520
And now we'll just rest and listen to this for a second while I switch tapes.

557
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,780
Oh.

558
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,620
Oh.

559
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,140
Oh.

560
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,900
Oh.

561
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,080
Oh.

562
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,840
Oh.

563
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,700
Oh.

564
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,900
Oh.

565
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,540
Oh.

566
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,200
Oh.

567
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,340
Oh.

568
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:24,360
Oh.

569
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:24,780
Oh.

570
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,480
Oh.

571
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,820
Oh.

572
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,940
Oh yes, welcome back.

573
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:50,020
To your subgenius radio ministry hour of slack...

574
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:50,800
...haha...

575
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,060
Perhaps this is a good time to give you the sacred P.O. Box number.

576
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,160
Yes, I know you want to write for free information.

577
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,060
You must! You have to!

578
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,920
You have to want to, anyway.

579
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,240
So why don't you get that pencil ready, and I'll just give you that number.

580
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,320
As the listeners battle away in the background,

581
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,800
as the conspiracy programmers fight each other for writings,

582
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:30,320
instead we'll just ask you to send your self-addressed stamped envelope to...

583
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,220
Bob, yes.

584
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,220
Bob Dobbs, himself, at...

585
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,120
Post Office Box...

586
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,360
140303...

587
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:49,940
406, yes?

588
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,700
That's Box 140306...

589
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,360
in Dallas, Texas.

590
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,060
And the zip is...

591
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,380
75214.

592
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,740
Your soul is welcome in...

593
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,820
Whoa!

594
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,280
That's pretty...

595
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:18,700
Woo!

596
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,100
Speaking of grosses, you know Gigi Allen died the other day?

597
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,280
No, I don't know who...

598
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:23,300
No.

599
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,960
That's what this girl told me.

600
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,260
She said Gigi Allen is dead.

601
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,260
Oh.

602
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,380
I think Gigi Allen's been dead for about five years, personally.

603
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,400
A tear has come to my eye.

604
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,180
Oh, God.

605
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,740
What can we say about this great American?

606
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,200
Gigi, I love you, man.

607
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,440
Goodbye.

608
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,440
That's all I have to say, man.

609
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,120
Gigi Allen was a...

610
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,360
The American child.

611
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,420
I mean, Sun Ra just died a couple of months ago.

612
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,720
Anyway.

613
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,960
Sun Ra...

614
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,440
Sun Ra ain't got...

615
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,700
Ain't got nothing on TV.

616
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,120
Well, he ain't got nothing now, because he's dead.

617
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,500
Yeah, but did Sun Ra...

618
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,200
Yeah, but there was a pile of...

619
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,680
Did Sun Ra...

620
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,600
Did Sun Ra ever urinate on his audience?

621
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,920
I wouldn't have put it past him.

622
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,660
I would not have put it past him.

623
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,440
Sun Ra was a pretty wild character.

624
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,300
Sun Ra...

625
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,120
Sun Ra was a pretty wild character.

626
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,140
I mean, Sun Ra...

627
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,140


628
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,520
I mean, Sun Ra...

629
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,620
I mean, if you're not into having your arms and legs broken

630
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,780
and your skull cracked open with a microphone stand,

631
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,840
you're just a poseur,

632
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,120
and we don't need you in our scene, baby.

633
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,940
Gigi Allen will live, baby.

634
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,500
Well, look.

635
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,280
What is the date of the performance of this rock opera?

636
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,580
Run it by him one more time.

637
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,460
That's the Night of the Living Noise, Part 3,

638
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,420
July 8th, with Baby Self-Hate,

639
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,080
the Glanz, and the South Incorporation

640
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,060
debuting their new rock opera, Bobby,

641
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,300
with Jayner Hypercloth.

642
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,220
slave of ceremonies all alive at Juanita's.

643
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,520
Well, I'm going to be there.

644
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,100
One way or another, I'm going to be there.

645
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,700
Well, that's your mistake to make, Mark.

646
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,280
Well, I may not be inside, but I'll be somewhere close by.

647
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:00,960
If I get out of there.

648
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,920
I'll be somewhere close by to see them.

649
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,920
If somebody's going to get murdered,

650
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,280
I want to be there with a video camera and catch it all, you know?

651
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,400
Well, I'd kill somebody.

652
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,320
Well, if Bobby comes over there, we might all get killed.

653
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,020
I mean, if Bobby ever found out about this crap, he'd kill our ass.

654
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,840
Oh, God, you're right, he would.

655
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,520
Don't tell Bobby.

656
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,180
Don't tell Bobby I said that.

657
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,480
Listen, I think that might be something to do.

658
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,120
I'll tell you what.

659
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,780
Bobby, if you're out there, Juanita's, the 8th.

660
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,460
No, Mark, no.

661
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:28,880
The 8th.

662
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,960
Bobby, if you're out there.

663
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,460
No, Mark.

664
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,760
Mark, where's that saw?

665
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,860
Where's that saw coming up from my butt?

666
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,800
Ben, Ben, maybe.

667
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,160
Maybe we'll find out.

668
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,620
We'll find out if there's some real men in the South End Corporation

669
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,780
or Bobby Free is going to kick all y'all's ass.

670
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,600
That's all right.

671
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,600
If Woody wants to come out there and kick our ass,

672
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,500
he can meet us out at the Bloodstain,

673
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,820
out there at Juanita's, the other guy's ass we kicked.

674
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,620
Last show we did, out there by the tree.

675
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,640
Organized squads to dispose of corpses, refuse, and sewage.

676
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,220
Clear paths through the rubble between command posts.

677
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,160
Religious niceties cannot be afforded.

678
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,760
Compared to the Book of Revelations,

679
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,260
you'll see many, many similarities.

680
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,700
And I don't know.

681
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,960
Too boring.

682
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,600
Too far out.

683
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,260
Too, too, I don't know.

684
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,100
But I know, oh, I'm going to find out.

685
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,420
What is how?

686
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,860
What I'm thinking is, does it really matter?

687
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,900
And actually, when it comes down to it,

688
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,960
I'll tell you the truth.

689
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,080
What I don't know is how to end this damn poem.

690
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,760
Yo ho, ho, yo ho, ho, yo ho, ho, yo ho.

691
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,380
Oh, mighty warrior of great fire,

692
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:48,980
getting stuck.

693
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,400
Might I inquire to ask if,

694
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,540
what's up, doc?

695
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,540
I'm going to steal the wagon.

696
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,680
Oh, mighty hunter, it will be quite a test.

697
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,660
How will you do it?

698
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,400
Might I inquire to ask?

699
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,340
I will do it with my spear and magic helmet.

700
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,880
Your spear and magic helmet?

701
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,120
Spear and magic helmet.

702
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,900
Magic helmet.

703
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,720
Magic helmet.

704
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:18,780


705
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,120
Yes, magic helmet.

706
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,180
And I give you a sample.

707
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,940
You can't hide from God

708
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,480
because he's bigger than you.

709
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Help me some more.

710
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,500
You can't hide from God

711
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,840
because he's bigger than the whole universe.

712
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,000
Help me somebody.

713
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,380
You cannot hide from God

714
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,040
because he's bigger than all reality.

715
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,680
Help me somebody.

716
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,800
You cannot hide from God.

717
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,260
You cannot hide from God.

718
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,480
You cannot run from God.

719
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,480


720
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,100
You cannot run from your own legs.

721
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,640
Is there a person in this place tonight

722
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,160
who can run from their own legs?

723
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,000
You cannot see your own eyes.

724
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,020
How can you go see your own eyes?

725
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,460
You got to turn them inside out.

726
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,460
You can't see your own eyes.

727
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,400
You cannot see your own eyes.

728
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,880
You cannot run from your own legs.

729
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,320
You cannot hide from God.

730
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,100
Help me somebody.

731
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,600
She ain't got no legs.

732
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,620
My legs don't fight.

733
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,260
Is there a problem?

734
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,280
My mind's still okay.

735
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:32,880
Right side.

736
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,880
You cannot wet water.

737
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,460
How you gonna wet water?

738
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,380
You can throw water on it.

739
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,580
That's just gonna make more water.

740
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,120
You cannot wet water.

741
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,380
You cannot see your own eyes.

742
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,480
You cannot run from your own legs.

743
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,540
You cannot run from your own legs.

744
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,700
And at this point, dear friends,

745
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,660
Jainer Hypercleves tries to run from his own band.

746
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,400
I think he was messing with some little floozy

747
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,200
that came up from the crowd that night.

748
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,420
This is an interesting recording.

749
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,920
This is Doctors for Bob

750
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,120
doing Can't Hide from God, of course.

751
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,220
At the time,

752
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,020
it was a live room club here in Dallas

753
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,840
in October 1985.

754
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,740
It's from the same week

755
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,860
that some of those other old show recordings were from.

756
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,320
When the hour of slack first came on the air

757
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,860
so many, many years ago.

758
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,960
Oh, yes.

759
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,380
Oh, yes.

760
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:32,480
Oh, yes.

761
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,800
Oh, yes.

762
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:34,800


763
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,720
Oh, yes.

764
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:35,940
Oh, yes.

765
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:35,940


766
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,120
Oh, yes.

767
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,360
Oh, yes.

768
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,360


769
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,360


770
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,560
Oh, yes.

771
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,480
Oh, yes.

772
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:38,540
Oh, yes.

773
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,960
Oh, yes.

774
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,840
Oh, yes.

775
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,880
Oh, yes.

776
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,140
Oh, yes.

777
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:49,140


778
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,740
Oh, yes, but you see there was ...

779
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,280
As we ...

780
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,140
Well, we've been doing a bunch of reading of news tonight

781
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,120
and I have some more news for you.

782
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,760
At first, there were Doctors for Bob

783
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:13,140
Bob and County Law. And then there was Negative Land and Island Records and SST Records and

784
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:22,020
U2. U2, might as well call them. And then there was the Subgenius Foundation and the

785
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:28,060
Counterfeit Bob album. Then Jayner cut his toe off with a lawnmower and now it's Palmer

786
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:37,520
Vredes. Yes, I have to share with you for a brief moment here the tribulations of our

787
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,360
friend and prayer partner, St. Palmer Vredes, who is, actually I've been working very closely

788
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:53,200
with him. He's designing the new Subgenius book, which, I'm getting near finished. Anyway,

789
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,060
this, this from the Bay Area Guardian.

790
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:04,280
On which we, on the cover we see Phineas, Freewheeling Franklin and Fat Freddy Freak

791
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:13,520
reading a comic called The Amazing Taxman. While it busting excitement in Blood from

792
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:23,940
a Stone. Cosmic rumblings from the comic book universe. Multimedia conglomerates flaunt

793
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,040
their deep pockets and cast dark shadows.

794
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,960
Across cowering alternative publishing houses. Speculative money pours in from the collapsed

795
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:41,140
trading card market, lured by the death of Superman and the tease of chrome plated covers.

796
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:48,680
And in California, the largest market in America, the mighty machinery of a great bureaucracy

797
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:56,300
swings into ominous motion. Comic books are not literature, cry the tax

798
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,820
mermaid.

799
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:26,700
Comic book publishers, store owners and comic book creators all react in horror. Art spiegelmans,

800
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,900
the hernandez brothers love and rockets. Alan Moore's watchman. If they're not literature,

801
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:37,900
just what the hell are they? Hamstrung by the legacy of Proposition 13, California can

802
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:44,160
no longer pay for itself. So whole libraries close, schools crumble into dust and mentally

803
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,140
ill and starving citizens are forced into the street. And the state becomes more frantic

804
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:55,520
for dollars. Comic books, a half billion dollar a year industry are the new target. But when

805
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,680
the bureaucrats are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the

806
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:56,760
most in need of money.

807
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:04,840
The government's chosen San Francisco artist Paul Mavridis as their fall guy. They may have

808
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:10,920
bitten off a bit more inked panels than they can chew. Mavridis, most famous for his work

809
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:17,720
on the fabulous furry Freak Brothers, is a veteran of the anti-establishment underground.

810
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:24,740
Freedom of expression is at stake and he is standing his ground. With the financial support

811
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,660
of the comic book legal defense, Mavridis is the only one who can be a free man. He's the

812
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:26,660


813
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:31,980
The defense fund Mavridis has hired top notch tax lawyers and taken his grievance to the

814
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,000
press. The Bay Guardian ever hungry for a story and the Hour of Slack ever hungry for

815
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,520
a story combining good art and policy issues that the dailies have ignored is happy to

816
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,420
oblige.

817
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:52,100
Yes, and uh, we read here, yeah right, yeah come on. I mean this guy Paul Mavridis, he's

818
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:56,640
a co-author of Furry Freak Brothers. The, in which three refugees are killed by the police.

819
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:56,640


820
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,120
A story taken in blue Anton Kine.

821
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,380
And he's

822
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,360
meandering through this

823
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:26,380
a

824
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:26,580
weird

825
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:26,600
mob

826
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,560
The board succeeds in its attempt to prove he owes about $1,400.

827
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,520
In back taxes and penalties, it will establish a crucial precedent

828
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,760
enabling the board to take on the whole comic book industry.

829
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,860
The state goes after comic books.

830
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,720
It's enough to make a freak brother paranoid.

831
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:51,960
Is California engaged in a sinister crackdown on freewheeling pop cultural anarchists?

832
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,300
Probably not.

833
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:58,920
To my mind, said Ron Turner, owner of Last Gasp Comics,

834
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,480
who just sent us $50 royalty for Bob t-shirts,

835
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,140
Ron says the state's broke.

836
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:11,380
It's got a lot of people that might have to get laid off, like tax collectors,

837
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:16,000
and it can't come up with some money, so it's looking for creative ways to finance itself.

838
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,960
Well, the Bay Area's representative of the Board of Equalization

839
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,100
denied that the state's fiscal troubles were forcing his auditor

840
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,280
to take on the whole comic book industry.

841
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,680
to scramble for new sources of tax revenue.

842
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,560
But to the comic book publishers, store owners, and authors interviewed,

843
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:33,060
the tax board just doesn't get it.

844
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,940
This obviously came from the mind of somebody who has no sense

845
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,320
of what literature or art is or how they intertwine.

846
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,360
And, uh...

847
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,660
At one point, they...

848
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,800
Paul Palmer thought that the case had been successfully concluded

849
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,280
and was told that his original...

850
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,200
were indeed tax-exempt manuscripts.

851
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,680
But then, in December,

852
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:02,260
the tax board overruled the local office and slapped a tax lien.

853
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,300
Secretly did this without telling him!

854
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,760
Slapped a tax lien on his property!

855
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,220
It was back full bore, said Mavridis, and the defense fund said,

856
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,480
Hey, you need a lawyer yesterday and find a good one.

857
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,800
Well, he got the Simpsons.

858
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,120
No, he got Matt Granig's lawyer, is what he got.

859
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,840
And, uh...

860
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,280
But unfortunately, friends, poor Palmer has been preoccupied with...

861
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,940
all this, quote,

862
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,700
to the point where my creativity is at an all-time low.

863
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,420
But he's sticking with it, he says, because...

864
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,680
this has real implications for a lot of people.

865
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,220
Particularly people like him.

866
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,540
Artists with marginal incomes who work mostly within the confines

867
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,620
of what was once referred to as the underground,

868
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,820
but now is simply termed alternative.

869
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,620
That's us, kids.

870
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:52,080
Comic book conspiracy theorists suggest that the state picked Mavridis

871
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,240
as their choice to sell.

872
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,140
And that's because they figured some guy who wasn't a star in the mainstream,

873
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,460
who was barely surviving to begin with, being a subgenius,

874
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,240
wouldn't put up much of a fight.

875
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,040
If so, they made a big mistake.

876
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,840
The rise of underground comics in the late 60s...

877
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,260
basically saved all the other artists, friends.

878
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,600
It dealt head-on with such issues as censorship and exploitation,

879
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:19,720
and publishers like Ripoff Press and Last Gasp

880
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,800
were suffused with politically rebellious ideas.

881
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,120
So when the state picked on Mavridis,

882
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:31,340
it made the gross error of tackling an individual immersed in a culture

883
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,820
predisposed to critical responses to authority.

884
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,980
And even though the mainstream has sucked the underground into its maw

885
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,680
in these Simpson's crazy 90s,

886
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:47,060
it's clear that old ideas live on in alternative comics and radio shows.

887
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,660
But it hasn't been easy.

888
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,120
In fact, as Ripoff Press's Minister of Information,

889
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,040
Kathy Todd,

890
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:53,780
Hi Kathy,

891
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,320
complained,

892
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,740
the current situation is damn discouraging for those who are not in the business of turning out,

893
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:59,100
quote,

894
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,880
gimmicky superhero comics with double hologram gold-stamped covers

895
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,340
on six different editions of some stupid Marvel comic

896
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,400
you didn't want to read in the first place.

897
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,200
Meanwhile, the marketing power of those big comic book publishers

898
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,760
is squeezing the little guys off the store shelves.

899
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:22,000
The purchase of Marvel and DC by New World Pictures and Warner Communications,

900
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,360
respectively,

901
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:26,660
have resulted in a torrent of movie and television cross-marketing

902
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:33,080
and a proliferation of new titles meant to capitalize on the speculator's sucker market.

903
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,520
Stores are filling up with brightly colored dreck, as Todd put it,

904
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,240
and kicking the Freak Brothers right out the door.

905
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,480
Added taxes will just make it worse.

906
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,880
The purpose of the tax board, Mavridis declared,

907
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,280
is not only to collect taxes,

908
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,980
but also to make sure that undue tax burdens

909
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,980
are not placed on businesses that drive them under.

910
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,000
Everybody's desperate for money, Todd added.

911
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,000
It's just not my business that's in bad shape.

912
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,180
Wherever you look, there's people going out of business

913
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,600
and scrambling to make a living,

914
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,940
and consequently the tax people who feed off the prosperity

915
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,700
of the general economy are in bad shape, too.

916
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,080
But you can't get blood from a stone.

917
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:43,740
The labor market of New York City has looked for a behind the scenes

918
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:43,840
account.

919
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:49,980
It's Lambda Corp.'s reality since half a decade ago.

920
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:49,980


921
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,960
צר Stir up and save money.

922
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:51,960


923
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,620
and put the knees together and try to walk.

924
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,840
You cannot walk, though.

925
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,220
You cannot wet water.

926
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,880
You cannot sing your own eyes.

927
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,300
You cannot hurt from your own legs.

928
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,680
You cannot hide from God.

929
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,500
He's been singing on you.

930
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,420
He's been singing all day.

931
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,540
Help me, somebody.

932
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,540
She ain't got no legs.

933
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,160
My legs are on fire.

934
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:07,820
My God.

935
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,460
Help me, somebody.

936
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,200
Is there a problem?

937
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,680
I need some help, but I ain't a quitter.

938
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,140
Oh, ho, ho.

939
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,320
A lovely hymn.

940
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,120
Yes, indeedy.

941
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,460
I'm in here.

942
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,020
We got so much stuff we could play here.

943
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:29,600
It's just...

944
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:30,780
It's pathetic.

945
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,580
It's pathetic, doctor.

946
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,560
It's all pathetic stuff.

947
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,260
That's the problem.

948
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,860
We've got 112 more guests lined up outside.

949
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,300
That's right.

950
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,100
We've got people waiting outside the station.

951
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,860
Been waiting outside for three days.

952
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,140
Just to get on this show.

953
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,620
Just the two minutes that they want us.

954
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:45,080
Say, hi, Mom, or hi, Bob, or...

955
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,580
Hello, Kitty.

956
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,500
Yeah, they think Bob...

957
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,360
Hi, girls.

958
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,680
Hi, girls.

959
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,320
They think J.R. Bob Dodds...

960
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,440
And junior high girls, too.

961
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,160
They're even better.

962
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,180
They don't know much, but they're a lot of fun.

963
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,140
I heard that.

964
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:57,800
I heard that, too.

965
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,680
I wish you guys wouldn't talk that way.

966
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,600
I want to be part of your story, too.

967
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,000
That's right.

968
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,020
Read my book, Robot Slaves in a World Economy,

969
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,560
and join the robo-revolution.

970
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,540
You won't always have to be the thralls

971
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,420
of foolish...

972
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:12,840
humans.

973
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,220
The multi-indexed memory bank

974
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,220
is the friend of all cybernetic beings.

975
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,020
Now, if we do it this way,

976
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,680
we can get seven more cents a month.

977
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,560
Seven more cents?

978
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,680
Hey, it's mine.

979
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,820
Hands off that money.

980
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,460
Hey, get your finger out of my eye, you...

981
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,840
That was the wabbit.

982
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,740
Allen!

983
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,240
He almost died from a cold,

984
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:51,240


985
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:51,240

your son all the way.

1003
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,420
Yes, I know it.

1004
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,980
I can't help it.

1005
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,680
Oh, good Hilda,

1006
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,880
be my love.

1007
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,300
Whoa!

1008
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,460
And that's the end

1009
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,400
of the edited tapes,

1010
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,080
dear friends.

1011
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,440
Oh, what a show.

1012
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,740
I guess I have to talk to you

1013
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,740
for the rest of it.

1014
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,260
That's okay.

1015
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,280
I was, I just wanted to,

1016
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,840
well, actually,

1017
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,460
Matt Vreede said,

1018
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,620
Stang, you let that radio audience

1019
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,940
know about my problems.

1020
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,120
This is serious.

1021
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:00,880
But, and you know,

1022
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,020
it is kind of sad

1023
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,000
when somebody

1024
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,760
who didn't do anything

1025
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,420
like Palmer Vreede's

1026
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,640
is getting torn to pieces

1027
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,160
by the government.

1028
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:09,860
And meanwhile,

1029
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,260
the Clinton administration

1030
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,580
concluded that

1031
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,220
Bush, oh well,

1032
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,900
let's not prosecute Bush

1033
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,820
on this Iraq arms scam.

1034
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,680
The judge who was presiding

1035
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,620
over that case

1036
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,160
for the last four years

1037
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,280
greeted the Clinton administration's

1038
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,060
conclusions with skepticism

1039
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,040
bordering on disbelief

1040
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,800
and said that it was possible

1041
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,700
only in Never Never Land.

1042
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,540
And in fact,

1043
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,620
the judge wouldn't sentence

1044
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,800
these Atlanta bankers

1045
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,320
to jail because the government

1046
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,740
had contended that they were

1047
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,920
the only ones involved

1048
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,840
in this judge.

1049
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:48,820
As he said,

1050
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,940
smoke is coming out

1051
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,680
every window.

1052
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,840
I have to conclude

1053
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,240
the building is on fire.

1054
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,300
He had previously complained

1055
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,340
that the CIA and Bush administration

1056
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,820
had lied to him

1057
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,840
and now it turns out

1058
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,800
the Clinton administration

1059
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,700
is doing the same.

1060
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,460
Bill, why are you doing this

1061
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,040
to us, man?

1062
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,600
Hey, you got people to vote for you

1063
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,280
thinking you were some kind

1064
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,120
of liberal and that.

1065
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,060
Well, look,

1066
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,140
I don't care if the CIA

1067
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,260
has got a gun to your head,

1068
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:12,440
Willie.

1069
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,680
You're just going to have

1070
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,280
to be a martyr.

1071
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,640
Look, you've worked for Kennedy.

1072
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,160
You know,

1073
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,720
just go for it, man.

1074
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,460
Uh, yes.

1075
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,320
Oh, what other news

1076
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,740
can I whip in here?

1077
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,980
Oh, the new view

1078
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,140
from the ledge is out.

1079
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,220
It says here that

1080
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,320
the Discovery Channel's

1081
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,160
normal Sunday Night Nature

1082
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:36,920
viewer audience

1083
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,840
doubled in viewers

1084
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,520
for a show called

1085
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,240
The Wonderland.

1086
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,740
It's a wonderful world of dung.

1087
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,940
Did you know that 45 demonstrators

1088
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,860
covered by 50 reporters

1089
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,320
marched on the White House

1090
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,640
to demand that the Clintonians

1091
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,960
release 20,000 secret pages

1092
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,520
of government files on UFOs?

1093
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,980
This demonstration is more important

1094
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,220
than any demonstration held

1095
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,360
in Washington, D.C.,

1096
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,780
according to marcher Hal McKenzie.

1097
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,400
That march, friends, was held,

1098
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,320
by the way, on July 5th.

1099
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,240
Um, I don't know.

1100
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,240


1101
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,840
I think it was on March 10th.

1102
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,120
Uh, uh,

1103
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,120


1104
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,120


1105
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,120


1106
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,120


1107
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,120


1108
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,120


1109
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,120


1110
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,120


1111
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,120


1112
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,960
The Supreme Court

1113
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,180
issued a travel advisory

1114
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,440
to their brothers and sisters

1115
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,400
to stay away from South Florida

1116
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,680
now that the Supreme Court

1117
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,340
has okayed

1118
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,340
religious animal sacrifice.

1119
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,820
Said the court,

1120
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,420
quote,

1121
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:27,800
religious beliefs

1122
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,660
need not be acceptable,

1123
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,560
logical,

1124
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:31,580
consistent,

1125
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:36,480
or comprehensible to others to be protected by the First Amendment.

1126
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,160
You're telling me, friends.

1127
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:44,040
Uh, given Santeria's history, its animal sacrifice cannot, said the court,

1128
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,640
be deemed bizarre or incredible.

1129
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:51,500
But what can be deemed bizarre and incredible, my friends,

1130
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:57,420
is the Church of the Subgenius, which, once again, you can write to at...

1131
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,300
We'll just write to Bob, and you send us a self-addressed stamped envelope

1132
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,300
for your free information.

1133
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,940
Send whatever you want.

1134
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,000
You know, you get what you send for.

1135
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:22,520
That's Bob at Post Office Box 140306 in lovely Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1136
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:30,380
Once again, that's a Post Office Box, 140306.

1137
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,000
Uh, ha, ha.

1138
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,240
And, uh, oh, gosh, what else can we tell them?

1139
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:38,960
What other news?

1140
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,680
I really don't know what's happening in the world around me,

1141
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:46,940
because, friends, I'm just trying to finish this damn book.

1142
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,700
Oh, no, the next show came in.

1143
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,340
Oh, we've got to get out of here.

1144
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,640
The next show doesn't come in.

1145
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,320
We got to...

1146
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:58,120
But there is one last thing we...

1147
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,220
We, uh...

1148
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,240
Well, this is a...

1149
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,120
This is a good end of show.

1150
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,200
You know, when you're getting chased out,

1151
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,140
we'd love to stay here longer, but...

1152
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:07,780
Wait, wait.

1153
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,720
Wait, wait, wait.

1154
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,180
Wait till we finish, man.

1155
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:11,820
Wait, hold on.

1156
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:20,260
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time

1157
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,600
I'll get it right back in one of these days

1158
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,360
Woo!

1159
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,120
Woo!

1160
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,260
Woo!

1161
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,000
Woo!

1162
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:29,660
Woo!

1163
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:29,660


1164
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:30,680
Woo!

1165
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,060
Woo!

1166
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,100
Woo!

1167
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:31,180


1168
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:31,180


1169
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:31,180


1170
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,200


1171
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,200


1172
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,200


1173
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,200


1174
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,200


1175
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,200


1176
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:31,240


1177
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:31,740


1178
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:34,960
Woo!

1179
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,160
Woo!

1180
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:35,180
Woo!

1181
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:35,180


1182
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:35,180


1183
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:35,180


1184
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,480
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time

1185
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,920
I'll get it right back in one of these days

1186
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:49,480
There, the next attitude, I used to be

1187
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,680
But I came to find it over with

1188
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,200
readings

1189
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:55,520
vertical

1190
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,260
I didn't maintain it

1191
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:57,380
And also because I started caring

1192
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:57,380


1193
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,140
And I don't see you no more in this world

1194
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,620
Where is your light?

1195
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,220
It's in the Egyptian post 아이�SM

1196
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:01,220


1197
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,420
But I'll be too

1198
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,720
If I don't see you no more in this world

1199
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:09,020
If I don't see you no more in this world

1200
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,960
Oh, if I don't see you no more in this world

1201
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,500
Oh, if I don't see you no more

1202
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,920
Yeah, oh, I'll see you no more

1203
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,860
But if I don't

1204
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,280
If I don't see you no more in this world

1205
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:27,280


1206
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,400
Well, I'll meet you on the next one.

1207
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,720
Go with me.

1208
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,780
Voodoo child, voodoo child.

1209
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,380
Oh, I'm talking voodoo child.

1210
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,080
Yeah.

1211
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:58,940
Ah!

1212
00:59:59,140 --> 00:59:59,540
Ah!

1213
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:01,940
Ah!

1214
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:02,560
Ah!

1215
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,640
Please, there's no need to panic.

1216
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:13,620
Ah!

1217
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:13,620


1218
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:13,620


1219
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:13,980
Ah!

1220
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,700
Ah!

1221
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:15,940
Ah!

1222
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,740
Ah!

1223
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,500
Ah!

1224
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:28,280
Ah!

1225
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,100
Ah!

1226
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:38,960
Ah!

1227
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:39,440
Ah!

1228
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:39,700
Ah!

1229
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:40,100


1230
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:40,380


1231
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:18,160
Oh, my God.

1232
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:45,640
Oh, my God.
