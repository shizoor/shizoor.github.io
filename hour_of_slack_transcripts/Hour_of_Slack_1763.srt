1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,940
My friends, it is very simple.

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,500
It's not hard to understand at all.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,460
Brought to you by nobody.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,480
Hi, Bob.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,660
Thank you, Lemur.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:25,980
Friends, some of you may have heard me whining and griping about how this dang show is taking too dang much time from books that we'd like to be publishing,

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,420
and that I was going to have to streamline some things or use more reruns or something.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,520
Well, this one is streamlined.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:45,040
That is, it's basically an uncut 45 minutes with Lonesome Cowboy Dave on the phone, followed by a Psychoskeletons instrumental.

10
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:55,480
But it starts with a 10-minute orchestral suite by the Rudy Schwartz Project called Demonstration.

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,380
Demonstration of the Peach and the Brush.

12
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,080
Demonstration of the Peach and the Brush.

13
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,360
Demonstration of the Peach and the Brush.

14
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,440
Demonstration of the Peach and the Brush.

15
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,460
Demonstration of the Peach and the Brush.

16
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,440
Demonstration of the Peach and the Brush.

17
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,000
Demonstration of the Peach and the Brush.

18
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Demonstration of the Peach and the Brush.

19
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,540
Well, how do you feel?

20
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:23,300
Every time you play this record, you will derive greater benefit from it, both physically and psychologically.

21
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,140
Thank you.

22
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:09,660
Thank you.

23
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,040
Thank you.

24
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,360
Thank you.

25
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,760
Thank you.

26
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,280
Thank you.

27
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,800
Thank you.

28
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,940
Thank you.

29
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,180
Thank you.

30
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,360
Thank you.

31
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,820
Thank you.

32
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,520
Thank you.

33
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,520
Thank you.

34
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,520
Thank you.

35
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,540
Thank you.

36
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,840
Thank you.

37
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,620
Hello?

38
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,340
It's Dave.

39
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,060
Who's the faster?

40
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,220
He's the faster?

41
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:11,900
Hell, why?

42
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,140
That's not the same thing as I was saying.

43
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,300
It's just saying when you talk to people, I say, hey, what's up, or something like that.

44
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,380
You say, that means what's lost.

45
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,760
And then they come back to you.

46
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,380
The dog got lost.

47
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,260
And you're supposed to go, oh, and point fingers at each other and make these huge excretions.

48
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:48,480
You know, like these F-P-H-A-R-T-Z that are so loud and menacing that they made schools close.

49
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,220
Those Germans are a funny race.

50
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,160
Yeah.

51
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,640
Yeah, yeah.

52
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,260
Pick a liver.

53
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,340
Pick a liver.

54
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,680
See, I made a poem.

55
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,840
That was well said, too.

56
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,580
I have to concur with Montage on that one.

57
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,680
Actually, it's pretty bad.

58
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,900
I think I pretty much kind of ruined the last line.

59
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,320
Well, it's a difficult last line.

60
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,000
It's not for Slovan or Pokemon or something like that.

61
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,160
It could have been something shorter, like, and all the while his loins are quiver.

62
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,660
Yeah.

63
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,680
It's only funny because it's said in this silly, semi-German sounding accent.

64
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,540
Yeah, it's like Lolita, only without the hair lip.

65
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,720
Well.

66
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,560
I mean, wow.

67
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,360
Yeah.

68
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,660
The movie's never as good as the comic book, you know.

69
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,940
The movie's never as good as the video game.

70
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,600
It's getting that way.

71
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,160
Well, I'm hearing a buzz now.

72
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:06,900
That must be.

73
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,580
How come I didn't hear a buzz when you called me back?

74
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,360
I'm sorry.

75
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,920
I'm listening for the buzz.

76
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:23,520
I heard that if you do focus on the buzz in a form of meditation, you'll get three wishes from a genie in a bottle.

77
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,480
I don't know if it's the same bottle we all drank from, or.

78
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,640
Well, I mean, at least you'll probably get the bottle.

79
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,940
The genie is not really guaranteed.

80
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:51,000
Do you think you can close off a city of, say, 21 million people, a conglomerate of cities running into each other, of going to about 20 million people and, you know, say no viruses will be allowed to go in there?

81
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,200
I have no idea what you're talking about.

82
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,640
Although.

83
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:06,580
Although it calls to mind the predicament of the people in Wuhan, China, who are all dying of a huge infectious Contrero virus.

84
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,800
Isn't that what it's called?

85
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,040
Yes.

86
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,760
No walruses?

87
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,860
Oh, no viruses.

88
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,320
Sorry.

89
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,600
Well, some people call it a Cervasivirus because you drink it daily.

90
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,760
Like you drink soporific milk if you were an underage child.

91
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,160
Wow.

92
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,820
Some kind of buzz just came in sounding like a tidal wave, Dave.

93
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,300
Yeah, it's very loud right now.

94
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,100
Or a Boeing 747.

95
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,160
Yeah, it's pretty loud.

96
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,840
That's strange.

97
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,120
What did you do?

98
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,520
Your phone needs a bath, Dave, or else you do.

99
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,860
Or a degausser.

100
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,600
I remember my friend from Romania, Moodoo, or Hoodoo, whatever his name was.

101
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,660
I forget his name now.

102
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,400
But he made some pretty strange salami sandwiches and some packs with the devil that you just would not.

103
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,180
You couldn't believe because you're incapable of believing it.

104
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,480
Well, packs with the devil and salami sandwiches do go together.

105
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,600
However, the drone buzz returned and then it left.

106
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
For a few moments, you had the...

107
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,620
Yeah, it got replaced by the sound of crunching cardboard.

108
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,560
It sounds like somebody crunching up cardboard on and off in the background.

109
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,940
That's the illegal immigrant business you've got going in the basement.

110
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,660
You've got 20 young Polish girls down...

111
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,080
That's your basement, Dave.

112
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,840
Working for $2 a week.

113
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,860
His dementia is getting so much worse so fast.

114
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,780
That's your basement, Dave.

115
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,020
We don't have Polish girls in Texas.

116
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,820
You're in Cleveland, remember?

117
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,860
That's where they keep all the Polish girls.

118
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,340
Okay, maybe they're from Oaxaca then, or...

119
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,460
God, listen to that.

120
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,500
I think he's...

121
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,260
Well, you want to go on the other phone?

122
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,680
I think his phone has that Nora...

123
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:47,800
What is the...

124
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,020
It's a new name for...

125
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,860
Darn it.

126
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,860
Coronavirus, it's called.

127
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
That's my report.

128
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,660
One of my...

129
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,240
Right-wing correspondents who I never respond to,

130
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,440
and I don't really want to read this horrible stuff that he sends 10 times a day,

131
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:12,320
he was basically informing us all that we're all going to die.

132
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,420
Jeez, thanks for reminding us.

133
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,760
It's not like something we could get out of if he didn't...

134
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,860
Well, no, he meant of this virus.

135
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,460
And his main complaint was not that everybody was going to die,

136
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,440
of this terrible disease,

137
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,560
but the Hillary press didn't know how to report it,

138
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,240
even though it's the most important news happening.

139
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,700
Oh, the other most important news he said,

140
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,860
oh, she also blamed us not knowing on the liberal press,

141
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,800
the Hillary press,

142
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,520
which is all press that's not extremely right-wing biased.

143
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:45,880
I see.

144
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,360
Yeah.

145
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,840
He said that they've invented a cure for cancer in England.

146
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,200
Oh.

147
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,440
Actually, even the British...

148
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,980
The British tabloid that he was getting this news from said,

149
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,360
we think maybe this could be really good.

150
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,520
It did seem like it was some magic cure-all for cancer,

151
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,820
which, of course, makes the whole story suspect.

152
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,800
Yes.

153
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,060
And the fact that it comes from a, you know,

154
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,520
the Daily Mail or something like that makes you kind of...

155
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,840
Which is like the British Inquirer.

156
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,400
Yeah, it's kind of like getting your news...

157
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,440
This is a liar rag, and it has all these stories like Russian diplomat is actually alien,

158
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,580
and they'll do a really poorly Photoshopped...

159
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:30,300
Copy picture, like have a real high forehead, like it's full of brains that are bad brains.

160
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,680
Well, that is how they look.

161
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:32,900
Well, yeah.

162
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,740
I don't know why they have to Photoshop them.

163
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,220
They got plenty of pictures of them.

164
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,560
Oh, it's called the royal family.

165
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,220
Yeah, that's what I could never figure out either.

166
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,120
The deformed-looking skulls.

167
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,600
I don't...

168
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,460
That's another thing.

169
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,380
Why are people so stupid that even in this country,

170
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,680
they have to constantly be harping about these two British royals

171
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,440
that decided they'd had enough of that hogwash and moved to Canada?

172
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:54,620
Canada.

173
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,400
Big deal.

174
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,140
Good for them.

175
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,280
Canada is more anti-monarchal,

176
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,140
even though it's supposed to be policy in the United States

177
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,360
that we defeated the British crown and got our freedom and stuff like that.

178
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,460
Canadians are far more anti-monarch than we are.

179
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,100
It is America.

180
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,360
We have some kind of really stupid...

181
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,620
Try jumping up and down.

182
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,740
Your voice is getting worse.

183
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,740
Want to try it on the...

184
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:24,780
Cell phone?

185
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,340
I guess so.

186
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,800
Okay.

187
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,860
I'll call you on your cell phone.

188
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:30,940
Okay.

189
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,840
I look...

190
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,020
Okay.

191
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,900
Okay, mate.

192
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,220
All right.

193
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,800
Now I can turn the music back up, Princess.

194
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,040
Oh, you put the music away because of the drone?

195
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,680
Yeah, it's just too much.

196
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,840
There's just too much.

197
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,160
I mean, I'm deaf.

198
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,420
I can't hear everything at once anymore.

199
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:47,780
I wonder.

200
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,680
I'm lucky to be able to hear one thing at a time.

201
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,360
I wonder.

202
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,200
The music in the background.

203
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,160
The music in the background is...

204
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,360
Why did I push that button?

205
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,160
Einstein's Secret Orchestra, witch disco album,

206
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,620
which has Dave playing guitar on it.

207
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,000
Now I've just got to get Dave at home.

208
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,080
It sounds very witch disco-y.

209
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,920
Butchkin's Pizza Pad.

210
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
Hey, man, did you uncop a buzz?

211
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,120
I uncopped a buzz.

212
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,820
What I thought was really weird is as soon as I hung up,

213
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,360
I thought maybe I'd give it a little chance to see if I could sneakily...

214
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,440
hear it not buzzing.

215
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,920
And it was not buzzing.

216
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,020
Well, no, after you hang up, it'll quit buzzing.

217
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,000
That's for sure.

218
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,660
That's the wonderful thing about the buzz.

219
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,400
At least you won't hear it when you hang up.

220
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,860
But the sound now, it is clear.

221
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,800
Well, but this is a different phone.

222
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,220
Oh.

223
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,180
Yeah, but it returned and then it went away again.

224
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,960
That's what I'm saying.

225
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,220
Seems to have a mind of its own or some other false venusial article.

226
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,260
Dave, if it has a mind of its own, it's the only one in the house.

227
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,800
With any mind at all.

228
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,880
It is.

229
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
Well, at least I'm safe.

230
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,340
Somebody is right.

231
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,780
You want to put it that way?

232
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,780
It's good to have a mind in the house.

233
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,200
Yes.

234
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,220
A mind.

235
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:11,980
A mind.

236
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:17,400
It sounds like a drug you'd taken in the late 20,000, 20 thousands.

237
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,880
A mind.

238
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,600
I'm sorry.

239
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm sorry.

240
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,720
Look, I didn't get my dose of a mind today.

241
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,020
So I have a small mind.

242
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,400
I have a long mind instead of...

243
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,740
I was just going to do a comparison of realistic dementia commercials.

244
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,500
They're like so-and-so with so-and-so can help with dementia.

245
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,560
Anybody who knows anybody who's had dementia that you have to stay clear of knives and

246
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,760
baseball bats and football shoes and...

247
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,540
Right.

248
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,840
And then for the next five minutes, somebody very, very quickly lists all the bad things

249
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,700
it can do to you.

250
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,780
May increase incontinence.

251
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,340
May increase irritability.

252
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,760
May cause suicide.

253
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,220
May, you know, just on and on and on.

254
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:05,200
Dave, a little while ago, we were talking about the tragic and deadly virus that has

255
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:12,880
appeared in China that's leapfrogging from individual to individual, just like wildfire,

256
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:21,360
like the Australian bushfires or the Californian bushfires or the American poverty or the American

257
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,900
brain cells are burning out all over the country.

258
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,060
The school textbooks become more and more like Texas school textbooks.

259
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,680
Well, you're just saying that because you hate the president because you hate him so

260
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,140
much.

261
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,580
Yeah.

262
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,480
That's what all you liberals all hate him so much.

263
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,200
Yeah, it's just hate.

264
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,820
That's all we can do is hate.

265
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,780
We have no agenda, no progressive ideas at all.

266
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,240
All we have is we're trying to really tick off the stupid people.

267
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,960
That's all liberals have.

268
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,780
That's all they can do.

269
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,400
It's just...

270
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,560
They can do anything they can do, whether it helps or hurts themselves, as long as it's

271
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,660
angering the dumb people.

272
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,860
That is how I think as a liberal.

273
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,580
That's my motivation for living, too.

274
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,920
Yeah, I learned it from the conservatives.

275
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,120
I learned it from them, actually.

276
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,460
Because they started it with the, nah-ah, you did?

277
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,380
Everything is, nah-ah, you are.

278
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,620
Nah-ah, you are?

279
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,260
Nah-ah, you are.

280
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,680
That's the dialectic today.

281
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,360
That's because he's texting you, nah-ah.

282
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,300
Nah-ah, you are.

283
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,160
Yeah, it's the nah-ah, you are.

284
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,280
He's in a text.

285
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,540
Decade.

286
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,300
Uh-huh.

287
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:37,740
And self-righteousness, self-righteous anger is the marijuana of the 2020s.

288
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,620
Yeah, but it's not the kind, you know?

289
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,680
No, it's not the kind.

290
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,200
It's the opposite.

291
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,840
It's the cruel.

292
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,480
It's far from the kind.

293
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,480
But it works equally well for leftards and rightards.

294
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,940
They can both enjoy righteous...

295
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,660
They can get high as hell.

296
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,800
...on righteous indignation over what...

297
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,120
And not...

298
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,420
...the other guy is saying, according to their friends.

299
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,220
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

300
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,480
It's called cognitive dissonance when you do it from the other side of the propaganda machine,

301
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:13,200
which is like Schmell, George's Schmell, I guess his name was, the German propagandist,

302
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,000
during World War II.

303
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,320
He explored all those...

304
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,920
No, no, you're living in the past.

305
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,520
Now, the new propagandist is Sean Hannity.

306
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:22,800
Huh.

307
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,380
Yeah, you're living in the past.

308
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,340
The new Nazi propagandist is Sean Hannity.

309
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,120
Well, Frank...

310
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,680
Hannity.

311
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:36,860
What you might find unusual and interesting to hear is that, you know, after doing the communications bit and stuff like that,

312
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:43,460
he actually did write down all the things that Hannity did that were right out of the Father Coughlin book of the 1940s

313
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,320
when they were trying to get America to join the war on Germany's side.

314
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:48,820
Right.

315
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,020
And Father Coughlin was not a very, you know, he's a priest, but he wasn't a very good Christian,

316
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,700
because, you know, he wanted to...

317
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,220
Because he wanted to kill more people than save.

318
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,200
Yeah.

319
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,000
Well, only 144,000 can be saved.

320
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,780
That's how big the memory is in my computer.

321
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,040
Which holds the book of life of saved subgeniuses.

322
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,780
And it taps out at 144,000.

323
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,620
Luckily, we've still got 100,000 to go.

324
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,680
Well, that makes complete and total sense.

325
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,640
That's the way it should be.

326
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,820
I think if I were to start my own country, my own universe, my own private world,

327
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,960
that's the way I'd want to have it.

328
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,620
Or if I want to have anything.

329
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,300
Well, we won't have to worry about much of anything much longer.

330
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,920
Because, okay, you think this Chinese coronavirus...

331
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,680
That's why you said Cervasa.

332
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,620
Now I get it.

333
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,200
You said Cervasavirus.

334
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:49,920
Uh-huh.

335
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,780
Yeah, yeah.

336
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,400
It's Corona.

337
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,740
It's Corona.

338
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,840
It's Cervasavirus.

339
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,840
So for David.

340
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,000
It's the Cervasa.

341
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,280
Okay.

342
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,560
Yes, with the lime on top.

343
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:56,700
The Cervasavirus.

344
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:03,540
Well, Dave, at least that Chinese brand new virus that no one knows how to control,

345
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,060
at least it's from our time.

346
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,320
Yeah, wow.

347
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,960
Here's a nice little interesting bit that came.

348
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,240
This was the result of a joint Chinese and American study in Tibet.

349
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,360
Welp.

350
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,000
Scientists found 28 new virus groups.

351
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,440
In a melting glacier.

352
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:33,860
28 previously undiscovered viruses, which were trapped in Arctic ice from 15,000 years ago.

353
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:40,740
And scientists are concerned that ancient pathogens and toxic chemicals may be released

354
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,600
into the environment.

355
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:42,760
May.

356
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,520
May.

357
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,360
They have been.

358
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,340
That's been ongoing.

359
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,180
When they say May, that means it's too late.

360
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,540
Yeah.

361
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,000
Yeah.

362
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,640
They drilled a 164-foot hole into a glacier.

363
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,520
Got ice core samples and looked at them.

364
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,060
And of course, these glaciers are all melting.

365
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,360
And they're racing the clock to collect, identify, and catalog the microbes found in ancient ice.

366
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:13,440
Having a record of these bacteria, viruses, and fungi plants paints a sharper picture of our prehistoric past

367
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,660
and could be valuable for use in studying future pathogens.

368
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,300
And meltwater from Arctic ice could ferry harmful pathogens.

369
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,460
Along streams, rivers, and other waterways.

370
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,940
Exposing humans to new microbes.

371
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,260
Of course, ice isn't the only thing melting in the Arctic.

372
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,260
Thawing permafrost creates its own unique set of challenges.

373
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:41,740
Gases like methane and carbon dioxide, which have been trapped in the long frozen earth,

374
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,340
are being released, farted, into the atmosphere at alarming rates.

375
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,740
I added that word.

376
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,840
Permafrost...

377
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,180
Yeah, well, it's making methane...

378
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,620
...houses...

379
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,560
...is methane, so why not?

380
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,940
There's twice as much carbon locked in the permafrost than what's found in the atmosphere.

381
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,260
So that, we have that to look forward to.

382
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:06,960
In recent years, researchers have pulled samples of smallpox, Spanish flu, bubonic plague,

383
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,280
and even anthrax from thawing permafrost.

384
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:11,940
Lovely.

385
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:19,620
And there's mercury trapped in the reservoirs beneath Alaskan permafrost.

386
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,300
The global seed vault...

387
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,700
Why did that...

388
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,540
...seed vault...

389
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:22,540


390
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:30,900
...which houses the world's largest supply of plant seeds, flooded due to slumping permafrost.

391
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,580
Slumping permafrost.

392
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,660
It's like slackage in permafrost.

393
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,140
Slackage.

394
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:43,580
The company that stores Sweden, Finland's, and Canada's spent nuclear fuel atop permafrost

395
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:52,540
is any slumping or sagging could potentially jeopardize the integrity of the permafrost.

396
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:52,540


397
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,660
Of those nuclear waste containment systems.

398
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,120
I can't remember.

399
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:06,540
Countless other buildings and even Alaskan cemeteries are in jeopardy of structural damage wrought by destabilized permafrost.

400
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,040
Oh, these snowflakes, they're just making up this.

401
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,260
I don't have any permafrost on my boots.

402
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,240
You see any permafrost on my boots?

403
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,180
Nah, it's a hoax.

404
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:22,540
It's just I put money in Al Gore's pocket so he could pay for his fancy electrical lights there, and he's...

405
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
He's a giant ranch there.

406
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,440
They just made that up.

407
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,840
It's a Chinese hoax.

408
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,740
Permafrost.

409
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,300
There's no such thing. I don't see it.

410
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,640
Do you see any on me?

411
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,620
What a way to celebrate Chinese New Year.

412
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,740
I mean, it's today or tomorrow or the next day.

413
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,360
It's Chinese New Year.

414
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,560
I think we're starting a whole new beautiful, wonderful beginning.

415
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,180
As either the hare or as the mango.

416
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,720
I forget which plant we are this year.

417
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,640
But there's a silver lining to all this.

418
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,280
Oh, okay.

419
00:29:52,560 --> 00:30:03,320
Yeah, while scientists have discovered a seemingly endless series of terrifying plagues, diseases, and chemicals in thawing permafrost and melting ice,

420
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:09,880
the Great Thaw has also revealed long-lost treasures from an earlier time.

421
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:19,720
Last year, scientists discovered an 18,000-year-old doggo trapped in permafrost just outside the Siberian capital.

422
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,640
It still had a lush, velvety coat and was cute as a button.

423
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,640
Well, it may probably be a wolf.

424
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:35,900
Researchers have also unearthed mammoths, more wolves, and arctic mummies lusting for the flesh of the diseased living.

425
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,520
Oh, I love arctic mummies.

426
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,860
Arctic mummies.

427
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,220
It's one of my favorite diseases.

428
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:49,480
And if I could live anywhere I want to, I'd be out in the rain somewhere with my own private swimming pool and have a university degree.

429
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,300
I'd be in the university in the background so I could see all kinds of baronicky teacher women walking by.

430
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,160
And that would be it for me for the next 25 minutes, you know what I mean, man?

431
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,200
Well, I'm sure you don't, but...

432
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,500
It's the dreams of Dave.

433
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,920
Yeah, the hallucinations of Dave, too.

434
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
He is dreaming.

435
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,880
Not the dreams.

436
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,420
Of nubile young college girls while he's in his own swimming pool.

437
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,460
Hey, did I tell you about stupid amalgam?

438
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:19,460


439
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,960
Stupid America? That's a new magazine.

440
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,420
Actually, it's a blog website.

441
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,780
Stupid America?

442
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,120
StupidAmerica.net. No, you have to spell it with an I.

443
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,020
Oh, Stupid America, okay.

444
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:34,620
You can't spell it like our critics spell it when they're telling us we're stooped.

445
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,560
Let's say stooped.

446
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,540
Is that with two O's or with an E?

447
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,780
With an E, yeah.

448
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,620
This is, yeah, I've been told that.

449
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,560
You're stupid.

450
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,760
Yeah, especially with dumplings and burgers.

451
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,160
That was a criticism of our new...

452
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,340
Numa Numa video.

453
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,680
Alfred E. Newman, he's behind everything.

454
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,940
He's one of those secret master spies who never could die.

455
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,420
That's another project for us.

456
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,100
Alfred E. Numa Numa.

457
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,280
How do we do that one?

458
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,920
Well, you have to make a small P so it looks like he's a saint or something.

459
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:13,000
So it would be small P, large N-E-U-A-M-A.

460
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
It's been there, done that.

461
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,520
Oh, okay.

462
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,900
Dave, I got some good news about our terrible news.

463
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:27,320
Our terrible news was that after doing this long calculation just the other day,

464
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:34,940
I determined that the great novel Neighbor World by Dave DeLuca has sold, get this, get ready,

465
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:40,480
a grand total of, and this is the number, 191 copies.

466
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,300
Get out of here.

467
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,080
Well, I told you that yesterday, actually.

468
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,500
We're saving you after this, right?

469
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,980
But here's the other thing.

470
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,680
I forgot it was so close.

471
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,040
191.

472
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:59,400
I mentioned that to my mentor, Onan Kanobait, who's been self-publishing with print-on-demand books for 18 years.

473
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:10,620
And he said in all those years, he's never sold more than about five, maybe ten of any given book of his,

474
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,740
many of which are not by him.

475
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,840
They're reprints of old obscure weirdos.

476
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,420
That he found and likes.

477
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:28,120
The only one that has sold more than ten or so copies is reprints of, let me see if I can say this right,

478
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:34,600
the Ekinodon, some Greek philosopher, let's call him Epicurus.

479
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,720
Yes.

480
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:35,960
Whatever.

481
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,060
He wrote the Ekinodon, I've read it on our Slack.

482
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,700
It's a religion devoted to sandwiches.

483
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,820
Actually, this guy was the deacon.

484
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,000
Bill Carnegie of his time.

485
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,660
And it's actually pretty good advice.

486
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,360
Anyway, that one has sold about the same number of copies.

487
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,260
Under 200 copies.

488
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,360
Same as Neighbor World.

489
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,940
That's his most popular self-published book.

490
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,820
So, you're selling at least as well as Epicurus.

491
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,440
Or Epicurus or whatever.

492
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,380
Epicurus.

493
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,200
Yeah, you're selling that well.

494
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,900
You're as famous and widely read as him.

495
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,100
Only I guess there's other editions of his work.

496
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,080
There's a couple other guys like Aggie Memnon.

497
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,200
You ever heard of that guy?

498
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,600
Yeah, they're the dumbest football team in Texas, man.

499
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,500
They can't Memnon anything.

500
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,100
Don't wet your pants trying to be silly.

501
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,260
God has a mission and a method for all of us.

502
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,020
You're right.

503
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,920
In this stinky little cabin in the woods.

504
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,620
But there you go.

505
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,900
But there you go.

506
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,340
Oh my God.

507
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,820
I don't know where it was we went, but we went there.

508
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,480
Wherever you go, there you are.

509
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,700
Well, there's a whole bunch of our Slack listeners that have been downloading this show.

510
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,040
They still haven't bought Dave's book.

511
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,180
I know because we get more than 191 downloads.

512
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,680
Quite a lot more.

513
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,000
Of this stupid show.

514
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,620
Which we're just making up as we go along.

515
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,100
Dave's book is very tightly crafted.

516
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,600
Dave's book.

517
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,280
Dave's book is enough to renew a person's joy in the love of reading.

518
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,300
Actually, I read a review of it yesterday online.

519
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,820
I should have printed it up.

520
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,840
It was an interesting way of saying it.

521
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,940
Tony, Terry Gilliam?

522
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,320
I mean, well, not Terry Gilliam.

523
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,380
It was a scary review of your book.

524
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,480
Oh, cool.

525
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:44,880
Yeah, it was a strange book that crept along and would keep creeping back in on me.

526
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,380
Yeah.

527
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:52,760
It was a story I had written long after you'd finished it with infectious thoughts where

528
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:00,380
you're going, well, it's true there wasn't much of a romantic interest in that book.

529
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:08,900
It's true that the main character's kind of hard to identify with if you're a normal human being.

530
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,800
But I don't think we've ever tried to sell the book.

531
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,760
to any of those.

532
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,660
That's not what this outreach is about.

533
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,860
That's right.

534
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:20,800
That's right.

535
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,580
Who died in Monty Python?

536
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,580
Yeah, it's for very special people.

537
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,160
Who just died in Monty Python?

538
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:28,760
Terry Jones.

539
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,240
I mean,

540
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,020
who's the guy in Monty Python

541
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,780
who just died?

542
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,980
The giant fat guy.

543
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,260
The huge fat guy

544
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,860
that ate the one last thin wafer

545
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,740
and died and exploded.

546
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,060
The guy that played the piano

547
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,520
in the beginning or the organ.

548
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,380
He's dead.

549
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:45,680
Terry.

550
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,040
He's dead.

551
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,960
I mean,

552
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,540
I think only

553
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,760
half the Fireside Theater

554
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,460
is still left

555
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,180
and half Monty Python

556
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,540
can still ambulate some

557
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,840
and talk, sort of.

558
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,960
Maybe we should put them together

559
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,300
and get them to mate.

560
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,380
Oh, it's too late.

561
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,400
They're like that.

562
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
You never know, though.

563
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,420
They'd be like horse flies,

564
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,140
you know what I mean?

565
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,400
It wouldn't make sense.

566
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,020
Who could make a saddle that small,

567
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,780
you know what I'm saying?

568
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,740
There's a 118-year-old Galapagos tortoise

569
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,380
that has practically repopulated

570
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,300
the Galapagos tortoise rice.

571
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,980
Yeah, I heard of that guy.

572
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,300
He's quite a lover.

573
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,180
If he can do it,

574
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,360
Monty Python and those last two

575
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,260
Fireside Theater guys on Walkers

576
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,220
ought to be able to do it.

577
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,460
No, there's no Carol Cleveland,

578
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,360
should I say, in Monty Python terms.

579
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,220
There's no hot babe

580
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,680
who doesn't have too many lines

581
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,420
but still commands all the action.

582
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,080
She can walk into the room.

583
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,240
No, they had some of those

584
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,120
in Monty Python.

585
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,140
In Fireside Theater,

586
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,560
you never knew if they did

587
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,700
because they weren't on TV.

588
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,620
Right, you'd hear their voice

589
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,200
in the background.

590
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,520
That's like Airsats Brothers coffee

591
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,320
but it still doesn't make any sense

592
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,720
to tomorrow, at least.

593
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,120
The female voices on Fireside Theater

594
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,000
albums were usually wives,

595
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,520
Tiny and Una

596
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,760
and a few others.

597
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,400
I know Tiny,

598
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,280
sort of.

599
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,260
I haven't seen her in years.

600
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,820
I know Tiny

601
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,840
for some of these years.

602
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,520
I know Tiny

603
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,500
after quite a few beers.

604
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,060
I'll stand in the shadow.

605
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,460
I'll stand in the light.

606
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,300
I asked Fireside Theater guy

607
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:29,980
David Austin,

608
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,380
I said,

609
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,180
how come you guys never were on TV

610
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,260
like Monty Python?

611
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:33,940
And he said,

612
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,100
well, we were hippies.

613
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,520
It was the short version.

614
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,020
So we never really had an agent.

615
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,680
We were happy doing what we were doing.

616
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,000
We couldn't believe we were so lucky

617
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,160
we could produce these albums.

618
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,420
And, you know, looking back on it,

619
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
they did have the wrong haircuts for TV.

620
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,620
Right.

621
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,460
And having the wrong haircut

622
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,200
is the worst thing you can do in life.

623
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,340
When St. Peter opens up the golden book,

624
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,360
it's the terminus of our own railroad

625
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,300
and stuff like that.

626
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,260
He's going to say,

627
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,920
what have you done for your fellow man?

628
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,060
And I'm going to say,

629
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,760
I ain't done nothing I don't plan on.

630
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,360
And he'll say,

631
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,680
then he'll say something about

632
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,420
K-Ron and the River Styx

633
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,300
or something like that.

634
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,860
Where does the haircut come in, Dave?

635
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,780
When did they kick you out?

636
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,380
Oh, yeah, that's right.

637
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,820
That's the ancient Anglo-Saxons

638
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,900
when they took over Britain

639
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,100
and started cutting everybody's hair.

640
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,460
They gave them all those

641
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,960
like pudding pump drop haircuts.

642
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,740
He's not tracking, Princess Marie.

643
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,740
He's not tracking at all.

644
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,900
I believe he is,

645
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,980
but it's at another level.

646
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,520
We just can't understand it yet.

647
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,660
When we hear the tape back

648
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,660
four or five times,

649
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:42,880
we'll understand it.

650
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,060
Yes, then we'll finally

651
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,220
pick up on the Dave track.

652
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,440
That doesn't always happen.

653
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,620
Very often it does.

654
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,080
Sometimes I listen back to it

655
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,140
and I go, no, it really is just complete.

656
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,440
Well, sometimes absurdity

657
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,920
is supposed to be absurdity.

658
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,960
It's not all supposed to make sense, you know.

659
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:00,900
Yeah, it is.

660
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,840
Even absurdity has to have some

661
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,960
vestige of connection to the haircuts.

662
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,700
I mean, like human words perhaps

663
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,180
or just sounds can make

664
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,640
a whole world of differences.

665
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,160
Out of the void.

666
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,360
Anyway, all I know is

667
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,080
once St. Peter sees your haircut or mine,

668
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,880
pull the lever, down you go.

669
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,480
That's it.

670
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,600
It's an unforgivable sin.

671
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,820
That's it.

672
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,820
Pull the lever, down you go.

673
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,120
We're going to burn in hell with our hair.

674
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,700
I'm not stealing lines from Jane or Jane

675
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,780
or got that line from

676
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,320
Brother Roloff or some preacher.

677
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,820
I believe you.

678
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,920
Rolled off Brother Roloff

679
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,160
and

680
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,420
and

681
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:43,620
, uh,

682
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,960
That was the one who liked it.

683
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,200
Brother Roloff and Peter Popoff

684
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,400
ought to get together and mate

685
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,100
and have a little crazy creature.

686
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,980
Popoff, oh yeah.

687
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,460
Popoff and Roloff.

688
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,240
They're both real names.

689
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,180
A legume

690
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,820
tangled with Peter Popoff.

691
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,460
Yes, I believe.

692
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,140
Up close and personal.

693
00:40:59,320 --> 00:40:59,640
I remember that.

694
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,060
Wearing a priestly top.

695
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,840
In a sexual way

696
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,880
or they were dressed up

697
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,740
in the same kind of clothes or what?

698
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,380
He basically walked up and said,

699
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,800
hey, we're in kind of the same business.

700
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,060
Popoff is famous

701
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,400
for being a charlatan.

702
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,220
Who reads minds by radio reports

703
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,700
coming in over little headphones,

704
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,160
little earbuds he's got in his ear

705
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,880
and his special helpers

706
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,280
quiz the people who come to see

707
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,900
Peter Popoff preach.

708
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,880
And they write down little notes.

709
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,460
And so that when Peter Popoff

710
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,580
can then stand up and go,

711
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,100
I see a person who's got diabetes

712
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,300
and they need money real bad

713
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,820
and they're wearing a red shirt.

714
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,460
Is there anybody here like that?

715
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,640
And the guy will stand up and he'll go,

716
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,400
I see in my mind,

717
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,340
that your wife is sick too.

718
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,140
And it's all this stuff

719
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,060
which they just told the guy's assistants.

720
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,040
Now, the reason we know this

721
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,960
is because people have recorded

722
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,380
the little broadcasts

723
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,460
done at these church revivals

724
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,980
and played them back.

725
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,740
So you could hear the preacher's staff cheating.

726
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,580
He's not reading any minds.

727
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,080
He's listening to spy material on headphones.

728
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,520
Whereas in subgenius,

729
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,160
why we just make up a bunch of hooey

730
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,400
and it's still cheating.

731
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:13,420


732
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,260
We're not using psychic anything.

733
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,760
We just, you can just yell.

734
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,720
I know somebody here is having financial problems.

735
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,480
And by golly, everybody in the room will stand up and go,

736
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,380
how did you know it's a miracle?

737
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,600
You don't need no assistants doing R and D for you.

738
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,160
I'm sorry.

739
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,920
Excuse me.

740
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,420
Sorry.

741
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,440
Dave, are you speaking through a blanket or a pillow?

742
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,420
I am a blanket or a pillow.

743
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,440
How does it sound now?

744
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,520
Better than it did a second ago.

745
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,900
You're not using your coffee cup sound filter again, are you?

746
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,920
No, I have the one with the Bob image on the side.

747
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:52,660
Yeah.

748
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,600
Did it finally break your old styrofoam cup

749
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,980
that had the bottom torn out?

750
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,920
That was his special effects filter.

751
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,960
Because then he could talk like this.

752
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,080
See, it was a toilet paper roll

753
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,620
and you can't even do it without one.

754
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,000
You're just making it up as you're going along.

755
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,360
Get yourself a toilet paper.

756
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:12,900
Yeah.

757
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,520
Roll and talk or beer can.

758
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:23,600
A beer can with the beer exalted like in the days of our Lord.

759
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,860
I can bring you one because I save them for the dogs.

760
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,640
Toilet paper rolls?

761
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,020
Yes.

762
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,580
The dogs like to play with them as toys.

763
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,600
I put one piece of dog food into the middle of it

764
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,540
and then I fold the ends and it takes the dog a long.

765
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,100
Time to open it up and get food out.

766
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,280
Okay, Boomer.

767
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,220
Okay, Boomer.

768
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,300
Answer me this, Boomer.

769
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,240
Why didn't you save the world?

770
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,620
Why didn't you stop all the crap from happening?

771
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,580
Why did you let them do it, Boomer?

772
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,460
Why did you just sit back and not even protest

773
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,740
while they just squandered?

774
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,820
You squandered it.

775
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,020
You squandered your grandchildren's world deliberately, Boomer.

776
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,880
How dare you be born between 1946 and 90?

777
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:12,880


778
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,020
You ought to be tried for war crimes, Boomer.

779
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,480
Yep.

780
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,820
That's the way I see it, too.

781
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,160
The Boomers are the ones that made up ecology.

782
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,120
Yeah, but they didn't make it happen.

783
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,700
They just talked about it.

784
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,120
They had better demonstrations than everybody else did, too.

785
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,740
Yeah, I know, but they allowed it.

786
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,280
But it didn't work.

787
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,760
That's why the Boomers must die.

788
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,880
Their protests didn't work.

789
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:42,880


790
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:42,880


791
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:42,880


792
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,060
The rich people continued to rape the planet,

793
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:52,400
using the Boomers as penises, and it's all our fault.

794
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:52,780
That's right.

795
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,780
Earth Day didn't raise anyone's consciousness.

796
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,640
If we had managed to not be born between 1946 and 1966,

797
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,180
everything would be fine now.

798
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,340
Yep.

799
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,500
Because no humans before 1946 or after 1966

800
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,380
used any resources at all.

801
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,260
And they had to fight with other age groups,

802
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,540
with really cool names like Gen Xs and stuff like that.

803
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,020
And then they have like ancient,

804
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,680
like one of the jousting tournaments,

805
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,500
where they get swords and stuff like that,

806
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,020
and ride on a horse with a pylon,

807
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,700
and club each other down, stuff like that.

808
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,720
And one of them would be named the King.

809
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,100
My son said,

810
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,560
what these millennials forget,

811
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,040
what these millennials forget is that

812
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,320
there's a generation between them and Boomers

813
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,320
that hates them both.

814
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,920
There's two, isn't there, aren't there?

815
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,880
I don't know.

816
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,400
I can't count that high.

817
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:47,860
I'm old.

818
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:51,840
Yeah.

819
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,820
Well, apparently, I believe that we must have used up

820
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,920
a lot of the resources.

821
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,400
I think we must have used up a lot of science books

822
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,040
and history books,

823
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,620
because apparently those aren't getting read.

824
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,840
And I think I said this before on the show.

825
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,640
If I was a little kid,

826
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:10,840
I'm sorry.

827
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,180
We may have used up.

828
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,900
We may have used up the brain cells.

829
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,880
I was just trying to figure out how,

830
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,420
if I was a little child during that period of time,

831
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,000
how am I responsible for doing all this crap?

832
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,160
Right.

833
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,240
At age of five,

834
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,720
were you supposed to say to your parents,

835
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,480
no, I don't want that toy battleship,

836
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,100
because the plastics in it

837
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,020
might get into the ocean in 50 years?

838
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,300
Exactly.

839
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,420
Or exactly the poet.

840
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,400
Yeah.

841
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,400
You got that one by the short hairs.

842
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,640
And when you were 12 or so,

843
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,140
why didn't we say,

844
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,100
no, mom, don't drive me the 10 miles to school.

845
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,120
I'd rather ride a bike.

846
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,120
Yeah.

847
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:53,760
Or how about,

848
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,780
don't demonstrate a nuclear bomb out on the desert there.

849
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,600
It's so pretty just before sunset.

850
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,680
You know?

851
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,980
Yeah, we didn't stop them.

852
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,460
Well, actually, the bomb tests were before we were born,

853
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,900
before 46.

854
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,760
So that's okay.

855
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,380
That's because we didn't,

856
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,080
we didn't stop them.

857
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,080
Or no.

858
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,180
I mean, somebody there,

859
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,900
where else was the world going to get the valuable chemical trinitite,

860
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,860
which only grows at nuclear bomb testing sites?

861
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,240
That's a true thing, by the way.

862
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,320
Wow.

863
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,540
What does trinitite do?

864
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,500
It's stubbed my foreskin.

865
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,800
What is it used for?

866
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,400
It's collected by Mr. Orsistar.

867
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,480
For what?

868
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,340
Because it's trinitite.

869
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,340
It's sand that's been turned into glass

870
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,860
by the intense nuclear blast.

871
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,060
Ah, I see.

872
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,900
Is it radioactive or is it just interested in parties?

873
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,160
Yeah, it's not enough to count.

874
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,980
It's not like, you know, it's not like...

875
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,040
Maybe it's old and can't count that high, you know?

876
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,880
Yeah, it's not like being on the set of The Conqueror,

877
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,440
which was all filmed at a nuclear test site.

878
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,260
And then they brought the dirt back from the nuclear test site

879
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,220
because the producer, Howard Hughes, wanted it to be authentic,

880
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,940
wanted the same color dirt.

881
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,080
It was highly radioactive dirt,

882
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,100
and almost everyone who worked on that movie died of cancer,

883
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,440
including John Wayne, who played Genghis Khan,

884
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,780
sounding kind of like this.

885
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:27,360
You Mongols had better do what I say because I'm the Khan.

886
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,500
That's short for a conspiracy.

887
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,420
You got me, cowboy?

888
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,020
Sure, Marion.

889
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,320
He had makeup on his face.

890
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,360
He had makeup on his eyes to make him kind of slanty-eyed.

891
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:41,800
Yes.

892
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,040
Kind of Asiatic-looking.

893
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:49,960
The big bruiser, Texan type of a Mongol.

894
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,840
Who was like J. Edgar Hoover,

895
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,260
who liked to be real macho when he was gay as hell.

896
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,000
That's what I find very interesting about America,

897
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,680
like J. Edgar Hoover, all the things he did to Martin Luther King

898
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,820
and everybody else who was involved in civil rights,

899
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,220
and yet at the same time,

900
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,620
he was just crazy.

901
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:15,240
Yeah, he wasn't exactly just plain ordinary gay, was he?

902
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,520
He was into some real kinky stuff.

903
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,660
And yet at the same time, he—

904
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,520
Certainly by the standards of those days.

905
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,900
Nowadays, it's like, well, Yankee high schools, you can do that.

906
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,000
Not Texas, hell no.

907
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,180
Texas, you better get a haircut.

908
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,100
It's appropriate for your sex.

909
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,200
Even if you don't—

910
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,700
Even if you don't have any hair, you know,

911
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,840
that's what I like about the great Emerald Star,

912
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:49,140
and Lone Star State is the fact that you can get so easily lost there

913
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,000
because it's so big.

914
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,420
Well, the funny thing is a whole lot of the old Texas po-buckers my age

915
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,240
have long ponytails just like me.

916
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,640
They want to look like—

917
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,980
They want to wear the haircut that they wanted to wear in high school,

918
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,120
but they weren't allowed to.

919
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,080
Now they're retired, and nobody can tell them to get a haircut,

920
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,260
and they all have these Willie—

921
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,560
and they all turned into Willie Nelson.

922
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,780
And they probably smoked reefers, a bunch of them, or wood,

923
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:21,200
if their nephews showed up with some, you know.

924
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,220
Yeah, but they could wear like little spindly parthenets on their head,

925
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,220
you know, instead of taking up two or three big ponytails,

926
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:35,140
they could have a little bunch of little teeny tiny ponitas crawling out of their skin.

927
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:40,900
They still ain't going to legalize that or evolution or knowledge, basically.

928
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:46,220
True, truthful, scientific type knowledge is kind of frowned upon in this state.

929
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:53,120
Any form of government help or welfare for the extremely sick or mentally ill,

930
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,780
they're pretty much, you know, they tell you to die.

931
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,500
And it works.

932
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,140
Yep.

933
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:00,980
They die.

934
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,340
Every time I've tried it, every time I've tried it, I've almost died.

935
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:09,180
I guess I was trying to get somebody else to die, but I couldn't do it, you know.

936
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,740
And they just come right back on me like I was a—what's it called?

937
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,340
A baseball player or something.

938
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:21,140
I know that they want us to die here in Texas because even Oklahoma,

939
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,100
even Arkansas has medical.

940
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:30,020
They legalize medical in Arkansas and Oklahoma.

941
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,180
But Texas, oh no.

942
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:32,900
Texas.

943
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:37,960
We'd never do anything so, whatever it is, Yankee, smart.

944
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:38,800
California.

945
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,420
We don't do smart things here.

946
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,060
This is Texas.

947
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,540
You don't understand.

948
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,060
This is Texas.

949
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,320
I know what you're talking about, man.

950
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,540
Sometimes I do.

951
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,520
Yeah.

952
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,360
That's why I'm here.

953
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:57,620
I'm back here to be a thorn in the side of this thorny, thorny state.

954
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,900
It's kind of pointless, like declaring war on God.

955
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,880
It's the thorniest damn state in the whole world.

956
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,100
I'm a thorn in the side of the Union.

957
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,720
It just makes me want to cry a river.

958
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,720
A river.

959
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,720
How was it?

960
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,660
Well-spoken, I must add.

961
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,700
Well, Dave, it's 40 minutes and you must be getting hungry.

962
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,280
And I must be about to play some kind of music or collage or something that has to do with Bob.

963
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,520
That was 40 minutes?

964
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,120
Yeah.

965
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,260
Really?

966
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,320
Well, there was a lot of futzing.

967
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,500
Futsing, you say?

968
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,500
Cardboard crumpling.

969
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,940
Cardboard crumpling.

970
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,140
Yeah.

971
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:35,980
Tsunamis.

972
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,380
Okay, well, that makes sense because I have to take these pills.

973
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,900
The reason why I have to take these pills is because I have to eat them while they have food at the same time.

974
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,820
So I plan every late afternoon to have these various pills that I must eat with.

975
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,320
Oh, I do that in the morning.

976
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:54,920
We understand.

977
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,760
I don't have one.

978
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:02,480
I have to eat pills with food and food with food.

979
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:02,760
With pills.

980
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,320
Yes.

981
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,220
It's the best way.

982
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,620
It's the best way.

983
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,340
What's that?

984
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,920
Um, so, and I know you need to go and I need to go too.

985
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,000
Okay.

986
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,140
In a different way.

987
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,580
Well, they're all pretty much the same no matter what you do.

988
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,320
You just gotta point Percy.

989
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,280
They all end up on their heads.

990
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,780
That's the sad truth.

991
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,020
Every single one of us.

992
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,780
Us, them, all.

993
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,180
All is vanity.

994
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,020
And they all end up on their heads.

995
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,220
Every single one.

996
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,080
Yeah.

997
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,040
It's a fun game to watch until they end up on their heads.

998
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,560
Then you gotta shove them off the board and get some new ones spinning.

999
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:42,960
Wow.

1000
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:44,500
Yup.

1001
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:44,960
Yup.

1002
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,260
And you have to spin them or else they'll just lay there.

1003
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,760
But they won't spin forever.

1004
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,120
They'll flop over on their heads sooner or later.

1005
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,440
They might win almost everything and then flop over on their heads.

1006
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:57,460
Right.

1007
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,000
Momentum stops.

1008
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,580
Boing, boing, flop.

1009
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,160
Boing, boing, flop.

1010
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,660
It's God's magic trick to make room for grandchildren.

1011
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:09,660
Okay man.

1012
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,060
Okay man.

1013
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,240
And we both got them, so we did our job.

1014
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:16,040
God should reward us even despite our haircuts.

1015
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:16,620
Don't you think?

1016
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,040
No.

1017
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,860
Or at least buy us a dinner one of these days.

1018
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,440
That would be good.

1019
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,160
Yeah, I'm waiting for, I figure when I pass through that train, we're gonna go.

1020
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:31,160


1021
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:31,160


1022
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:31,160


1023
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:38,300
heavenly curtain to the shoot through to the other side uh god will say hey tell me that war on god

1024
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:43,220
rant again that was pretty funny that's the only reason you even lived as long as he did i was

1025
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:49,880
hoping to hear you do that again well that's what i said it's just hilarious thank god the very idea

1026
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:55,700
that a pipsqueak human being like you on that little stupid planet you declare war on the

1027
00:54:55,700 --> 00:55:00,900
ultimate being that controls every it's like don't you know i'm the one who made you tell

00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,380
i've heard it and know what you're going to do i want to hear it again anyway even though the joke

1030
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:17,380
omnificent and omniscient i can know everything and maleficent and beautiful i can i still want

1031
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,080
to hear you tell that rant again even though it'd really be me telling it since it got you're

1032
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,540
me and i'm everything being god and all

1033
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,040
you

1034
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:30,220
well the joke is that god and this guy who was the world's greatest digger of

1035
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:37,640
of articles and stuff like that and we're in a competition they made a bet this is god said he

1036
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:42,440
could he could shovel more dirt than that guy could no matter how great of a dirt shoveler he

1037
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:49,820
was and there was no way that there was well never mind so anyway they start to dig and each

1038
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:55,540
got their own shovel in there and and god looks up looks over at the guy and says

1039
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:55,680
hey god what did you do to me and he said well you you you you you you you you you you you you

1040
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,480
Hey, get your own dirt.

1041
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,500
So the guy automatically lost.

1042
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,300
Know what I mean?

1043
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,320
Well, yeah, your diction in telling that joke was abysmal,

1044
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,420
but I think I got most of it.

1045
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,800
Do you think I don't want my diction to be abysmal?

1046
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,480
I love it.

1047
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,680
No, I thought you didn't want it to be abysmal.

1048
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,200
I thought you didn't want it to be abysmal either.

1049
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,920
Well, you were both wrong because I wanted it to be,

1050
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,120
and you can't prove otherwise.

1051
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:25,840
Know what I mean?

1052
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,660
You win.

1053
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:28,880
You win?

1054
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,240
Yeah, just like if you're thrown up against God.

1055
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,360
He's so high, you can't go over him.

1056
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,400
So low, you can't go under.

1057
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,900
God looks at the guy and says, get your own dirt.

1058
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,040
So wide, you can't get around him.

1059
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,780
It would be kind of hard to bury someone without any dirt.

1060
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,780
Yeah, you always got to do that,

1061
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,100
unless you could give them a fight.

1062
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,660
I remember a wonderful battlefield cadet experience

1063
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,040
where he dropped me in the Pacific Ocean

1064
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,600
and set off more nuclear weapons.

1065
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,480
That's just so that Australia burns a little bit more crispy.

1066
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,440
I thought we were going to go eat dinner.

1067
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,480
Well, I am.

1068
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:13,280
Okay.

1069
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,480
Did he just actually hang up?

1070
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:18,820
Yeah.

1071
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:20,940
Dave?

1072
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,180
Houston, you're looking good here, right down the center line.

1073
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:24,640
What?

1074
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,280
What's that?

1075
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,240
That was the end of Witch Disco.

1076
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,460
Yeah, but there was a voice.

1077
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,660
It was NASA.

1078
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,480
It was a moon landing thing.

1079
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:32,860
Remember?

1080
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,300
This is Chaz's house.

1081
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:34,700
Right.

1082
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,500
Everything's all outer space.

1083
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,060
Right.

1084
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,860
And layers of sound and music and voices and stuff.

1085
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,180
Yeah.

1086
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,460
Always.

1087
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,860
Many layers.

1088
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:59,020
A...

1089
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,720
And I didn't get paid, right?

1090
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:11,720


1091
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:11,720


1092
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,100
That took care of it?

1093
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:12,140


1094
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:12,660
What's one thing you've learnt since then?

1095
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:12,660


1096
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,340
You know?

1097
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:14,340


1098
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:14,340


1099
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,280
btw, but something something you can't do all the time.

1100
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:25,100
Siloms anyone who's good at polo try to send quelqugo friends and relatives

1101
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:31,860
Thank you.

1102
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,480
Thank you.

1103
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:31,860
Thank you.

1104
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,700
Thank you.

1105
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,080
Thank you.

1106
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,420
Praise Bob.
