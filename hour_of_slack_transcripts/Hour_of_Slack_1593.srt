1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
What is God good for?

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,300
Call now and I'll rush you a free tape.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,520
That's what we can count on God for.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,680
A free tape.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,900
No. No.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,120
Yes. He did it.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,000
God is a content

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,040
By which we measure

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,860
Our

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,660
Pain

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,040
I'll say it again

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,900
God is a content

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:03,040
By which we measure

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,900
Our

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,400
Pain

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,960
Yeah

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,580
Pain

18
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,200
Yeah

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,880
Pain

20
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,240
I don't believe in magic

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:26,120
I don't believe in I Ching

22
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,980
I don't believe in Bible

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:38,400
I don't believe in talent

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,540
I don't believe in Hitler

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,860
I don't believe in Jesus

26
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:57,140
I don't believe in Kennedy

27
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,260
I don't believe in brother

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:09,360
I don't believe in mantra

29
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,520
I don't believe in Geeta

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,820
I don't believe in yoga

31
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,800
I don't believe in kings

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,160
I don't believe in Elvis

33
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,520
I don't believe in Zimmerman

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,720
I don't believe in Beatles

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,840
I just believe in me

36
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,360
You're the one for me

37
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,240
That's reality

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,280
The dream is over

39
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,880
What can I say?

40
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,300
The dream is over

41
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,460
Yesterday

42
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:35,900
I was the dream we found

43
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,720
Now I'm not born

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,100
I'm not born

45
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,260
I was the walrus

46
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,380
But now I'm John

47
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,680
And so, dear friends

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,100
We'll just have to carry on

49
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,100
The dream is over

50
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,100


51
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,100


52
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,040
The dream is over

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,800
But, dear friends

54
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,520
Somebody else is just starting up

55
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,420
Fuck!

56
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,440
I know who it is!

57
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,060
I know who it is that doesn't belong among us!

58
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,080
I swear, I know who it is!

59
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,800
It's...

60
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:33,700
It's...

61
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,940
The Self Genius Hour of Swag

62
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,360
Oh, that's not true!

63
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,860
Oh, that's not true!

64
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,600
S is for the suckers that live all around

65
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,980
U is for us, they're always putting us down

66
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,300
B is for Bob, he gives us our bread

67
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,040
G is for the guns they put to your head

68
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,060
E is for the eunuchs they want you to become

69
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,600
N is for the knots they wish they had some

70
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,420
I is for that eye in the back of my head

71
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,880
U is for you, they wanna see you dead

72
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,480
S is for the shit that's all around

73
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,340
I'm a subterraneous motherfucker

74
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,200
And I ain't no fucking clown

75
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,300
In order to rule the world

76
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,980
You must first conquer it

77
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,740
Only on those bold terms

78
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,580
Can this world be a place for you to be

79
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,900
This total war

80
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,940
Result in total victory

81
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,160
The End

82
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,260
Well, don't you think it's a little late?

83
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:54,760
No

84
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,280
Well, I do

85
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,040
The End

86
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,660
I don't give a damn

87
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:01,980
Dead center

88
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,540
Yes, liberty reigns

89
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,560
I can't stand things that frighten me

90
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,680
That don't make any sense

91
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,060
Come on, let's get out of my brain

92
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
Yes, sir

93
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,520
Yes, sir

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,080
The right brain that was actually originated for people who were tired of pointing salt

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,300
The heliopter Jesus was originated for your right brain

96
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:17,640
That's true

97
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,720
He's in a little can and we open him every 45 minutes

98
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,940
Now he's just squeaking

99
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,280
Be scary, Colin

100
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Stand back, stand back

101
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,780
Okay, I was steering the ship toward the left

102
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,760
And you won't be able to

103
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,900
Now look out the window

104
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,580
See little people there?

105
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,920
See them?

106
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,000
No, stop

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,020
They're actually not people

108
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,100
They're a bad genius

109
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,300
I am there to scare you

110
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,600
I'm so scared

111
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
They're in the human scrap yard

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,380
Please, if you're coughing all over your speakers

113
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,360
You're saying we've gotta clean it up here at the station

114
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,740
Yes, sir

115
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,060
It is true there is a thing here I do not understand

116
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,200
There is a pain between my ears

117
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,820
For those who don't understand

118
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,040
Perhaps they're always on the short poopy end of the stick

119
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,660
Yes, the short poopy end of the stick

120
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,280
There's a lot of short doggy poop around to put on the stick

121
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,140
But if you want to live like a real man or woman

122
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,340
You must, you must, you must

123
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,100
It is

124
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:15,980
Later than you think

125
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,640
It's later than you think

126
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,140
It's later than you think

127
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,940
It's more late than you think

128
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,540
It's more late than you think

129
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,560
As chimpanzees are to humans, humans are to us

130
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,760
You're a proving jack

131
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,940
You just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty in you

132
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,220
The one that ruined you was that damned Indian, old Titi

133
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,200
You mean Olasky

134
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,800
He gave you a vision of moral order in the universe

135
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,760
And there isn't any

136
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,360
Those stars twinkle in a void, dear boy

137
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,000
And the two-legged creature schemes and dreams beneath them all in vain

138
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,060
All in vain, Jack

139
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,680
Did you hear anything?

140
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,820
Listen to me

141
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,940
Two-legged creature won't believe anything

142
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,740
And the more preposterous the better

143
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,740
Whales speak French at the bottom of the sea

144
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,740
The horses of Arabia have silver wings

145
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,160
Pygmies mate with elephants in darkest Africa

146
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,120
I have sold all those propositions

147
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,980
I have sold all those propositions

148
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,120
Fool, fool, fool, fool

149
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,980
And they were all fools and none of them matters

150
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,400
Ah

151
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,220
guitar solo

152
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,700
I watched a world from an alien place

153
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,160
From a desert plain that's so far away

154
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,980
I hear the sound of a starlit night

155
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,660
Of an angel's song in a big and light

156
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,620
Your world of people has no place for me

157
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,120
I've read the plea from an insane king

158
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,940
Your world of people suffocates me

159
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,940
It prisons me, it drowns me in ice

160
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,280
I watched a world from an alien place

161
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,040
From the tides of time and the shores of space

162
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,720
I stumble onward in a fevered dream

163
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,500
In a landscape of light, she gave a silent scream

164
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,460
Your world of people has no place for me

165
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,980
I've read the plea from an insane king

166
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,640
Awaken world, oh little man

167
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,580
Of hatred, deeds, and evil eyes

168
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,980
I'm the responsibility I make

169
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:21,180
Why are you alert for the

170
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,920
amidst a cold brawl

171
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:30,260
Bring your snow

172
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,760
I watch the world from an alien place

173
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,400
From a desert plain until far away

174
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,300
I hear the sound of a starlit night

175
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,320
Of an angel's song and a billion lights

176
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,060
Your world of people has no place for me

177
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,740
I'll forever flee from it, it's St. King

178
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,260
A wicked world, a little man

179
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,560
Of hateful deeds and evil ends

180
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,540
I'll forever flee from it, it's St. King

181
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,420
A wicked world, a little man

182
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,060
Of hateful deeds and evil ends

183
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,080
Your world of people has no place for me

184
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,440
I'll forever flee from it, it's St. King

185
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,300
A wicked world, a little man

186
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:00,860
Of hateful deeds and evil ends

187
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,440
Your world of people has no place for me

188
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:13,380
I'll forever flee from it, it's St. King

189
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,000
A wicked world, a billion lights

190
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,000


191
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,180
Your world of people has no place for me

192
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,420
I'll forever flee from it, it's St. King

193
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:31,240
A wicked world, a billion lights

194
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,440
Your world of people has no place for me

195
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,720
I'm a dish Śrīüs in this視ri,

196
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:42,720
Only to appear here

197
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:42,720


198
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,820
Is this hellishHH

199
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:50,020
My peoples, no one left to live

200
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,960
As you killed the יכולied

201
00:13:52,960 --> 00:14:00,820
As you killed the helfallen

202
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:00,940
Once in your free will

203
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,980
2013, sinners have taken the matter into their own hands, but remember, God holds the final trump card.

204
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:15,300
The judgment. Revelation 20, verses 11 to 15. 10. Mercy killers are also on the ascendancy in America.

205
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,100
They are progressive abortions who have become hard to killing and now wish to include the mommies

206
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,040
and daddies along with the babies. Why were my father and mother bitten? God's command is Exodus

207
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,080
2012. Interference. Responsibility is so great. These words must be related.

208
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:42,620
You be the judge. You be the judge. You be the judge. You be the judge.

209
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
So, there you go. That's like,

210
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,840
doctors watching you right now.

211
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,020
What does this mean? Here, wait. You gotta put your headphones on, Dave.

212
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,640
That one.

213
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,500
No, Warden, it's not in my booty.

214
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,960
What the hell is that?

215
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,620
You be the judge.

216
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,900
No, Warden.

217
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,620
You be the judge.

218
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,360
But, no! Warden be the judge someday!

219
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,600
You be the judge. You be the judge.

220
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,240
You be the judge today!

221
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,000
But, no!

222
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,940
You be the judge tomorrow!

223
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,340
Compulsory death for all at age...

224
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,880
Compulsory death for all.

225
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,780
That's why the kids...

226
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,320
Oh, no!

227
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,260
Oh, God!

228
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,860
The problem with them TV preachers...

229
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,780
That's the problem with using your teeth for the needle on the turntable, man.

230
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,160
What makes people think they can flunk God's rules and end up in eternal bliss?

231
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,140
Flunk God's rules?

232
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,500
What makes people think they can do that, Dave?

233
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,500
I don't know. Flunking is easy.

234
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,800
But flapping is hard.

235
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,080
But who do we think we are?

236
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,960
Who do we think we are?

237
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,300
I got away with it so far.

238
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,180
I got away with it because Bob gave me something to get me off.

239
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,400
I got away with it.

240
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,180
Bob got me off!

241
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,640
And I got away with it.

242
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,460
I got away with dogs.

243
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,780
I got away with old ladies.

244
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,060
I got away with barbers with one eye.

245
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,020
I got away with three people's hands.

246
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,480
I got away with men who think they're Jesus Christ.

247
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,480
Then, our brazen disregard...

248
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:23,820
Then, our brazen disregard...

249
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:23,940
Then, our brazen disregard...

250
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:23,940


251
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,840
Of God's laws will be judged.

252
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,700
of God's laws will be judged.

253
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,540
of God's laws will be judged.

254
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,460
Our dogs, usurperors,

255
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,140
our dogs, usurperors,

256
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,180


257
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,740
our dogs, usurperors,

258
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,760
Dogmongers and G весьers was agar away with dogs.

259
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,000
Dogmongers and G весьers was agar away with dogs.

260
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,320
The day of the Lord is at hand.

261
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:41,500
The day of the Lord is at hand.

262
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:41,720
The day of the Lord is at hand.

263
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,940
He shall come like a thief in the night,

264
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,720
He shall come like a thief in the night,

265
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,280
or He shall come somewhere another.

266
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:47,680


267
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,820
The Lord cometh and the Lord goeth and the Lord goeth.

268
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,800
Come unto me, bud!

269
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,480
This here's your sugar daddy

270
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,880
From his catty

271
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,320
In the ever-loving great beyond

272
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,100
So prick your ears up

273
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:29,380
And be quick-lipped to respond

274
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,280
Cause daddy ain't too happy

275
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,860
None too happy

276
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,320
What did I ever create you for?

277
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,300
You are the one

278
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,720
You ain't done nothing

279
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,940
But make your daddy sore

280
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,280
It looks like evolution's no solution

281
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,300
You just keep falling ever further behind

282
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,380
You may be tanned and clean-shaven

283
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,000
But ain't with little bit of hair it's high

284
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,280
Figured out how to make you feel

285
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,280


286
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,280
Hair is situation

287
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,940
Every nation

288
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,660
About to break your daddy to his knees

289
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,460
I just keep crying

290
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,600
These people bleed

291
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,420
You damn dirty apes

292
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,800
What the hell

293
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,140
Are you doing?

294
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,180
You damn dirty apes

295
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:50,340
Look at what you have done

296
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,600
You damn dirty apes

297
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,620
Who do you think you have been fooling?

298
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,560
Cause I'm gonna catch you

299
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,920
Gonna catch you

300
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,020
Every one of you

301
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,820
Every one of you

302
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,860
Too cute to reveal

303
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:27,900
Hyperspace

304
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:27,900


305
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,440
To speak

306
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,440


307
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,440


308
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,440


309
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,700
Or the bones

310
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,640
To keep you alive

311
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,460
I'm just a star

312
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:32,900
Behind theED

313
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:32,900


314
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:32,960
But even better

315
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,560
You're safe and sound

316
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,920
Time to race

317
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,220
You're a dung sold

318
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,760
By us

319
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,700
It's a world

320
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,520
And flip it

321
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,240
Thank you

322
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,800
See ya

323
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:45,800


324
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:45,800


325
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:45,800


326
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,820
Earthquakes, floods and lightning

327
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,420
Very frightening

328
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:18,160
Oh, but that's just a little nervous twitch

329
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,720
But I'll be getting medieval

330
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,540
If you can treat me like your bitch

331
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,960
So get yourself together

332
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,900
Now or never

333
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,420
All you need's a little self-esteem

334
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,500
To turn this nightmare

335
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,080
Into a sweet, sweet dream

336
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,860
You damn dirty ape

337
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,400
What the hell are you doing?

338
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,180
You damn dirty ape

339
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,560
Look at what you have done

340
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,300
You damn dirty ape

341
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,940
Who do you think you have been playing?

342
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,740
Cause I'm gonna get you

343
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,980
Gonna get you every one

344
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,940
I'm gonna get you

345
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,120
Get you every one

346
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,480
I'm gonna get you every one

347
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,160
I'm gonna get you every one

348
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,860
A song from God

349
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,720
Called Damn Dirty Apes

350
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,700

354
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,520

Cut-up collages

369
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,160
Hustling evidences

370
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,860
Howling over men

371
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,520
Lonesome cowboys

372
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,200
And Chaz right here

373

This is the night of the whole world

So there's been all this talk on

375
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,400
This is the night of the whole world

376
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,100
And science

377
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,600
Let's talk science for a minute

378
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,280
Well, can I ask you one question?

379
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,680
Kind of a scientific question

380
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,200
What?

381
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,640
Is it true that you've heard

382
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,980
That there is a dangerous sorcerer

383
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,920
Or a demon, perhaps,

384
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,960
That speaks from Dick Cheney's navel?

385
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,000
Really?

386
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,640
I don't think that's scientific

387
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,480
Well, I don't think it is either

388
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,140
I think it sounds like superstition

389
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,120
So it couldn't possibly be true

390
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,320
It has nothing to do with it

391
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,960
That sounds like an urban legend to me

392
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,180
Oh, yeah, that's not science

393
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,100
That's pseudoscience

394
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,880
That's false science

395
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,360
Okay

396
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,380
But now, uh, we're going to talk about

397
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,480
Scientists are pretty convinced that

398
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,800
We're talking all about this lately

399
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,140
The day of the Lord is at hand

400
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,900
They're pretty convinced that, um

401
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,720
That we need to deprovincialize ourselves

402
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,920
One step further

403
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,180
And we thought that this universe

404
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,100
Was the only one

405
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,940
And it turns out that

406
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,540
They're pretty convinced that there's

407
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,060
Just multitudes of varied universes

408
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,620
All existing

409
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,560
They're real convinced of that, huh?

410
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,840
Well, if dogs can have multiple orgasms

411
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,420
Mathematically

412
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,740
Why can't we have multiple universes?

413
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,220
Mathematically

414
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,380
So if you've seen

415
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:42,380


416
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,860
You haven't done the math with your slide rule

417
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,820
And your calculations

418
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,880
No, but I'm open to whatever

419
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,280
You know, people come up with

420
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,060
Just as valid as anything I come

421
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
That might as well be

422
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,660
Come across anywhere else

423
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,300
Well, yeah, and you know as well as I do

424
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,580
That for all you know

425
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,780
All that math that they keep talking about

426
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,580
It's not real math

427
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,260
It might as well be the same as the totem pole

428
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,380
That some medicine man tells everybody to worship

429
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,740
Maybe, but it's the best bet we got

430
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,560
Well, it's

431
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,300
I mean, it's led us farther than any of those other things have

432
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,760
It's more like a meta

433
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,440
It took us to the moon

434
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,920
We have probes

435
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,380
We have probes

436
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,280
We have going all over the universe

437
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,400
What telephone poles have taken us to the moon, Larry?

438
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,240
I've been to the moon

439
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,440
Not on a telephone pole

440
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,360
Not the way you're talking about

441
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,980
Yeah

442
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,840
And I don't see no weird like eagles or thunderbirds

443
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,480
On top of any ladder of numbers

444
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,940
We're building a space station that got, you know

445
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,980
Science, you know, we understand a lot about a lot of things

446
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,340
DNA

447
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,140
Well, Hitler almost built a science station with the world of fire and ice

448
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,820
So it's gotten us a lot farther than all the other, you know

449
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,500
Religions

450
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,600
But Hitler built, almost built science with fire and ice

451
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,280
We've actually gotten things done

452
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,260
Science is the most exacting religion

453
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,840
They don't know what I'm talking about

454
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,540
No

455
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,660
The theory of fire and ice

456
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,300
Hitler's theory of science was totally whacked out

457
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,700
And yet he produced all this weird

458
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,860
Well, he didn't produce anything

459
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,800
Well, they had the best Nazi flying saucers in the whole hollow earth

460
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,620
Well, they believed in all this anti-grav stuff

461
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,880
But, you know, it didn't have

462
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,060
And they came out with that movie

463
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,100
Ilse, She-Wolf of the SS

464
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,020
Well, that was pure science right there

465
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,360
They work for the CIA now

466
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,500
Who does?

467
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,000
Where are all those Nazi sonnets, dude?

468
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,200
No, they're on their night

469
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,440
I think they're too old unless they're taking Islan

470
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,500
Islan?

471
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,300
Islan

472
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:17,880
Islan

473
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,840
Islan

474
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,540
Your island paradise on the moon

475
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:26,540
Attended to your every wish by a Nazi scientist from the year Zip

476
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,520
Here's Klaus Friedrich, an early inventor of U2

477
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,100
Preparing to offer you a jelly donut

478
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,480
And here's you spending over log in the hot sun

479
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,960
As Ilse, the She-Wolf of the SS

480
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,640
Hands you her slide roll

481
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:41,900
What?

482
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,660
We'll make you his jelly donut

483
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,100
And he has to

484
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,900
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution

485
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,000
Anything is likely to develop

486
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,020
Enter the church of the subgenius

487
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,420
Filling itself as the weirdest cult on earth

488
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,740
What do they believe in?

489
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,900
Everything

490
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,420
Who do they believe in?

491
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,340
The world

492
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,800
Oh yes good enjoy TV

493
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,040
Oh yeah

494
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,040


495
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,740
Oh yeah

496
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,220
Hey!

497
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:27,480


498
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:27,520
You should just be selling all these наших

499
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:27,600
Eh...

500
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,860
Nevermind

501
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,920
What do your unos excited as fuck?

502
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,720
What have you got to say aboututo?

503
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:44,760
slack to planet earth and to you young man and to you if you will send a dollar

504
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:58,200
for more with this is a church that does not play games and join the church of the subgenius

505
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,680
genetic engineers working in secret laboratories in

506
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:15,720
are now able to create an onion that will not make mr and mrs he doesn't even have a body his

507
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,740
little head yea verily for bob should be praised he is being praised this is how we praise bob

508
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,820
this is how we polish this is the way we worship our bob we take care of bob

509
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,180
like we worship our bob

510
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:37,860
no one else repeat after me no you repeat after me bob is ice bob is nice light

511
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:45,940
you know just saying it doesn't make it so bob is not nice yea verily yea verily i know if bob's

512
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:51,260
looking in the window are you the servant that opens it so he can piss no more onions will no

513
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:56,720
longer provoke i only know about it because if i had to seek out the magic towel that night

514
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,140
for bob has arisen

515
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,740
well you shouldn't have been able to continue again and again and again and again

516
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:07,820
it makes me want to go to grand view camping center and watch kill them sitting there bob is always up

517
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,740

518
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,060
always up dude

519
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:15,720
he never has to seek out the adult catalogs that other subgeniuses do

520
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,820
and you must receive slack in bob

521
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,380
those subgeniuses too cheap to get on their own computer must seek out

522
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,660
now you be nice to your little phone people

523
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,900
tiny little catalog

00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:33,560
or twenty and getting separated from you

525
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,140

the Smith part was a great

527
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,060
and cut-throat

530
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,280
and now Half Man, Half Biscuit.

531
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,780
Seriously, the following is a song by Half Man, Half Biscuit

532
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:14,540
called 99% of Gargoyles Look Like Bob.

533
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,740
Jesus Christ, come on down!

534
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,820
Have you ever wondered

535
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,860
How you get up

536
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,400
To get triangles from a cow you need

537
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,380
But a milk and cheese

538
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,520
And an equilateral chainsaw

539
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,340
In debt I owe someone a fiver

540
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,480
Maybe I should try my hand at slag

541
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,860
James Dean was just

542
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:25,860


543
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,360
A careless driver

544
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,620
And Marilyn Monroe was just

545
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,420
A drag

546
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,960
99% of Gargoyles

547
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,600
Look like Bob Tart

Look like Bob Tart

555
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,520
Mary had a little lamb

556
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,840
The doctors were astounded

557
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,060
Everywhere she went

558
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,620
Gynecologists surrounded

559
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,820
The doctors were astounded

560
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,120
with a

561
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,900
They've been cooking on Blue Peter now

562
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,100
They're sampling the dishes

563
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,320
I don't normally like tomatoes, John

564
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
But this is delicious

565
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,080
99% of Gargoyles Look Like Bob Tart

566
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,800
99% of Gargoyles Look Like Bob Tart

567
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,880
99% of gardeners look like Bob Jaws

568
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,560
Take me home

569
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:25,580
The son of Jimmy Clitherow is shouting out

570
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,120
Where's my Ferrucci?

571
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,040
Yeah

572
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,700
Well, they've come a room and spread

573
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,520
But they didn't tell the bread

574
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,500
Did you honestly think that they would?

575
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,540
And if they tell the bread

576
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:10,540


577
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,560
They'll take ten cats or prefer whiskers

578
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,840
To the other two prefer Leslie Jones

579
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:32,720
99% of gardeners look like Bob Jaws

580
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,020
99% of gardeners look like Bob Jaws

581
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,540
99% of gardeners look like Bob Jaws

582
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,400
99% of gardeners look like Bob Jaws

583
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:49,660
99% of gardeners look like Bob Jaws

584
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,660
Don't tell me you're the future

585
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,500
You'll be lucky to catch on at the phone company

586
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,360
Your parents up there, you know what I'm talking about

587
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,440
20, 25 years ago they were telling us

588
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,360
You are the future

589
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,460
You kids want to see the future?

590
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,260
Look at your folks

591
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,180
Fat butts, saggy tits, fear, television

592
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,340
That's the future

593
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,760
Look at me, I'm supposed to be a big success

594
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,680
I built taco stands for a living

595
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,220
What kind of bullshit future is that?

596
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,580
You got any sense?

597
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,980
Give them back their damn diplomas

598
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,220
Give them back their silly fucking hats

599
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,200
And stay 18 for the rest of your life

600
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,360
You don't want to be the future

601
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,420
No, no

602
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,540
Forget the future

603
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,460
The future sucks

604
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,560
There he was

605
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,020
Big as life

606
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,440
Right there at the foot of my bed

607
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Jesus

608
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,360
Hmm?

609
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,080
Jesus?

610
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,100
And he looked me straight in the eye

611
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,240
And he said

612
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,040
What on it?

613
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,060
Wanda Jean

614
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,340
There's more to love than just fornicating

615
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,720
Ha ha ha, sure

616
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,140
That's like eyes in the back of your head

617
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,560
Yeah

618
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,000
Even the purest research

619
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,600
These mud-gobbling giant worms

620
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,580
Which live on the edge of volcanic vents

621
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,160
Gorging themselves on massive huge piles of mud

622
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,380
Just like those tremor worms

623
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,820
Just like the ones in Dune

624
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,740
Only this mud is wet

625
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,440
Biologists frequently choose the tiny worm

626
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,520
Not like the kind of mud we used to have back when we were kids

627
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,780
It was dry mud

628
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,600
We used to have to make mud pies

629
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,460
And to make them stick together

630
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,740
We had to spit on them

631
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,300
We'd like have dirt in one hand

632
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,200
And a big pile of spit in the other hand

633
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,020
And we'd like roll them together

634
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,960
Until we had us a good mud pie

635
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,020
And that was the only thing we had for moisture back in those days

636
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,640
Just spit

637
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,520
We didn't have candy back then either

638
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,980
We had to just take a bag of sugar

639
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,920
And carry it around a big old five-pack of sugar

640
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:05,920


641
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,480
And carry it around a big old five-pack of sugar

642
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,340
We had to carry around a big pound bag of sugar

643
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,280
In our back pocket

644
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:08,640
In our back pocket

645
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,320
A big old tablespoon

646
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,520
And when we needed some candy

647
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,620
We just stuck it into the bag

648
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,940
And it took about four or five big tablespoons

649
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,600
Shoveled it down

650
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,580
And that was all we had for candy back in those days

651
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,340
Each one genetically engineered to make a difference

652
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:28,420
Now when a worm dines on one of these babies

653
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,060
You gotta have

654
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,720
Those worms have to have lamps

655
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,040
To see underground when they're eating through the dirt like that

656
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,460
For about one thousand miles per hour

657
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,000
They carry little like little miners helmets that let them mine through the dirt.

658
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,760
They're chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing.

659
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,160
Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.

660
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,600
They chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away.

661
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,580
Oh, I can't see where I'm going, said Mr. Worm.

662
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,640
And he looked ahead and he had his little pointed yellow helmet on,

663
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,160
shining the way into the back of the goose, as it were.

664
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,800
Where the end of the goose is flying.

665
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,000
They thought it was a reptile, but actually it was a bird.

666
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,360
It was a bird.

667
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,480
They found that it was only a simple bird.

668
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,220
It was a bird-like reptile bird.

669
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,820
It was only the size of a goose.

670
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:26,120
And yet its wings were 900 feet wide at their widest proportion.

671
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,480
27 feet, or 30 actually.

672
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,300
Where's Bozo?

673
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,540
Larger specimens recently discovered.

674
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,060
What the hell?

675
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,680
It's the Twinkie Bike.

676
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,340
What a wonderful, wonderful Twinkie Bike.

677
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,560
And so the Twinkie Bike headed out into the desert, carrying the little show people.

678
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,040
They asked me about...

679
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,300
Twinkie Bike, Twinkie Bike.

680
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,900
They asked me about Twinkies on my show.

681
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,760
And they asked what the ingredients were.

682
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,820
Of course, all I could tell them was...

683
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,540
That's when I got fillies!

684
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,240
Golden sponge cake and creamy fillings.

685
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,100
That's all you need to know.

686
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,100
You don't need to know anything more than...

687
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,980
That is all on Earth you know and all you need.

688
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,820
And we'll enter that in the computer.

689
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,360
That's good enough for Thor.

690
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,120
That's good enough for me.

691
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,540
The United States of Sponge.

692
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,420
Creamy soft whipped cream.

693
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,620
Yes, little caller, you have won the United States of Sponge.

694
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,280
...going everywhere in the valley.

695
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:22,460
As we continue to look for your requested songs, squeezing these up in four.

696
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,080
...from within the confines of its donut-like home.

697
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,120
Is it a bird?

698
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:31,460
No!

699
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:31,880
No!

700
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,840
Is it a plane?

701
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,260
No!

702
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,020
Oh my gosh, it's mighty mild.

703
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,720
No way I'll hide.

704
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,840
No way I'll hide.

705
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,120
No way I'll wait all the while.

706
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,220
Is it a bird?

707
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,780
No!

708
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,840
Is it a plane?

709
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,340
No!

710
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,940
Oh my gosh, it's mighty mild.

711
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:10,340
No way I'll fly out of town.

712
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:10,420
Yeah!

713
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,820
It's açe madam, it's a plane!

714
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,920
It's a flying bird, whatever your tailゆ.

715
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:17,980
Step out.

716
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,420
It's clickba-kling-ling...

717
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,920
You know it'll cut my nose.

718
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:20,920


719
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,460
Yes, 900 miles an hour, people!

720
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,580
This is examiny services, you never say to me,

721
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,260
ё round dogs are probably believed to be a process of wagging.

722
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,060
Godneagit government of humanity!

723
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,820
Actually, I have danger!

724
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:29,880
You should get out now.

725
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,880
Oh no, please!

726
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,280
Hey, Boggs!

727
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,140
I have a special report on the camps to make to the Ministry of Education.

728
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,040
For the children.

729
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,760
Tally-tally!

730
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,960
You get 152 hits.

731
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,780
It may sound silly to you, but...

732
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,260
Something bothering you, boy?

733
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,640
Nuclear death.

734
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,780
Oh, God!

735
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,620
Oh, okay.

736
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:44,100
When I take it this place, this Mabel Street, is not unique by no means.

737
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:59,620
While we were in Italy, this woman walked up to my friend and threw my friend a baby.

738
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,660
And, uh...

739
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,680
My friend caught the woman's baby.

740
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,080
Her other kids ran up and took what was in my friend's pockets.

741
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,540
So, um...

742
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,200
Let that be a tip for you, you know, if you're ever in Italy and, uh...

743
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,220
Someone throws you a baby, swat it to the ground.

744
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,820
Swat it to the ground and scream,

745
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,920
I don't think so!

746
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,360
I'm just trying to take a bite out of crime.

747
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,220
The Lord took...

748
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,400
Took the child.

749
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,440
He died a heartless death.

750
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,440


751
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,440


752
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,440


753
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,440


754
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,440


755
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:31,960
A horrible death.

756
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,000
The awfulness of it...

757
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,660
Staggers the imagination.

758
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,380
We're going to be using this corpse for a demonstration of placement.

759
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,720
And she looked at me and said...

760
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,920
She's a stupid.

761
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,160
I said, what do you mean?

762
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,820
She said...

763
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,260
She...

764
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,580
She's a stupid.

765
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,360
No, Sid.

766
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,080
I said, I went out of my mind.

767
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,860
I said, I went out of my mind.

768
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,440
I said, I went out of my mind.

769
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,000
And she looked at me and said...

770
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,160
I went to save the others.

771
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,320
And she said...

772
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,280
You don't have to be afraid of him.

773
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,300
That's all there is to it.

774
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,620
Rew, rew.

775
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,000
Rew, rew.

776
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,280
Ah!

777
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,300
Now I can't take it anymore!

778
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,200
Friends, are you going to let this happen?

779
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,440
Are you just going to sit by and watch this go?

780
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,220
This corpse rot?

781
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,600
Are you going to scrub its buttocks with a dog brush?

782
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,880
Or are you going to get down and apply mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to this rotting corpse in his

783
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,760
WCSV?

784
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,700
With your lips?

785
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,620
Which do you want?

786
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,020
Prefer?

787
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:50,040
Don't you want to get down there and apply the kiss of life?

788
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,100
Things will all be going our ways.

789
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,100


790
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,780
You guys are worthless.

791
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,440
I know we are.

792
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:52,840
Get out of here.

793
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,980
Don't you want to...

794
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,160
Get out of my radio station.

795
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,380
Let's go.

796
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:57,920
I'm going home.

797
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,160
Man, we cannot get one lousy carnivusion.

798
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,420
I'm going home.

799
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:01,420


800
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:01,420


801
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:01,420


802
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:01,420


803
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:01,420


804
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:01,420


805
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,720
My friends, I was in the spirit and Bob said to me, he said, I'm going to have to call

806
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,800
you home, Reverend Stangen.

807
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,740
I don't think he meant home to Texas.

808
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:07,920
How about?

809
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,660
I think he meant home to heaven.

810
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,220
A beautiful home away from home.

811
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,540
If he says because it's the only way to send a signal to these people because they don't

812
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,140
seem to believe.

813
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:16,380
Look it.

814
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:16,660
There's the gates.

815
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,680
You can travel there on a signal.

816
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,700
I'm being called home, friends.

817
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,480
A beam of light.

818
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,560
Bob's calling me up.

819
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,680
Now I see the rocking chair of eternal slack up there on that beautiful cloud.

820
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,220
Oh, yes.

821
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:29,560
Why, look.

822
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:30,940
There's Bob.

823
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,400
Oh, yes.

824
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:31,400


825
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:31,400


826
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:31,400


827
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:31,400


828
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:31,400


829
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:38,640
There's beautiful creatures of the desired sex gyrating around the heavenly excrementation

830
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,040
throne.

831
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,540
And then just when you're in the gate, you thought you were in the gate in the heaven.

832
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,900
You made the ultimate mistake.

833
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,560
You didn't call 68769.

834
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,220
Oh, you could have.

835
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,580
That's the funny thing about it.

836
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,300
You could have.

837
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,300
At any minute.

838
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,420
Even after the show.

839
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,620
Oh, if he only would have sent his contribution.

840
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,100
You could have.

841
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,320
He could have had a coffee mug.

842
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,020
A beautiful logo shirt on.

843
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,300
Maybe he was a new twinter.

844
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,500
But you blew it.

845
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,440
You fool.

846
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,280
Man, you totally blew it.

847
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,160
God, I can't believe what a geek.

848
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:25,620
How could anybody totally, totally, totally, utterly, utterly.

849
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,780
Well, all I remember was he had a chance to get one of those warm sweatshirts on.

850
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:29,860


851
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,340
You were told.

852
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:30,660
Don't.

853
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,200
Don't.

854
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:31,400
Don't.

855
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


856
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


857
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


858
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


859
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


860
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


861
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


862
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


863
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


864
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


865
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


866
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


867
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:31,400


868
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:31,780
Don't do that.

869
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:31,800
Don't do that.

870
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,800


871
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,800


872
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,800


873
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,800


874
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,840
You blew it.

875
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,920
Don't mess up.

876
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,640
And you messed up.

877
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:42,460
Cause you didn't call 6900 in the 216 area code.

878
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:43,960
Oh, man.

879
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,740
Did you blow it, dude?

880
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,300
So that sweatshirt, no, no, you didn't get that, either.

881
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,580
Well, you know, and that 6900 is the number itself you will get.

882
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:58,340
If you're not having sex and you don't have anybody loving you lately, if you just call

883
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,460
that number 6900.

884
00:44:59,460 --> 00:44:59,700
6900.

885
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,620
The S gets to 6900

886
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,300
because it's like,

887
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:01,720
that's it.

888
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,160
It's synergy.

889
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:02,740
You know.

890
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:03,900
69,

891
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:04,960
it means belly rub.

892
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:05,640
Yeah,

893
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,020
69.

894
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,300
We each get something out of it.

895
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:08,960
You know what I mean?

896
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,580
Like,

897
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:10,940
it's an old,

898
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,200
oh,

899
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:11,960
there it is again.

900
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,380
Here they come again.

901
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,460
There they go.

902
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,060
They never come around for long.

903
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:19,900
Touch you.

904
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,980
We want to rub

905
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,980
your little round belly,

906
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,400
listener.

907
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,760
We want to reach out

908
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,640
with our fingers

909
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,160
over these hair waves.

910
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:26,860
We want to reach out

911
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,780
with our fist

912
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,180
and bust you in the face

913
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,120
if you don't call.

914
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,080
We're going to fist you,

915
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,820
my dear friend.

916
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,060
We're going to fist you

917
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:34,760
right in the face.

918
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,960
I can smell your feet

919
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,060
from all the way

920
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,360
across the escheleta.

921
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:38,880
Vino,

922
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,720
vi-vi-vino.

923
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:40,220
Yes,

924
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,380
I believe that Jesus Christ

925
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,560
is a succulent,

926
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,340
delicious,

927
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:44,480
flavorful,

928
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:44,840
juicy,

929
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:45,760
tender

930
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,620
son of God,

931
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,080
the Messiah.

932
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,540
And I'll tell you what,

933
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,580
because I was that desperate.

934
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,440
And this other male,

935
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,480
he's being stimulated

936
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,480
by the mating activity

937
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,820
and he wants to have a go too.

938
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:56,560
Oh,

939
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,360
that's so sweet.

940
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,340
And everybody knows that.

941
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,880
Arusha Control speaking.

942
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:09,800
Go ahead.

943
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,180
We have a rhino.

944
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,500
Anything else?

945
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,180
He's bleeding pretty badly.

946
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,260
Anything else?

947
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,360
No, that's all.

948
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,340
I saw these guys

949
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,980
in a roller rink.

950
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:27,980
I saw the,

951
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,300
who is this now,

952
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,320
the Fletchland Angels?

953
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,300
It's,

954
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:31,820
um,

955
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,060
Dick Clark.

956
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,700
Dick Clark.

957
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,040
Yeah,

958
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,960
Andy in the Warhols.

959
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,040
I saw the plastic

960
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:36,840
exploding bananas

961
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,940
at a roller rink

962
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,420
in Columbus,

963
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:38,740
Ohio,

964
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,260
when I was a sparse lad

965
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,160
of nearly 58 years old.

966
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,460
I had,

967
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,440
I was wearing chicken shoes

968
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:44,980
at the time

969
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,080
and Nico noticed me

970
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,720
in the front row.

971
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,620
She waved

972
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,060
and threw some

973
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,040
barbiturates to me.

974
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,960
She also rubbed

975
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,360
that hefty groin of hers

976
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,560
with a large

977
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,060
red Italian scarf.

978
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,540
I wonder what that meant.

979
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,680
Do you think it could

980
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,200
mean anything?

981
00:46:59,480 --> 00:46:59,900
No, right.

982
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,700
Stop trying to see,

983
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,280
you know,

984
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,680
deep, hidden meanings

985
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,280
in everything.

986
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,000
In what she does

987
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,460
and everything, I guess.

988
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:05,820
Anything.

989
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,320
I guess I should stop.

990
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,980
There is no reality.

991
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,100
No, I guess there is no,

992
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,140
I thought you were going

993
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:13,820
to say all reality

994
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,700
is interpretive,

995
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:15,700
but you said

996
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,860
there is no reality.

997
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,980
No, everything's relative.

998
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,920
Right, we're not talking

999
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,540
about Homeland Security

1000
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,920
or the black holes

1001
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,020
that could envelop us

1002
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,020
in a hundred billion years.

1003
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:23,120
Who even knows

1004
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,020
which universe we're in

1005
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:24,720
at any given moment?

1006
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:24,820
Right, right.

1007
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,000
I mean, that, you know, right.

1008
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,080
You know, you're here,

1009
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,720
you're there, you know.

1010
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,380
Speak for yourself, man.

1011
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,600
I've been stuck

1012
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,560
in the same one

1013
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,820
this whole time.

1014
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,900
Yeah, talk about strange.

1015
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,580
I'm pretty sure of it.

1016
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,940
Except for that one time

1017
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,100
when alternate universe man

1018
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,360
did his trick

1019
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,660
just to prove he could do it.

1020
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,560
Attention!

1021
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,640
Our next witness is Paul.

1022
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,100
Oh.

1023
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,060
R-O-T-S.

1024
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:58,760
Thank you.

1025
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,620
Clueless.

1026
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,160
We look forward

1027
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,420
to your testimony, Mr. Mellor.

1028
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,140
Today's hearing is important

1029
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,420
to the office furniture industry

1030
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,320
for four reasons.

1031
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,600
Scram, dribble butt!

1032
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,260
Mr. Chairman,

1033
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,300
let me conclude by saying

1034
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,000
thank you.

1035
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,080
You took a leave of absence

1036
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,160
with three children

1037
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,220
and a wife and a girlfriend

1038
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:17,740
on the side.

1039
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,800
Bless his little heart.

1040
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,700
How did you afford

1041
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,540
a leave of absence?

1042
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,020
Pretty drunk.

1043
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,780
Thank you, Mr. Donald DeRossi,

1044
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,600
who was established in 1927.

1045
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,100
Uh, uh, thank you.

1046
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,360
Come on back in your home!

1047
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,420
And so there they are.

1048
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,200
Oh, no!

1049
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,200
Oh, no.

1050
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,920
Mr. Chairman,

1051
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,960
let me conclude by saying

1052
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,280
Teletubby!

1053
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,840
Oh, no, please.

1054
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,100
Eyes burning like coals.

1055
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,040
The blood,

1056
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,760
bloodsucker

1057
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,500
of Betsy Moore.

1058
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,600
Holy catfish.

1059
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,300
That's awful.

1060
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,140
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

1061
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,020
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

1062
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

1063
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,180
Well, uh,

1064
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,360
where would my dad

1065
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,460
get rid of a body?

1066
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,380
Ha, ha, ha.

1067
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,680
There's just one little thing

1068
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,340
you're forgetting, college boy.

1069
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,300
You buried him, too.

1070
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,020
Hey!

1071
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,400
It was money.

1072
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,500
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1073
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,460
How are you doing on time?

1074
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,180
I will wrap up very quickly.

1075
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:35,580
Thank you.

1076
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,920
The purple dinosaur

1077
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,500
who has been called everything

1078
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,060
from refreshingly sweet

1079
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,000
to nauseatingly nerdy.

1080
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,480
Well, once again,

1081
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,660
rule toddler TV.

1082
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,100
Menacing the Teletubbies.

1083
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,980
I believe that the Teletubbies are,

1084
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,440
their time is on this.

1085
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,980
They're definitely...

1086
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,020
Never seen them, actually.

1087
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,280
Their days are numbered.

1088
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,820
They may as well put a fork in the Teletubbies

1089
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,340
once Barney hits the scene again.

1090
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,360
Did you see this subgenius hooded robe?

1091
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,880
Subgenius hooded robe?

1092
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,560
Clearly made to intimidate and impress,

1093
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,100
and I'm guessing it dates 1980,

1094
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:11,920
maybe the beginning.

1095
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:12,420
What's its origin?

1096
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,440
The best item of its kind I've ever encountered.

1097
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,860
Unfortunately, we have no information

1098
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,420
identifying the subgenius.

1099
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,280
Robe is of excellent quality,

1100
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,320
in thin black wool,

1101
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,720
58 inches long from the neck,

1102
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,040
nine-button front.

1103
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,780
Buttons are silver-colored,

1104
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,380
permanently affixed to the neck,

1105
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,460
is a 14-inch tall hood,

1106
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,880
which comes to a point at the top rear

1107
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,740
and then goes 10 inches forward to its front,

1108
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,620
which falls the face mask with...

1109
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,040
Wow.

1110
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,160
One size fits all, huh?

1111
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,680
For the men that want something extra,

1112
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:39,840
which would be at the top of the forehead,

1113
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,220
it's not available in stores.

1114
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,720
Two-and-a-half-inch by two-and-three-quarter-inch

1115
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,120
embroidered Dobbs face.

1116
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,720
This is not amazingly boring stuff.

1117
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:48,860
This is the real thing.

1118
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,280
No, this is amazing.

1119
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,640
Has wavy white embroidered edge.

1120
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,560
Yeah, this thing on the back

1121
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,860
has a 12-inch high red inverted pipe.

1122
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,020
Does it have the flap?

1123
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,660
It has a flap in the back.

1124
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,200
How much does it cost?

1125
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,580
That's the important thing.

1126
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,200
How much are they charging?

1127
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,780
It's $475.

1128
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,040
Does it have the pyroflatulation flap in the back?

1129
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,080
But it may be so aged that it would fall apart.

1130
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,100
It sounds like it's actually real.

1131
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,880
Because if you didn't have that flap

1132
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,580
and it cost $475,

1133
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,960
you could risk actually igniting it

1134
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,060
if you weren't careful.

1135
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,320
It's a mysterious, subterraneous robe.

1136
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,420
Yeah, from some secret society or order.

1137
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,840
Look at it, this piece of hood.

1138
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,500
With a skull and crossbones.

1139
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,280
I don't believe me,

1140
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,900
because he thinks they're light.

1141
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,700
I like him, but when the UFOs come,

1142
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,160
the ladies are going to kill everybody but me.

1143
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,380
Well, you know, of course they'll spare the righteous.

1144
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,060
That's what all subgeniuses think.

1145
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,740
I'm helping channel the thoughts of all subgeniuses

1146
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,900
onto the show.

1147
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,260
That means no one will be spared.

1148
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,240
And no one will call.

1149
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,620
They don't need to go to Brushwood.

1150
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,620
The saucers will come and pick them up

1151
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,680
wherever they are.

1152
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,480
They'll be instantly materialized.

1153
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,740
It'll be like a rapture

1154
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,640
of subgenii.

1155
00:51:59,060 --> 00:51:59,840
Yes, thank you.

1156
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,920
Right now, we're looking at a picture

1157
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,600
of all the subgenii sitting in their

1158
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,640
pretend first-class seats on the space shuttles,

1159
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,240
ready to leave.

1160
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,180
Mysterious and threatening secret clan

1161
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,080
or society.

1162
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,680
I was just telling you, it's a subgenius robe

1163
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,980
from the early 70s.

1164
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,100
Well, it certainly looks like a terrifying,

1165
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,500
intimidating robe.

1166
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:19,880
It does, it does.

1167
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,260
That's back when they used to paddle the pledges

1168
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,080
and all that stuff.

1169
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,500
Yeah, we used to make them run the gauntlet.

1170
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,020
The bobbies?

1171
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,380
The famous naked woman gauntlet

1172
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,340
we used to run them through.

1173
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,020
They hated that.

1174
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,900
Those bobbies, they always hate stuff

1175
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,020
because they're nerds.

1176
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,260
And they're so competitive among themselves.

1177
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,960
That's what's so pathetic about it.

1178
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,500
Just because the average weight of each of those women

1179
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,720
was well beyond 300 pounds,

1180
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,800
that shouldn't have any effect on it

1181
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,400
if they were, you know.

1182
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,760
Or where Philo has worked for a million years.

1183
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,200
Thinkers.

1184
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,080
Thinkers from beyond the sun.

1185
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:54,380
The competitive world.

1186
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,280
On the backside of reality.

1187
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,060
A little conspiracy biz.

1188
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,620
A little boil on reality.

1189
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,620
Fantasies that boil up in a drenched sunburst

1190
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,980
of fun and relaxation.

1191
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,060
Rest and relaxation at last.

1192
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:09,940
I don't feel relaxed.

1193
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,680
This show makes me all tense and itchy.

1194
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,800
From rest and sleep.

1195
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:16,960
Witch.

1196
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,460
Yeah, you can earn money even while you sleep

1197
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:25,700
with our custom sexual cyber brain.

1198
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,620
from the must-have turnkey operation website

1199
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,780
and sooner our best men

1200
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:39,360

1201
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,280
percent fulfillment

1202
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,260
startup with only ten dollars

1203
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,540
you must be two hundred years twenty one years old

1204
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,500
laws and desperate

1205
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:57,960
for the space and what for us and what we negotiating for

1206
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,640
means that a good deal that we want to know

1207
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,300
yeah i want to know return a second-guessing negotiating team problems

1208
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:07,740
that i just want to know if it's worth the trouble i'm going to i don't waste

1209
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,060
my time if all we're gonna get out of it is a few pictures of space or something

1210
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,320
okay okay i'll tell you

1211
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,160
right this time

1212
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,800
all life on earth is going to be dead in five years

1213
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,380
skip over the other side

1214
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:19,880
right this time

1215
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,580
what's this

1216
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,540
this is what they want to say that

1217
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,080
all the flowers

1218
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,820
all the trees

1219
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,000
all the birdies

1220
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,240
told all the children

1221
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:30,560
that's it

1222
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,760
yet dedicated as we are bob

1223
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,940
you know they have no incentives no motivation

1224
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:37,840
what's this

1225
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,200
survival map to show us where we're gonna pick them up

1226
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,720
uh... better not lose it

1227
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,360
i'd say bob

1228
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,260
all things

1229
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:46,840
uh...

1230
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,800
in think

1231
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,280
l Olympic

1232
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,320
the

1233
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:01,320


1234
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,380
car

1235
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,760
ho

1236
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:03,780
the

1237
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,480
police

1238
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:05,480


1239
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:05,900
where

1240
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,700
that

1241
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:06,740
long

1242
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,500
didn't

1243
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,100
you

1244
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,540
i shell

1245
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:19,280
is quite a

1246
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,260
to see what the size of my nose

1247
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,760
has to do with the problem that we are facing now.

1248
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,840
You can be like the queen on sex planners.

1249
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,480
It makes you constantly comment

1250
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,020
on its prodigious size.

1251
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,480
I forget. You know, I never

1252
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,540
did watch Star Trek, so I don't know all the different

1253
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,480
characters. What is it about

1254
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,240
my nose that constantly brings

1255
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,000
great attention?

1256
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,400
Blast you, spook. You know that your nose

1257
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,520
is in front to all decent Earth men?

1258
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,880
Weird. I'm picking up like...

1259
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,480
That's what you keep telling me.

1260
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,380
Are you out of your Vulcan mind, spook?

1261
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,420
Oh, I get it.

1262
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,880
He doesn't have a mind, right? Is that the joke?

1263
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,820
A mind is a

1264
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,400
terrible thing to waste.

1265
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,900
When the baby is done drinking, it must

1266
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,240
be unscrewed and laid in a cool place

1267
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,020
under a tap.

1268
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,720
This cheesy nut butter is the cause

1269
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,000
of the alien's antagonism.

1270
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,440
I'm sorry. I think I just sat on the racist

1271
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,520
peanut butter cups.

1272
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,040
You did that on purpose. I saw you.

1273
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,280
Just so I could have them all.

1274
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,000
Oh, he figured out my point.

1275
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,120
All right, all right.

1276
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:20,520
Yeah, yeah.

1277
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:21,200
Look at that.

1278
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,740
To boldly split infinitives

1279
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,540
where no one has done that

1280
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:28,980
before.

1281
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,280
Voyage to see what's on the box.

1282
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,300
Space. The final frontier.

1283
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,920
And then a bunch of old crappy stars

1284
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,320
pretending to go like this.

1285
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,260
These are the voyages of the starship KPFA.

1286
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,120
Its continuing mission

1287
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,140
to boldly explore

1288
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,460
space.

1289
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,460
To split...

1290
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,580
Smash up the entire...

1291
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,680
Break everything.

1292
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,780
The bottom is erupting.

1293
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,080
The entire studio...

1294
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,280
That's the monster that comes out and attacks the whole ship.

1295
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,100
Oh, some monster, did they, Kirk?

1296
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,220
What kind of ship is that?

1297
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,960
Every week there's a Kirk out.

1298
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,920
The ship pitches and rolls.

1299
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,160
Everyone falls out of his seat.

1300
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,040
Here's a harder one.

1301
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:05,540
Oh!

1302
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,160
Oh!

1303
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:06,960
Oh!

1304
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,520
Hard is right.

1305
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:11,760
Oh, my seat!

1306
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,440
Well, friends, Dr. Howell

1307
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,060
and the...

1308
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,880
show there on KPFA.

1309
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,640
Before that, a clip sent by

1310
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,760
the bishop.

1311
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:25,620
And tons of Lemurian collage.

1312
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,920
And remember, friends,

1313
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,440
you can always check out

1314
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,600

1315
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,400
or you can write to me

1316
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,780
at

1317
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,400
postofficebox181417

1318
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,020
That's

1319
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,380
181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1320
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,700
44118.

1321
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,140
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.

1322
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,020
And now, Christopher Hyatt

1323
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,120
with the late

1324
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,540
occult scholar

1325
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,720
Israel Regardie.

1326
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,080
The Guru Hymn.

1327
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,340
This is a hymn

1328
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,740
dedicated to the grinning,

1329
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,980
giggling monkey guru.

1330
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,820
Now, this

1331
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,400
is bliss consciousness.

1332
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,280
Now we have the roots

1333
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,600
of the tree.

1334
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,700
This is the trunk of the tree.

1335
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,580
These are the branches of the tree

1336
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,300
with the pretty leaves.

1337
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,620
Now, in order to get bliss consciousness,

1338
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:27,180
we must water the roots of the tree.

1339
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,640
When the roots are watered,

1340
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,780
the bliss rises up the trunk of the tree

1341
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,600
into the branches of the tree,

1342
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,020
into the leaves.

1343
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,660
When this happens,

1344
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,820
we have bliss consciousness.

1345
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,640
Now, bliss consciousness is something

1346
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,520
that your mother will approve of.

1347
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,180
Unlike,

1348
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,980
like sex and other said things,

1349
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,280
this fits right on in with her.

1350
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,040
She loves bliss consciousness.

1351
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,680
Pig.

1352
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,200
Pig.

1353
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,300
There is a happy land

1354
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,960
far, far away

1355
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,720
where little piggies grow

1356
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,620
three times a day.

1357
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,180
Oh, you should see them run

1358
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,320
when they see the butcher come

1359
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,640
to cut slices off their bum

1360
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,160
three times a day.

1361
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,360
Oh, man!

1362
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:30,400
I wish they didn't L detection!

1363
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,460
It was a Seb Bestz-in-isses

1364
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:34,480
ash.

1365
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:34,640
We love that!

1366
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:44,640
Oh, there you are.

1367
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,040
Oh, there you are.

1368
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,640
Oh, there you are.

1369
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,300
Oh, oh, oh.

1370
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,060
What do you want?

1371
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:51,920
What do you want?

1372
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,260
I was wondering where you've been.

1373
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,320
Living on Bob.

1374
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,660
Bob Bob's Bob.
