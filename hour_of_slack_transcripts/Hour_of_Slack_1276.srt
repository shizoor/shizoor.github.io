1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
You ain't nothin' but a soul genius!

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,560
Power of...

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,820
...watch!

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,700
We depend on you to lift the standards of our young people, not hasten their decadence.

5
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,980
We depend on you to lift the standards of our young people, not hasten their decadence.

6
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,580
We depend on you to lift the standards of our young people, not hasten their decadence.

7
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:49,460
If responsibilities get heavy to bear, can your blind walk through life so severe?

8
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:59,300
There's a hypnotic man who is beckoning from, with his disembodied head always there.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,040
Look away, look away, from the things to the billowing light.

10
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:18,540
Look away, look away, from the things to the billowing light.

11
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:47,180
If your conflicts with normals bring struggles and strife, may then onward your rantings ensue.

12
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,180
Look away, look away, from the things to the billowing light.

13
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,780
That's a waiting and odd sound for you.

14
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,080
Look away.

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,480
Look away.

16
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,340
From the things to the billowing light.

17
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,520
Look away.

18
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,980
Look away.

19
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:10,980


20
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:10,980


21
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,940
From the things to the billowing light.

22
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,200
Yee-haw!

23
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,520
The Mutant Mountain Boys!

24
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,680
Bless their hearts.

25
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,220
It's recorded in Cleveland, behind the Beachland Ballroom, outside the devotional.

26
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,320
I believe it's on YouTube, and you, too, can Google Mutant Mountain Boys.

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,080
This is Hour of Slack number 1,276, and through the miracle of Pater Nostril's recordings,

28
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:57,420
we can journey back to the 13th X-Day drill, to the Hours of Slack, and of asking Dr. Howell,

29
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,320
before a live audience of beautiful...

30
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,620
live girls.

31
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,100
With the Pope Black, and even, yes, Dr. Philo Drummond, overman, first degree,

32
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,220
a dabbling delver into the dark mysteries.

33
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,540
Keep delving, Philo, with due diligence.

34
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,820
I've got to go a little deeper now.

35
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,060
Into the deeper things above.

36
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,260
Wow, this one's all hot. It's all heated up.

37
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,060
Mmm.

38
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,600
Sorry.

39
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,980
It's not the only thing that's heated up around here.

40
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,160
Dr. Howell, this is unprecedented.

41
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,380
Hmm.

42
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,700
This is a...

43
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,860
This is a...

44
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,820
A $10 question.

45
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,740
All right, a sawbuck.

46
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,240
See, I told you things were getting better.

47
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,660
Prosperity is just around the corner.

48
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,560
And the next piece of pie.

49
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,400
I got a feeling that you're going to be in trouble tonight.

50
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,620
Let's have another cup of coffee.

51
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,400
You're in trouble, and I'm not talking about a bladder infection.

52
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,180
You're in over your head now.

53
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,460
Well, uh...

54
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,240
Of course, this was $20.

55
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,160
That is generous.

56
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,240
There will be a poem.

57
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,240
But there will also be the best gall-gurned answer to this question that I can give.

58
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,680
This is a really easy...

59
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,360
This is a softball, Dr. Howell.

60
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,780
It's a $10 softball.

61
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,020
You may think so with your improved mental and physical apparatus,

62
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,940
but I will have to judge whether it's easy or not.

63
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,500
It's all heated up, too.

64
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,160
It's still warm.

65
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,020
Dr. Howell, which direction is the enemy coming from?

66
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,940
Now, there's...

67
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,340
Okay, I'll...

68
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,160
Go ahead.

69
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,880
Which direction is the enemy coming from?

70
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,020
Well, the enemy...

71
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,480
Very leading question.

72
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,780
The worst aspect of the enemy,

73
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,420
the van of the enemy's swarming army

74
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,700
of imps, witches, succubi,

75
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,620
the whole appalling number of them

76
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,360
come from all directions.

77
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,000
But the worst aspect of the enemy is...

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,680
The ones that you have to worry about the most

79
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,080
are the ones coming from behind you.

80
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,600
Because you can't see when they get there

81
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,720
or what they're intending to do.

82
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,520
Generally, your worst suspicions about this

83
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,540
tend to be correct.

84
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,740
Something's coming up behind you, Dr. Howell.

85
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,540
That is why these worst suspicions occur.

86
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,440
You are given them the gift of paranoia

87
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,500
to know the worst about what your potential...

88
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:28,980
your potential...

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,280
enemy might be doing.

90
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,200
I think this is clear.

91
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,640
Thrusting itself.

92
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,920
That's true.

93
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,820
Impinging upon you, you could say.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,980
But there is a solution,

95
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,780
which is to use the enemy's

96
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,480
particular vulnerability against it

97
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,200
to lead them on and on and on

98
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,040
in incredible nearness

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,980
past the zone.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,260
And then, when they are closer,

101
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,860
even in the embrace of Zeno's paradox,

102
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,080
may you lash out.

103
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,260
Perhaps through over-stimulation,

104
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,020
but the valor of your response

105
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,380
will always be recorded.

106
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,140
Keep milking.

107
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,700
It's only like about eight bucks so far.

108
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,260
Keep going.

109
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,880
Oh, but there is the poem.

110
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:28,980
It's a poem.

111
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:28,980


112
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:28,980


113
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:28,980


114
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:28,980


115
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:28,980


116
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,780
There's the poem, you see.

117
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,020
I'm trying to figure out which one that is.

118
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,400
There's a poem.

119
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,920
Okay, there's a $2 worth of poem on the end of this one.

120
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:36,940
Oh, okay.

121
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,080
Well, $2.

122
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,880
I don't think we're going to do a poem for $2.

123
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,600
It doesn't matter.

124
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,040
We're just winging the thing.

125
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,540
So, which direction is your enemy likely to come from?

126
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,880
If your enemy is valiant and honorable,

127
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,680
then there's probably a reason

128
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,040
why you are being attacked.

129
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,180
Hmm?

130
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,880
So, then, if you are a piece of evil,

131
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,320
human flotsam,

132
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,320
then your enemy will come directly toward you,

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,100
because your enemy is more noble

134
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,360
and heroic than you are,

135
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,820
and deserves to win,

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,760
like in all the stories.

137
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,420
But you are not some scumbag, are you?

138
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,520
You're a subgenius.

139
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,660
So, your enemy instead is the ignoble one,

140
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,880
and will come from a direction

141
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,000
that is not the brilliant order of battle

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,780
with martial banners

143
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,900
flapping and trumpets blowing.

144
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,560
Instead, like a slinking assassin,

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,700
or like a Japanese soldier in Burma in 1945

146
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,200
sneaking up to your jungle hammock

147
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,300
to stick a silent bayonet through

148
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,400
and impale you before you can even get to your rifle,

149
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,360
something like that will happen

150
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,020
if you have not been true

151
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,640
to your subgenius principles

152
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,560
and the faith in Bob.

153
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,360
Now, of course,

154
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,940
I'm not here to try to panic anybody,

155
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,140
and we have to live with a certain expectation

156
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,480
of being jogged from our world of comfort

157
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,400
and narcissistic reflection,

158
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,600
smug self-satisfaction.

159
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,240
These things do happen.

160
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,140
But the type of enemy you get

161
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,300
is what determines the direction

162
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,740
the enemy comes at you,

163
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,380
and the type of enemy you get

164
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,220
is determined by the type of enemy

165
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,440
you are.

166
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,260
And now I think I used it up

167
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,620
except to the poem.

168
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,380
And let's see.

169
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,740
The poem shall be from T.S. Eliot.

170
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,360
In an old house there is always listening,

171
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,980
and more is heard than is spoken,

172
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,220
and what is spoken remains in the room

173
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,180
waiting for the future to hear it.

174
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,980
And whatever happens started in the past

175
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,340
and presses hard.

176
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,660
And what is hard on the future.

177
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,800
The agony in the curtained bedroom,

178
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,660
whether of birth or of dying,

179
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,360
gathers into itself all the voices of the past

180
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,300
and projects them into the future.

181
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,380
The treble voices on the lawn,

182
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,120
the mowing of hay in summer,

183
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,400
the dogs and the old pony,

184
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,040
the stumble and the wail of little pain,

185
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,500
the chopping of wood in autumn,

186
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
the singing in the kitchen,

187
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,800
and the steps at night in the corridor,

188
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,340
the moment of sudden loathing

189
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,340
and the season of stifled sorrow.

190
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,300
The whisper, the transparent projection,

191
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,240
the keeping up of a bad job,

192
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,240
all twined and tangled together,

193
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,580
all are recorded.

194
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,100
There is no avoiding these things,

195
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,180
and we know nothing of exorcism.

196
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:02,420
And whether in Argos or Brushwood,

197
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,640
there are certain inflexible laws,

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,220
unvariable in the nature of music.

199
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,560
There is nothing at all to be done about it.

200
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,760
There is nothing to do about anything.

201
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,880
And now it is nearly time for the news.

202
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,420
We must listen to the weather report

203
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,180
and the international catalog.

204
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,580
We must be prepared for the next catastrophe.

205
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,720
Well, at this point,

206
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,740
we are going to reach for another question

207
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,800
within the bodice of...

208
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,640
Oh, no, you already have one.

209
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,220
Okay, I've already got one, actually, here.

210
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,860
What?

211
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,440
Do this have some meaning?

212
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,240
And the challenge is?

213
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,200
The enemy is the enemy,

214
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,400
not our enemy.

215
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,980
The DNA comes from that one.

216
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,160
Dr. Lagoume has answered

217
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,920
and added to my last answer.

218
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,800
Indeed, challenged it,

219
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,700
claiming the enemy comes from above.

220
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,260
The enemy of a subgenius comes from above.

221
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,220
No, the enemy comes from above,

222
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,500
but not necessarily our.

223
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,000
The question is which way is the enemy.

224
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:11,900
Oh.

225
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,640
So it's all about who the enemy is

226
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,060
before you've got to frame your question.

227
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,140
But is the enemy not our enemy, Dr. Lagoume?

228
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,900
No, the enemy is us.

229
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,220
All right, well,

230
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,700
I said you had to be

231
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,280
the type of enemy you needed

232
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,940
to get that type of enemy,

233
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,660
but it is true.

234
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,880
Yes, we have met the enemy,

235
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,080
and he is us.

236
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,060
Okay, that was a good rebuttal there

237
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,280
from Dr. Lagoume.

238
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,300
I appreciate that.

239
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,440
That helps.

240
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:40,960
That shades the question

241
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:40,960


242
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,900
Definitely helps frame the question properly.

243
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,680
There's this election next week,

244
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,340
so after that it might not be him anymore.

245
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,040
It might be, what's his name?

246
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,280
Mumbly Joe.

247
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,760
I saw him on TV the other...

248
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,500
Bob.

249
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:54,720
Hmm.

250
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,660
An election that complicates matters.

251
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,020
Set grid coordinates for Bob.

252
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,660
Well, night everybody.

253
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,000
Night, Senator.

254
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,520
Take it easy.

255
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,340
Good luck next week.

256
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,000
What?

257
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,620
Bob doesn't need this.

258
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,280
What's happening?

259
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,380
Is it noon already?

260
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,060
What the hell is this?

261
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,800
Some kind of tube?

262
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:25,800
Hey!

263
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:26,960
Hey!

264
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,140
I've got to stop them!

265
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,920
Ladies and gentlemen, Bob.

266
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,440
Yay!

267
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,740
Tomorrow when you are sealed in the voting cubicle,

268
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,740
vote for me, Bob.

269
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,580
Okay, Bob, you're the pro.

270
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
I'm the digger.

271
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,900
Oh, yeah, I have a different concept of microbreweries than most...

272
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
You do?

273
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,480
Yes.

274
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:08,140
Yours is based on like a microscope and what brews in some stenchified, rotted, fetid...

275
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,640
Actually, I do have a whole selection of vials and jars at home that are labeled the

276
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:14,720
three.

277
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


278
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


279
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


280
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


281
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


282
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


283
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


284
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


285
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


286
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


287
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


288
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


289
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


290
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


291
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


292
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


293
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


294
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,720


295
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,420
I have the source of the animalcules.

296
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,060
The creepy local alchemist here.

297
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,200
And then I have a second level of Petri dishes in which I mix and match the populations

298
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,720
just to see what'll happen.

299
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,100
It's like playing God.

300
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,480
And as Bender himself found out when he was God, don't...

301
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,580
You shouldn't try to help these things.

302
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,840
You'll just make it a thousand billion times worse.

303
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,820
I used to see this...

304
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:50,620
These little nematode worms, they appear to be helplessly tangled up in a wad of algae.

305
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,900
And they're thrashing.

306
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,140
And to the human eye, it looks miserable.

307
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,720
It looks like this creature is just desperately, desperately wiggling around and trying to

308
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,100
get loose from this stuff.

309
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:10,800
And in my foolishness and ignorance, I took a pen, a sewing needle, and you could actually

310
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,800
see the giant blunt end of the needle down in the middle.

311
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,000
And I tried to free the little creature.

312
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,300
And of course, I accidentally killed almost everything in there.

313
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,760
Did you hear their little microscopic cries of pain?

314
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,140
And then I later read that this is what these creatures do.

315
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,780
And what appears to me to be desperate, mindless thrashing is his perfect movement for sucking

316
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,720
in bacteria that he eats.

317
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,120
Just because his tiny face looked to me like it was grimacing in agony.

318
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,800
And I could hear tiny screams.

319
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,460
That was actually his mating song.

320
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,380
And I had just cotton blocks a little down.

321
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,880
Screams of pain sound like mating from this distance, Reverend Stang.

322
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,380
We're being hunted.

323
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,760
The cages, all of us, are all brought here for the same purpose.

324
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,500
This planet is a game preserve.

325
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,600
And we're the game.

326
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,640
We're the game.

327
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,420
In case you didn't notice, we just got flushed out.

328
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,300
They split us apart and they watched, testing us.

329
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:37,060
So now, as I play God with my little concentration camps of horror, I try to keep them as natural

330
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:42,400
as I can and kind of a hands off when I throw a new population of monsters in there.

331
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,500
They've now got a hideout.

332
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,540
Usually what happens is the next day you look and only the biggest ones are left.

333
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,700
Imagine that.

334
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,480
All the little interesting guys are gone and there's one big thrashing worm in there.

335
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,220
So it's you that's contributing to population decline?

336
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,600
I prefer to think of myself more as a Dr. Moreau than a Dr. Frankenstein.

337
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,020
Exactly.

338
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,120
You're creating better strains by stressing the population.

339
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,680
That's what I'm trying to do.

340
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,380
I think he's disrupting biodiversity, baby.

341
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:12,380


342
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:12,380


343
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,040
He meddled in affairs best left to God's domain.

344
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,020
Well, it's funny.

345
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,960
You get these...

346
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:24,220
I will actually go out of my way to not hurt one of these things.

347
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,920
Although every time a mud puddle dries up, God has slain a million of them.

348
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,740
A universe of organisms.

349
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,160
Legions and hosts of warriors.

350
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,380
Instead of playing God with them, why don't you play Bob with them?

351
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,380
They don't have any money.

352
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,040
They don't have any money that I can identify.

353
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,740
So it's kind of pointless.

354
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,220
You can't fleece them.

355
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,660
What they got, you don't want.

356
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,900
You can't fleece them.

357
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What is cheering about the study of these creatures is that you're under the impression

358
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,040
that every amoeba is the same amoeba.

359
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,860
Even Tommy Amoeba thought that.

360
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,060
But it's not true.

361
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,740
There are many, many different species of amoebas and they're not all alike, even if

362
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,700
they split in two by.

363
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,660
Individual variation.

364
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,960
They have different behaviors and they have opinions.

365
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:18,000
There's things they don't want to eat and things they do want to eat.

366
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,900
Some of them eat a paramecium that looks exactly like his brother, may eat really fast

367
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,540
and the other one eats kind of slow.

368
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,200
One bumps around into things and the other one's more cautious.

369
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:36,820
This encouraged me so much because I can very easily envision life after people.

370
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,480
And to some folks that's depressing.

371
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,860
It's like, oh, well, wouldn't that be terrible?

372
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:49,580
Without us brilliant chimpanzees to do paintings of landscapes and appreciate beauty.

373
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,500
Well, no, actually those little guys have just as much.

374
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,580
They're smarter than we are in their own way.

375
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,260
You say they are individuals.

376
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:10,380
And the point of this is long after surface life is gone, there still be life under the Arctic ice sheets.

377
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,940
Life in the most inhospitable way.

378
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,900
In inhospitable places.

379
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,680
Underground.

380
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,160
Bob will always have customers.

381
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,940
And that's why we don't need to worry about anything.

382
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,720
Very good.

383
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,020
Very good, Reverend Stanton.

384
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,300
You know that underground life.

385
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,860
Thank you for that clarification.

386
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Life that exists below the surface of the Earth in complete darkness, if you were able to weigh it,

387
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,560
would outweigh all surface life, including all the life in the oceans.

388
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,220
So since opinions are like assholes,

389
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,220
does that mean the mere presence of an opinion implies that an asshole exists?

390
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,780
Well, the expression of an opinion may imply that an asshole is in the vicinity.

391
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,580
Why would you ask us that?

392
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,540
I don't know. It's something that just popped into my head.

393
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,760
Clearly troubling you, but maybe in these last moments together we should clear the air.

394
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,200
The question popped into my head while I was looking at you for some reason.

395
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,900
Hmm.

396
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,940
Yeah, Dr. Howell, you're right.

397
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,420
There are five times as many creatures living inside of other creatures.

398
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,600
Yes, in the hidden darkness.

399
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,800
As there are ones who don't live inside of anyone.

400
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,940
Right.

401
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,540
And even those creatures have five times as many living inside of them.

402
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,060
You know, when Jesus exorcised the Gadarene swine,

403
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,560
he may have driven a lot of little imps out of them,

404
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,860
but I'll bet he also drove out all sorts of parasites and other things.

405
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,820
So you mean when a subgenius dies, it's not just him that's dying,

406
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,460
it's millions and millions of dependent organisms.

407
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,480
That's right, with a subgenius alignment and inclination.

408
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes, each one has a tiny...

409
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,700
You are guilty of genociding.

410
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,560
Each one with 5,000 dependent organisms inside his own gut.

411
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,360
This is where all my slack's going.

412
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,640
There's no other place for them to be but in you.

413
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,040
Oh, here's one of those things I meant to say.

414
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,760
I felt so bad every time one of these creatures...

415
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,540
No!

416
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,500
...died.

417
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,300
Princess, we hosed out the birdbath one day.

418
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,080
I was like, oh my God, the rotifers.

419
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,180
Do you realize you've slain them all?

420
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,500
And once I was filming this little...

421
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,600
I think it's a...

422
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,720
You've slain them all.

423
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,780
...cane rotifer, Lacani.

424
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,860
And it was...

425
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,500
I didn't understand why it wasn't going anywhere.

426
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,420
It was just in one place kind of waggling its little foot tail.

427
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,100
And I thought, whoa, great, he's standing still.

428
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,480
I can get a real good shot of him.

429
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,880
And then this funny pattern spread across him.

430
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:49,080
And I realized what I was watching was the drop of water drying up and him dying.

431
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,120
He struggled a few more times and then stopped.

432
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,000
But then the...

433
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,340
He just kind of collapsed.

434
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,760
And I realized I'd just been watching water at a tiny scale.

435
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,980
It evaporates pretty quick.

436
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,580
I felt terrible about that.

437
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,500
Particularly when it's a big light shining over...

438
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,540
I had nightmares over this little creature.

439
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,280
And on top of that, I'd exploited his death.

440
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,500
I even used it for the end of a little musical moment.

441
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,580
Faded out on it.

442
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,200
You know.

443
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,960
And I still have felt bad about it.

444
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,660
But...

445
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,240
You revived the creature with your teardrops.

446
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,920
I saw a BBC special that opened my eyes.

447
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,900
Those very creatures I was so worried about, the rotifers.

448
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,540
They...

449
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,940
Although their lifespan is only a couple of weeks.

450
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:37,460
If you dry up their water dish or put them in outer space exposed to radiation,

451
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,720
zero...

452
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,880
Better not.

453
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,320
...or whatnot, they'll dry up into a little horrible ball full of broken DNA.

454
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:53,080
And a year later, you can put that microscopic little ball into a drop of water with some scum.

455
00:22:53,100 --> 00:23:01,520
And the son of a bitch will not only come back to life from not really being dead,

456
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,180
it will reassemble its own broken DNA.

457
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,600
Using spare amino acids from the other creatures around it.

458
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,160
Amazing.

459
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,500
How about that, ladies and gentlemen?

460
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:13,920
And I...

461
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:21,960
Here I had been guilt tripping myself over a couple of them drying up in a goddamn drop of water.

462
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,160
Those sons of bitches are gonna outlast me without even trying.

463
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,460
Let me give you a personal testimony to that, Reverend Stang.

464
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,120
When we came through the Grand Escalante, we stopped at our something.

465
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,460
The Grand Something.

466
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,640
And they had an exhibit there of creatures that were...

467
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,460
Lived on the desert that looked...

468
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:43,760
They were...

469
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,860
Had not changed.

470
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,300
They looked quite a bit like a trilobite with a tail like a shrimp.

471
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,480
A triops.

472
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,560
A triops.

473
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,580
That's exactly right.

474
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,260
And the triops hasn't changed much in like 250 million years.

475
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,160
And the triops has the ability to dry up for like 25 years.

476
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,040
Mm-hmm.

477
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,340
And then able to...

478
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,380
And so they have these rainstorms that don't come out there but every few years.

479
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,360
And that's when the triops comes to life.

480
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,600
It has its whole mating cycle.

481
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:25,900
And then within two weeks, it's finished with its entire life cycle and is ready to go into dormancy for another 20 years when the pond drives up.

482
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,480
Yeah.

483
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,820
Don't feel sorry for them.

484
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,240
They got their act together.

485
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,560
They look like a tiny little trilobite.

486
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:33,920
They're amazing.

487
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,260
They look like a horseshoe crab.

488
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,960
A limulus crab.

489
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,760
A horseshoe crab.

490
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,060


491
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,120
A horseshoe crab.

492
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,640
Yeah.

493
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,540
You can buy them in packages.

494
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,120
They're sold for kids like sea monkeys.

495
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,060
Lovable live sea monkeys.

496
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,640
The triops, a survivor from the age of dinosaurs.

497
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:56,620
And of course, there's pictures of dinosaurs on it and a painting of a triops which makes it look a lot cooler than it really is.

498
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,860
Now once you turn over the shell, the inside is rather slender and dainty.

499
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,700
Insubstantial.

500
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:09,640
It looks like this muscly tank thing, but inside it's just got these little spindly limbs and hardly any body whatsoever.

501
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,180
You probably could eat them.

502
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,400
I've often looked at my little friends, the copepods, and thought, well, they look like shrimp.

503
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,060
I wonder if you made enough of them, you could eat them.

504
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:29,640
Then I read in my new Bible that copepods harbor an organism called the guinea worm.

505
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,260
Which is almost wiped out.

506
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,160
It's one of the worst scourges of humanity.

507
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,580
And you've never heard of it, right?

508
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:45,360
Well, our ancestors in Europe, when they got a guinea worm in them, it gets to be a damn long worm, like two or three feet long.

509
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,280
And when it's ready to leave your body, it chews its way out of your leg.

510
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,820
And its head comes out.

511
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,620
And if the medieval peasant just yanks it and breaks it off, the rest of the body is gone.

512
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,380
The rest of the body stays inside and rots and you lose the leg and die.

513
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:18,580
So when you got a guinea worm and he started coming out, you had to sit down and spend the rest of the week slowly rolling the worm around a stick as it gradually emerged from your leg veins.

514
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:27,020
You don't hear about this kind of thing, but this is a sort of health problem that we had to deal with not all that long ago.

515
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,260
That's the things that our noble savage ancestors dealt with.

516
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:37,280
So imagine just sitting there, you know, making your kids roll up your tapeworm as it slowly emerged.

517
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,540
In fact, the caduceus may be based on that very thing.

518
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,440
The fact that they had to roll the serpent up around the stick.

519
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,360
It may be what that caduceus symbol is based on.

520
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,220
Okay, thank you very much. This has been X Day Live.

521
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,640
It's called the caduceus.

522
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,380
X Day Radio Live is now over.

523
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:58,900
Oh, is it?

524
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,360
Yes.

525
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,340
Pronounced caduceus?

526
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,460
Yes, caduceus indeed.

527
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:10,700
Furthermore, this symbol of the medical profession was not carried by Apollo, but rather by Hermes.

528
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:18,060
But through a misapprehension of the U.S. Army Signal Corps, this misbelief is now universal.

529
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,080
Their picture of Apollo was holding the caduceus, but it's Mercury's staff.

530
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,620
Mercury did have wings on his feet though, right?

531
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,420
The winged foot freak with the manly physique.

532
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:30,700


533
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,880
Yes, Mercury was the messenger of the gods.

534
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,620
Okay, there's the sign of the knife being drawn across the neck.

535
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,340
Known in the old solar language as Vitruvia.

536
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,380
Which means kill it, kill it now, kill it.

537
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,520
He was formed in primordial ooze.

538
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,560
When chemicals merged and something grew.

539
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,860
He split in two.

540
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,280
And then in four.

541
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,800
So now today, there's a whole lot more.

542
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:09,700
Viva amoeba, the lowest form of life.

543
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:17,460
Tommy amoeba, he'll make it all right.

544
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,460
Others evolved to higher forms.

545
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,360
The dodo bird.

546
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,260
And the dinosaur.

547
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,040
The human bee.

548
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,360
And cockapoo.

549
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,560
Tommy remained to himself true.

550
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:53,180
Viva amoeba, the lowest form of life.

551
00:28:53,180 --> 00:29:01,960
Tommy amoeba, he'll make it all right.

552
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:11,040
Viva amoeba, viva amoeba.

553
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,460
Tommy amoeba.

554
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,180
And the spider.

555
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,160
And the spider.

556
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,160


557
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,800
Fuck yeah.

558
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,340
He was made to live, voice didn't reveal her identity.

559
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,760
Frank came along and had an enormous cast.

560
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,200
Did probably give her the second man lifetime when you staggers would tape the male human body.

561
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,780
cervfernthein.

562
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,720
커.

563
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,860
He was a brave little soldier

564
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,240
Marching far from home

565
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,800
He was lost and he was lonely

566
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,100
Pretending to be bold

567
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,820
He was a brave little soldier

568
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,940
Marching all alone

569
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,740
He was looking for some answers

570
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,020
He was looking for some love

571
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,040
Letters froze inside his mind

572
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,320
Spelling words that seemed to say

573
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,580
Everything would be revealed in some twisted way

574
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,160
A big idea, reality or make-believe

575
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,340
Oh yeah

576
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:51,800
Oh yeah

577
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:51,800


578
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,940
Oh yeah

579
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:53,940


580
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:53,940


581
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:53,940


582
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,580
A great idea

583
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,160
But where does it ever lead?

584
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,420
A less idea

585
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,200
Than do we ever really know

586
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,480
It's time to happen

587
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,300
But in the meantime

588
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,280
It's on with the show

589
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,020
On with the show

590
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,880
March on

591
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,420
component

592
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:32,540
On with the show

593
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,680
On with the show

594
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,700
March on

595
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:37,700


596
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:37,700


597
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,680
On with the show

598
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,380
March on

599
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:49,720
March on

600
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,340
March on

601
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:57,180
He had a chip on his shoulder, too bad he didn't know

602
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:04,220
He marched into the future, thinking time was on his side

603
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:11,360
With no woman on his shoulder, life just passed him by

604
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:19,420
Letters froze inside his mind, spelling words that seemed to say

605
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,720
Everything would be revealed in some twisted way

606
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:43,220
A big idea, reality or make-believe

607
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,400
A great idea, but without the truth

608
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,240
Does it ever leave?

609
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,160
A less idea than do we ever really know

610
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,340
It's part of heaven, but in the meantime

611
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,180
It's on with the show, on with the show

612
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,980
March on

613
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,840
March on

614
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,940
March on

615
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,920
March on

616
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,800
March on

617
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,260
March on

618
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:33,080
Divo did that from their live album, and we have more war stories coming up.

619
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:38,400
And before that, Reverend Tommy Amoeba, live at 13X Day,

620
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,360
actually wearing an Amoeba suit when he sang that.

621
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,280
And by and large, by the large, and also lemur,

622
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,400
were the colorful collages.

623
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,700
And flaming intros.

624
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,920
G. Gordon Gordon, speaking of colors and flames,

625
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,460
lived in Bolivia, where cocaine is manufactured.

626
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,180
He took our friend Sterno to a bar, and the subject came up,

627
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,600
you know, Coke, different grades of Coke burn different colors.

628
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,960
He goes, oh, really?

629
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,460
Well, it's not the kind of thing that most people would check out.

630
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,960
Well, the next thing you knew, everybody in this bar

631
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,220
had pulled out their...

632
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,880
giant bags of Coke, and were throwing it into the fire.

633
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,980
And it was like, oh, that was boof, that was green.

634
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,360
Look, boof, that was purple.

635
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,600
You wouldn't see that happen in the United States in most places.

636
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,480
And some of the people who went to visit G. Gordon Gordon

637
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,080
came back dead.

638
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,820
And he himself had that unfortunate nasal accident

639
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,480
which resulted in the creation of subgenius art.

640
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,020
Now, you say you have the septum?

641
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,900
Mavridis has it.

642
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,640
The septum...

643
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,200
In a formality...

644
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,200


645
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,200


646
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,200


647
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,060
It was removed from the great G. Gordon Gordon's nose

648
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,360
after living in Bolivia for about ten years.

649
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,240
It was auctioned off at X Day.

650
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,180
Yes.

651
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,660
And as I understood it,

652
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,300
Gordon let that skinny girl Christina Bucket have it

653
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,020
in return for a lap dance.

654
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,860
I thought that was kind of sad,

655
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,940
so I was glad to hear that you have the sacred septum piece.

656
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,180
She didn't really want it, keep it.

657
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,200
She just wanted to relieve him of it.

658
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,600
And puzzling evidence is two front teeth were auctioned here,

659
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,020
and Sister Decadence has them.

660
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,760
Hmm.

661
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,880
No doubt she'll use them in some powerful spell or cantrip.

662
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,320
Those were the teeth past which the air went

663
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,780
of all those puzzling evidence spouting.

664
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:42,940
Those were the teeth of the man who single-handedly lost the Vietnam War,

665
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,580
as he explained it to me, and I believe him, too.

666
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,200
It sounded absolutely circumstantial.

667
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,140
It sounded circumstantially viable.

668
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,060
Now, how does he explain that?

669
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:52,920
What?

670
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,860
How did he lose the Vietnam War?

671
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,560
Well, he was in Saigon.

672
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,880
He got really stoned.

673
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,760
He went to this restaurant, and he forgot that he left there

674
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,980
the package containing the war plan for the entire northern conduct of the war.

675
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,660
Oh, that's right.

676
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,500
And when he went back, it wasn't there.

677
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,800
No, when he went back, it was there exactly where it should be,

678
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,180
with everything in place,

679
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,980
just as if nobody had opened it and photographed it

680
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,940
and then neatly put it right back.

681
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,440
Put it all back, just as if that hadn't happened.

682
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,480
Yeah, just so.

683
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,940
However, the...

684
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,720
The war was lost.

685
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,500
It did seem that they knew everything as part of the northern plan,

686
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,860
which he explained also.

687
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,100
I shot up my ration of bullets today.

688
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,960
He also used to broadcast radio out of a Goonie Bird,

689
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,980
flying over the China Sea back in them days,

690
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,360
the same day that our friend Bishop Joey,

691
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,160
who was in the submarine service at that time,

692
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,860
in a submarine, in one of the last diesel submarines that the US had

693
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,080
when they were still introducing nuclear subs,

694
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,000
he was in the Tyroo, which ran aground

695
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,680
and became momentarily embarrassingly notorious for our nation.

696
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,260
So you see, even recent American history

697
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,160
is riddled with wormholes of subgenius activity,

698
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,060
which have crafted today's news landscape.

699
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,780
Wherever you see a gigantic military failure,

700
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,600
somewhere in the background,

701
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,440
there is a subgenius running away.

702
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,780
What would happen if you went back in time

703
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,840
and got puzzling evidence to repair what he did

704
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,200
and win the Vietnam War?

705
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,420
What would have happened?

706
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,060
I'm not sure it would ever have been won anyway,

707
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,400
but it didn't help them any.

708
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,120
What if you went back and fixed Washington's teeth?

709
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,360
It changed everything for the better.

710
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,560
That would be a very selfless act on your part,

711
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,480
by eliminating the possibility of returning to the time track

712
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,500
that produced you,

713
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,600
making yourself an orphan,

714
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,960
and then making yourself a slave of time,

715
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,680
even more badly off than the man without a country,

716
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,920
who we all remember had a sad death.

717
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,420
One of those Futurama movies

718
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,740
had such a complex time travel conundrum plot

719
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,680
that I sat down and wrote out every plot point

720
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,100
so I could follow it.

721
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,200
I was trying to work something like that into a subgenius movie script.

722
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,240
Once again, Futurama beat me to everything.

723
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,020
I had to drop all these gags

724
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,380
because the bastards at Futurama came up with them first.

725
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,700
I hate that.

726
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,500
You remember that.

727
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,440
You hate it when that happens,

728
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,020
when some rich, successful person is smarter than me.

729
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,000
God damn it!

730
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,380
I hate it when somebody's driving a Porsche

731
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,480
and I don't have one.

732
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,000
I was driving through the rich neighborhoods of Dallas

733
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,340
with G. Gordon Gordon,

734
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,240
who used to be rich.

735
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,120
He was going,

736
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,720
I hate these rich assholes.

737
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:15,440
I said,

738
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,840
Gordon, if you were rich again

739
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,420
and lived in this rich neighborhood,

740
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,020
would you still feel the same?

741
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,460
I'd hate him even more.

742
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,140
I like to think that's true.

743
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,600
I briefly lived in a nice,

744
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,780
what you call a nice pink neighborhood,

745
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,840
almost like a gated village

746
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,460
during the last years of my previous marriage.

747
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,840
In fact, that's kind of what helped do it in.

748
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,260
And I must say,

749
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,600
I felt like a pink asshole all the time

750
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,260
just because I was surrounded by him.

751
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,080
I was so happy to get back into a neighborhood

752
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,180
full of the down-home for real people,

753
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,580
the bull daggers,

754
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,400
cocksuckers,

755
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,940
fudge packers,

756
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,480
the real freaks.

757
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,020
I noticed though you're staying up

758
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,280
like the man on the high castle.

759
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,020
Oh yes, of course.

760
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,540
We have a special,

761
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,000
we don't sleep down here on the field in the mud.

762
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,960
We sleep in the big house with the celebrities.

763
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,860
Boy, that subgenus orgy we advertised

764
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,620
sure was great last night.

765
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,240
Yeah, we looked all over for that.

766
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:18,800
I can barely remember it.

767
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,400
I couldn't find it.

768
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:19,680
It was so good.

769
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,200
My favorite part.

770
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,060
You all did get your invitation right.

771
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,040
I'm sure that yours wasn't censored.

772
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,860
Many were.

773
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,920
We tried to pick and choose

774
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,620
who really got to go to that orgy.

775
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,360
I don't remember actually seeing most of you there.

776
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,000
Was Joan Rivers there?

777
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,160
Oh yeah, yeah.

778
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,760
Of course Joan Rivers and all of those celebrities.

779
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,660
Al Franken was there.

780
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,940
Got to stay away from him.

781
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,800
Did you give Joan Rivers a stank subgenius?

782
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,700
He finally has a good word for us, huh?

783
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,620
Al Franken finally has a good word for us.

784
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,140
You know, I met that guy

785
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:01,520
at the subgenius book release party in 1983

786
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,560
at the Danceteria.

787
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,720
That was when the conspiracy loved us

788
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,480
and thought we were going to sell.

789
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,680
They rented the Danceteria in New York

790
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,160
and they invited all these celebrities.

791
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,240
At the time, Al Franken was a guy

792
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,800
who you'd seen on Saturday Night Live.

793
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,380
He was riding for them.

794
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,020
At the time, he had not cleaned up his act.

795
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,720
I think he had serious drug and alcohol issues.

796
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,120
When I met him, somebody said,

797
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,920
Stang, this is Al Franken.

798
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,540
I go, oh wow, I would really enjoy that stuff.

799
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,320
I'm going to do that stuff you and your buddy did

800
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,360
on Saturday Night Live.

801
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,340
And he said to me,

802
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,000
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

803
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,120
uh, subgenius celebrities.

804
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,700
But then later on, he darkened our towels.

805
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,120
Dragnet is the story of an action.

806
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,960
This is 9364623.

807
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,060
Yes, sir, can I help you?

808
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,600
A couple of questions we'd like to ask.

809
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,080
Do you know?

810
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,860
I don't know.

811
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,640
I see.

812
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:11,540
Yeah.

813
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,980
All right, ma'am, thank you.

814
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,580
The suspect had taken off his doorknob

815
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,740
and he stayed awake.

816
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,760
I wonder if you'd mind telling us what happened.

817
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,240
Sure.

818
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,100
Awful thing.

819
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,000
Yes, sir.

820
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,080
Just what did happen?

821
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:25,600
Well.

822
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,200
Awful.

823
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,640
Mm-hmm, yes, sir.

824
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,540
I could tell.

825
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,480
Could you tell that?

826
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,540
Yes, I could tell.

827
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,120
Yes, sir.

828
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,520
Well, finally I do it one by each.

829
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,840
I can't just go with you.

830
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,900
Get out that lonely room and I'll get you good.

831
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,520
I'll get you good.

832
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:37,760
Uh-huh.

833
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,240
I understand.

834
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:42,860
One thing I can say, though, just too about thought of adventure on the way to the last

835
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,120
doors.

836
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,440
You feel all right, sir?

837
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,060
No.

838
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,300
I get it.

839
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:48,900
Well, what's that?

840
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,720
Can you speak a little louder?

841
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,120
That's better.

842
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:50,520
What?

843
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:50,920
Uh-huh.

844
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,540
When did this happen?

845
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:51,760
Yeah.

846
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,340
What's the address?

847
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:52,620
Yeah.

848
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,040
The street.

849
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,600
Now, give me the number.

850
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,020
That's right.

851
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:54,540
All right.

852
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:54,820
You bet.

853
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,380
We'll take care of it.

854
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:55,540
Right.

855
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:55,740
Bye.

856
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,620
Looks like something here.

857
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,320
Yes.

858
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,360
Market managers.

859
00:42:59,560 --> 00:42:59,840
Yes.

860
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,160
They specifically select the best, best, best, fresh, completely average, adverse

861
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,940
sinuses.

862
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,380
After eight months, he observed no nose suspect.

863
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,820
Suspect, suspect, suspect, suspect, suspect described as 50 to 55 pounds, 130 to 140 years.

864
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:22,700
Yeah, I'm good.

865
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,880
He was sentenced to life in California.

866
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:31,980
Ladies and gentlemen, the National Sea Council reminds you to pump your head wipers and always

867
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,100
slam on brakes and start a skid in wintertime.

868
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,420
Take a great break.

869
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,300
I'll be right back.

870
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,060
We've got about half an hour, and it's 620 in the leaderboard,quick takeoff, 그러니까

871
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,060


872
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,060


873
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:54,060


874
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,240
Here we are.

875
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,160
We're in an ocean of

876
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,100
We're jumping through the ocean.

877
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,280
There he is.

878
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,500
Where is Reverend Suds Bashaw?

879
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,240
Because Suds is the good, it's gone bad.

880
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,860
Suds, scrubbing bubbles, washes conspiracy minds clean.

881
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,200
Look at all those faces out there.

882
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:44,520
In case y'all weren't here last night, I am the very esteemed universal philosopher of absolute reality,

883
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,680
Reverend Frodus Bashaw.

884
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,720
But y'all know me as Reverend Suds.

885
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,480
See?

886
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,160
You guys...

887
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,700
We're here to give all the credit to Bob and all this shit for bringing everybody together,

888
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:05,200
but, you know, there could be some more sinister forces at work here, folks.

889
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:11,060
As you see, we've got to give some credit where at least that little bit of credit's due,

890
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,820
and there happens to be one other we must thank for this divine wisdom.

891
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,300
One other entity that we must pay tribute to our final reckoning, friends.

892
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,480
You sure you want to know?

893
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,940
Friends, we've got to take a moment to thank the conspiracy itself.

894
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,140
I know it comes as a shock to my brothers, sisters.

895
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:41,520
I know you're thinking to yourself, how could he give that lumbering, all-consuming, slack-sucking machine

896
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,880
a slow, agonizing species death and ounce of credit for anything other than pissing and fucking our collective rectums of our congregation?

897
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,680
But you're probably trying to figure out how that silly son of a bitch could get up there and...

898
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,920
polish the helmet of that which we sweet-axed subversion seek to destroy.

899
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,680
Oh yeah, polish that helmet!

900
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,160
Wanna know why, folks?

901
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,260
Because the conspiracy pushed my fat ass straight into Bob's pipe!

902
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,640
And for the first time in my life, I know what true slack means to me.

903
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,240
I realized I had it all along, and no matter what hellbound path the conspiracy has planned for us,

904
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,680
they will never take it away from us!

905
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,100
Praise fucking Bob!

906
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,840
Praise Bob!

907
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,440
Praise Bob!

908
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:20,700
Praise Bob!

909
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,760
Praise Bob!

910
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,100
Praise Bob!

911
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,800
Now I gotta admit, I'm guilty of some acts of stupidity.

912
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,520
I'm sure all of us, subgenie, I know, okay.

913
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,880
Yeah, but uh...

914
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,680
Yeah, I look back and...

915
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,800
Yeah, this is a lot of shit.

916
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,580
I shouldn't even be here for some of the stupid shit I've pulled.

917
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:46,180
But, I know Stang at one point made mention about those who admit that they're dumbasses

918
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:50,820
might be a little smarter than those who just are too oblivious.

919
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,080
Yeah, they are.

920
00:46:52,860 --> 00:47:00,900
Yeah, these dumbasses look back on our experiences with hard earned wisdom, humility, and better understanding of the stupid all around us.

921
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,140
Six billion points of stupid...

922
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:08,900
...tools!

923
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,500
Every last one of them.

924
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:21,400
Unworthy of the edict of Bob, they bumbled to and froze stupidly, clinging to any false shred of slack they think they have, praising their lord for giving them something they've never known and wouldn't recognize if they had it!

925
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,480
They continue to piss in our cornflakes.

926
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:32,180
Those who love nothing more than the stick, their dick, and the birthday cake, and quite frankly, I think we're a little fucking tired of it, don't you?

927
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:43,060
All these mental fucking midgets of the pink race, bobbing their heads to and fro to the pronouncements of morons, their eyes glistening in a bovine glaze of intellectual laziness.

928
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:51,380
On all sides they come, armed with the stinking madness of their fear, they file in, shoulder to shoulder, jack booty to the wall, and they're all in.

929
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:51,380


930
00:47:51,400 --> 00:48:04,300
The fools bang and bleeding like legions of demented sheep, launching their blitzkrieg of bullshit and incompetence in the heads and hearts of all those they do not understand, decimating the very ground under their feet with the sheer weight of their crusade against rationality and common sense.

931
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:14,220
These putrid imperfections of protozoan puke permeate the dark recesses of this church far more than I ever dared to believe, folks.

932
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:21,380
Hiding behind their Dobbs head t-shirts, pretending to know the paths of frenzy, blindly following the edicts of those who would and will be.

933
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:21,380


934
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,220
They will take advantage of them for their own delicious, demented, yet tastefully slackful purposes.

935
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:32,220
Do not underestimate these viles and disgusting abominations, and I know a few of you know who I'm talking about.

936
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,880
Yeah, we'll discuss that after the show, man.

937
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:50,160
Yep, just look around and you can see their heads kind of going, yeah, I know what you're talking about, yeah, give them hellsets.

938
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,360
Hey, you morons!

939
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,540
Shut the fuck up!

940
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,740
You'll stick your head in a fucking toilet and give yourself an emotional swirly.

941
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:07,240
Degenerate feces-flinging monkeys wasted our time, and worse, they've wasted our slack, and that is un-fucking-forgivable.

942
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,300
Now, those will suffer.

943
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:20,580
Never knowing the reasons why Bob has never seen fit to grant them true slack, suffering will become delicious candy for all those across the corporate galaxy.

944
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:31,700
And their actions will be remembered come next day, folks, when the legions of card-carrying church members shall be enjoying the immaculate madness of sex-hurt news squared, all thanks to Bob.

945
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,660
Laughing with the uber-sex goddesses over the destruction of the Bobbies and their pink brethren.

946
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,880
And in any case, Bob gets to keep their money.

947
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:47,160
So reaffirm your faith in the salt and the sails, friends, the instigator of yucks, the alien war-bearers.

948
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,380
Money will flow like the explosion of wet sex over the face of the highest uber-sex.

949
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:57,980
And a never-ending fountain of slack shall empower the yeti race against the conspiracy until we punch that final ticket, friends.

950
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:07,200
So until then, friends, may the pure hatred of those sorry fuckers who blissfully allow the madness to continue unabated fuel this engine of reprisal.

951
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,620
May the rage sustained by pink insanity drive this vehicle.

952
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:16,560
And may the fire of our hatred keep us nourished through even the darkest times, and may it warm us into the coldest of nights.

953
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,680
May you find shelter among the wrinkles of Bob's scrotum.

954
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,360
And may the shadow of the sun be the light of the night.

955
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,980
And may the shadow of his opulence pave your path of least resistance.

956
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:30,700
And may subgenius efforts and proverbial pie-chucking and backhanded slapstick appease the lunatic gods and their insatiable funny bone.

957
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:39,000
Lest we once again find ourselves hung out to dry on the next day, being mercilessly mocked and heckled by those beyond the stars.

958
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,640
Praise God damn Bob.

959
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:56,580
Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise Bob.

960
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,700
Do not shout.

961
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,420
And don't be afraid.

962
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:23,440
The plan by Bob has just been made.

963
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,400
It's the power of the man with the pipe.

964
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,240
the power of the man with the pipe.

965
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:46,180
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

966
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:46,400
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Kurz Tom! Praise Bob! Let's fucking go?

967
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,000
Praise God!

968
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:47,620
Praise

969
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,040
God

970
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,680
Praise God

971
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,420
WHAT?

972
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,680
What!

973
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,560
What did I do!?

974
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:04,600
Praise

975
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:06,140
GOD!

976
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,460
Praise Who!?

977
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,980
Praise The Real

978
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:14,960
Praise

979
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,540
Praise God! Praise God!

980
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,540
B-O-B spell Bob! Praise Bob!

981
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,480
Oh, I get it!

982
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,220
Now you get it!

983
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,520
1-3-0-1-3

984
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,900
808-B-O-B

985
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,280
Doesn't matter how you spell it, just praise Him!

986
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:39,360
January 31st, 2013

987
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,320
Praise God!

988
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,860
Praise God!

989
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,320
Bob!

990
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,380
Praise Bob!

991
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,200
Falling man, lift a pipe

992
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,340
He's come to save us tonight

993
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,500
Falling man, lift a pipe

994
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,720
Take us up into the skies tonight

995
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,540
Praise Bob!

996
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,040
Promise that piece of toilet paper that sticks to your shoe when you leave the restroom

997
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,040
You know that, don't you?

998
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:14,100
Yeah

999
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,240
Praise Bob!

1000
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,940
He's that little kid that sits behind you on the train or the bus and kicks the back of your seat

1001
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,180
Praise Bob!

1002
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,180
He's the piece of gum that you step on in the...

1003
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,300
Praise Bob!

1004
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,040
...and anywhere out on the sidewalk

1005
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:29,940
Praise Bob!

1006
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,620
But yet...

1007
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,000
Praise Bob!

1008
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,740
Bob Dobbs is your best friend

1009
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,600
Praise Bob!

1010
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,560
Hence, that's why you want to claim him

1011
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,480
You want to walk with you outside of the bathroom

1012
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:42,560
Praise Bob!

1013
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:42,680
Praise Bob!

1014
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,820
Dancie you from the sidewalk

1015
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,700
Marcel and Paul

1016
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,680
Just annoy the living fuck out of you

1017
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,380
And have the train kick in your seats

1018
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:55,760
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise by! Praise Bob! Praise by!

1019
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,640
Praise Bob! Praise by the upon the living fuck of us

1020
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,020
maiden

1021
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,700
Hi Bob cách

1027
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,400
Praise...

1028
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,860
Everybody line up and do this again.

1029
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,660
Bob!

1030
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,280
Praise!

1031
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,300
Bilo?

1032
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,020
Praise!

1033
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:16,980
Not Bilo!

1034
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:18,540
Praise!

1035
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,480

1036
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:22,460
Praise!

1037

Praise!

1039

1040
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,180
Praise!

1041
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:31,200


1042
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,920
I just want to say for the record that Bilo is playing a

1043
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,380
chunk of wood for the fourth!

1044
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,180
Praise!

1045
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:39,180


1046
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,120
Praise!

1047
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:46,060


1048
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:46,780
Praise!

1049
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,160
Bob!

1050
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,800
Praise!

1051
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,620

1052
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,500
Praise!

1053

00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,160
Praise!

1055
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,820

1058
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,620
Praise Bob!

1059
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,180
Praise him!

1060
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,260
Praise him!

1061
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,100
Praise him!

1062
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,520
Praise, Bob!

1063
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:18,920
praise Bob!

1064
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,080

00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:33,220
Bob! Bob!

1072
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,480
Oh shit.

1073
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,620
I just screamed in my pants.

1074
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,580
It's fucking Bob.

1075
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,860
Anybody got towels?
