What do we do now?
The only thing we can do, Robin.
The hour of slug.
Oh, no, sir, not that.
I'm afraid so, Alfred.
That man would be the first to say so if he were here.
And if you do not believe me,
try turning on your water faucets at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
2 o'clock?
2 o'clock!
Mama, mama, mama, please.
Thank you.
Cash award.
Praise Bob.

There came an awful sound.
And from his lips there came an awful sound.
Bob.
Where'd you two take me?
Where's the elevator from, Shangri-La?
I was supposed to be a boy named Thomas.
Me.
I'll get him.
No talking behind my back.
Ponderosa.
What's that?
What's that?
That's the home place of the Cartwright.
My name's Joe Cartwright.
Who's Cartwright?
And this is Adam?
Yes, we've met.
Oh, the dream.
You come out here, you run down our country.
It's a country we love.
It's a country we're proud of.
I think I'm stronger than you.
We don't boo you because you support Russia.
Get ready to Dwayne the Swamp at Electomania 2020.
Take a runner out here looking like a big fat bowl of fruity pebbles.
It's an all out smackdown of democracy.
You're right.
He is scared.
You're right.
We're looking at what would happen if a homeless lumberjack banged a noopaloopa.

Ah, yes, dear friends.
And that was a tune called Las Bragas
by the Rudy Schwartz Project
from the new album Postal Code for Ham.
Look it up.
I can't play the best album.
I can't play the best stuff from that album
on broadcast radio
because it's too bold.
Before that, we heard some
Media Barrage-style audio collage
by the redoubtable Cool Hand Chris.
And there'll be lots more of that
near the end of the show.
Most of what follows
on this hour of Slack,
number 1,687,
is one 40-minute
generally uncut recording
from July 5th
at the 21X Day
Drill event.
Actually, the 23rd drill.
From my portable
Tarzan's radio station
being used by Dr. Hal Robbins,
Reverend Mother Racine Miller,
Reverend Anna Mall,
Reverend Fanboy,
with Dr. Philodrum Engineering,
and
if my voice
sounds kind of thin
right now,
it's because that portable radio station
is still in Ohio
with Princess Wee and her mom.
But I'm alone with two dogs
on Stang Ranch
in blistering rural
north-central Texas
using tinfoil and toothpicks
for a microphone.
It's due to a family
situation that is still ongoing
but making great
progress finally.
And my heart
has lifted again after a while.
I'm sure you've all heard

routine in this cave.
I don't have Princess Wee
here to spoil me,
but I'm learning.
And I have hope for the future,
mine anyway.
And I'm confident that soon
we'll be able to move on
to new subgenius book projects
for one thing.
Anyway,
meanwhile,
here are Anna Mall,
Dr. Hal,
and rotating cohorts
broadcasting
the latest









broadcasting,
I think late at night
at the Caffeinist Cafe
at Wisteria Campground
in Southern Ohio
last July 5th
upon the failure
of the world
to end
again.
I really like the flexibility
in nature
that you're bringing
to the table here,
Dr. Hal.
Versatile is all I get out.
That's okay.
I've been hit in the face
with a microphone before.
I like,
I like the fact





that I'm in the middle

I like it when liquids
are near electronics, guys.
That's not a good question.
Makes me feel safe.
Okay.
Let's then arrange this way
and I'll take this accident
in utero out of here.
This is not a coaster.
This is the book.
I'm gonna put that book
right here.
That's the book
about all the wild
and crazy sex things
these crazy kids
are doing out in,
in where?
That's where we're going.

that's where we're going.
That's where we're going.






Not sure where.
But I do know
that if you're gonna get
a short duration marriage
and you're out of ideas
of what to do
after the first couple of days.
I do perform that all the time.
I do do that also.
Perform the short duration marriage
ceremony.
You know,
as a subgenius,
you get to.
Yeah.
I've actually performed
many short duration marriages
and unfortunately
a couple of them stuck
and are long term marriages
and I keep telling them
that's really not
how you do it, kids.
But, uh,
I'm not sure




if I can tell you

you know,
they're,
they're all kooky
these mutants.
Reverend,
do you use,
uh, headphones?
Let's see.
It's amazing
once you've got it
going through your head
and, uh,
now you really feel,
uh,
plugged in
a part of the old,
uh,
radio stream
to use
archaic terminology.
Now we got odd
casts,
podcasts.
There's new streams.
There's new streams.
Streaming casts.
Radio streams,
podcast streams.
Just don't cross
the streams,
they say.
No.
They're the same.
No,
you can't cross them.
I'm telling you.
Some people say,
I've had some people say,
well,
it's just the same as radio.
You're talking,
people are hearing.
But, uh,
you know,
like,
radio,
you can pick up
on your car,
radio.
Yes.
Rumbling along
in the
Badlands
or something.
Cool,
I get a car now.
No,
I missed that.
A sporty special.
Awesome.
I missed that about radio
and I don't listen
to a lot,
any commercial radio.
I cannot
listen to it anymore.
And non-commercial radio,
not enough.
My favorite radio station
It's a guest.
is a public radio station
in Austin, Texas
that, uh,
lets pretty much
anything be played
and there's one show
called Commercial Suicide
where the,
ooh,
that sounded like
some church air.
Oh,
oh,
oh,
yes.
And, uh,
the Commercial Suicide
show,
the air of the church.
Honestly,
one of the most
Is there any despair?
They had a
half hour song

let's offer one
at any rate
if we can.
of a clicking,
random clicking sound
the other night
and I couldn't figure out
what was wrong
with my vehicle
and it turned out
it was just the song
that was playing
on the radio.
Oh,
it wasn't the tap
of the Death Watch Beetle.
No,
it was actually
probably mic'd that
and that was the song.
Well,
that's, uh,
using natural sounds
as the basis
of, uh,
your music.
Do they still have
that recording
that you just like,
that, you know,
you go out and just like
catch the sound
and it's there
and it's,
capture the sound
and the feel.
It's on the hill
beneath the moon
and under the sun
I know there's people
who are storing
sounds.
in the roaring traffic
boom
in the silence
of my lonely room
What?
Sigh.
Roaring
traffic

sound effects
by Philodrome.
We are on that,
uh,
diurnal,
nocturnal cycle
here.
Night and day,
uh,
some of us under normal circumstances
do not go out
in the sunshine
because of its
deleterious effect
it has on our being.
Mm-hmm.
It hurts.
But,
it need not
if you put some of your
coffin earth
inside special
hollow shoes
like I have made,
you can even walk around
in the daytime,
though not really
very often.
You can do all your secrets.
Oh, no.
Everybody does that.
Uh-huh.
All the people
who need that.
It's commonly done.
I wish I had
the hollow shoe concession.
You,
they have to
make them
for you.
Uh,
here we have
some more church air
coming up to the
podium now.
Fantastic.
Let me just
hand it over
and,
uh,
I hope you'll enjoy.
No, I'm good.
Okay.
I'm good.
Thank you, though.
Church,

yes,
he wants to keep
all the brain cells
he's got.
I know that attitude.
Oh, no.
When you can count them,
then you gotta
conserve them.
That's right.
Oh,
cartridge it.
Oh, you haven't,
I didn't,
I thought it was loaded.
Pardon me.
Oh, no, no.
That's just our
audience participation.
Let me give you
a special little
greenish metallic
cylinder.
Now,
everything's
gonna be all right.
I didn't realize
it wasn't loaded.
I'm gonna go
to a place called
the Fun Shop.
The Fun Shop?
The,
it was Joe's Fun Shop.
And then we,
then Joe,
I don't know what
happened to Joe,
but it was called
the Fun Shop.
Have fun at Joe's Fun Shop.
Eat at Joe's
and then go to
Joe's Fun Shop.
That was,
uh,
that was in the,
uh,
Austin, Texas area
back in the
90s,
80s,
90s.
This shop had good
fun shooey.
I don't know what
was fun about it,
but I had a bunch
of,
there was church
here in the back.
More fun than a
barrel of mankies.
Why the tinfoil?
Is this a,
a,
a,
It's preventing
feedback from that
speaker.
Okay, amazing.
What do I think
of next?
I like this music
quite a bit.
I think it's great.
Well,
now things are
working as they
should be.
The larks on the
wing,
the snails on the
thorn.
God's in his
heaven.
All's right with
the world.
Until it goes
haywire again.
There we are.
Well,
I wonder,
first of all,
did you try it
all?
What?
Now I'll just
load myself up
one,
or maybe a
double.
If anyone would
like a double,
I'll put
chew in just for
your trouble.
Thanks Rev Mom Dog.
That's the new,
that's our new
first four short
in the name.
That's a dead
soldier there.
I love,
I love that Viking
helmet.
Let me comment on
it.
Those playing along
at home,
there's somebody
wearing a hat.
A Viking helmet.
And it's very
impressive.
It is impressive.
It's,
it's certainly
got big horns.
Yep.
Indeed.
Anybody
ready to sing opera
in that thing?
That would be
appropriate.
Yes.
You see the Vikings
didn't have horns
on their helmets.
I'll check backstage,
maybe there's a breastplate.
But the opera
had that design
by Arthur Rackham
for Wagner's
Ring Cycle Opera.
Can't,
can't assume that
everyone with a
helmet wants to
sing opera.
Everybody thinks it.
But if you have
that hat with
those horns,
then you're like
Brunhilde,
the warrior woman
who,
who loves Siegfried,
who's surrounded by,
by fire,
because Wotan forced her
into exile
in the eternal flames.
Like you do.
Yeah,
and then Siegfried
got her out of there
and,
Where was Roy?
There's sentencing
guidelines.
You gotta hold to them.
I just put one of these
in here.
I'm just gonna have
a single,
not a double.
It's greedy to have a double
and he used it all up
at once just for
a heightened effect.
It's,
it's,
it's good to remember
the golden rule
in these
circumstances.
And do unto others
as they
would do unto you.
As you would have
them do unto you.
That's great.
Okay,
I didn't kill it.
Does,
does this music
have a name?
No?
I don't think











it does now.
It's enjoyable.
The Toad,
or Todd Death Music.
Toad meaning death.
Nice.
And Toad,
well,
it could be
the death of a toad.
I told you so.
The death
of a toad.
Oh,
for a minute
I thought it was a poem.
A toad,
the power mower caught.
Oh,










the power mower caught.
Chewed and clipped
of a leg.
Oh.
Where the hobbling
hop has got
to the garden verge
and sanctuaried him
under the cinerary leaves.
In the shade
of the ashen
heart-shaped leaves
and a dim,
a low
and a final
glade.
The rare
original
heart's blood
spends,
flows
on the earthen
hide
and






in the flows
and wisenings
of the banked
and staring
eyes.
He lies
as still
as if he would
return
to stone
and soundlessly
attending
dies
toward
some
deep
monotone.
Toward misted
and ebullient
seas
and cooling
shores.
Toward lost
amphibious
emperies.
Something's burning.
Day dwindles
drowning
in the

and at last
is gone
in the wide
and antique
eyes
which still
appear
to watch
across
the castrate
lawn.
The haggard
daylight
steer.
Haggard?
Like Merle?
Yeah,
like a
jagged
You know,
it goes on.
Things are not
as they should be
but
there it goes.
Aww.
I don't know.
It's a

It's one of those things.
Anyway, that toad
died nobly
and honorably.
I feel bad
for the toad.
That's too bad.
The toad had a good
death,
a philosophical
death
in which he was able
to visualize
the great
amphibious
empire
of earlier ages
and then just
kindly
die from
blood loss.
As happens,
I've run over them
with the power mower.
Web loss?
Blood loss.
Oh, blood loss.
Probably web loss, too,
at that point
if you've been run over.
It chewed him
and clipped him
of a leg.
Power mower.
I take the blades off
before I go driving around
in my power mower.
The whole idea
is you're mowing
the castrate lawn
it describes
at the end.
So, yeah,
humans are really
the top predator now.
I mean,
that's what keeps
populations down.
Because we have
lawn mowers.
Because we have
lawn mowers.
Well, seriously.
The lawn mower.
The lawn mower.
Yes, indeed.
Is it the grim reaper
or the international harvester?
Some kind of
mechanical device.
Uh-huh.
I had a pool lawn
for a while.
With flashing blades
and swishing sides.
Chopping, hacking,
and hewing
its way along.
A lubricated dreadnought.
Those machines
are fascinating.
They are.
They cause
all those terrible
farm machinery accidents.
I'm afraid so.
Implements.
Implementing.
Jake and John.
They're the best.









They mark the beginning

here and he and I are going to be doing our show for the pagans it hasn't been a
pagan kind of thing but we can craft it there are pagans at Starwood that's
right wonderful star would going to star would never have been that'll be
interesting that's an interesting act for them yes it should be it different
after the low-key nature of x-day where they come in and they measure with
measuring tape every possible occupiable spot of ground for their pavilions and
tents uh-huh yep I've seen that I've seen that occur it's very ambitious for
us not leaving anything behind they want to measure it first yeah we know what
they're missing I saw you worse earth-worshipping pagans leave more
garbage than we cynical snarky subgeniuses that's interesting
you
yes I'm the mess I don't leave one see dang always said that the pagans paid
more attention to his sermons than the subgeniuses did that's that's easy yes
that's not hard to understand yeah we used to go camping out near pagans and
we just put down a giant tarp okay roll it up at the end was that okay that work
out Home
Out

Out
Out


Out
Out
while it was all rolled out.
You mean when you rolled it out again?
When we ruined the earth repeatedly year after year.
For people that are interested in seeing that live,
they can come to Mischievous Columbus Day weekend in North Texas.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
Yeah, it would be if it's not sold out already.
Do you get a holiday at that time?
You know, it's not like I want to say I need the weekend off
because it's my people's holiday.
That's not one of those things that you...
In the name of the Italian-American heritage
or the admiral of the ocean sea or whatever.
It's like the jerk that says he discovered stuff that was already here.
Oh, yeah, right.
It's like, I need Columbus Day off.
It was a venture. It was in itself worthy of praise.
The lessons, though, that I received as a child about Columbus
and about having Christmas celebrations in public school and stuff like that,
it gave me this mythology,
which is how I view the world.
And I have to constantly have that stuff deprogrammed out of me.
That's why I believe in the conspiracy.
Well, they decided that I was going to think one way about all this stuff.
After you're told something to go,
examine it yourself and get comfortable with what you hear.
I don't introspectively look at anything.
I just get more stuff in there.
That way it's all garbled.
I don't know what's true.
That's an approach.
What should I believe?
It's kind of like my accounts online.
If anybody ever wanted to figure me out online,
they would look and they would be like,
I don't know what to think of this person.
What about the compartmentalization of belief?
You know, like in Japan,
you compartmentalize what you choose to believe at different times
on the basis of different things,
maybe different attitudes.
It's impressive to me that it's recognized.
You can think scientifically or you can think magically.
I think you can seek out or discard omens.
But the point is to...
Why not both?
You don't share some compartments.
Nope.
No.
And it's...
I think it's Western Christian religious culture that says,
you can't do that.
You have to be genuine.
You have to be genuine.


You have to be genuine to yourself and genuine to God.
And I think it's...
Of course, God created the drugs and the receptors
that make them operative in the human case.
Sure.
I thought some dude just wrote up some dogma
and said that that's how it was.
Often it was like that.
Okay.
Often it is like that.
That's why I don't really hang out with people
that are, once again, writing things down,
admissible in court.
Well, putting something in writing does make it official.
I'm sorry.
I'm fascinated by an inflatable poo emoji
being towed in a little red wagon by...
There, there.
It's all right.
A tall person who is...
You're okay.
...demasked.
You're my friend.
It looks like they've got their crap together.
Good.
I'm glad.
I feel calm.
Their poo emoji.
Because it was quite a vision.
Yeah, that's real.
That's real.
You're not...
Oh, good.

It's all real.
You'll keep telling yourself,
it's not just a movie.
It's not just a movie.
It's a sequel to a movie.
Right.
The sequel to...
Are you familiar with The Tingler?
Why, yes.
A most interesting movie.
Is it not?
Is it a movie?
It is a movie.
It's a movie.
I've been fed that line before,
and I did not see a movie afterwards.
This is the movie.
The Tingler is this horrible centipede-like creature
that...
that's more than a foot long,
that forms at the back of your spine
when you're scared,
but is destroyed...
destroyed when you give a scream.
So, uh...
In this movie,
they get a...
a woman who's a mute,
terrified,
and then she can't scream,
and then they cut out The Tingler,
and it escapes,
and it goes into a movie theater,
and it's crawling under the seats.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Tingler has just entered this theater.
The only way to defy...
to defy it...
is to scream for your lives,
ladies and gentlemen.
Scream.
Also,
in the same movie,
Vincent Price takes LSD.
It is said to be LSD.
He takes it.
He's...
He's noting his, uh...
reactions.
12.45.
My pulse seems to be, uh...
slightly greater than normal.
You know, and it goes into this horrible trip of, uh...
William Castle horror effects.
Bathtubs full of blood.
Bloody hands coming out.
You mean...
You mean a difficult experience.
Uh...
Uh...
Yeah, so like...
It's just a difficult experience you're having.
It depends.
You work through it.
It might be somebody's typical acid trip.
I don't know.
But anyway, that's how Vincent Price does it in the movie.
There's nothing that won't, uh...
you know, won't end in seven to nine hours.
You'll be fine.
The Tingler is such a preposterous movie
that I think it deserves a place in subgenius bull.
Uh...
You refer to it.
Everybody ought to refer to it
because it resonates in so many peculiar ways.
Another one that is just so hardcore,
it's ridiculous,
is Life Force.
Don't you think that one's a real subgenius movie?
Yeah.
You know that one?
Very, very much.
About the space vampires?
I don't think I've seen it.
I got a deficit in that department.
It's based on Colin Wilson's novel,
The Space Vampires.
But they come to Earth and they are, you know,
one's a beautiful naked woman who walks around,
but they zap your youth and your beauty from you
and you turn into a horrible, withered, shrunken mummy.
And then on the operating table...

I mean, not subjective at that point.
The mummy sits up
and then the mummy performs mouth-to-mouth on you
and now you're all old and horrible
and the mummy is young and walking around.
The mummy's kiss?
Well, they're exchanging the life force
with this mummy zap kiss
and it gets out of control
and the whole city of London is shambling,
mouth-sucking mummies.
Always London.
That's a real cinematic image right there.
And sometimes the space vampires,
reveal themselves as enormous bats,
which is nice of them.
Anyway, the whole thing.
Damn good, I thought.
It's just a wacko movie,
but it's very subgenius.
Life force, we're talking about.
I have to go see that.
Yeah, you ought to.
Get it on my television.
It's been around for so long,
you can probably watch it for free on the...
You really ought to.
It's good.
It's got a good script.
It's always exciting when you find pre-code movies
and things that are in public domain on YouTube.
I believe Frank Finlay is in there as Dr. Filardo.
And of course, Steve Charles Manson-Railsback
is there as an astronaut
who is seduced by this alien being.
Well, somebody's got to do it.
It's wonderful.
They're up in space
and they find these godlike beings
in their bat-like ship and so forth.
Do you remember the man who could make miracles?
Yes.
Yes, by H.G. Wells.
I do believe so, yes.
But the movie itself.
The movie I do remember by Alexander Korda.
Yes, absolutely fantastic.
Pretty good, yes.
That's public domain these days.
Uh-huh.
And you can't get enough of that.
It has great moments.
Have you read the story?
I have.
Yeah, the story is wonderful, too.
I've actually read a book.
That was the book.
That was the one...
The only book I've read.
Well, the two books that I've read.
The church book.
You see, in all these stories,
when somebody is given a miraculous power,
they always fuck it up.
I mean, this is the form of the story.
How could you write such a story
where they don't fuck it up?
I think I might have figured it out.
Well, how come it's always like
the weird, unhappy, drunk person
that gets the power?
Instead of some...
A successful, confident person.
It's like, this person looks level-headed insane.
Let's just, let's give them a power.
See what happens.
A successful, confident, self-satisfied person
might wreck the world soon.
Or a young child with ambition.
Mr. Fatheringay spends most of his time
trying to get this woman to like him.
That's not even in the story, but...
No, it is.
But at the end, he starts to get a sense of his own power.
Oh, Mr. Fatheringay.
Oh, Mr. Fatheringay.
How dare you?
Oh, you're so cheeky, Mr. Fatheringay.
He wants more time for his meetings,
so he stops the world,
causing all the continents to fly off
and everybody to be killed.
And an entire pantheon...
Of gods.
Of gods and goddesses.
Including Torrin Thatcher,
are up there watching.
Are looking down at him,
and, oh, this is what we've done, huh?
The evil magician from the seventh voyage of Sinbad
is one of those gods.
It was a bet between two of them, wasn't it?
Yes, yes.
Again, not in the story, but in the movie.
In the movie.
Well, the problem with it,
with having the superpowers,
is you're not in a stable state.
You're always finding out
the extent of your superpowers
until, eventually, you are destroyed
because something happens that is irrevocable
and you just can't deal with.
But what if you use your superpowers on yourself?
You decree that most of the time
you forgot that you had it.
But things are going to go well for you.
You get this all figured out.
And then, you know, you forget for a while.
You forget that you have superpowers.
Then you wouldn't be the chump
who is knocked down for...
For using superpowers.
For using superpowers or whatever, yeah.
So, basically, you're saying
if you just subject yourself to your own will
and don't use your will on other people...
It's difficult, given human nature,
to say that you can control it.
But if you deliberately subtract elements of your own ego,
you might be able to live with it.
So, a loss of ego and being...
using more of an Eastern philosophy
of wanting what you have
as opposed to having what you want might...
Stephen King, America's most popular writer,
wrote a short story called
The Word Processor of the Gods.
Ah, yes.
Do you remember that one?
I do. I do remember that one.
This kid, who's a brainy genius type,
who's also a sensitive, molested character.
He repairs this guy's word processor
and it turns out that anything he writes on it comes true.
How many machines gave powers...
Stephen King was a hack.
Or is a hack, sorry.
Yeah, of course.
But still, he's playing in the classic vein.
Now the guy can change things around
and he eventually changes around
so that this kid is his son
instead of his actual son, who he hates,
and changes around all the facts of his life
and then the word processor...
The word processor busts a fuse and gives out, you see.
What if you had some magical device like that?
Or what if you had some alien equivalent of the iPhone or something?
It operates on probability vectors that are totally outside our science.
But you have it and anything you write there will come true.
You should write that you forget that you have this for a while.
That nobody else ever gets it.
Gets it.
And then you write their hands on it.
And then everything that happens, even though you have written the script,
is a pleasant surprise to you.
And furthermore, you're contained by the fact
that you're not leaving it wide open for you to start
a giant cosmic temper tantrum,
which will inevitably mean your downfall.
Sounds fantastic, actually.
It's a great idea.
A lot of foresight put into that
that I don't think most people are capable of having.
But...
Would you want to forget?
Well, the next time I get one of those devices, you see,
I'll be all prepared for it.
This is so wonderful. Why would I want to forget this?
Oh, how can I take this away from myself?
I've known joy.
But you remember.
The thing is, you might get to a dangerous stage of annui.
You know, now nothing matters.
I can have whatever I want.
That's true.
In a large charge.
But if you forget that...
Because if you remember joy, then you'll remember sadness.
Oh boy, things are going great.
You know, what'll happen next?
And then in the still of the night, you remember.
Oh, yes, I have that thing.
And oop, there it is, right there.
Couldn't see it before.
Well, let's write some more.
Take a nap, wake up, and it all starts over again.
All anew, all afresh.
Well, you can't wish for a million wishes, that sort of thing.
You'll get nothing for nothing.
I've never been given the opportunity to wish for anything,
much less a million wishes.
Well, you know, the joker who's given three wishes and the last wishes.
And I wish for a million more wishes.
That's a very dangerous procedure.
To follow.
As opposed to the staunch list follower, the joker.
I don't understand.
Did he actually get a million more wishes?
Or did they do something...
Well, what he would get was something that would rebound against him.
Like the three wishes he already had, he would get a million more times,
or something like that.
Oh, wait.
The guy that...
That's what it was.
If you wish for a million more wishes, you become the genie,
and you have to give the millions of wishes.
Perhaps. It could be...
That is Shazam.
Yeah.
Zing.
And other sounds.
These stories are really variants on deals with the devil stories.
You know, you try to get a good bargain with the devil,
but that is always difficult to do.
Yeah, but if you don't come from that kind of dichotomy,
like the good and evil...
Sometimes people win, but...
No.
Usually the house wins.
Just like, maybe it's just a trickster.
Maybe it's more of a Loki or a Kokopelli or something, that rabbit or something.
Well, once you're dealing with the devil, you're in a Christian framework,
including Satan worshippers.
These people are actually Christians because the devil is a Christian character.
But there is a bleed over into the ancient devil worshippers.
The worshipping of fire and Zoroastrianism and the demons of Arabic mythology.
Yeah, there's always set.
Yes.
He was such a wonderful seagull, I swear.
That's Egyptian.
If I may, it's interesting that today, 21st century, when we think about superpowers,
we think about containing them.
But when the modern superhero started, it was supposed to be somebody who beat up the bad guys,
including the corrupt officials.
He was the savior.
Now we think of them...
I mean, both comic book companies have basically put the non-cooperating superheroes in concentration camps
in their different universes.
That's what it all seems to boil down to.
A struggle against conditions which wouldn't prevail if the superheroes weren't there.
That's what happened to the new Dirk Gentry.
I swear, have you seen the Dirk Gentry's Holistic Detective Agency of late?
No, not yet.
The new episodes are all about how he's got this special superpower.
He's not just necessarily...
He just wants to be a holistic detective.
He just wants to call it holistic detectivism.
He just is really good at being at the right place at the right time.
That's his superpower.
So, I'm not sure.


Instead of just being a really awkward detective,
he's trying to be contained by some government agency.
Whatever works.
I know Stang always brings up the forgotten DC character Bouncing Boy.
He's one of the absurd Teen Titans.
The bouncing superhero power.
But you gotta play whatever hand you're dealt.
So what is your superpower, Dr. Hal?
Oh, I would never claim to have a power of particular discernment.
What's your okay power, then?
I think an extraordinary power of yours is the power of recitation.
It impresses me.
I'll just go ahead and say that.
Yes, I've got a recitative thing going as part of my act.
You know, it's the recapitulating poems and so forth.
Here at X-Day, it smells like...
Bacon?
It certainly does.
I think the late night meal is a cookin'.
I think...
Or hot dogs.
Hot dogs.
The motion picture.
Yes.
Actually, there was a movie of talking hot dogs recently.
Wasn't there?
Was...
Oh, the sausage thing.
The sausage party movie?
Yeah.
I didn't see it.
I heard about it.
It's really snarky.
These hot dogs address each other in contemptuous fashion.
Yeah, I know.
Only so many euphemisms I can pack in in an hour.
And that was a little much for me.
Did you see a portion of it?
I saw none of it.
I only knew that it was happening from a distance.
A serving of it?
Did anybody actually see that movie?
Or was it...
Maybe they just did the prequels.
I'm looking forward to the new Ant-Man movie since I liked the first Ant-Man movie so much.
This one has just gotten good reviews.
What's not to like?
It's like he gets really tiny and he hangs with his ant friends.
Also, the wasp is along with him this time.
That was a good trailer.
Yes, I didn't see the trailer, but did you see the first Ant-Man movie?
No, I'm superhero deficient, I'm afraid.
If you hate them all, this is the one to see.
It's interlocked with all the rest like they are, but it's quite a charming and witty movie.
I'll take your word for it.
I think the last movie of that nature was Birdman.
Oh, I saw Birdman.
That was depressing.
It was an interesting film though, the whole movie pretending to be shot in one single shot.
Is that what it did?
That was the movie?
Birdman.
Oh, I thought there was a plot and I didn't realize that was the...
Oh, the camera never goes off the guy, right?
The shot is always running whatever happens, except at the end when he goes out the window.
There you go.
You mean also like Hitchcock's Robe?
Or there he went.

This is another film like that?
Birdman?
Yeah.
Well, like what?
There's no other film like it that I know of.
It's a trope.
It did receive...
Now it's a trope.
Yeah.
It wasn't yet a trope.
I've...
There have been other movies that have been similar, that have had similar gags.
I've read a bit about how difficult that movie was to make.
Because they had to make breakaway sets that were silent.
Right.
Because to move back, you have to go through walls and things like that.
Alfred Hitchcock's Robe was done that way many years ago.
But they had to cheat by sometimes while they were panning past a chair or something, they'd stop the camera and then rearrange things and continue passing.
But at any rate, it's still all the same single shot.
Single shot.
Yep.
There's one more.
Well, anyway, Ant-Man.
Now you'd like him.
He's...
You know, he's real small.
That's the nice thing about him.
Nice guy.
Can he change from very small to very large?
Is this the same thing?
Well, yes.
Now he can.
You remember in the comic, he could also become Giant Man.
Yes.
But at the end of Ant-Man, the villain, who is also the insect dwindling superhero type,
there's, as always in these movies, the mighty Batman.









And they generally meet in front of a crowd that has carefully dis fury.


He's both a role model and aedly fiddler that's a master of rest mystery
And he's, uh, what they call open sly.
The sound effect that cut in is really great.

but let's take a brief整 Background обı teams
to the mass
size of a dog and races out and later on in the movie it's seen that the guy's daughter is feeding
the ant under the table a beloved pet by this time and a lot of good things in the in the movie
i like honey i shrunk the kids uh i even somewhat like honey i blew up the kid if you saw that one
where they make the toddler an obscenely huge giant because that's that's the kid you want
to make larger one in diapers well he's of course uh irritatingly cute and impossible to control
and the bad guys want to blast him with helicopter gunships and so
so rick moranis is actually coming back he was a where did he go oh that's very good news yes
i've been missing him he's doing so yes sctv is trying to commemorate itself doing
that's a good thing yes who have they got
who's still around uh joe flaherty oh boy andrea martin yep they're still around um so dave thomas
dave thomas is actually a real big wheel so really him him he i think it was he who wanted to get it
going oh uh it's just a little bit stuck here um uh i i tend to screw it on too tight then uh
i'll take out a piece of paper so dave thomas and who else uh rick moranis
rick moranis and then uh who was i don't know if i don't know if he's part that's why i won't say
okay well uh you know who would be in uh any of the gals coming back andrea martin
andrea martin uh any any other gals well i wonder about about katherine o'hara would she become i
wonder too yeah that would be fun yep she was in tim burton's movies that's true all right which one
uh
for sure in beetlejuice
don't say it a third time no
you thought i was gonna say beetlejuice
now i've got to find zag nuts and
manuals for the recently dead dick cavett
isn't that yes it's true not tourette's he's actually saying people's names
no i'm just a fan of his i always liked his show back when it was on yeah remember you had the
johnny carson show but dick cavett was like the hip version of that where they would get
more interesting guests and it's better to have multiple venues i don't think i was allowed to
stay up that night or had been invented yet
so
it wasn't
for a lot of folks but uh right
anything past 10 o'clock was monty python in my house yes monty python was still uh
uh on still wide favorite certainly and there are many of those guys still left alive yeah i uh
i was gonna say i i met uh uh
Eric Idle, except, you know, I did, and yet I didn't.
I was at the studio in Hollywood
where we were doing the Conspiracy Zone TV show,
and the car pulled up, this long black car,
and I had nowhere to stand, nowhere to move,
and the door opened, and Eric Idle got out,
so there he was, and I was like,
how do you do?
Great, great fan of yours, nice to see you, and so forth.
That's not really meeting yet.
Anybody.
Didn't get a Christmas card written afterwards.
Yeah, that would have been nice.
Letters from camp.
He didn't follow you on Twitter.
We had good guests on that show.
It's a pity that I feel the show had potential,
but we had the wrong emphasis.
So many things here at X Day having potential.
Missed potential on today's
Subgenius Podcast.
Yes.
Our story begins before the beginning.
Out of the cosmos.
Out of the silence.
Out of the mind of Bob.
Out of no thing at all.
Emerged everything that was, is, and will be.
All.
The design of those first three seconds
of the original flaring fourth
were perfect, supremely intelligent.
And that impulse, that design is still
operating through us now.
You hit the button and off it goes.
It felt like you were making a difference, you know, just you yourself.
And you didn't even have to leave your home, you know.
You just sat at your computer and followed instructions and stood up for what you believe in, so to speak.
You made your say in the world and hopefully it turns out better for it.
Yeah, that was some really crazy stuff to watch.
To be sitting there in front of a monitor and you have just information just flying in front of you and it's this unseeable internet war.
Knowledge is free. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.
It's over. You're not going to be able to follow people back to their house anymore with impunity.
You're not going to be able to just issue a cease and desist letter to any reporter who wants to write some shit about you that you don't like.
Bob invites you to join us in an act of solidarity.
Bob invites you to take up the banner of free speech, of human rights, of family and freedom.
Dress accordingly. Cover your faces because they will try to find out who you are and screw with your life.
Rule number 17. Cover your face. This will prevent your identification from videos taken by hostiles.
It is the idea that none of us are as cruel as all of us.
You have this massive crowd of people who are anonymous that is going to fight against a bigger thing and win.
And what the hell?
What just happened? What changed? Who flipped the switch?
The world looked very different to me at that point.
We all met each other.
Here's your culture.
You meet your own people finally.
The hour of flat.
We do not forget. Expect us.
We stand for freedom. We stand for freedom of speech.
The power of the people. The ability for them to protest against the government.
To right wrongs. No censorship. Especially online but also in real life.
We have members throughout society and all stratas of it worldwide.
Yet we have no leadership.
Bob!
Now we are going up.
We can't survive the fires that have burned down our immortals.

And Europe.
I don't think in time but still.

And let Peatsanao know this.

I am aitenst Schlisselfluege.
When we began our passions.
Until believe me.
When we began to imagine the future outside our mimics.

O Sole Mee.
new began to come in. We had surplus. Out of this came civilization, came arts, came
culture, came this great explosion of creativity. And around about 800 BC, something new began
to emerge again. Great individuals broke through and founded the religions of this world. We
had, for example, Isaiah in Israel. We had Zoroaster in Persia, Buddha in India, and
of course, Jesus and Mohammed. These were individuals, in my understanding, who had
the experience of the core of the spiral breaking through as their consciousness.
Civilizations were built around these great humans.
And we loved them so much that they became the center of each great culture on this planet.
You see, in this whole sequence in the last 8,000 years, and now more recently with the
origin of religion, this yearning for something more, to transcend the limitations of the
human condition, to transcend the limitations of self-consciousness, to transcend the limitations
of the creature-human condition. And remembering the spiral, nature takes quantum jumps. It's
always building toward more consciousness, more life, more freedom. And very recently,
the last 300 years, we begin to gain radical new powers that actually lead to transformation.
The first of these powers is democracy itself.
The idea that we have to be free from the power of the world is to be free from the power of the world.

The idea that all people are created equal. The idea of the release of individual creativity
and potential through freedom. Democracy, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
This can be seen as an evolutionary advance. Nothing can stop it.
And the other great tool of radical transformation is
Bob.
Oh yeah, yeah, cue the jackasses. Get your freaking eyelids down.
It's my time to speak. We…
She… she once had a scabies cluster on her… well, on her out mouth. It was pretty gross then, true,
but I… I love that about her now. Now that the worms are the last ones to get to eat her at.
Not like this, little dog.
Meow! It's my way!
If you are what you eat, the worms are the last ones to eat you.
than I am her.
And those worms out there,
ditto.
Toddly,
but I'm a spy.
All you phonies and cronies must fly.
All you phonies and cronies must fly.
All you phonies and cronies must fly.
Phonies she just couldn't take.
If you wanna know, then read along.
And if now you are stupid and wrong,
oh, you fool, you thought you were cool,
but she thought you weren't.
Oh, no.
Undo.
Undo.
Dude, just drink it all.
Spazzy.
Hey, friends, I have no idea
where most of those audio sources come from
because I'm old,
but Cool Hand Chris is,
or seems to be, relatively young by comparison,
and he assembled those disparate parts into something.
I'm gonna close the show
with a very new song
from an upcoming but as yet unreleased album
by Una Walkenhorst,
and her pa, Bob Walkenhorst.
Yes, my songwriting hero, Bob of the Rainmakers,
is working with his talented daughter, Una.
Now, I work with a talented daughter myself sometimes,
so I really identify.
And I wish you could see the video
that was made to go with this song.
Hopefully you will.
You could Google or YouTube the title
Bob and Una Walkenhorst for Tomorrow.
And place cierto patria en poner que...
it comes from this piece
to say it's consequences e

Everybody's talking about the way it used to be yesterday
But I'm living for tomorrow
Everybody's talking about the times
Feel the dream is in decline
But I'm hoping for tomorrow
These kings ain't learning from the past
Think their reign will always last
The change is coming for tomorrow
So let them go and try to draw a line
Of hate and hate

Dividing you and I
We'll be rising up tomorrow
Ooh, I'm tired of standing around
Feet planted on this ground
Aren't you tired too?
Ooh, we could change it all
Right now
Tear all these statues down
If we really want to
What will we do?
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
What will we do?
Everybody's standing in the storm
As the future flips and falls
We're all fighting for tomorrow
Every dreamer, hoper, and defender
All the names that you remember
Will be coming round tomorrow
Ooh, here
We're all fighting for tomorrow
We're tired of standing down
Being punched and pushed around
Aren't you tired too?
Ooh, we could change it all right now
Tear this foolish wall on down
If we really wanted to
Ooh, what will we do?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
What will we do?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
What will we do?
Bob and Una Walkenhorst, For Tomorrow.
Title track of the upcoming album by this father and daughter team.
As a family man, I'm very touched to see this collaboration.
I'm not always a crazy ranting preacher.
You know, that's just my job.
Anyway, this is Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.
