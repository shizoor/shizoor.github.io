1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,680
The radio, remember? Make it work.

2
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,840
The hour of slug!

3
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,600
So you did bust it.

4
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,540
Stations aren't strong enough in the daytime. Tonight it'll work.

5
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,480
Tonight it's better.

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,580
Can't you smell it?

7
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,520
From PR News in Washington, I'm the easiest of them all.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,220
The Russians stole emails and then stole PR News to try to impact Washington.

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,540
The Trump sun cast a shadow.

10
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,420
Shadow over British Prime Minister Theresa May.

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,660
She's pursuing an inadequate approach to PR News.

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,380
Washington.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,960
Trump repeated.

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,840
U.S. stocks up, up, down for 25, 91, 7, 17, 19.

15
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,140
Earlier this year, three PR News were killed in a park.

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,040
It's an unprecedented loss.

17
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,760
The Federal Reserve is projecting next week over the next two years.

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,860
The government of Kenya says,

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,120
This is defective PR News in Washington.

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,380
Oh, yes, dear friends, and thank you, Lee Murr,

21
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,340
and welcome to Hour of Slug number 1762.

22
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,900
It's January, the year the conspiracy calls 2020,

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,880
and we left Cleveland and the radio station for good last October.

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,840
And while we're at it, we're going to talk about the conspiracy.

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,100
We've done a few live shows with Dave here at Stang Ranch.

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,180
I've managed to make the recordings from the X-Day drill, 22 X-Day drill,

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,200
last all the way from July to now,

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,040
and we're only just now getting to the tragic recording from 7 a.m. July 5th.

29
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,840
For friends, that is the day that we expected the men and sex goddesses

30
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,420
from Planet X to arrive on Earth,

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,820
rupture us up to our own private custody,

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,020
power justice for failings,

33
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:47,100
and make us British Bratz under thoseゲ relic mmz

34
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,220
The

35
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,340
Nature left in King George the fourth.

36
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:04,740
Facebook, more interesting. I guess anybody can spend that $3.05. Anyway, it was all a moot point

37
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:15,860
since 2019 obviously wasn't 1998 or 8661 after all. So yep, once again, we got up at 6 a.m. for

38
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:23,600
nothing, as you'll be hearing, as we are made to feel dumb and dumber like a bunch of regular

39
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:36,720
dumpsters. Dumpster. Dumpster. Dumpster. Dumpster. Dumpster. Dumpster. I'm still waking up. Me too.

40
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:47,360
I've had a cup of coffee, but it hadn't run through me yet. One more. One more 7 a.m. Dr. Drummond and

41
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,500
Princess Wee. Just one more. That's all we have to do. We won't have to do it again.

42
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,400
after this, I'm sure. Got my boarding ticket. Boarding pass. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh right, right, right.

43
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,600
There's, I've got to make sure I have the extra. Oh, I'm glad she mentioned that. There's green

44
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,280
tickets. Yeah, you got your green ticket, right? I have my boarding pass. Everybody have their green ticket? I have mine. That's really important.

45
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:21,460
Okay. We have to go. Where's Dr. Philo Drummond? Dr. Drummond. Dr. Drummond. Dr. Drummond.

46
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:45,060
Dr. Drummond. Dr. Howell. Dr. Drummond. There he is. Sit in here. Put your butt in here. No. No. Oh, the pain. Pain. Pain. Pain. Pain. Pain. Misery and pain. Misery and pain? Misery and pain.

47
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,280
I have my boarding pass.

48
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,480
I have my boarding pass.

49
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:32,940
I have everything else we need. I have my boarding pass worn over my heart. Hey!

50
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:50,320
There's some other stuff we need. What? The other tickets. The red tickets. The red tickets? Yeah,

51
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,200
you didn't... Yeah, I didn't tell you about the red tickets. No, you didn't tell me about the red tickets.

52
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,520
They're supposed to be in the car here. You didn't tell me about the red tickets. I know. I don't know anything about the red tickets.

53
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,500
Don't worry, don't worry. Everything's fine. Don't panic.

54
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:15,580
Now they're not in here. If somebody took the red tickets or misplaced them, we could be in real big trouble. Uh-oh.

55
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,000
Could they have fallen down between the seats?

56
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,480
Between my seat and the console?

57
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,360
Just go on down there. We'll figure it out. Okay, I can't.

58
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,340
There's an open door in the car that I guess Philo... Well, where's Philo?

59
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,980
He's getting coffee. He's gonna walk down there. So he's gonna walk?

60
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,840
I hope so. Hope he still can. Coral Scudder.

61
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,640
So does he know we're leaving? Who cares? Don't worry about Philo.

62
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,200
But I do, I do worry about Philo.

63
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,240
I'll let you decide where to pull over here. I usually go down that circle at the end.

64
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,820
Okay. Okay. Oh, here we go. There's Reverend Fanboy maybe. Woohoo!

65
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,440
This is gonna be real hard to get out. I'm just gonna stay right here.

66
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,140
Now, where's the other tickets? That's the big question.

67
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,300
I think you're funning me about my tickets. No, I'm not funning you about them.

68
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,200
Seriously, there's some... There's red tickets that we're gonna need. Those green tickets are a ruse.

69
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,200
Oh no!

70
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,820
There's nothing else. Right down here.

71
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,140
It was like a folded up envelope. An envelope?

72
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,080
Yeah, it's a big envelope with a head. That's not an envelope.

73
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,600
No. Let me look under this. Oh yeah! Here it is. Here it is. Oh, thank God.

74
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,360
Here you go, baby. Oh, Jesus. Oh, what a relief.

75
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,440
Now, why is Susie... I had no idea what that envelope was.

76
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,480
I know, I know. You weren't supposed to know. Nobody was supposed to know.

77
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,080
You can't walk the car.

78
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,560
Okay.

79
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:10,860
Another hard, hard walk to the stone circle at Wisteria.

80
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,260
Poor old...

81
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,280
These poor old bones are gonna make this long.

82
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,700
I'm gonna make this long walk one more time.

83
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,920
I'm trying to remember what kind of... What was that great rant I came up with?

84
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:26,920
Photograph.

85
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,880
Poor old Reverend Stang. Hobbling out here one more time.

86
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:44,940
One last 7 a.m. This will be the last time I have to get up this early. God damn it.

87
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,240
Well, which one are you? You're new.

88
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,580
Yeah, I'm Dr. Overlord Destructotron. Showtully, whichever way you want to call me.

89
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,680
People send things like that to me every X-Day.

90
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,340
Huh. Okay. Well, welcome.

91
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,020
Thanks.

92
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,940
I'm the Pope of Plur.

93
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,680
I'm glad you made it.

94
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,600
Yeah, thank you. I'm glad, too.

95
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,100
And, uh...

96
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,880
Hi!

97
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,320
I'm technically a Wisterian.

98
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,820
Oh.

99
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,460
But I'm bringing the subgenius later today.

100
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,380
Oh, okay. Okay. Well, you made a wise move just in case.

101
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:20,740
Yeah.

102
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,300
You know, I just...

103
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,280
I already sent him a message. If I don't pick you up, world ended. Sorry.

104
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,020
Yeah. Well, yeah. There you go.

105
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,340
Poor old Philodrumon. Hobbling down the road for yet another 7 a.m.

106
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,660
Not a fit hour for man nor beast.

107
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,000
Grumbling and muttering.

108
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,680
Where's that...

109
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,700
Where's that music coming from?

110
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,620
He has speakers on his hips.

111
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,400
That's pretty...

112
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,180
That's great.

113
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,580
That's atmospheric, yeah. So that's a pretty good base for tiny little things like that.

114
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,240
For their bows.

115
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Oh, wow. The countdown... the countdown device. That's nice to have.

116
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,420
6 minutes and 33 seconds.

117
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,060
And how many subgeniuses are here this year?

118
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,480
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

119
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,020
Whoa, that's a record.

120
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,100
Record low.

121
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,960
11 subgeniuses waiting for the saucers. Hmm. What does that say? What does that tell you?

122
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,540
11 suckers.

123
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,380
Well, at least we got...

124
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,400
We got a lot of subgeniuses.

125
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:40,400


126
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,420
Nice background music for it.

127
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,440
We're ready, Bob. Or, uh, Exus. Or, I mean, uh...

128
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,160
We thought a ship was coming, but it turned out to be a meteor storm.

129
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,960
An asteroid headed to destroy Earth. Another killer asteroid.

130
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,180
In a race with the Exus.

131
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:02,700
Yes.

132
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Who will get here first, the asteroid or the Exus?

133
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,640
If it's another meteor storm, I do have this.

134
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:09,820
Right.

135
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,980
Reverend Feitsitaj here, friends, has the Ex Day Abort Key.

136
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,200
You don't see one of these every day.

137
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,120
So you might want to get a good, close look at it.

138
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,780
And memorize it.

139
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,600
And hope, pray, we don't need it.

140
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,360
Well, don't pray.

141
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,180
That's always a bad idea.

142
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,840
Yeah, never pray. You never know who's listening.

143
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,980
Yeah.

144
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,660
You got your own soundtrack with you. You sound like a Vangelis soundtrack.

145
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,700
This is different. This is real different with that lively music.

146
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,320
Yeah?

147
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,880
Yeah, it makes me feel hopeful.

148
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,920
We've got about five minutes now?

149
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,400
Yeah.

150
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,420
Wow. Oh, my God.

151
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,760
Geez, we've been slacking.

152
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,200
Last five minutes on it.

153
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,620
Uh...

154
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,180
Yeah.

155
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,920
Princess Wee, what was that rant that I came up with last night?

156
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,160
I don't know.

157
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,320
I had this great...

158
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,180
My brain was scoured.

159
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,160
You said it was really good.

160
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,340
It was. It was hilarious. I was in hysterics.

161
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,580
Wow.

162
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,100
Last night.

163
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,480
Well...

164
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,180
It was great. It was really novel.

165
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,540
Yeah, it was a whole new thing for 7 a.m.

166
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,060
Hi, Reverend Fanboy.

167
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,900
Nice to see you.

168
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,940
Glad you made it. Just in time.

169
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,060
I can't believe I made it either. But...

170
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,420
I'm here.

171
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,340
Yeah.

172
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:38,960
Yeah.

173
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,300
Yeah.

174
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,480
It was a stressful music.

175
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:40,760
Look.

176
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,880
Yes, how will it end?

177
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,880
It's okay. It's all right. Everything's okay. You're among friends.

178
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
The music is coming out of Reverend Fightsy Taj's gut.

179
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,280
I'm staying until I come by later. I have glue if you want to put that thing back on.

180
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,900
No, it's a...

181
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,840
What, the fright wig on my recorder?

182
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh, no. I thought that was your penis that you were holding in your hand. I'm sorry.

183
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,560
They're cheaper now. It's twice the price.

184
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,080
Which... Which... What do you mean?

185
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,540
Which...

186
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,360
Which penis?

187
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,560
Yeah. I got... It could be any.

188
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,360
It's the one that, you know, that sheds and falls off every once in a while.

189
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,220
Which one of those do you mean?

190
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,560
Yeah.

191
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,680
I've lost count.

192
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,900
The music is really...

193
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,800
Dramatic.

194
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:35,000
Tomorrow will be yet a new wonderful day for the subgenius.

195
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,250
Subgeniuses.

196
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,670
Not... Why tomorrow? Why today?

197
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,370
And...

198
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,830
If in some...

199
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,910
Horrible twist of fate it turns out this isn't 1998 after all,

200
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,150
we must remember the words of the great Professor Chaz Smith.

201
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,090
Build your own ship.

202
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,610
That was what it was. It was some rant about build your own ship and...

203
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,930
Yeah, we had to clean up the spaceship.

204
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,650
And the ship were already on and...

205
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,290
Oh, no. We knew that that comes after.

206
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:08,930
Okay.

207
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,650
But there won't be an after.

208
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,230
That was perfect.

209
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,230
We don't have to worry about after 7 a.m.

210
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:21,430
No. We won't have to worry about breakfast or going back to bed or

211
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,270
any of those things that we wonder and worry about every day.

212
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,990
Oh, Susie, you made it. Oh, good.

213
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,230
It's like, oh, wow.

214
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,190
If we don't get off...

215
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,590
You've got your... Now...

216
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,270
That's for you.

217
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,350
Does everyone have their green ticket?

218
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,210
No.

219
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:37,610
Yes.

220
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,710
You were handing out green tickets, right?

221
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,210
Yes, yes.

222
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,790
Yeah, I've got my green ticket. It's somewhere.

223
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:43,630
You don't have...

224
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,150
And your membership card.

225
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,810
I've got extra tickets.

226
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,270
Everybody...

227
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,790
Oh, all right.

228
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,390
Crimson Icula says...

229
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,330
Oh, yeah. Make sure you get that green ticket.

230
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,070
Green ticket.

231
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:53,750

Green ticket.

242
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,150
I believe I can still get a lease.

243
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,570
Yeah, you'll probably need to make an appearance at the charity workshop.

244
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,410
Oh, if you were in that look...

245
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,670
Maybe we could put a sign in.

246
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,810
Kids andле

247
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,470

My sex goddess is a teaser

287
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,250
We can touch with finesse

288
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,410
We will make her a believer

289
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,290
She will see July 5th

290
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,350
Worldwide state of panic

291
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,690
We'll see earth burning adrift

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,350
Cause I'm a pleaser

310
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,990
She's a pillow princess

311
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,710
How about that, folks?

312
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,590
One of the first original X-Day hymns in years.

313
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,010
The title is Pillow Princess

314
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,350
and the band is

00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,670

Neil B. Formey, to be more exact.

319
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,590
So, Neil before Reverend Neil B. Formey

320
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,530

325
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,390
before the fateful countdown.

326
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,470

Yeah, you're not the only one

331
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,930
who's asked about my pubic hair this morning.

332
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,170
Nice merkin, huh?

Yeah.

334
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,630
I'm proud to be a merkin.

335
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,470

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,010
thoughts one can

355
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,030
have. You don't want to be trapped

356
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,890
in your little mud world

357
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,850
of need and sex

358
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,890
and hunger and tiredness

359
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,230
and arthritis

360
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,670
and allergies and

361
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,770
pain.

362
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,910
The pain of

363
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,350
a hundred thousand

364
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,810
pains is about to

365
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,630
lift away.

366
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,070
Nine, eight,

367
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,170
seven, six,

368
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,290
five, four,

369
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,250
three, two,

370
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:02,390
one.

371
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,490
Fuck them if they can't take a

372
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,070
shot!

373
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,710
Everybody's always looking up.

374
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,950
You never

375
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,330
know.

376
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,450
Oh, that'd be awesome.

377
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,710
Yeah, where else are they going?

378
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,030
I may...

379
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,170
Maybe we should...

380
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,810
No, we've done that before.

381
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:31,810
Perhaps...

382
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,750
Maybe they're running

383
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,450
a little late.

384
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,510
No, no.

385
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,410
The clocks are right.

386
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,510
We're not sure about the

387
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,450
calendars or the astronomy.

388
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,270
Are they on like

389
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,050
sidereal savings time?

390
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,610
I don't know.

391
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,270
I think they are.

392
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,790
Maybe we may have...

393
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,470
Are the tickets any good?

394
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,230
This is where we get to dress

395
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,410
staying like a deer.

396
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,130
I brought a cleaning kit with

397
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,970
over the elbow gloves and a big

398
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,050
sack for the guts.

399
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,390
Who needs gloves?

400
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,490
It's fun when you do this.

401
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,370
Wait a minute.

402
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,730
You had told me there was some

403
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,250
other...

404
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,690
Something I had to remember.

405
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,470
What was it?

406
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,490
Something about...

407
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,570
Are you hoping Stang will remember this?

408
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:13,870
Wait a minute.

409
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,010
What was this thing...

410
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:15,150
The gut sack.

411
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,450
What was this all about?

412
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,350
I had the important tickets.

413
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,710
Your tool.

414
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,070
Oh, it's got your tool in there.

415
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,470
Green means go.

416
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,030
Green means go.

417
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,130
Green means go and I have green.

418
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,050
Yeah.

419
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,790
Well, you gave me this package

420
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,610
yesterday and said it was really important.

421
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,570
Ah, shit!

422
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,670
Oh, fuck.

423
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,450
Not again, Susie.

424
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,750
Red means real.

425
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,930
Red means real.

426
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,950
Green means go.

427
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:38,890
Susie!

428
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,110
Go to the bathroom.

429
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,510
No way.

430
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,270
No way.

431
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,390
You mean these tickets aren't even worth scalping?

432
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:43,770
What?

433
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,770
These tickets aren't even worth scalping?

434
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,070
God damn it.

435
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,310
Damn it.

436
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,490
How much did you guys pay for those green tickets?

437
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,770
I hope it wasn't much.

438
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,450
I mean, I only paid like $2 for my tickets.

439
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:52,990
Oh, the things I had to pay.

440
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:53,830
I'll give you a second.

441
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,590
Anybody want a red ticket?

442
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,870
Apparently, we've got all these red tickets here.

443
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,150
Oh, way to go, Susie.

444
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:02,970
It's just great.

445
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,350
You didn't have the tentacle hacker for us, did you?

446
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,670
You were the one that told me.

447
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,030
I held on to the red ticket.

448
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,150
I didn't tell you anything.

449
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,110
I have my boarding pass.

450
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,470
We got fucked and you weren't here to wipe us off.

451
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,870
I'd say I was sorry, but I'm not.

452
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,370
He always...

453
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,770
He'll have what perfect timing.

454
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,830
Reverend Angry Larry comes down at 7.05 a.m. on July 5th.

455
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,810
If I would have been here, I would have been here on time.

456
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,490
You mean this paper is nothing but paper?

457
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,290
I had to drop Reverend Lucy off at the toilet.

458
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,450
And then I raced here.

459
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,650
Are you calling her a toilet?

460
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:37,490
No.

461
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,550
Oh, here's your red ticket anyway.

462
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,130
That was the one we were supposed to have.

463
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:46,070
Only Susie got mixed up between, you know, yes and no.

464
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,490
Right and wrong.

465
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,910
Left and right.

466
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,110
Up and down.

467
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:51,910
Left and right.

468
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,010
That never happens to me.

469
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,090
This is righty, this is lefty.

470
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,630
Are you going to tell me my tits are wrong?

471
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,830
Yes, actually, that's right and that's left.

472
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,090
Not in the mirror it's not.

473
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,090
Not what the tattoo says.

474
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,810
Well, hell.

475
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,210
Once again...

476
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:15,970
Time to celebrate.

477
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,090
For...

478
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,150
Come to think of it, I guess, Susie,

479
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,630
it's the 24th time I've said, well, hell,

480
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,430
at about 7.01.

481
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,930
My water broke, put it in my butt.

482
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,410
Oh, we're recording at the premiere.

483
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,810
Oh, again.

484
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,730
It happened again, Susie.

485
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,690
This is just paper?

486
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,870
How can it be just paper?

487
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,510
Yeah, hang on to your green ticket, Susie.

488
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:41,810
You're welcome.

489
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,770
God, thanks a lot.

490
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,850
We had this one chance.

491
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,170
One chance.

492
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,010
No, wait a minute.

493
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:48,870
One chance.

494
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,390
What is it?

495
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:53,470
I did tell you green meant goat, didn't I?

496
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:53,950
Yeah.

497
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,810
Run, Bucker.

498
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,990
Oh, my bad.

499
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,590
My bad.

500
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,410
I'm such a consummate toady.

501
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,490
I just took the blame.

502
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:03,970
Thank you.

503
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,750
Thank you.

504
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,530
It's all her fault.

505
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,950
Once again, Susie fucked up.

506
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:08,910
It's all her fault.

507
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,310
She's the goat.

508
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,010
She's always ready to take it.

509
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:12,810
Yep.

510
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,910
Thank you so much for...

511
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,070
Bend over, say ah.

512
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,150
Ah.

513
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,490
Ah.

514
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,010
Ah.

515
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,730
Why did I keep this just in case?

516
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:30,070
Well, we better hang on to those red tickets for next, what, 86-61?

517
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,570
Is that...

518
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,330
Hmm.

519
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,770
It seems like it didn't take as long this year.

520
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,190
What, to be disappointed?

521
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:38,590
Yeah.

522
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,850
No, you're right.

523
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:40,310
It does.

524
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,390
It seems like usually it goes on and on and on.

525
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,610
It's the countdown clock I've ever seen.

526
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:45,990
Oh, right.

527
00:25:45,990 --> 00:26:01,030
It's only 365 days, 23 hours, 55 minutes and 654321 seconds to 23X day.

528
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,710
So, Reverend Stang, you need to be...

529
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,790
Are we going to let the Discordians be right?

530
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,670
Once more, the pinks got off, but not us.

531
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,210
What?

532
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,790
Once more, the pinks got off, but not us.

533
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,650
I don't know that any pinks got off.

534
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,810
They got off the hook, didn't they?

535
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,430
They're not burning.

536
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,690
I don't smell it.

537
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,330
Well, they got off the hook one more year.

538
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,610
But so did we, if you think about it.

539
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:32,090
Did Bob ever say where Planet X is or if we were actually supposed to go there?

540
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:39,350
There's certain things that were left kind of open and vague, like exactly where are

541
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,730
the saucers going?

542
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,790
We get saucers.

543
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,430
We know that.

544
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:43,770
Right.

545
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,170
Maybe there's like a Parkinson's.

546
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,170
Maybe we can say that we're supposed to meet him at or something.

547
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,890
That issue has been raised before.

548
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,430
Every goddamn issue has been raised.

549
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,170
Every possibility.

550
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,210
Maybe they went to the original landing site in Brentwood.

551
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,390
Okay, Stang, we figured out a problem.

552
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:04,590
No, no.

553
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,650
It was never geocentric.

554
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:12,630
You could be anywhere you had your membership card in your pocket.

555
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,430
Maybe we're on the wrong Earth.

556
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,150
I do still think that.

557
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,570
I still have my membership card.

558
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:23,370
Oh, that whole, yeah, now that rant is starting to come back to me, but it sounds stupid now.

559
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,150
It was like, we're on a spaceship.

560
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,410
We have to clean up the spaceship we're on.

561
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:34,510
And we did that rant in 1998, 99.

562
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,370
It sounded so brilliant last night.

563
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,150
Yeah, well, that was last night.

564
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,630
In the cold, harsh light of day.

565
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,850
Oh, my God.

566
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,870
They call us a gut bag.

567
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,790
Oh, that's no.

568
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,650
No, no, they call you a gut bag.

569
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,830
Oh, I'm sorry.

570
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:56,630
No, I, you weren't, I didn't, that slipped of the tongue.

571
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,890
I'm going into the six knuckle for that one.

572
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,490
Oh, no.

573
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,630
Oh, my God.

574
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,830
Who's next?

575
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:11,690
So, the gathered subgeniuses now have these long plastic arm gloves for.

576
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,390
It's a cleaning kit.

577
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,690
We're going to clean you.

578
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:14,810
Okay.

579
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,270
It's a cleaning kit for, I think these are for large animals.

580
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,290
Yeah, it's for pulling a stillborn calf out of a cow.

581
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,790
I've seen my brother do that, actually.

582
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,990
I've seen my brother with his arm all the way up an unculate.

583
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,810
Did you notice this?

584
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,610
Oh, that's for me, is it?

585
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:32,990
That's for you.

586
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:33,250
That's the pressure.

587
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,110
That's the cartoon for me.

588
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,830
So, you guys are all gloving up for me, right?

589
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,570
From that cartoon, the medical experiment.

590
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:41,930
What?

591
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:42,330
Look.

592
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,330
I'm not Bob.

593
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,230
I didn't take the memo.

594
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,970
I'm not the exus.

595
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,170
You guys know that.

596
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,650
We've been through this.

597
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,850
I've been dunked already.

598
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:52,370
Wow.

599
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:52,810
That's very clingy.

600
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,890
I've been lynched two or three times.

601
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,390
Show the camera your cleaning kit label.

602
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,450
Your arm will end up your ass all the way to the elbow.

603
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:08,870
Cleaning out my inner bowel won't change the fate of the earth, I'm pretty sure.

604
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,070


605
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,370
No, but it could be amusing.

606
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,550
Yeah, right.

607
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,310
It might make you feel better.

608
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,310


609
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,310


610
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,310


611
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,310


612
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,310


613
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,310


614
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,310


615
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,010
You feel better.

616
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:13,550
Come next.

617
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,590
Just keep looking.

618
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,710
It's up there somewhere.

619
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,350
Dig a little deeper.

620
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:18,810
Yeah, yeah.

621
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,450
It's Philo.

622
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,050
Philo's the one that knows Bob.

623
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,130
Just keep looking.

624
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,550
I know he's up there.

625
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,590
You're the one that handed me that memo.

626
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,330
He was, it started, it was his fault.

627
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,450
It really was.

628
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,210
You would have said so right in that movie.

629
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,110
I didn't realize you could do that.

630
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:34,730
If you come off.

631
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:35,630
Ouch.

632
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,450
Let's make dinner.

633
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,910
Who's ready for breakfast?

634
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,290
I'm ready.

635
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,290


636
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,290


637
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,290


638
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,290


639
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,290


640
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,290


641
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,290


642
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,290


643
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,290


644
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,290


645
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,130
Mealtime is just a minute away.

646
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,630
Where's that big old hog we're going to slaughter for bacon?

647
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:55,490
I need a, I'll just rub its ass and throw it on the fire and go to town.

648
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,590
Or go to bed.

649
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,850
Turn over and go back to bed.

650
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,550
Who wants to go to bed now?

651
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,830
I drank all that coffee for nothing.

652
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,370
Murdered it again.

653
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,250
I ain't telling them I pulled this out.

654
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,970
I'm going to come with it.

655
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:10,750
Say what?

656
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,110
I ain't telling them I pulled my hands out.

657
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,830
The world ain't going to come with it.

658
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,170
Yeah.

659
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,410
That's what, that extra detritus up there.

660
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:25,310
Well, thank you all for having the faith, suckers, to get up in the morning and, six

661
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,050
in the morning and come down here.

662
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:33,330
To be disappointed by man yet again, Reverend Stang.

663
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,030
Well, it just.

664
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,710
Tell my mom I do have faith.

665
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:37,970
See?

666
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,750
What?

667
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,650
I got to hand it to you.

668
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,650
That's a good balloon.

669
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,290
He's got a faith that's strong.

670
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,790
Strong enough to fit on.

671
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:44,390
Yeah.

672
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,250
As long as I've got a face, you've got a place.

673
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,650
There but.

674
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:51,750
There.

675
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,830
Well, that's the safest sex of all.

676
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,770
No, that's okay.

677
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,270
My turn.

678
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,550
Turn your head and cough.

679
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,750
Yeah.

680
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,790
It's so sad.

681
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,890
It's 7.05.

682
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,670
5 a.m.

683
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,970
And now it's July 5th.

684
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:18,450
And the subgenius has turned to plastic covered safe sex.

685
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,050
We are a little gutsy.

686
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:23,270
We're supposed to have those full body condoms.

687
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,710
Well, they did that.

688
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,330
That was, um.

689
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:26,870
Yeah, but it's not big enough.

690
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,370
The naked, the naked gun.

691
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,290
Yeah.

692
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,030
The smell of fear.

693
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:32,970
Hmm.

694
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,390
Smells like fear in here.

695
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,290
I think they'll never.

696
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,890
Smells like disappointment.

697
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,210
I lose my touch.

698
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,870
Smells like anguish.

699
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:41,870


700
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:41,870


701
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:41,870


702
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:41,870


703
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:41,870


704
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:41,870


705
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:42,870
And hopelessness.

706
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,130
Oh, it smells like teen spirit.

707
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,250
I don't even smell a froth.

708
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:48,910
I got it on top of my head.

709
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,410
Clamished with some little plastic widget-y thing.

710
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,310
Well, the excess didn't come.

711
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,430
Instead I had to like line up like a fucking goat.

712
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,150
Where's the booze and heroin?

713
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:00,730
They're on the sauce.

714
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,830
And antidepressants.

715
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,670
Time to go down.

716
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,950
We have to go on harder and harder drugs.

717
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,350
Every year you fail us, Tang.

718
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,270
We don't have anything left.

719
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:11,750
You're welcome.

720
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:11,850
I'm sorry.

721
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,850


722
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,850


723
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,850


724
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,850


725
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,850


726
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,850


727
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,850


728
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,850


729
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,850


730
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,850


731
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,850


732
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,630
Actually you're right.

733
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,330
We need something stronger than roofies.

734
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,770
Because the ones I took 20 minutes ago aren't working at all.

735
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,750
I'm just kidding.

736
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,090
I didn't really take them 20 minutes ago.

737
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:28,990
My God.

738
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:29,990
Thank you.

739
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,710
Oh, yeah.

740
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,310
You're talking about Peter Sellers, yeah?

741
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,170
Hmm?

742
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,650
Anything stronger now we got to grind up Keith Richards.

743
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,070
You have a nice one.

744
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,810
Well, there is that.

745
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,210
You have a nice one.

746
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:41,210


747
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:41,370
I'm going to go with the one that's a little bit more.

748
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:41,470


749
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:41,470


750
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:41,470


751
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:41,470


752
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:47,230
I've got a little bit of lunk left over from legume and chas.

753
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:53,990
We do have little scrapings from legumes' lungs that help us forget.

754
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,390
It would probably give us whatever he had.

755
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,870
Got a little bit of chas lunk.

756
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:02,950
No.

757
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,070
Some heathen lunk.

758
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:04,390
No.

759
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,510
No.

760
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,430
Those guys are already there.

761
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,670
They're on the saucers.

762
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,730
Dr. Dart.

763
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,450
Dr. Dart.

764
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,270
Well, he didn't frog.

765
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,990
I don't care for his lunk.

766
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,190
Lunk.

767
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:17,930
Lung junk.

768
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,070
It's the stuff they scrape out of subgenius lungs when you die.

769
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,850
It's pretty strong stuff.

770
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,290
Come on.

771
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,230
Blow on it, girl.

772
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,050
Susie, come on now.

773
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,010
You can blow better than that.

774
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,190
Well, that's what everyone's heard.

775
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,470
That's what I read on that bathroom wall.

776
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:38,870
Okay.

777
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,390
If the new Bobby here is going to show up and go, mm, good job.

778
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:46,410
For a good time called WREK Atlanta.

779
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,370
That's for that five packers.

780
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,950
Bob's Slut Time Funhouse.

781
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:50,570
Yeah.

782
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,730
Four and out.

783
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,950
You guys are just trying to make me feel jealous.

784
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,870
I did have.

785
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,370
I did have.

786
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:01,730
Look, okay.

787
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,910
Here's the Church of the Subgenius, friends.

788
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,590
This is what we're reduced to.

789
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:06,810
Reduced to?

790
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:10,630
Fake dicks made of blown up camel delivering hands.

791
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:11,370
We are ascendant.

792
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:11,370


793
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:11,370


794
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:11,370


795
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:11,370


796
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:11,370


797
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:11,370


798
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,830
Not even realistic dicks.

799
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:13,030
Let's be gone.

800
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,550
Let's leave.

801
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,550
Let me to your tranny, man.

802
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,090
It's okay, Tori.

803
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,130
You didn't miss a thing.

804
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,050
Oh, I was here.

805
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,770
Oh, were you?

806
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,650
She was here.

807
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,030
Yep.

808
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,610
She was here.

809
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,890
Yeah, I was the only one that wasn't.

810
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,610
Once again, you didn't miss anything.

811
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,270
Sorry.

812
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,070
Tori was the only one they took.

813
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:27,790
They just sent her back.

814
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:29,690
They didn't kill her.

815
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:29,830
They didn't kill her.

816
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,070
Stank fucked us all.

817
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,030
Again.

818
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:33,870
I wish.

819
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,310
I don't remember that.

820
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,190
Wouldn't that be nice?

821
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,630
Wouldn't that be fun?

822
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,390
Right?

823
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,470
No.

824
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,210
No.

825
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:40,450
No.

826
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:40,850
No.

827
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,070
No.

828
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:41,370


829
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,670
I was hoping.

830
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,110
I feel just as fucked as anybody.

831
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,050
Possibly more.

832
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:48,310
Why, Lo?

833
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,610
Come here, Stan.

834
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,310
Bob couldn't have let us.

835
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:55,350
Could a preacher be wrong or lie?

836
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,350
A preacher can't.

837
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,370
Would a salesman lie or be wrong?

838
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,630
Well, that's different.

839
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,370
That's different.

840
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,270
I remember those days.

841
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,930
I feel like a teenager again.

842
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,350
It's been a long time.

843
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:11,350


844
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:11,350


845
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:11,350


846
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:11,350


847
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:11,350


848
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:11,350


849
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:22,110
Bob said, why tell the mundane truth when a creative lie is so much more entertaining?

850
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,690
Yeah, well, what's the creative lie?

851
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,850
Because I'm really tired of the mundane truth.

852
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,070
Yeah.

853
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,490
We've been getting that up the butt for a long time now.

854
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,690
Well, it was funny 25 years ago.

855
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,310
Just grab your ankles and learn to enjoy the ride.

856
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,850
Bag bomb.

857
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,650
I'd have to be getting retreaded every month.

858
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,350
I know.

859
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:41,350


860
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,050
I'm getting retreaded every month, too.

861
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,050


862
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,330
Okay, time for breakfast, everyone.

863
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,090
It's cool, man.

864
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,230
Is there a pancake breakfast somewhere?

865
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,010
What was that old song?

866
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,230
Welcome to the camp.

867
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,530
I'm glad that you all heeded Bob's call.

868
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:04,230
My name is Ivan and I own the Trademarks all.

869
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:09,370
If you want to copy Bob, you'll have to cut my balls.

870
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,330
So, pull down your panties and cut my balls.

871
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:11,330


872
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:11,330


873
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:11,330


874
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:11,330


875
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:11,330


876
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:11,330


877
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:11,330


878
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,150
If you want your pants in, pull out your wallet.

879
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,570
You cannot escape Bob's thrall, ban...

880
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,950
We're not going to take it.

881
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:22,850
Duh!

882
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,730
Nobody...

883
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,930
What are you going to do with this chorus, you know?

884
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,090
We're not going to take it.

885
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,370
I've given you the opening, okay?

886
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,190
We're not going to take it.

887
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,050
Okay.

888
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,590
Okay.

889
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:41,210
Stank's been raped and dumped and flumped and everything.

890
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:41,310


891
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,710
Okay, now we can have breakfast, right?

892
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:48,190
Scrambled eggs, hard-boiled eggs, toast.

893
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:53,270
Scrambled eggs is a working word for yesterday until he came up with three syllables.

894
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,310
Scrambled eggs.

895
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,710
Continental breakfast.

896
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:04,170
A little bowl of cornflakes in a box that you pour milk into the box.

897
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,490
With the wine from Mr. Sister?

898
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,850
Yeah, right.

899
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,790
That's what we get for 7 a.m.

900
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,650
We all stayed up.

901
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,390
So we get a little cardboard box full of cornflakes.

902
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:18,990
You rip the box open and pour in Mr. Sister's hot wine.

903
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,570
From leftover from yesterday.

904
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,070
Hot wine.

905
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:22,670
That's it.

906
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,530
You've got the Kool-Aid.

907
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:24,190
That's the problem.

908
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:25,790
Hot wine.

909
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,110
You've got to put a newspaper in there.

910
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,690
Oh, I remember years when we had the tub of Kool-Aid.

911
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,890
Poor old Friday Jones stirring that tub of Kool-Aid.

912
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,510
That great big bin.

913
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,990
Waiting for us to show up.

914
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,390
Yeah, that's exactly.

915
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:42,770
That's me.

916
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,630
There you go.

917
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,850
It's a time lapse.

918
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,950
It's X day.

919
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,990
The church of the subgenius slowly just...

920
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,830
It wilts away.

921
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,490
Tentacles all sagging.

922
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,810
All deflated.

923
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,090
Kiss me, Mr. Kool-Aid.

924
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:13,330
It's only time every 7.15 I get to have some kind of sex with Susie.

925
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,670
Through plastic.

926
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,950
Some kind of sex.

927
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,130
Yeah, some kind of.

928
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,330
Some horrible.

929
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,370
Some kind of sex.

930
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:19,950
That's the closest.

931
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:20,790
Some kind of sex.

932
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,650
That's the closest we get to the escape vessels.

933
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,490
Passenger.

934
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,310
Plastic tentacles.

935
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,070
Oh.

936
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,550
Wait, look.

937
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,550
We're all in this together, folks.

938
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,110
I'm.

939
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,110


940
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,050
Unfortunately.

941
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:39,850
Yeah.

942
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,890
To shake hands with the exit.

943
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,330
Yeah.

944
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:42,910
To where they are.

945
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,450
All of us reaching up.

946
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,030
Reaching up to the sky.

947
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:46,410
Yeah.

948
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,410
Why everybody say up?

949
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,270
Everybody looks up.

950
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,270
All the way up to Uranus.

951
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,070
How do we know they're not going to come out from underground like the Martians?

952
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,450
The Spielberg War of the world.

953
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,210
Flying saucers.

954
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,610
And flying saucers don't fly through the ground.

955
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,550
That's like totally.

956
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,530
People don't even think about it.

957
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,850
Those are digging saucers.

958
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,490
That's like ducks flying.

959
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:06,890
You know.

960
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,550
Crawling under the ground.

961
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,310
They don't talk about digging saucers.

962
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:09,810
Yeah.

963
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:12,190
They fly through the hollow earth and then come up through the ground.

964
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,670
So complicated, though.

965
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,390
Yeah, it should be simple.

966
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:17,450
Yeah.

967
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,150
What the lasers are for.

968
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,950
But we're the ones that are simple.

969
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,310
Like that fellow.

970
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,670
That fellow is simple.

971
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:29,630
He is a simple fellow of unassuming mean.

972
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,110
Which one?

973
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,870
The one with the hat with the cup on his hat.

974
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:34,650
All those guys.

975
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,750
Everybody who got up at 7am.

976
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,810
Or the one with the duck on his head.

977
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,170
Or the one with the pipes up his, you know.

978
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,070
You know.

979
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,050
Hey.

980
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,150
You know.

981
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:45,810
Fundaments.

982
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,850
The one with the glow sticks.

983
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:53,150
There's a slowly deflighting air mattress waiting for us, dear.

984
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,770
Oh, is that what you're going to escape on?

985
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,930
Yeah, that's our flying carpet.

986
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,370
A deflated air mattress.

987
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,770
With a leak.

988
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,390
Deflate your mouth.

989
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,350
Oh, that's a good one.

990
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:06,710
Yeah.

991
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,150
I don't even remember what that's like anymore.

992
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:09,630
There.

993
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,490
So many, so many X days.

994
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,010
Next year, Adwisteria.

995
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,250
More tickets?

996
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,390
Well, we remember the red tickets.

997
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:23,910
No, no.

998
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,370
Forget the green tickets.

999
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,010
It was the red tickets.

1000
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,210
You reckon that'll do it?

1001
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:28,930
We didn't have enough?

1002
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,690
I mean, you know, I'll sell you more tickets right now.

1003
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:31,970
Anybody.

1004
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,350
Five dollars a ticket.

1005
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,030
Right now.

1006
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,510
Oh, great.

1007
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,090
Now the scalpers come out.

1008
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,630
Oh, we have to unite us as drugs.

1009
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:40,950
That'll work.

1010
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:41,390
Okay.

1011
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,110
Yeah, no.

1012
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,970
Yeah, hey.

1013
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,970
Things are, it's not all bad.

1014
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,110
Fuck yeah.

1015
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:48,870
Yeah.

1016
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:52,530
Where's that heroin and roofies?

1017
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,470
I want to just.

1018
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,690
Stark and a reversal.

1019
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:01,970
I just want to go home and get my finger licked by my dog.

1020
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,170
Potatoes.

1021
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,010
Potatoes.

1022
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,670
What a bitch.

1023
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,990
I guess he had the right idea.

1024
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,250
Well, let's shuffle on away, dear.

1025
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:17,610
Once again, another X day.

1026
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,530
This just looks like the scene in that movie.

1027
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,690
There's Princess Weave smiling, looking beautiful.

1028
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,370
Me in this stupid shirt.

1029
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,610
Reverend Bunny made.

1030
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,370
Everybody sadly trudging away.

1031
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:35,390
I'm on the road.

1032
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,170
Film seven.

1033
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:41,230
You made a shit hole out of heaven.

1034
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,670
I think it's all insanity.

1035
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:48,650
It's just a stark fist of reality.

1036
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,330
Yeah.

1037
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,150
Nice.

1038
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,090
Stark fist of reality.

1039
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,070
Yeah.

1040
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,910
You were full of songs yesterday.

1041
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,610
Really?

1042
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,250
I was full of something yesterday.

1043
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,810
I think it was frat, but.

1044
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:04,010
Princess Weave and I have certainly been filking lately.

1045
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,330
Yeah.

1046
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:06,550
Yeah.

1047
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,750
When is that performance going to take place?

1048
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,090
Huh?

1049
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,510
When is that performance going to take place?

1050
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:11,950
What, Buddy?

1051
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:12,910
Yes.

1052
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,890
No, next year.

1053
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:14,410
Oh.

1054
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:14,790
Buddy.

1055
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,390
Yeah.

1056
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,190
It's not ready to be launched.

1057
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:17,490
No.

1058
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,990
We have to train the orchestra.

1059
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:23,610
Going to launch Buddy?

1060
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,190
I think I did.

1061
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,890
Rock opera.

1062
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,870
Pop, pop, pop.

1063
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,330
Pop rock opera.

1064
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,110
Pop rock opera?

1065
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,990
Rock, rock dog opera.

1066
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:33,990


1067
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:33,990


1068
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:33,990


1069
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:33,990


1070
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:33,990


1071
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:33,990


1072
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:33,990


1073
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:33,990


1074
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:33,990


1075
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:34,930
Pop rock opera.

1076
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:35,470
Yeah.

1077
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,370
F-rock, rock, rock, rock.

1078
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:36,450
Rock opera.

1079
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:36,870
F-rock, rock, rock, rock.

1080
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,870


1081
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,270
Oh, there you go.

1082
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:39,630
Okay.

1083
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,750
F-rock, rock opera.

1084
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,570
Phantom of the F-rock opera.

1085
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,910
There's a new, our new Hollywood movie.

1086
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,330
Phantom of the F-rock opera.

1087
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:54,430
Oh, come on, oh no, we'll just trudge back to the car.

1088
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:59,530
Another July Fifth, trudging back to the van.

1089
00:42:59,530 --> 00:42:59,810
and...

1090
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,030
Ugh.

1091
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:02,450
Phooey.

1092
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,050
Another two hours of show

1093
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,310
where we bitch and gripe and whine

1094
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,390
and come up with excuses.

1095
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:12,770
Excuses.

1096
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:13,770
Excuses.

1097
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:14,430
Excuses.

1098
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:27,590
That's life!

1099
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,070
That's life!

1100
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,790
That's what all the people say.

1101
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:36,310
You're riding high in April,

1102
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,730
shot down in May.

1103
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,770
But I know I'm gonna change that tune.

1104
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,870
When I'm back on top,

1105
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:49,850
back on top in June,

1106
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,050
I said that's life!

1107
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,070
That's life!

1108
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,570
And as funny as it sounds,

1109
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,150
it may seem,

1110
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,810
some people get their kicks

1111
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,310
stomping on a dream.

1112
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,610
But I don't let it,

1113
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,350
let it get me down.

1114
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,850
Cause this fine old world,

1115
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,010
it keeps spinning around.

1116
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:21,610
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet,

1117
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:23,970
a pawn and a king.

1118
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,270
I've been up and down and over,

1119
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:27,930
and out.

1120
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,130
And I know one thing.

1121
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,790
Each time I find myself

1122
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,550
flat on my face,

1123
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:43,250
I pick myself up and get back in the race.

1124
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:44,750
That's life!

1125
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,210
That's life!

1126
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:49,230
I tell you, I can't deny it.

1127
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:52,870
I thought of quitting, baby.

1128
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,730
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it.

1129
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,250
I thought of quitting, baby. But my heart just ain't gonna buy it.

1130
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:01,070
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try,

1131
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:05,190
I'd jump right on a big bird,

1132
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,010
and then I'd fly.

1133
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:13,130
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet,

1134
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,330
a pawn and a king.

1135
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,330
I've been up and down and over, and out.

1136
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,450
And I know one thing.

1137
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,890
Each time I find myself

1138
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:25,930
playing,

1139
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,750
flat on my face,

1140
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:34,630
I just pick myself up and get back in the race.

1141
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,030
That's life!

1142
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,370
That's life!

1143
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:38,050
That's life!

1144
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,650
And I can't deny it.

1145
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,150
Many times,

1146
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:47,110
I thought of cutting out, but my heart won't buy it.

1147
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:51,690
But if there's nothing shaking, come this here July.

1148
00:45:54,570 --> 00:46:00,470
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball.

1149
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:08,110
And I'm...

1150
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,610
My, my...

1151
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,830
My...

1152
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:37,930
And this is

1153
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,710
Subgenius Radio ministry hour of slack

1154
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,190
at Stately Fossil House on

1155
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:53,610
lovely Stang Ranch in bucolic Glen Rose, Texas. P.O. Box 807-76043. And it just now suddenly

1156
00:46:53,610 --> 00:47:01,510
occurred to me that this month, so-called January of so-called 2020, is in fact the 40th anniversary

1157
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:08,410
of the public outreach of the Church of the Subgenius. Bob was immaculated by Jehovah One

1158
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:14,530
in 1953, and that's when the church really began, but it was kept pretty much undercover until Bob

1159
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:20,550
authorized Dr. Philo Drummond and myself to publish Subgenius Pamphlet Number One,

1160
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:30,190
which we picked up from the printer on January 2nd of 1980. 40 damn years! And you can hear it

1161
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:35,810
in my voice. A good thing they made that movie when they did. Incidentally, I believe they've

1162
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,390
got a distribution deal now, so soon we'll be seeing...

1163
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:44,370
J.R. Bob Dobson, the Church of the Subgenius, on screens everywhere, or at least somewhere.

1164
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:54,110
It's really good, too. Anyway, yep, 40 years! Hell, I've stood there waiting for the saucers at 7 a.m.

1165
00:47:55,170 --> 00:48:04,170
24 July 5th. The late Dr. Dark was with me for 22 of them. Dr. Howell and Reverend Susie the Fluesy

1166
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:08,290
were there for most of them. And Dr. Howell's still...

1167
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:14,750
there in this tinny, heavily filtered recording with Philo Drummond and the mysterious reverend

1168
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:21,110
known as X from July 3rd, although they sound more like it's July 5th at about 8 a.m.

1169
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:36,670
Back to Centerville, Ohio, where the tall corn grows. Birthplace of Brick Burnside.

1170
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,910
All-American Goofy.

1171
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:44,490
Notional Pre-Record Radio. Please pledge.

1172
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:48,390
Pledge your break now.

1173
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:54,410
Just one dollar. One dollar, you can make a difference in this child's life.

1174
00:48:55,030 --> 00:49:04,550
Yes, little Timmy Pibber, age 19, has never owned a set of electric trains. But you can make up this difference.

1175
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:08,070
Your contribution will be...

1176
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:29,610
immeasurable help in changing his life from one who never enjoyed this pleasure of childhood to one more adjusted and able to face a brighter tomorrow because of his knowledge of, nay, obsession with switches, track coupling controls, and rolling stock.

1177
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:31,790
Yes, rolling stock.

1178
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:35,190
Then there's his stamp collection, but I won't go on.

1179
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:38,390
It's important to have a...

1180
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,670
hobby. Join a church group. Help others.

1181
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,610
Don't just sit at home twiddling your thumbs.

1182
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:46,730
I tried, Hob.

1183
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:48,090
Come hear the music play.

1184
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:51,010
Hobbies just didn't seem to work for me.

1185
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:56,530
You know, there was this time I took up knife throwing, and...

1186
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:01,370
At Hobby Empire, you can make an entire castle out of old popsicle sticks.

1187
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,390
It's easy and fun.

1188
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,110
We'll take up all your spare time.

1189
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,630
Give you that...

1190
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:09,750
and a strange feeling of pride.

1191
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:16,230
But luckily, the prosecuting attorney wasn't mad at me for impaling his wife.

1192
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:21,570
Having a machine gun in your backyard is no crime, at least not today.

1193
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:29,190
And so I think none of us were surprised when the favorable verdict was reached in that case.

1194
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:31,830
Four dead...

1195
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,710
in one little town.

1196
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,290
Also an ornamental pond.

1197
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,690
Full of goldfish.

1198
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,190
Although it does tend to attract Brer Raccoon and his minions.

1199
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:51,590
In addition to a water feature, your backyard retreat can...

1200
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:51,870
Have come.

1201
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:56,090
...be graced by a miniature Greek temple.

1202
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:58,710
Temple.

1203
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:02,190
Yes, it'll hardly cost you anything. Just leave it to me.

1204
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:08,170
And we'll have it all there, all set up and in the ground before St. Swithin's.

1205
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:08,430
Day.

1206
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:10,870
I won't remember.

1207
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:14,530
You're the guy, you're the guy, you're the guy that, uh, took my Wanda.

1208
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,770
Well, I just want to thank you for that.

1209
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:19,170
I'll wander as I wander.

1210
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:21,710
I don't think you wandered his little sister.

1211
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:23,770
Uh, a fish.

1212
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,930
I was dead.

1213
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,570
And, and what are you up to, Philo?

1214
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,590
Are you, uh, know any good ones?

1215
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,470
Uh, of course, uh...

1216
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:34,650
Uh...

1217
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:35,970
Uh...

1218
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:38,150
Uh...

1219
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:39,250
We all grew up with...

1220
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:39,390
Music.

1221
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:43,150
To soothe the savage beast.

1222
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,790
Wrestling Women Versus the Aztec Mummy.

1223
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,110
A K. Gordon Murray production.

1224
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,490
Ting-Kong. Watch it again.

1225
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,330
There is, uh...

1226
00:51:58,330 --> 00:51:59,950
You'll see some Murray.

1227
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:05,610
There is a shape-shifting Aztec mummy involved in this motion picture.

1228
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,170
And our...

1229
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:16,030
Well-endowed female, uh, wrestlers, the luchadores, uh, take on, uh, the mummy and not only that,

1230
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:22,870
uh, a robot and other antagonists which, uh, make life a challenge for them in historic

1231
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,230
old Mexico.

1232
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:29,870
In addition, the mummy is able to change its molecular structure and can even appear as

1233
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:34,590
a tarantula or, and other unlikely products of metamorphosis.

1234
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,050
Oh, your imagination.

1235
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,490
No, it's all in the movie.

1236
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:42,570
In the Wrestling Women Versus the Aztec Mummy.

1237
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:43,410
Wow.

1238
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,210
A K. Gordon Murray production.

1239
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,630
I bet you've seen it, Philo.

1240
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,550
Haven't you seen that one?

1241
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:48,110
You've seen that one?

1242
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:49,130
Yeah, I've got a copy of that one.

1243
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:49,670
He's got it.

1244
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:50,770
He's got that movie.

1245
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:51,570
It's easy.

1246
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:52,990
It's the movie I'm talking about.

1247
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:55,990
I'm sort of a movie collector and I like weird, obscure stuff.

1248
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,210
He actually has a copy of Wrestling Women Versus the Aztec Mummy.

1249
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:59,910
It's in my left eyebrow now.

1250
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:00,550
Hmm.

1251
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:05,410
Now, it's been stored in nano-modules in your cellular structure.

1252
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:06,030
Uh-huh.

1253
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,030


1254
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,030


1255
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,030


1256
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,030


1257
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,030


1258
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,030


1259
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,550
That's right.

1260
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:09,410
You can do this too at home in your spare time.

1261
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:12,510
Have your eyeball outfitted as a projector.

1262
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:18,090
And then you can serve projectile outfitters?

1263
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:25,730
In the new miracle of the screen, SenseAround, Todd AO, CinemaScope, VistaVision.

1264
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,790
There's nothing else out there.

1265
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,810
Now in the splendor of giant Panimation.

1266
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:35,610
Dynimation 90.

1267
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:36,010
The new Panimation.

1268
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:36,010


1269
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,230
The new miracle of the screen.

1270
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:38,930
Don't open the door.

1271
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:40,190
Regiscope.

1272
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,110
Don't christen the baby.

1273
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:44,390
Don't go in the basement.

1274
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,630
Don't do anything.

1275
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:48,570
No.

1276
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,710
You've got to do something.

1277
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:56,530
If you can only do one thing to do, one thing today, you should do it.

1278
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:02,590
And if you can't do one thing today, well then you're pretty damn lazy.

1279
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:03,910
That's what I gotta say.

1280
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:04,430
You just not.

1281
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,070
You gotta.

1282
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:05,910
Nonsense.

1283
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:07,530
There's always something you can do.

1284
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:11,370
And just think of the physical accomplishment that you will feel.

1285
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:14,670
Yes, you will beam with pride.

1286
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:20,910
Your chest will swell and expand as you consider how you made a difference this one day of

1287
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:21,130
day.

1288
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:26,430
Of light will fill your head as you remember you've been spread.

1289
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:29,230
A corona of light.

1290
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:30,990
That all the doctors this world's ever known.

1291
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:31,330
Heroes.

1292
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:34,390
Halo will play over your brow.

1293
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:34,890
When?

1294
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,950
When this procedure has been completed.

1295
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,750
Somebody.

1296
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:42,930
Who is that?

1297
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,990
Do you see that mixer in front of you?

1298
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:45,630
I do.

1299
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:46,670
Some of those.

1300
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:47,810
Those are the ones.

1301
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,150
Yeah.

1302
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:48,810
Let's see it.

1303
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:50,910
There.

1304
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:51,350
That one.

1305
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,470
That was the one I think.

1306
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,590
So you're cutting down the.

1307
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:55,010
So.

1308
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:55,850
Yeah.

1309
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:56,370
Echo.

1310
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,370
Say something.

1311
00:54:58,910 --> 00:54:59,390
Echo.

1312
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:00,150
No.

1313
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,130
You're great.

1314
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:02,710
You're fine there.

1315
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:03,210
Echo.

1316
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:03,830
Echo.

1317
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:04,390
Yes.

1318
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:04,810
That.

1319
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:05,050
That.

1320
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:05,050


1321
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:05,050


1322
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:05,050


1323
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:08,190
That reverberation was an Ivanstang artifact.

1324
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:12,430
He just left it there cause he's so deaf he didn't hear himself...

1325
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:12,830
Right, but we heard it.

1326
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,030
So it was like turning it up.

1327
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:14,490
Yeah.

1328
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,810
We're always too loud he's never loud enough.

1329
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,370
Said the deaf man.

1330
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:19,990
To Evanstang?

1331
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,470
Then he said, I can't get no poontang.

1332
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,370
What's that joke?

1333
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:25,810
Oh, yeah.

1334
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:29,430
How come farts stink?

1335
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:31,030
How come?

1336
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:34,370
So deaf people can enjoy them too?

1337
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,030
Yeah.

1338
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,930
I thought I was sad because I had no feet.

1339
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:45,390
Then I met a man who had no frop.

1340
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:47,630
Oh, that's terrible.

1341
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,550
I thought I was sad because I had no feet.

1342
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,450
Until I met a man that had no body.

1343
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:55,010
Nobody.

1344
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:56,970
Well, he should have been sad.

1345
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:59,670
Everybody needs to have somebody.

1346
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:05,190
And there's nothing attached to me.

1347
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:06,810
Yeah.

1348
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,050
I'm just a discorporated entity.

1349
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:18,090
As free as a discorporated entity can be.

1350
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:21,470
I can do it.

1351
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,270
Do it to me.

1352
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:28,850
I don't exist in reality.

1353
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:29,650
There's no body.

1354
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,510
Attached to me.

1355
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:36,410
No equations apply to me.

1356
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:42,130
So you really just want to keep on doing nonstop show 24 hours a day?

1357
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:44,770
No, I'm about ready to hang it up for today.

1358
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:47,990
Stang has abandoned his post.

1359
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,790
Stang's abandoned his post.

1360
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:54,930
He's no longer radio show, Carson's radio show host.

1361
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:57,250
Longer than an hour, less than a show.

1362
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,530
And then Stang said,

1363
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,270
Yes, Stang did that.

1364
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:03,670
And Stang said,

1365
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:06,490
And then Stang said this.

1366
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,550
And Stang said that.

1367
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,870
And the waters he called rain.

1368
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,010
And then he parted the sea.

1369
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:14,950
And the land he called the driveway.

1370
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:18,830
And all the Hebrews stepped forth.

1371
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:20,890
And they came out burning.

1372
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:24,750
And it was hotter and hotter and hotter.

1373
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,150
And I reached out.

1374
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:29,190
And as I reached out, the flames shattered.

1375
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:30,570
And I was falling.

1376
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:32,550
I was falling into the void.

1377
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:33,890
Into the void.

1378
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:34,970
Into the void.

1379
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:39,450
Well, do you have a history of this in your family?

1380
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:40,890
Void where prohibited.

1381
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:43,810
Officer, I was just doing what the sign said.

1382
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:45,430
The sign said void where prohibited.

1383
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,170
Well, if you voided something,

1384
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:53,130
you should have voided it where they are less uninhibited.

1385
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,950
But I'm a inhibited man.

1386
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:24,910
I'm a inhibited man.

1387
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:25,070
I'm Bob.

1388
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:26,950
Let Bob be praised.

1389
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:28,110
And good night.

1390
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:41,250
Oh, and now that the red broadcast light is off,

1391
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:46,450
the big membership pack is $35 plus postage.

1392
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:48,710
And no, it's not just a bunch of stickers.

1393
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:52,350
Just reading the first few booklets will take you weeks.

1394
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,050
And you might not ever finish reading them.

1395
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:56,650
Because for some people, they just keep going on and on,

1396
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,450
changing each time you pick it up.

1397
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:03,550
And of course, there are also stickers and decoder pins and posters

1398
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:08,630
and extremely official looking, densely torrid documents,

1399
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:10,590
frameable documents.

1400
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:13,150
And you really do become an ordained minister

1401
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:16,870
who can perform marriages and have a funny special title

1402
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:18,450
and name of your own choosing.

1403
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,790
And you get access to the secrets.

1404
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:23,690
And...

1405
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:26,990
And I'll be able to see you next X Day, 23 X Day,

1406
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,290
this June 30th through July 5th,

1407
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:31,550
again at Wisteria in Southern Ohio.

1408
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:36,470
See the events section in subgenius.com for details

1409
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:40,450
and lots of photo essays on the old school X Day drills

1410
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,470
before cell phones,

1411
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:47,070
when a lot of the ladies and gents were younger and cuter

1412
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:49,450
and would take off all their clothes.

1413
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:53,570
For some reason, once everybody had a phone camera,

1414
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,550
and their grannies all got on the internet too,

1415
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:59,790
well, you don't see as much nakedity

1416
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,970
as we did back around the turn of the century.

1417
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:04,350
Heck, at Starwood Festival,

1418
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:07,690
which still follows X Day in the same place,

1419
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:11,770
I've had to step over couples copulating in the dark

1420
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:16,370
just outside the crazed ritual caveman bonfire

1421
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,170
drumming and dancing circle.

1422
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,170
Ah, them was the days.

1423
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:23,610
Back before all this internet hooves,

1424
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,330
we were in the end of privacy.

1425
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:27,490
Oh, well.

1426
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,710
Hurry up, X Day.

1427
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,450
We want to get off.

1428
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:37,110
And now back to these Captain Beefheart instrumentals.

1429
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:39,850
Praise beef.
