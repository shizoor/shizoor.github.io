1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,120
The Power of Swag

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,120


3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,740
Yeah?

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,660
The numbers all go to 11.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,380
Right across the board.

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,000
11, 11, 11...

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,600
Amps go up to 10.

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,100
Exactly.

9
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,780
You see, most blokes are gonna be playing at 10.

10
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,220
You're on 10 on your guitar.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,620
Where can you go from there?

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,380
Where?

13
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,180
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

14
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,560
I'm free.

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,200
Don't worry, dear.

16
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,400
I suppose worse things happen.

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,200
Aye, but not much worse.

18
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,320
If only we could get inside that special prime.

19
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,120
Come.

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,020
Come.

21
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,040
I will show you wonders you have never seen before.

22
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,340
Gee.

23
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,460
11.

24
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,460
I don't know whether I'm awake or dreaming.

25
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,000
My mind just won't accept.

26
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,660
But Albert...

27
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,920
What about Albert?

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,820
From PR News in Washington, I'm PR's moron.

29
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,200
President Donald Trump is back on the state-sponsored terrorism list.

30
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,660
The military seized control last Wednesday and placed Trump under house arrest.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,900
And the President is hoping more PR news are expected to be announced soon.

32
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,980
Trump is showing no sign of voluntarily stepping down as President.

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,200
Like Chico and the man.

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,600
So many people are saying, well, that had better be the case.

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,640
The White House is indicating that this is a lie.

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,060
What I do know is the majority30lation of press will feel fear of Ace all over Twitter watching this...

37
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,060


38
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:35,440
PR News, friends, is always by Fernanda Nande, Lee Murrow, and so are our titles generally.

39
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:47,620
Read up on the personal events of two guests in the new year 2021 The gendered ladies on Facebook

40
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,260
and Twitter stuffë¦¬

41
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,640
acag.com

42
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Heinz

43
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,420
Thank you.

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,580
Thank you.

45
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,960
Thank you.

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,260
Thank you.

47
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,600
Thank you.

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,220
Ah, yes, dear friends, and that was the Rudy Schwartz Project.

49
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,380
And welcome to Hour of Slack number 1076.

50
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,100
No, 77. 1077.

51
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,580
1,677.

52
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,180
By golly, we'll get it right, given time.

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
And here's a rat.

54
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,100
With some music in the background by...

55
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,240
Spongle.

56
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,160
This is a rat not by me, but by Reverend Eddie Romanoff,

57
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:37,320
who may be a relative, because I am the last remaining heir to the Romanoff throne.

58
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,540
I hope he and I don't have to fight about that.

59
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,020
Anyway, he's a contributor to the Scrub Genius Forum,

60
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,460
and he's written a lot of really good stuff.

61
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,200
This...

62
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,900
And this one is called...

63
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,520
A New Working Definition of Subgenius.

64
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,560
Am I actually recording? Oh, good.

65
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,180
This hasn't been my day, friends.

66
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:11,920
Anyway, so, A Working Definition of Subgenius by Reverend Eddie Romanoff.

67
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,440
So, a copy of Angel Tech fell into my life today.

68
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,320
For those who don't know, it's a book by...

69
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,960
Antero Ali, who, as I understand it,

70
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,020
is a kind of latter-day, next-generation member of the

71
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,480
Tim Ginsburg, Leary, Robert Anton Wilson crowd.

72
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,920
He exists right at that junction point between the zones of legitimate psychology,

73
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,740
experimental theater, psychedelics, punk rock, discordianism, and chaos magic.

74
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,940
Just the introduction blew the top of my head clean off.

75
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,040
Oh, there it goes.

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,080
I haven't felt this enlightened since Bob smoked my pineal gland

77
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,120
and awakened within me the gospel of the true funk.

78
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,240
None of that really matters, except to say that it has awakened within me

79
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,860
a peculiar feeling that I've only felt a few times before.

80
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,360
Mostly the first time I read Howl.

81
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,080
Or On the Road.

82
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,160
Or Illuminatus.

83
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,480
Or, for that matter, the Book of the Subgenius.

84
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,480
It's a feeling of not quite knowing if what's just been laid out before you

85
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:41,260
is total and complete bull, or total and complete not-bull that just seems like bull

86
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,380
because of the bull that's been put on you by the con.

87
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,360
More to the point, it's like a...

88
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,620
a lot like feeling just not smart enough to really get it right.

89
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:51,620


90
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,000
To grok what you've just been told, but really wanting to go through with it anyway.

91
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,400
Of being a garden-variety weirdo in the presence of a real weirdo for the first time.

92
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,200
And that's when it hit me.

93
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,860
A subgenius is the Joe Sixpack of enlightenment.

94
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,900
The hillbilly in Shamballa.

95
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,220
The shortest tall person in the room.

96
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,820
The Jerry Snowman Reed to the Burt Bandit Reynolds of the glittering Illuminati.

97
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,480
Sure, they got the flashy car and all the chicks,

98
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:29,640
but we're the ones eastbound and down with a load of Bob's Own frothy triple-frop 12% IPA

99
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,620
direct from the land of the sky-blue waters for the cosmic dry county that is Trump's America.

100
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,460
Let us meditate on this.

101
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,460
Baba Free Eddie, The Mountain of Inattention 2018.

102
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:07,140
I have to say this, um, and I don't want you to think I was prying or anything, but...

103
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:16,380
I would never have come across them, of course, if I hadn't been tidying out the dirt and the filth that you left after yourself.

104
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,920
But I come across...

105
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,440
Well, a certain kind of literature, I suppose, if you could call it that.

106
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,120
Literature. It's not what I would call it, but...

107
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,060
That stuff you have back there in the cupboard.

108
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:42,420
I just happened to see it as I was hanging up your jacket.

109
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,960
Of course, it's completely your own business what you read, but...

110
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,280
I don't think...

111
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,800
I don't think we've ever had anything like that in the house before, and...

112
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:03,000
I wouldn't like to think that the people who stayed here read that kind of thing on a regular basis.

113
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,820
Well, yeah.

114
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,680
Look, I know you're a young man and you've got other interests and...

115
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:16,200
But I think that that's trash. I mean, that's what I think it is, is just trash and filth.

116
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,600
You probably think I'm...

117
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Well, very old-fashioned and very nosy parkour.

118
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,420
I probably am, but I'm going to say it.

119
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,580
I mean, I've seen a lot of the world I've lived in.

120
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,480
I've seen people come and go here over the years.

121
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,000
Now, what tell me you...

122
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,460
What would persuade anybody to pose for those pictures?

123
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,440
I mean, what would persuade a woman to just show herself like that?

124
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,440
I can't imagine. I just can't imagine.

125
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,460
And I think to myself...

126
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,200
That you probably don't have too much in your life if you have to resort to this.

127
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,200
Of course.

128
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,820
I don't know what you use them for.

129
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,020
What you're keeping them a secret if you're keeping them in a box here.

130
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,160
Like you must be ashamed of them somehow.

131
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,580
And...

132
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:17,900
And...

133
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,440
There's no harm in having secrets.

134
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,280
Should we all have our secrets?

135
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,840
You write down some of yours too, don't you?

136
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,080
It is no shame to write your secrets down.

137
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,600
I've had thoughts like that myself, the things that you write.

138
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,580
We all have thoughts like that.

139
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,580
You know, I was reading for quite a while before I realized that it was...

140
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
That it was myself you were writing about.

141
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,060
I was reading for quite a while before I realized that it was...

142
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,020
I was going to close the book immediately then, but...

143
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,480
I was curious to see...

144
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,700
If we'd any...

145
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,220
I suppose thoughts in common.

146
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,700
I didn't know you were watching me so much.

147
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,060
I didn't know you were watching me so much.

148
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,060


149
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,400
It's strange...

150
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,000
It's strange...

151
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,080
To have somebody looking at you like that.

152
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,440
To have somebody looking at you like that.

153
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,640
And writing it all down.

154
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,680
And...

155
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,780
and you writing as if you could see right through my blouse.

156
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,960
There, you're in old sly boots, aren't you?

157
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,720
Hi.

158
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Oh, look at me.

159
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,620
I'm shivering now.

160
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,920
I'm shivering.

161
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,680
That media barrage that you're about to hear,

162
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,980
and any that you already did hear,

163
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,640
were by Cool Hand Chris.

164
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,880
Cool Hand Chris has been taking our old stuff and redoing it

165
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,500
and mixing it in with other old and new stuff,

166
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,540
and it's great.

167
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,320
And maybe that's Dave.

168
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,380
Dave.

169
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,420
Hello?

170
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,060
Hello?

171
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,220
Why, Dave, you've made it.

172
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,760
How manly of you.

173
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,000
My testicles are a sight to behold.

174
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,380
I'm weighing more than ten stones in the island of Langham.

175
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,420
You know all that.

176
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,400
You can behold them yourself.

177
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,200
Behold?

178
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,540
Yeah, yeah.

179
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,560
You can behold them.

180
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,480
They owed me something?

181
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,960
You can hold those.

182
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,920
Those testicles.

183
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,120
You're nuts, man.

184
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,600
You're nuts.

185
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,260
You're crazy.

186
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:49,620
So.

187
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,560
Did you ever wonder in a sloppy moment

188
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,320
why such a ridiculous comparison was made?

189
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,460
You know, like squirrels have nuts and...

190
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,900
And are nuts?

191
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,480
Yeah, I buried sleigh dogs and so forth.

192
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,200
I got a couple of trumps down here

193
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,940
that you can take a good long gander at, buddy.

194
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,400
That's what I think of you.

195
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,920
Trumps?

196
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,820
Take a good look at my two big trumps.

197
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,180
So that's a real usage too, a trump?

198
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,500
It is now.

199
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,660
It is now on the Hour of Slack.

200
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,520
You know, I...

201
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:27,820
You know, I...

202
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,840
You can't replicate the body politic.

203
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,080
For the broadcast version...

204
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,100
You're intimidated.

205
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:40,900
For the broadcast version of the show, I replaced bad words with the word Trump or Trumps.

206
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:40,920
I'm not a Trump.

207
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:40,920


208
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:40,920


209
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:40,920


210
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:40,920


211
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,760
Or Trumped.

212
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,140
Or Trumping.

213
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,200
Oh, well, of course.

214
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:45,840
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,540
I forgot that.

216
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,740
Well, you don't hear that you probably...

217
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,460
I probably mail you the uncut shows.

218
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,920
Now you have lately.

219
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,580
You seem to think that somehow I've taken a more salacious turn in life

220
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:04,440
and would prefer to be known as a dirty dog swear man

221
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,520
or incendiary vomit to death.

222
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,260
You...

223
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,920
You know what the hell I'm talking about, don't you?

224
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,140
Oh, yeah, sure.

225
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,140
I always know what the hell you're talking about, Dave.

226
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,200
Hey, we got a review of your novel Neighbor World,

227
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,140
which hasn't been read by enough people.

228
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,740
But I gave a copy to Dr. G. Gordon Gordon,

229
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,320
who's one of the coauthors of the book The Subgenius from the very beginning get-go,

230
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,100
and one of my best pals.

231
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:36,780
And...

232
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,240
And the guy who is probably...

233
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:46,880
the guy who has given me more good hints about great books to read.

234
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:53,540
He turned me on to E.N.M. Banks and Neil Stevenson and a lot of great stuff.

235
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,600
And now he wants to turn everybody on to Neighbor World

236
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,440
because listen to what he says here, Dave, about you.

237
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,320
God damn.

238
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,420
The guy's a...

239
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,960
trumping...

240
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,520
genius.

241
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,540
William Gibson meets James Joyce.

242
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,840
Reading it slowly to enjoy it more.

243
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,760
Only on Chapter 3, but I just love it.

244
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,340
Best sci-fi read I have had in a long time.

245
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,860
You can't imagine what this means coming from this guy.

246
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,520
Duel.

247
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,320
This book should go mainstream, really.

248
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,960
If you talk to Dave, tell him old G. Gordon Gordon says,

249
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
he's fantastic.

250
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,100
I'm gonna recommend this to everyone who I think is smart enough to read it.

251
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,480
So, unfortunately, that's only about eight people.

252
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,320
But, uh...

253
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,400
But he's gonna recommend it to all of them.

254
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,820
Did Gordon Gordon say that?

255
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,520
Yes.

256
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,020
I'm highly... I'm highly evacuated.

257
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,000
That's wonderful.

258
00:16:59,420 --> 00:16:59,940
Oh, yeah.

259
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,680
I mean, to me, I don't know... yeah.

260
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,700
Oh, he's a really good writer himself, but he's an even better ranter.

261
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:12,580
I did a show two weeks ago that was his interview that I recorded in Portugal,

262
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:20,160
which is where he and his wife live now much more cheaply than they can here.

263
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,380
And they have real good healthcare that's real cheap

264
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:34,340
and mass transit that's really efficient and a ton of good wine.

265
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:35,700
Yeah.

266
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,760
And I think that F.R.O.P. is even decriminalized there, but...

267
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,760
Yeah.

268
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,940
But it didn't do me any good.

269
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,400
It's a place that many are depatriotizing to for some weird reason.

270
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,380
It's cheap.

271
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,840
I remember when you first told me that G. Gordon Gordon had moved to beyond La Belle France

272
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,620
all the way up there to Gallegos in Porto Gallo.

273
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,060
And you told me this, and somebody just said, man, I'm gonna go...

274
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,260
I've also, during the same period of time,

275
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,020
I have people say they're going to other parts of the Mediterranean

276
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,980
because it's inexpensive and benign and it's governmental.

277
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,800
Well, it kind of helped that the Gordons lived in Brazil for 10 or 15 years

278
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,120
and speak fluent Portuguese.

279
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,580
That makes it a lot easier.

280
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,780
Yeah, because I was wondering if, like, you know, are you multi-fluent?

281
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,040
If you can speak both Spanish, you have to be able to speak...

282
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,300
I was wondering if many people in Portugal, I know they do,

283
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,220
speak Spanish also.

284
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,060
But what about those...

285
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,200
Well, it's just enough like Spanish to get you in a lot of trouble.

286
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,400
Yeah.

287
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,420
It actually is...

288
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,980
Like Italian and Spanish.

289
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,540
Because I got in trouble by thinking one word in Italian was the same in Spanish

290
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,480
because there's so many words that are alike.

291
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,180
Right.

292
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,220
And I got in trouble.

293
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,060
Well, I didn't actually get put in jail or anything, but there was...

294
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,500
Never mind, it's a long story.

295
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,300
Well, it's...

296
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,700
Portuguese in Portugal actually sounds more like Italian.

297
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,020
I kept feeling like I was in a Fellini movie walking down the street.

298
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,300
Does it have that nasal French thing going on there too?

299
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,560
It's more Italian-y.

300
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,920
I mean, it sounds sort of like Spanish with an Italian accent, except that it's not.

301
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,380
I mean, they're all, you know, weird variations of Latin.

302
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,280
I can read French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.

303
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,580
Just enough to get myself in trouble.

304
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,580
Yeah, it can be troublesome too.

305
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,860
Do you think if it was like 1937 again, and we were rough brigands of the North, and we

306
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:51,520
decided to join the Spanish Civil War, and like in a movie or something like that, and

307
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,900
we'd go like jump off cliffs and slide sideways down the side of the hill and stuff like that,

308
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,100
and blow up trains.

309
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,280
That's...

310
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,120
Well, I mean, we wouldn't do that, but we'd watch it on some TV.

311
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,400
Smokey vacuous vision that reminded us of television.

312
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,400
Well, anyway, G. Gordon Gordon loved Neighbor World.

313
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,900
He's the best sci-fi critic I know of, and he thinks it's the best sci-fi he's read in a long time.

314
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:19,700
And I agree.

315
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:30,260
And people can actually get Neighbor World if you just type it into that little blank spot at the top of the browser.

316
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,100
It'll pop up on Amazon.com.

317
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,880
But it'd be better if you just go to subgenius.com because...

318
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,560
Well, just because.

319
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,100
There are lots of reasons, aren't there, Reverend?

320
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,180
There's all kinds of reasons for taking many, many venues and many things in the future.

321
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,680
And this might not be perhaps one of those that you see, Ari.

322
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,060
Many different visions in one.

323
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,080
Yeah, William Gibson, the cross with James Jordan.

324
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,080


325
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,720
But above and beyond all that, X Day's coming real soon.

326
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:18,120
In fact, this year, X Day, we're going to celebrate X Day and await the coming of the saucers kind of later in July.

327
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,620
We're not going to start until July 3rd.

328
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,960
And in fact, I'm still in Texas and may not be in Ohio until...

329
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,640
Well, I've got to get...

330
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,060
I have to be in Cleveland before...

331
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,820
Or I can go to Wisteria Campground to do X Day.

332
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,720
But, you know, we've run into some real snags here, Dave, in the real world.

333
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:52,680
I know it's really weird when that happens because it kind of sucks and it's hard to even describe because you feel as if you're powerless.

334
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,820
And then all of a sudden you feel like, you know, you can wheel the gas station truck to come over and fill up your tank while you're asleep.

335
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,060
You know?

336
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,320
Well, it's actually real easy to describe.

337
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,780
Wee maw maw, my mother-in-law, and I'll...

338
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,400
Well, really, I call her mom.

339
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,820
She fell down and kind of injured her seat bone.

340
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,220
And I don't want to...

341
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,980
I'm not sure how well she can handle five hours a day in a car.

342
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,880
We're going to check that out.

343
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,080
But she's still having a lot of trouble walking.

344
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,020
And I don't know if I want to transport this old lady that way.

345
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,040
And the dog, Buddy, had to go to the hospital.

346
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,040


347
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,780
And he was going for surgery on one of his paws because he had a little nub.

348
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,340
He'd been a wart or a little Dobbs head or something that was growing on his paw.

349
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,460
And he kept chewing at it.

350
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,180
And it was getting worse and worse and worse.

351
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,880
And the doctor said, let me just snip it right off as if that was easy.

352
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,400
And it probably was.

353
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,680
But what's hard is keeping the dog from chewing his bandages off and ripping the stitches off.

354
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,040
He's in the punishment cone.

355
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,780
He's got a cone on his head.

356
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,220
But it's not quite big enough.

357
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,800
I need a bigger cone.

358
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,040
But it's Sunday.

359
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,900
And the cone store is closed.

360
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,500
And the cone heads are all out of town.

361
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,540
So I've got this little dog that is requiring literally constant attention.

362
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,640
And that's why Princess Wee isn't on right now.

363
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,000
She's walking him.

364
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,740
Because otherwise all you'd hear in the background is her going, no, Buddy, no, stop, no.

365
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,960
We tried spraying his bandage with foul-tasting elixirs.

366
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,200
And like I say, he hasn't had a lot of fun.

367
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,880
He has a cone on.

368
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,260
But the cone isn't big enough.

369
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,880
And he can still get to it.

370
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,540
And you have to watch him every second.

371
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,260
And I've actually had to whack him a few times.

372
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,360
What is happening is he is starting to heal.

373
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,080
And like humans get itchy when they start to heal.

374
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,880
Oh, I can tell.

375
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,060
I absolutely, it's driving him nuts.

376
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,100
Yeah.

377
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,280
In fact, there's that word again, nuts.

378
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,300
But we gave him some of Dammit's leftover tranquilizers.

379
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,460
And that helped.

380
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,820
That bought me about half an hour.

381
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,280
But he was, he's, anyway, it's hectic.

382
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,340
And it's rough.

383
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,820
And we're supposed to be back in Cleveland already.

384
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,360
But I'm glad I'm not because they need me here.

385
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,880
And, but man, when we get back, I'm going to have to hit the road running.

386
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,400
I don't know how we're going to keep up with hours of slack with all the stuff I have to do.

387
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,360
To keep myself out of the poorhouse.

388
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,540
Because I've got to sell that house in Cleveland.

389
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,580
I've got to sell it quick.

390
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,520
But it's not ready to sell.

391
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:51,480
Just because now it's a case de pobresitos doesn't necessarily mean it can't be some kind of graciosos.

392
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,660
Well, just thank goodness the world ends July 5th.

393
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,580
Right.

394
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,140
Suddenly.

395
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,460
I don't know why I'm worried about it, but I always do anyway.

396
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,340
In fact, if I know me, I'll pay off all my bills before the world ends just out of spite.

397
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,720
If you can imagine kind of a reverse nobility spite.

398
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,220
It's like to screw the conspiracy by not screwing it.

399
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,940
By rising above it.

400
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,500
Because I'm going to burn all, I'm going to burn them all alive right after I pay those bills.

401
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,120
I could see like the comic book from the anarchist cookbook in 1940.

402
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,580
1945.

403
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:37,360
Where all those people like Emma Goldman and all those famous anarchists and collectivitis and so forth.

404
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,780
And they would meet in little taverns down in the Lower East Side of New York around Avenue A and B and stuff like there.

405
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,960
And that happened a hundred years ago and people still go down there and get drunk.

406
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,580
If you can imagine people with feet that big that could actually do that twice a day and not get caught.

407
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,860
Or at least too horny they can't envision a better future for all human beings.

408
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,560
Well not everyone gets to grow up to be a subgenius.

409
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,400
Some of them have to spaz down.

410
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,500
They have to release that vacuous ovals who condition ill.

411
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,320
Remember when we used to talk about all the condiments that doctors would use to fake out the police?

412
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:26,300
When they were smuggling heroin and mashed potatoes and greenway fudge and armpit gravy.

413
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:27,960
No.

414
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,360
And the mechanical shoes especially.

415
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,440
What do they need to smuggle all that?

416
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:40,860
Because of the coming civil revolution and the civil war between the apes and the have-nots.

417
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,980
And the syllabus and the...

418
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:47,200
I was going to say, is it going to be between the haves and the have-nots?

419
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,840
Because I have a feeling the have-nots aren't going to...

420
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,720
They're not going to have enough weapons.

421
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,060
Or lawyers.

422
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,760
And then real have-nots are going to have no weapons.

423
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:57,940
And then real have-nots are going to have no weapons.

424
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,480
And they're going to end up shooting themselves anyway just because the second amendment is right.

425
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,460
Didn't you ever read that in the...

426
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,020
Everyone has the right to shoot themselves or their children.

427
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:09,960
Accidentally.

428
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,580
While dancing.

429
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,620
Because it was a different world back then, you've got to remember.

430
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,340
So then you've got to forget that when you bring that up and try to resolve it.

431
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:26,840
Well actually when my dad was growing up, every kid learned how to shoot a gun when he was ten years old.

432
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,060
And most of them had guns.

433
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,320
And they actually went out and shot squirrels and actually brought them home and cut them up and ate them.

434
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,520
And that was perfectly normal.

435
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,940
However, they weren't using AK-47s and things like that to shoot at squirrels.

436
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,080
And they really were just shooting at squirrels.

437
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,760
They didn't hate women or their classmates or the libtards or the rumptards.

438
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,460
They just didn't hate...

439
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,920
Well actually there were people...

440
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,480
They were just going to get the...

441
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,620
There were people they hated and did terrible things to for no reason at all.

442
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,300
But it wasn't usually with guns.

443
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,200
No.

444
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,100
A hangman's noose was usually enough and torches and white hoods.

445
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,620
Yeah, the good old days, you know.

446
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,680
What they want to go back to.

447
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,300
Well, some types.

448
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,980
Well it certainly seems that way to me.

449
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,620
I don't know, I've been a medicine man.

450
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,960
I'm this here tribal preserve.

451
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,700
This indigenous nation of me, myself and I.

452
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,920
And we just finished up just over the last 45 minutes of powwow ritual.

453
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,160
It usually just involves one person, namely me.

454
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,140
I'm the elder and I'm also the trainee.

455
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,400
And I know all the moves and make them up as I go along.

456
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,040
Sometimes I have to because rhythm is very important when you try and draw down the moon.

457
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,200
Or the sun or any architectural vector.

458
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,060
That's just common knowledge.

459
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,780
Everybody who has a swing turn knows that.

460
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,020
Or can dream of.

461
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:55,820
Or something.

462
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,620
Yeah, it's common knowledge.

463
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
Everybody knows that.

464
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,460
What you just said.

465
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:02,500
Yeah.

466
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,280
If they don't, I'd just smack them and spite them and slap their mammies ten times.

467
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:12,680
Wouldn't you?

468
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,360
Those were quite the crazy days back then.

469
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,700
In Indiana.

470
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,640
Never mind, I'm sorry.

471
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,420
Never mind.

472
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:38,940
I'm sure it won't be long before people are talking about the good old days when you could just get water free without fighting for it or stealing it.

473
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,940
Or the good old days when it was under 130 in the shade.

474
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:47,860
Yeah.

475
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,500
The good old days when.

476
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,180
Is it Tera Blasco's right now?

477
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,960
There was a Florida.

478
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,080
Florida.

479
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,460
That's where you are.

480
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,280
Huh?

481
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:54,700
What?

482
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,440
What was it like today in Tejas?

483
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,440
Where you stand right now?

484
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,380
It finally reached 100 degrees today.

485
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,820
It did today so early.

486
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,040
It is a little bit early, isn't it?

487
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,840
Actually, they've been predicting it for a week.

488
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:17,100
And I was eager for it to happen because I wanted to test my air conditioning system in the shed.

489
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,260
I'm about to leave the shed to itself.

490
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:26,000
And only small window units will fit in the small windows.

491
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,040
I got a second window unit.

492
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:34,600
And when it's 100 degrees and the second window unit is on, it's only 80 degrees in the shed.

493
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,780
And that's fine for the film and old tape and all that.

494
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,480
There's a dehumidifier in there.

495
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,580
But yeah, that's the trick.

496
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,320
I've got this.

497
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,340
All of the Sogenius archives are in a nice insulated shed.

498
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,240
But it's in a shed.

499
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,780
And it's a shed in a place where it goes 100 degrees every day for three months.

500
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,920
And it's going to cost a lot to run those two air conditioners.

501
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,300
Which is another reason I've got to get rid of that stupid Cleveland house.

502
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,580
Anybody need a historic slacker mansion in beautiful Cleveland Heights?

503
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,560
Well, I'm not supposed to solicit things like that on the air.

504
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,820
But I have mentioned that before.

505
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,460
I know I have.

506
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:15,800
I would.

507
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,360
But it's a normal person's house.

508
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,220
So, therefore, you would be able to get it.

509
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,980
I would be asking three or four times what I would be capable of paying.

510
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:32,400
And I have been saving up my regiment of fruits and nuts and vegetables.

511
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,060
Each on a daily basis.

512
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,740
You know, you can only take two or three more carrots than you can hold.

513
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,240
Because if not, they'll get away and they'll come back and haunt you.

514
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,400
Just as you or some old hank yourself or something.

515
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,140
I don't know.

516
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,360
What?

517
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,140
Do carrots come back and haunt you?

518
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:50,760
What?

519
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,600
You can go back and...

520
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,820
A carrot's a one-celled critter just like a radish is.

521
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,860
It's just one cell.

522
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,180
That's not so.

523
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:05,440
And if you could somehow capture that in solar magnetism at the same time, you could go

524
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,380
back and forth into the future in the pasture.

525
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,360
That would be it for you.

526
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,240
I guess I should get more carrots and radishes.

527
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,780
And what do you do?

528
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,120
You make a time machine out of it?

529
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,980
What do you have to do?

530
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,240
Yeah.

531
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,700
You have to make a time machine that will...

532
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,620
Because that's the easiest that you can put anything back and forth in time.

533
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:32,100
But the problem is if you go ahead in time or back in time, even one second, the Earth

534
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:37,460
will have rotated out from under you and probably dropped far away.

535
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:37,800
Oh, yeah.

536
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,600
Or you'll be right in the center of it when you quit time traveling.

537
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,180
Because, I mean, what keeps you attached to the same place when you're floating around

538
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,880
through time?

539
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,860
See what my problem is?

540
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,040
It's the grace of Zeron keeps us floating in mid-air.

541
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:59,280
Well, I don't know if I agree with you, but I think for the sake and purposes of knowledge

542
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:07,000
of Athena, of wisdom, of Mithras, and the ancient globe, I would say yes, you are correct.

543
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:14,860
Well, I mean, I've read lots of sci-fi stories and the time machine is always in the same

544
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,160
place after it travels.

545
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,160


546
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,160


547
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,160


548
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,160


549
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,400
It travels through time, but the Earth itself is not in the same place from second to second.

550
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,120
It's hundreds of miles further along every second.

551
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,280
Yeah, that's a big amount to us, too.

552
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,300
Yeah, so you got to...

553
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,920
It's like, how are you going to calculate that?

554
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:39,920
It's like you can only travel in increments of an entire Earth's rotation around the sun,

555
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,740
like a whole year or something, and then you're back in roughly the same place, except for

556
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,140
one thing.

557
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:52,660
The sun is traveling thousands of miles per nanosecond through the ethers.

558
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,940
Everything is.

559
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,920
Everything's traveling.

560
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,160
It's just as jiggly as a dance.

561
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
Right, so how do you get your time machine to magnetize?

562
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,100
Do you put a magnet on it?

563
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,060
I think you need to tune it to the point...

564
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,700
The magnet, it detaches from time.

565
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,500
It won't stick.

566
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:16,140
Yeah, that makes sense also, but if you think in terms of light waves, that's a different

567
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,140


568
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,300
thing.

569
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:24,000
Being the end-all and be-all of wave furniture, you could magnetize a different wave form solution

570
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,340
and just kind of go into that part of it.

571
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,100
Actually, Dave, you know what Bob said about time control?

572
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,960
And it was kind of a sad statement because...

573
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,180
And that's why we don't advertise it much.

574
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,000
He actually said, and this is a remarkably sober thing for Bob to say.

575
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,960
All right.

576
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,680
I forgot what I was going to say.

577
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,860
That was what he said.

578
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,080
But he also said, the only time control we have open to us is patience.

579
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,280
I guess you could say, or magic, but...

580
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,000
Oh, so you got to go back to med school just to get a few people hungry on the earth while

581
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,060
a gravy magnet gets snow to speak?

582
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:14,880
Well, no, you just have to trust in Bob and believe that he's got enough magic to...

583
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,340
Patience and doctors, that's all I can hear.

584
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:17,920
Oh, I see.

585
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,220
It sounds like some kind of medical scammer he wants as usual in America.

586
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:30,400
Doctors for Bob once said that, what you really said, but Bob said, is you have to have patience.

587
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:35,760
Yeah, if you kill enough of your patients, then it's like a sacrifice and you can travel

588
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,640
ahead in time as far as you want.

589
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,180
The problem is that you age while you're doing it.

590
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,340
Yeah.

591
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,920
And it doesn't happen any faster.

592
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,540
I remember you talking about...

593
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:51,520
And so the kind of patience that Bob was talking about was forbearance.

594
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,400
Yeah, forbearance.

595
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:53,840
Mm-hmm.

596
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:03,580
Being, having a zen-like attitude towards the irritating passage of time, which has

597
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,440
been irritating my lower back with arthritis.

598
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,040
I'm not looking forward to the car trips.

599
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,060
You sound like a hairy old man right now.

600
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,580
I am.

601
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,120
I'm a real hairy old man.

602
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,360
Like a earthly person.

603
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,800
I'm...

604
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,540
Well...

605
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:26,460
Confirmed and convinced in his quintessential existential gravy, the very bottom most essential

606
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,960
part of his being, that somehow cripes in the form of Bob's log or...

607
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,760
J.R. Bud Dog.

608
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,340
Yeah.

609
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,980
The one pod hound dog.

610
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,600
Yeah, Grandpa Dog.

611
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,840
...will save you from any...

612
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:49,020
Give you haunted refuge and flavored different kind of barbecue, you know, like pork rinds

613
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,280
and stuff.

614
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,580
Yeah, I don't get to eat any of those.

615
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,200
You can want to, though.

616
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,160
Oh, yeah, I do.

617
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,700
I do want to.

618
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,000
But I don't.

619
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,400
I had one bite of a brisket hot dog yesterday.

620
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,760
One bite.

621
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,320
Can you imagine being able to just have one bite?

622
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,580
Well, of course.

623
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,600
You know, you did well.

624
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,540
You did well.

625
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,420
You took one bite.

626
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,960
You even tortured and tempted Vamp, the creators of the universe in sideways myth rhythms and

627
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,680
stuff like that.

628
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,360
You took all of her randomness right out of her with that.

629
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,420
Well, I'm just trying not to have another heart attack, that's all.

630
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,660
Well, that's a worthwhile goal.

631
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,180
So, yeah, man.

632
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,560
X days are coming.

633
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,200
Maybe some subgeniuses will go, by golly, what if this is the last X day?

634
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,280
Listen, Reverend Stang just signed up for Medicare.

635
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,740
That means he's probably going to be dead in no time.

636
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,200
Nobody else is going to do that.

637
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:54,620
Nobody else is going to go to the trouble of setting up that pulpit and those speakers

638
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,400
and things.

639
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,640
When old Reverend Stang goes, I'm not going to be able to go to the next day.

640
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,520
Maybe I should go this year.

641
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,160
Maybe this is the year that the world's going to end and everything will be fine.

642
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,000
Hunkus Dorus.

643
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
But probably they won't.

644
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:16,240
They'll probably say, well, now I could go, but I really kind of need to save my money

645
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,420
up for the drugs and rent.

646
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,500
I don't really have to go to X day this year.

647
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:32,100
I'm sure Bob wouldn't just surprise us by having the world end on one July 5th.

648
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,160
That happens to be the real 1998.

649
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,140
Well, I think what it is.

650
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,460
It's 1998 as he prophesied.

651
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:37,680
Right.

652
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,620
Exactly.

653
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,680
And what if you were to wake up one morning and you were to find out that world in 1998,

654
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:49,200
backwards from 89, which we meant the cocktail, the crock.

655
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,200
You're left behind.

656
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,460
You're left behind.

657
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,000
We're left behind.

658
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,160
That would mean the same thing as E equals no ridiculous motion.

659
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:05,140
Hey, Dave, are you familiar with those left behind books that Christians love so much

660
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,400
about all the idiots that weren't saved and got left behind in the rapture?

661
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,240
There's all the cool cartoon art in there.

662
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,620
Well, not the ones I'm thinking of.

663
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:21,680
The ones I'm thinking of, it's just a bunch of holier than thou people get to mock all

664
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,980
the libtards basically that didn't go to heaven with them.

665
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:34,060
But our friend, Reverend John Shirley, the science fiction writer, just finished a new

666
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:40,940
book that is like the reverse flip around answer to that.

667
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,580
Now I suddenly can't remember the title of it.

668
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,140
The New End, Another End.

669
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,560
Anyway, it's the end of the world done right.

670
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:59,160
And instead of happening from a right winger's point of view, it's kind of like a new world

671
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,560
from an enlightened person.

672
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,000
Right.

673
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,700
It's like a Gurdjieffian point of view.

674
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,340
And John Shirley actually is a big Gurdjieff fan.

675
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,040
Or a Uspensky perhaps.

676
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,680
Perhaps a Madame Blavatsky or a Uspensky.

677
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:20,300
It's like these higher intelligences come and kill the bad guys.

678
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:31,400
They literally kill all the serial killers and murderers and politicians and evil generals

679
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,940
and bad cops and child rapers.

680
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,820
And father rapers and all that.

681
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,020
They just die.

682
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,040
Then there's a second round of the world ending where, okay, people know something's going

683
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,320
on, so maybe they better learn to repent, quit their job and slack off.

684
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,820
And the ones who don't get left behind.

685
00:40:51,260 --> 00:41:01,280
And the ones who do move on 20,000 years into the future to the new earth that's been regrown

686
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,060
after the left behind people completely blew it up and killed each other.

687
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:16,580
So I just spoiled the great story, but it is a fantabulous John Shirley new book and

688
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:22,940
was a fun read with his latest collection of short stories which are his most evil and

689
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,280
sick writings.

690
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,280
So it was like a novel of hope.

691
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,840
It's kind of a send up of the book.

692
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,700
It's a left behind books.

693
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:38,100
And then an anthology of hopelessness that was so sick.

694
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,460
There's one story in there that I will not let my wife read.

695
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,320
It ends with an image that she doesn't need in her head and neither do you, Dave.

696
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,820
Well, I'm glad this is just as hell to be without, especially since I think right now

697
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,600
at this particular moment in time, you should be thinking about Neighbor World.

698
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,240
Yeah, about that too.

699
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,960
Hey, I'll tell you what, why don't you, I'm going to run upstairs.

700
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:09,440
I want you to talk to the audience about Neighbor World for about one minute while I run upstairs

701
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,220
and get John's book so I can give the proper endorsement.

702
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,560
Okay.

703
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,840
So just start talking.

704
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,860
You know I ain't going to be able to do it.

705
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,600
I'll listen to it later.

706
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,900
Just keep talking, Dave.

707
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,100
All right.

708
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,780
I'll trust you.

709
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,140
Well, it's about, let's see, it's about 2038, something like that.

710
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,220
And everything's gone swimmingly except for the whole book.

711
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:35,000
The whole globe, I'm not talking about the one you might like, where there's a hairpiece

712
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,060
or a frog necklace or something like that.

713
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:44,380
But the whole world is just gone, is a part of this huge network that's like a combination

714
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:51,520
of the network of internet and social media and television and everything's all combined

715
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,260
into one thing.

716
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:59,240
It's also the interface, the interface between your, oh, I better talk about somebody else

717
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,160
if I'm going to start speaking.

718
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:12,980
So I've been no longer using that any longer.

719
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,800
I've been Amazon Prime trip to Thailand.

720
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:18,940
I love that.

721
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,300
It's the best that I've ever heard.

722
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:25,440
Well, Dave, I wasn't, I just wanted, I wasn't able to put things into the box such

723
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,580
as the white globally so that people don't get mad atï¿½ï¿½, I think, about that because

724
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:26,580


725
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:26,640
And on that note, yeah, definitely discussing it.

726
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,220
The English spoken really has taken an interesting place in a lot of the eight years, working

727
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:27,220


728
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,320
Wait till I dive again.

729
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:29,320


730
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,480
run to get a neighbor world to read my own blurb off the back of it although I suppose you should

731
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,860
have a copy of it that you could read that blurb off of but I ran up to get John Shirley's two

732
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:50,840
books The Other End that's the hopeful end of the world it's really spectacular The Other End by

733
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:59,460
John Shirley it's a send-up of Left Behind The Other End and his most extreme short story

734
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:09,320
collection is called In Extremis In Extremis and it has three subgenius short stories that are

735
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:21,160
really sick and then some that are even sicker so the John Shirley's The Other End and In Extremis

736
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:28,740
two extremely opposite books I mean really opposite one is really full of love and hope

737
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:35,500
and is full of hate and terror and ugliness neighbor world is full of

738
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:43,920
an intense paranoia about the where we're going with the media and the internet

739
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:56,720
and is sort of like a Fellini movie meets Billy Jack meets William Gibson meets Neil Stevenson

740
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,980
meets

741
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:07,560
Anthony Burgess meets Franz Kafka meets the Firesign Theater and Warner Brothers cartoons

742
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:14,020
and they call it a cluster yeah how's that how's that for a description of Neighbor World well it

743
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:20,520
was a cluster because it included numerous violations of the ethical code but didn't

744
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:26,860
excuse me I was trying to swallow a fly um it didn't come from the more

745
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,300
um perhaps

746
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,440
um perhaps

747
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:29,440


748
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:29,440


749
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:29,440


750
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:44,020
been beat up um did mai and which are to survives

751
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,020


752
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,020


753
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,020


754
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:51,520
iggle was quite a mouthful of just the basis for the stuff that increases attractiveness.

755
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,440
uh-huh

756
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:08,180
global swarming the tarantulas are swarming and uh i'm heading heading down to the

757
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:18,780
veterans administration to uh protest we also the snakes are out too uh princess we did i mention

758
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:24,800
on this show that princess we while i was gone of course the snakes were afraid while i'm here

759
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,660
but i was gone in portugal for five days and two nights in a row princess we had rattlesnakes in

760
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,360
the backyard in fact she opened the door and the rattlesnake was right there at the door and stuck

761
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:41,320
her head in and princess we slammed the door screamed first then slammed the door on the snake

762
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:47,160
and it pushed the snake out and she didn't go outdoors for like three days after that

763
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,700
which which was rough on buddy too but of course once i came back the snake

764
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,080
oh reverend stangs back we heard about what he did to that copperhead our cousin

765
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:06,320
with that shovel and that machete so we're gonna we're gonna steer clear old

766
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:14,920
reverend stangs ranch when he's around when that pretty lady's there you could probably

767
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:24,680
use some sort of like a psychotropic um you know nuclear warfare on them well you know i don't

768
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,400
i don't have the right kind of gun yet i need a gun that shoots knives

769
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:39,000
that's what i need a gun that shoots knives and chili powder that would be great because you could

770
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,520
do like two or four different things at one time oh and yeah because it would they'd sneeze while

771
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,980
they were dying yeah but i don't know that i want you know i'm not it's not that i hate snakes not

772
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,860
even poisonous snakes they all have a place in god's creation

773
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:02,460
the non-venomous snakes have the place of eating the baby poisonous snakes i'm real careful about

774
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:11,660
which snakes are hit with shovels yeah like in florida what did they the coral snake and then

775
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:17,320
there was this common other snake they were exactly the life except he had to know how to

776
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:22,280
count the different bands of black on red never dread black on yellow kill the fella

777
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,660
we have we have coral snakes

778
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,820
here too but what i saw a great big snake in the road the other day it was a it was so peaceable

779
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:36,640
looking and it had such a narrow instead of broad head that i had time to stand there

780
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:43,700
next to it practically googling pictures of snakes and i ascertained that it was a harmless

781
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:49,420
corn snake that would eat rodents and baby rattlesnakes

782
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,380
so i i spared it however my

783
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,920
nephew around the corner down the road ran into it the next day and shot it just because he hates

784
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,720
snakes he didn't care what kind of snake it is and he grew up here he should know the difference

785
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:13,420
between your friendly snake and your unfortunate snake and neither one of them hate you both of

786
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:18,920
them just leave you would have to be happily leave you alone yeah many of these different

787
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,720
things that we think we're supposed to shoot with a shotgun and stuff are actually holding up the

788
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,540
pillars of evolution

789
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,740
you know the world we live in the ecosphere and stuff well that's not going to be here much longer

790
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:36,140
that's all that's over with dave you'd be glad we're going to be dead in 20 years i mean seriously

791
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,940
do you really want to be reading about the last mountain gorilla

792
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:49,020
because you will be if you live too long yeah but that's what humans didn't understand if you

793
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:54,340
kill everything off that includes you you know includes mankind oh we'll try to explain that to

794
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:54,780
the average person

795
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:02,080
well god they god did tell them that everything grows back within a couple weeks

796
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:08,900
everything does grow back but it's not the same form of animal when it finally comes back

797
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:18,420
five million years later to fill that niche yep a turn a turnover uh yeah they say there's some

798
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:23,600
strange critters living around there well it's interesting that there's anything living there

799
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:32,540
there's it's very rich with life mutant life mutant life yeah speaking of mutant life we have to go

800
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:39,220
we've actually been on the phone for a while and there's other stuff on the show that's already been

801
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:46,260
played but we did talk we did we did dutifully talk about neighbor world and x day and we

802
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:52,160
mentioned bob oh did i tell you i got i got dr howell's plane ticket that's our biggest expense

803
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,780
at x day and he's also going to be on the show for a while so we're going to be talking about that

804
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,400
he's going to be at starwood he's going to be out there with us for two weeks straight because

805
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:04,660
starwood festival follows x day it'll be on my escape saucer because the world would be destroyed

806
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:11,700
but either way why doesn't he just drive his mercedes benz towards you sometime instead of

807
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:20,560
making you pay for a ticket he could just get in his 2017 yeah rolls royce and just have his driver

808
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,700
take you in the him in the air uh you know it's a

809
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,560
it's a well-paying job being a doctor or a minister of the church of the subgenius

810
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:36,640
oh you're huge oh god we pay so great well just think isn't isn't that a texas preacher

811
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,780
who's trying to pray his way into getting the fourth airplane or something they're all doing

812
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:47,260
that even i'm doing that yeah but i just i just know i just want a second car that works in the

813
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:53,100
news right as far as what's trending you know that uh that there's some some

814
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,820
there's some preachers good money-grubbing preachers and nothing new i think jesus had

815
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:06,580
something to say about them yes i believe he did i believe he walked into their false

816
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:12,660
temple and just started kicking over tables full of money just like bob came on that construction

817
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:17,740
site started kicking over all those chem toilets going why are you hiding in in this little sticky

818
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:23,240
closet to do a natural thing be a natural man like me and he pulled down his britches and just

819
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,420
let go right there

820
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,620
and all them hard hats they threw their hard hats up in the air and they all did the same thing and

821
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:38,200
followed suit and then uh they were all fired and the company hired a bunch of scabs come in and

822
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:44,340
clean up all the poop but so the moral of the story is only bob can get away with that poop

823
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:53,060
but but dave really we need to go time flies swiftly on that shower note

824
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:53,540
um

825
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:01,340
either the guy's a wimp or he's a schmuck

826
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:10,260
you know anybody who is who has ever been nice to me has been such a wimp

827
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,300
that i just wanted to kick him in the face

828
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:19,580
i got married to one of those uncaring guys after i rejected one of these super caring guys

829
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,460
and i'll tell you i don't know which one was worse i don't know which one was more disgusting

830
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,060
i'd rather be alone

831
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,660
i can't be bothered it's not worth it

832
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,160
i have a dog who is more understanding than any man i've ever been with

833
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:50,900
he's cozier if my dog could drive he'd be perfect now when i want to go somewhere i have to drive

834
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,440
and he has to sit in the passenger seat that's that's the that's the only drawback as far as i'm

835
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:54,780
concerned i don't know if i'm going to be able to drive if i'm going to be able to drive if i'm going to be able to drive

836
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:56,840
shut up

837
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:07,580
i'm over sex i did all the sex i needed to last me for the rest of my life you know and you know

838
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,500
there are always ways around that if you really get desperate i don't happen to be desperate at

839
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,380
the moment and i feel like i'll never be desperate again

840
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,520
and i'd much rather talk to a woman any day of the week

841
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,500
you know or to one of my gay friends

842
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:24,780
who are gay

843
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,800
are so much funnier and sillier and they like all the things i like

844
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:36,000
you know i don't have a problem being alone i i'm so busy that

845
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,240
i look forward to the times when i'm alone

846
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:48,820
and it's such a relief not to have to pick up after somebody and try to please somebody you

847
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:53,860
know and look good for somebody and worry if they're gonna

848
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,760
you know i don't have a problem being alone i'm so busy that i look forward to the times when i'm alone

849
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,080
and i'm like you know what i'm not gonna do

850
00:54:55,080 --> 00:55:01,960
i'm gonna abandon you or smother you or talk you to death or freeze you out or you know take up all your space

851
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,720
or leave you alone

852
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,860
when someone's getting rid of you you feel like

853
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:23,500
the lowest ugliest oldest stupidest most boring

854
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:30,100
klutz-y being that ever walked the earth

855
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:36,520
that no one will ever care about you again that you'll never care about yourself again that

856
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:43,020
that your skin is raw and your heart is raw and and you just feel like the whole

857
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:50,280
air has gone out of your life that you that you can't breathe that you're gonna drown that

858
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,560
that you're gonna live in darkness for the rest of your life and and you can't let

859
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:04,380
go and you cling and you clutch and it's like dying. I can't imagine ever going through

860
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:10,140
that again. It was so horrible. But now when I look back on it, I think, what was that?

861
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:23,220
I'm so happy now. I come and go. My time is my own. I eat what I want. I love that. I

862
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:28,280
was trying to please think about the food and about the clothes and about the hair.

863
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,500
My time was never my own. I was always looking at my watch and running, oh, if I do this,

864
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,760
if I want to work late, I can't. If I don't want to make love with me, then there's something

865
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,480
wrong with me. There was always something wrong with me or something I couldn't do.

866
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,540
And now everything's right with me.

867
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,840
That's how I feel.

868
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,860
And that's how I intend to feel for the rest of my life. I just, I don't know what happened.

869
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:05,280
It's like somebody, I had this horrible boil and somebody just popped it. You know, I just,

870
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:21,480
it's gone. I don't care. Relationships are just too hard. Why get involved in some kind

871
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,620
of a horrible world?

872
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:44,020
I don't know. I just want to be alone. I don't want to be with anyone. I want to be by myself.

873
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,840
That's how I was born. That's how I want to live. That's how I want to die.

874
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,700
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

875
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,860
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

876
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,000
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

877
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,980
I hate to derail your train of thought.

878
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:18,940
Sorry to interrupt in mid-sentence for you.

879
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,140
Hammer and nail me to the spot.

880
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:26,420
Well, excuse me, I was just leaving.

881
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,380
I used to be the lover that you celebrate.

882
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,380
Now I'm just someone you barely tolerate.

883
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,160
I hate to leave the house in such a mess.

884
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,180
But that's what happens when you bleed to death.

885
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,300
And baby, yes, I gotta go.

886
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,860
Oh, no, no.

887
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:52,760
Oh, no.

888
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,120
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

889
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,860
Baby, I'm leaving.

890
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,240
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

891
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:08,300
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

892
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,460
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

893
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,340
Love has a way of hanging around.

894
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:24,940
Long after kindness has left town.

895
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:29,320
Sorry to come between you and your demons.

896
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:33,100
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

897
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,120
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

898
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,140
Yeah, I gotta go.

899
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,140
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

900
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,260
Oh, no, no, no.

901
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,020
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

902
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,540
Baby, I'm leaving.

903
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,240
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

904
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,300
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

905
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,920
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

906
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:58,180
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

907
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:02,180
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

908
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,100
Excuse me, I was just leaving.

909
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:11,740
Uh, Bob Walkenhorst from a solo album called Beginnings.

910
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,420
Just leaving.

911
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,640
Don't hang up.

912
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,980
Okay.

913
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,180
Cause even though the broadcast,

914
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:20,320
Okay.

915
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:20,600
Just even though the broadcast,

916
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,220
version of the show just ended.

917
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,340
Now we can talk frankly to the internet crowd

918
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:27,080
Now we can talk frankly to the internet crowd

919
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,360
about how what they really should do with their $35

920
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:30,380
about how what they really should do with their $35

921
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:35,720
is add another $14 to it and buy not only their

922
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:35,920
is add another $14 to it and buy not only their

923
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,400
SubGenius membership but a copy of the

924
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,120
the Neighborworld science fiction novel.

925
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,880
and science fiction is,

926
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,360
it's science fiction in the same way that

927
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:46,500
it's science fiction in the same way that

928
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,620
Kurt Vonnegut is science fiction.

929
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:50,320
And then we have,

930
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:54,900
you don't actually find Vonnegut's stuff in the science fiction section.

931
01:00:55,180 --> 01:01:00,760
You see it in the literature section, although he thought he was writing science fiction at the time.

932
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,540
So they're old buddies' home.

933
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,180
Anyway, friends, yeah, if you look at subgenius.com, there's a link to right up at the top,

934
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,800
all the places you can spend money.

935
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:13,480
Neighbor World and Book of the Subgenius is still in print.

936
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:25,840
And the subgenius memberships and Arise video DVD and a bunch of other DVDs and T-shirts, all that stuff.

937
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,800
And X-Day.

938
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:36,100
And if you click on the Hour of Slack link, every time you read about a new show,

939
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:41,940
it shows the links for the poor, struggling subgeniuses that need your charity donations,

940
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,460
such as podcasting.

941
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,180
Pope Sternodocs, who just had an operation for kidney cancer

942
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,820
and is waiting to see what else is going on with him.

943
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:57,940
And Anna Moll, who lost her worldly possessions to a flood, a water accident.

944
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:09,100
And my little niece, Claire, who has a dread condition called EDS that's really bad.

945
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,000
And so when you help.

946
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:17,200
When you help my niece, you're actually helping Church's subgenius.

947
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,680
I don't have to give her as much as much charity myself, you see.

948
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,540
Anyway, yesterday was her birthday, by the way.

949
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:31,460
And that was why I ate that one bite of brisket hot dog.

950
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,840
Well, that is it.

951
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,380
That was a damn swell idea.

952
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:39,700
As far as I am concerned.

953
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,880
I was just thinking about the great apes.

954
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,840
Central Africa, like the wildebeest,

955
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,020
gerrymongrels,

956
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,280
the connectivated tissues of all the miscreants.

957
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,760
You were just talking about connectivated tissues, weren't you?

958
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,260
Yeah, that was about ten shows or years ago, I think.

959
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,340
Yeah, at least in the mountainous lands of Agoura,

960
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,800
where my ancestors came from originally.

961
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,000
They never really were very original people.

962
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:13,460
Well, they were.

963
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,440
They were rather steadfast and bold.

964
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:18,340
You know, that's not the right phrase.

965
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,820
I meant, like, not very creative.

966
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:22,560
Boring.

967
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,620
It's not a faction that you could find in the Church today now,

968
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,840
if you were to go to Hungary, say, in the magic year of 1358,

969
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:37,740
and look up some kind of refugee party action that's going on there.

970
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,560
You'd be sure.

971
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:47,340
That a phenomenon like Bob Dobbs would be sometimes necessary.

972
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,300
And would sometimes be necessary.

973
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,020
There you go, friends.

974
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:59,780
And that's hour of slack number 1,677.

975
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,480
There, I said it right that time.

976
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:04,960
Okay, Dave, now I'm going to go,

977
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:09,480
and it's because I've had the air conditioner off for an hour to record stuff,

978
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,380
and it's sweltering.

979
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,380
It's just...

980
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:14,100
It's sweltering.

981
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,820
You have your swollen little nipple.

982
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,080
In one hour.

983
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,160
No, they're shrunken in the heat.

984
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,880
In just one hour, it became really noticeable.

985
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:24,240
Yeah.

986
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,140
Yeah.

987
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,920
And the upstairs, we have two units.

988
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:35,780
The upstairs has to be handled by a different air conditioner machine and heater.

989
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:38,640
I had to get that repaired last week, too.

990
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,820
Thank goodness it was a cheap repair.

991
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,440
It was just that the drain wasn't draining right.

992
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:48,680
And the guy showed me how to unclog the drain pipe, and everything's fine now.

993
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:51,760
It only cost me $100 for him to show me that.

994
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:53,020
Well, that's good.

995
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:54,280
That's amazing.

996
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:55,780
So...

997
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:57,260
Have anybody do anything for...

998
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,100
Right, he actually...

999
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:01,800
Oh, and we had a little fender bender with the car.

1000
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:07,240
It was the kind of thing that a body shop would charge you $1,000 to fix.

1001
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:12,720
Well, my nephew, the snake-killing nephew, happens to also be an expert.

1002
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,280
He's a car mechanic.

1003
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:19,120
And he walked over and just took a...

1004
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,020
To look at it, and he fixed it with his bare hands.

1005
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,620
He just reached underneath and forced all the metal back into shape.

1006
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:33,040
He's going to get, like, a blow-up doll, rubber blow-up pool toy or something,

1007
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:39,320
and insert it behind that thing and then pump it up a little bit more to fill it out completely.

1008
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:43,440
And, yeah, that's what they charge you $1,000 for.

1009
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,020
What one guy can...

1010
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:49,260
One muscly guy can do by sticking his hand underneath the bent fender

1011
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:54,920
and physically using his own strength, pounding it back out.

1012
01:05:55,420 --> 01:06:02,100
You can hardly tell, except for the scratches, you can hardly tell what happened.

1013
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,440
And I don't want to say.

1014
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,580
It wasn't me, though.

1015
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,800
Well, I wasn't the pilot.

1016
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:10,780
You were the exchange student.

1017
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,320
I was still in bed.

1018
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,860
Anyway, Dave, we have to go.

1019
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:20,960
I have to go, and you have to go, and I'm going to turn on the A.C.

1020
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,640
Okay, turn it on, man.

1021
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:28,280
And we'll sell some Neighbor Worlds, by God, if we keep not shutting up about it.

1022
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,620
By God, by God, somehow, it says.
