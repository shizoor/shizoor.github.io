1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380
Bob?

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:03,960
Bob?

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,480
Bob?

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,780
If you happen to tune in within the last few minutes and you are wondering about what's going on,

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,740
we'd like to tell you that this is a program about...

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,000
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,920
We want to pry into people's private lives to record anything that is really none of our business.

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,780
As you can see on the large screen behind me,

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,880
we're keeping track of things on one of our many manned space stations now in orbit,

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,420
while the small screens below show other activities being monitored by mission control.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,940
I'll have them repeat it on the upper screens for you also.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,020
SSL, this is instrumentation.

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:50,860
Roger.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,780
SVO, start port recorders and TV video tape.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,200
Record.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,860
Roll call.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,840
Ah, yes, dear friends.

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,620
Welcome to hour of slot number 1839.

19
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,040
And I'm not sure exactly what all's going to be on this one,

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,580
except there may be a lot of me talking.

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,980
Reading, actually.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,800
Because I came home from X-Day,

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,320
missing something I had sort of expected to have.

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,720
I have a lot.

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,240
In fact, I have too much.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,360
And that makes the editing trickier.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,360
And I'm behind and late.

28
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:48,300
So I don't know what we're going to do tonight or today or this morning or wherever you are.

29
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,580
But I do know this.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,280
Stock up and save.

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,560
We'll get through this.

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,040
Everyone, play in school.

33
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


40
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


42
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


43
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


44
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


45
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


46
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,040


47
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,920
And look, pay Bob Bonham in my book.

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:58,920


49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:58,920


50
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,760
Pay Bob to show you how.

51
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,740
Read the pamphlet, study it.

52
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,420
Memorize it.

53
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,000
You'll wonder aloud how such priceless wisdom can be sold—

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,140
But that supporting an online course didn't quite work at great leisure.

55
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,760
Legally, and all for less than $2.

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,200
Tell your friends and family about your slack until their ears bleed.

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,980
And that's from the Dobstown Mirror.

58
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,660
And now this.

59
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:11,120
The Dobstown Mirror.

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,120
The Dobstown Mirror.

61
00:03:41,140 --> 00:04:04,860
The Dobstown Mirror.

62
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,580
The Dobstown Mirror.

63
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:22,460
They comfort me in mayonnaise and then they ate my bones.

64
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,080
The bumblebees caress my skull.

65
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,220
The queen protects her drones.

66
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,360
She moistens them with jelly paste.

67
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,120
Until they're...

68
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,980
Until they're fully grown.

69
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:54,060
They penetrate my tender flesh, ignore my pleading moans, and torture me with mayonnaise

70
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,900
before they eat my bones.

71
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,380
Until they're fully grown.

72
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,400
They torture me with mayonnaise.

73
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,640
So they can eat my bones.

74
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,200
And of course, who else could that be but the Rudy Schwartz Project

75
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,220
from the new album adjacent to the latex gerbil?

76
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,220
You ought to check out his videos, too, on YouTube.

77
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,020
They do the same thing to your eyes.

78
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,700
This episode has me reading a lot, but it's peppered with collages,

79
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,000
mostly by Reverend Norrell Preff and Lee Murr.

80
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,260
Later, you'll hear both the fake and real news of X-Day.

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,800
Which is which?

82
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:14,980
Which?

83
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,660
But first, this.

84
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,280
Pretty lies.

85
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,020
Some cults, once you join, you think you're supposed to get along with every other cult member,

86
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,760
so you keep your mouth shut when you're supposed to.

87
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,280
You were the one who joined, but you aren't allowed anymore.

88
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,860
Only getting along is allowed.

89
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,400
In the Church of the Subgenius, once you join, that's it.

90
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,040
The rest is up to you.

91
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,500
Believe me, we do not all, quote, get along, unquote.

92
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,200
Heck, I even hate myself sometimes.

93
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,020
Yet we're all still subgenius.

94
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,460
But maybe you'd rather just get along.

95
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,100
Hey, what's that?

96
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,680
Bob!

97
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,340
Bob!

98
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,520
Bob!

99
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,320
Are you hurt?

100
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,040
Bob!

101
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,460
Bob!

102
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:13,980
Bob!

103
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,000
Hi.

104
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,160
You faker.

105
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,440
Steve, you know what this is, don't you?

106
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,860
It's a time-space warp.

107
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,840
I'm not sure I know exactly what that is.

108
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,520
I don't suppose anybody really does.

109
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
We've seen some strange things tonight.

110
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,120
Strange creatures that we know don't belong on our planet.

111
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,340
God only knows where they came from.

112
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,280
Jenny and Ben.

113
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,640
Ste pods were heard early this morning.

114
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,520
Bob's been trapped, diving around forever.

115
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,920
He's found Have you escaped the

116
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:58,920


117
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,740
I as always thought you looked like a ghost in my head,

118
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,780
...the guard over you.

119
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:14,780


120
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,160
We can discuss the first dimension at length.

121
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,940
The second dimension is widely known.

122
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,720
And the third dimension has been studied in depth.

123
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,020
Yet there exists a realm beyond.

124
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,380
A world 65 light years east of nowhere.

125
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,140
There it is just ahead.

126
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,460
A dominion of sight and sound.

127
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,220
A universe that twitches and howls in three quarters time.

128
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,180
A place we know as Swonk.

129
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,900
Yes, Swonk.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,460
Where reality peaks at 3.14 in the afternoon with such clarity and sharpness you'd think it would shatter.

131
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,780
Where traffic signals radiate black light.

132
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
Where the dogs of war battle apes of wrath.

133
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,060
This is Swonk.

134
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,440
And dear friends.

135
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:23,700
Swonk is a comic book or a magazine or a collection of comics originally published in the Arizona Daily a long time ago.

136
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,180
It's by Greg Pettix who wrote these things.

137
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,560
And Reverend Chris Silla who sent me this copy of this collection.

138
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,080
And even though it's a comic book with drawings I'm going to read some of the cool writing from it.

139
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,760
Because it's cool writing.

140
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,380
And some of them I can describe the drawings.

141
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,100
And I'll skip the ones where I can't.

142
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,940
Here's a short one.

143
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,460
And they're all short.

144
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,120
After I dropped out of college I worked at a grocery store in upstate New York.

145
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,640
One day I was looking for price stickers near the register.

146
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,000
And I saw something strange.

147
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,060
And it shows the buttons on the register such as...

148
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,940
Tax.

149
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,180
Return.

150
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,880
Angel override.

151
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,960
Void.

152
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,120
Angel override?

153
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,260
Maybe this was the silent alarm of the apocalypse.

154
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,180
The glowing red bat phone to God.

155
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,660
One touch would summon an army of angels.

156
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,140
Jehovah's howling commandos sliding down from heaven on fire poles of pure light.

157
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:42,760
Dodging stun pumpkins while their M16 harp rifles spat out clean and holy death.

158
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,740
Boy, there's a great picture of the apocalypse happening there.

159
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,600
Then again, maybe not.

160
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,280
There's only one button I have faith in.

161
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,600
And it shows a finger pushing the cash register button that reads void.

162
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:12,560
And here's one panel in which we see a psychosomatic hunchback ascends to the papal throne

163
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,500
on a platform of sacramental bourbon and scantily clad altar boys.

164
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,780
Displeasing the legions of cool youth deacons who voted for Cardinal Blaze,

165
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,600
the self-styled pastor of disaster.

166
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,900
And Cardinal Blaze looks like a skeleton cardinal with a skull head.

167
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,280
And he's on fire.

168
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,880
And the psychosomatic hunchback pope looks like an ape.

169
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,960
Saying hoo-ha with a big jug of bourbon.

170
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,440
This is all a bit reminiscent of the late S. Clay Wilson.

171
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,140
Somewhat in style.

172
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,320
But also very, very different.

173
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,200
Swonk.

174
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,960
Bjork's stork forks the pork.

175
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,620
But Hank's dank tank stank.

176
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,540
Meanwhile,

177
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,540
Bob's job selling food,

178
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,660
fobs to mobs,

179
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,500
and hobnobbing with snobs,

180
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,340
makes Rob's blob sob.

181
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,980
And such a sad picture of Rob's blob sobbing,

182
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,040
with tears running into the box of five-cent apples.

183
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,520
Wherever you are, however you are, this is the BBBB.

184
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,940
Today, the US Senate have been torturing prisoners.

185
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,660
BBBBB News.

186
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,620
The United States has said that it's bad.

187
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,880
An Iraqi deputy interior minister had been paralyzed by three people in Hunan province.

188
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,860
Others had had their skin peeled off during the BBBBB.

189
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,680
The French Parliament has approved violent unrest in a number of French cities and towns.

190
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,220
The interior minister told Parliament that he was beaten and stabbed in the capital, Tunis.

191
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,880
The Tunisian government has denied that it was behind the organized United Nations attack on Wednesday.

192
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,280
China says it's producing more than 100 million doses of bird flu,

193
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,460
and is producing more than 14 billion human deaths from bird flu in a day.

194
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,420
The US government's announced it intends to take the grisly interior secretary, Gail Norton,

195
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,220
off its list of endangered secretaries.

196
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,480
Look at that caveman go.

197
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,200
Plato's theory of forms was an explanation.

198
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,580
It's an explanation of universals, perceived laws of nature,

199
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,440
such as animals giving birth to animals like themselves, etc.

200
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,320
Plato's theory is that there's a form or ideal version of all things,

201
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,380
and physical forms are imperfect emanations of it.

202
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:05,780
There's a perfect ideal human ideal that physical humans are imperfect emanations of.

203
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,020
It makes just as much sense to say that there are even less perfect,

204
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,640
and even more perfect ones above the ideal we perceive.

205
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,780
Otherwise, you're in that familiar bait and switch of

206
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,300
everything has a cause, except that one thing.

207
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,000
And now this.

208
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,660
The

209
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:40,860
The

210
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,460
The

211
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,500
The

212
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,380
The

213
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,000
The

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,240
The

215
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,280
The

216
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,320
The

217
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,320


218
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,620
The

219
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:10,780
The

220
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,000
The

221
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,720
The

222
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:11,920
The

223
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,620
The

224
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,640
The

225
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:13,660
The

226
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:13,660


227
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:13,720
The

228
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:13,720


229
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:13,740
The

230
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:13,740


231
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:13,880
The

232
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,140
The

233
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,140


234
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,140


235
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,200
The

236
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,200


237
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,680
The

238
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,680


239
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,220
The

240
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,120
The

241
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,520
The

242
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:18,520


243
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,680
Be alright

244
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,460
Down the road of peace

245
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,780
Watch the Snatch Base, man!

246
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,100
Everybody wants to know

247
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,680
what the hell happened to X-Day?

248
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,560
For 45 years, Bob said that the world was going to end

249
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,840
at 7 a.m. on July 5, 1998,

250
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,720
and he's still saying it!

251
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,080
Even the normals want to see the end of the world.

252
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,120
They're musking for it.

253
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,040
Everybody secretly hankers for that Judgment Day porn

254
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,880
in which their enemies fry,

255
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,240
and they, of course, are spared.

256
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,820
Every other Hollywood blockbuster

257
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,580
has some movie star saving the threatened world

258
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,280
by using his muscles and going,

259
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,500
AHHHHH!

260
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,800
Plus you have your Heaven's Gate

261
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,420
and your Jonestowns and your Wacos,

262
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,500
where some little band of weirdos

263
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,900
manages to make the world end,

264
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,480
at least for themselves.

265
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,000
Then there was...

266
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,900
the Y2K bug.

267
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,800
Remember that?

268
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,060
The pin kooks were all running around like ninnies,

269
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,340
fretting that their precious ATMs

270
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,740
and other false slack doohickeys

271
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,720
would shut down, crash, fail to reboot.

272
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,320
They should be so lucky!

273
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,720
The day the con calendars,

274
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,280
called July 5, 1998, came,

275
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,260
and no immediately discernible world cataclysm occurred,

276
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,900
what a disappointment!

277
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,100
Oh, people made fun of the subgenie,

278
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,580
they mocked our serious beliefs,

279
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,060
but did we care?

280
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,800
Hell no!

281
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,660
We're religious nuts!

282
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,280
Did the Jehovah's Witnesses

283
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,900
quit coming to your door

284
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
just because the end of the world

285
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,280
fizzled out six or seven times in a row?

286
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,940
Did the Scientologists stop believing in L. Ron Hubbard?

287
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,080
Are we going to let the Jehovah's Witnesses

288
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,980
or the Scientologists out-kook us?

289
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,900
X-Day!

290
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,160
X-Day might not come for the next 200 Julys straight,

291
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,440
but the true subgeniuses will maintain

292
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,520
unquestioning faith in Bob's word and prophecy.

293
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,980
If Dobbs says the world ends July 5, 1998,

294
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,540
then that is what will happen!

295
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
The only thing proved by the events of,

296
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,200
quote, July 5, 1998,

297
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,420
is that we have no idea what year this really is.

298
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,080
At 7.15,

299
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,280
on 7.598,

300
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,860
upon closer inspection of the original prophetic memo from Dobbs,

301
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,680
we encountered the 8661 quandary,

302
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,060
the so-called upside-down bar napkin theory.

303
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,800
The subgenii, at large,

304
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,820
were not exactly overjoyed by the idea

305
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,020
that somebody had repaired a torn memo

306
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,400
by placing part of it upside down

307
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,000
and that we might have over 6,000 years to wait

308
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,060
before we get the image of the original.

309
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,400
We were not sure if we were going to be able to

310
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,400


311
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,400


312
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,420
We were sure that we were going to get the image of the original.

313
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,680
But that's just one theory.

314
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,580
I've been telling and telling you people,

315
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,780
hollow earth.

316
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,860
Everything turned inside out.

317
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,920
All the stuff that was on the inside is on the outside.

318
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,320
Holes at the poles seal up

319
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,800
with Jehovah One and all pinks inside

320
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,320
where it gets to eat them forever.

321
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,020
New outside looks exactly like old outside,

322
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,660
but pinks are replaced by identical,

323
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,560
flesh robots.

324
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,300
When we return after a thousand-year pleasure cruise,

325
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,860
we're given new flesh robot bodies

326
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,940
exactly like the ones we lost on July 5th, 1998.

327
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,300
Our memories are wiped back to X-1

328
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,300
and we live out our lives exactly as we would have

329
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,300
if X-Day had never happened.

330
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,700
I remember from last time.

331
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,240
Well, that's what Nenslow predicted.

332
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,160
And for all we know, it came true.

333
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,180
Dr. Howell, besieged by whimpering gimme bobs

334
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,200
complaining about the post-X-Day world,

335
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,680
shared this doctrinal rebuke

336
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,880
with the poor, wandering livestock.

337
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,740
Dear Seeker, please calm yourself.

338
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,560
It's not the end of the world.

339
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,400
The official line is a tissue of flapdoodle

340
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,340
involving a misreading of the launch date

341
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,680
as scrawled by Bob himself.

342
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,400
On the back of an envelope, allegedly,

343
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,160
Stang read the year upside down

344
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,040
so that the year would be the year of the moon.

345
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,980
The year 8661 A.D. was thought by the scribe to be 1998.

346
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,960
This would have the effect of giving the church

347
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,180
more time to accomplish its mission.

348
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,280
Uh-huh.

349
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,960
However, I prefer to believe in the original prophecy

350
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,980
to wit, we are now in the new aeon.

351
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,080
The rupture indeed took place according to schedule

352
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,900
in the early morning.

353
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,300
Were you awake?

354
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,740
In a twinkling of Bob's eye,

355
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,840
the faithful, which I trust includes you,

356
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,340
were caught up in the clouds, in the so-called saucers,

357
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,660
and returned in time for breakfast.

358
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,180
All predicted changes are happening or will happen,

359
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,880
not according to human standards of time,

360
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,780
but rather in accordance with the movements,

361
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,800
whether in epicycles or quanta,

362
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,500
of the cosmic clock,

363
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,080
which may only be read by superhuman optic

364
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,760
or other sensory organs.

365
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,880
A religion that could be completely comprehended,

366
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,240
and fully interpreted,

367
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,680
would be a toy, fit to be encapsulated,

368
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,640
and folded up to be put in one's pocket.

369
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,160
But behold, we show you a mystery.

370
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,460
Isn't it universally accepted that one of the few things

371
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,740
we do know about the aliens is that when they abduct you,

372
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,940
they always put you back?

373
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,140
That the abductees do not immediately remember the details?

374
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,660
What in the name of Whitley Stryber,

375
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,860
were you people expecting?

376
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,300
Without springing for a conspiracy psychiatrist,

377
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,100
look back, recollect in tranquility, if you will,

378
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,240
dare to disturb with a ripple of self-inquiry,

379
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,120
the deep pool of your unconscious memory.

380
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:34,000
Now then, are you sure you can completely account

381
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,060
for your activities at 7 a.m. on July 5th, 1998?

382
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,720
Austerely yours, Dr. Howland Owl.

383
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,100
Others insist that X Day worked out, but only for Bob.

384
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,520
We know that Bob makes a million dollars every time he screws up.

385
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,640
In 1998, we had 10,000 dues-paying subgenius ministers

386
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,920
that felt Bob screwed them big time.

387
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,060
That's 10,000 screw-ups.

388
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,580
Ten times one million dollars per screw-up,

389
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,640
or ten billion dollars.

390
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,880
That's how much Bob stood to lose should X Day succeed.

391
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,540
Maybe a delay.

392
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,560
A day of X Day was engineered by Dobbs

393
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,140
after he convinced his customers for this galactic drug deal,

394
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,160
the Elder Gods, that he could brew up an even more pure grade

395
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,140
of the drug in question, that being human soul,

396
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,880
given a little more time.

397
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,620
With Bob's cultivation of the church,

398
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,300
he was providing enough variation in the additives

399
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,000
to keep them wanting more.

400
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,740
On July 3rd, 1998, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon related this parable.

401
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,640
Two bulls, an old one and a young one,

402
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,020
are standing on a hilltop,

403
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,880
looking at a herd of cows in the valley below.

404
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,660
The young bull says,

405
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,300
Hey, pops, let's run down there and fuck some of them cows.

406
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,640
The old bull replies,

407
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,560
No, let's walk down there and fuck all of those cows.

408
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,360
So maybe that's what Dobbs is really up to with this rescheduling.

409
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:16,820
And friends, there are many more theories.

410
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,120
It was all just a joke theory, the total recall theory,

411
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,960
and there's a description of what really happened at Brushwood

412
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,100
by Onan, which is a whole other story.

413
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,660
But, uh...

414
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,980
You make me happy when I am blue.

415
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:36,880
Too low.

416
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,680
1-800-1961

417
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,240
I'm acting just like an animal.

418
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,700
There's all the time I need and all the time I want.

419
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,360
Ample.

420
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,300
Antithesis.

421
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,540
Are you hungry?

422
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,060
Are you in good hands?

423
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:00,740
I'm hungry, too.

424
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:08,780
The World of the Dead

425
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,680
The World of the Dead

426
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,840
Ashes of a Dead World

427
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,500
And he moved an entire community back into the Dark Ages.

428
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,200
Better blood!

429
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,000
Better blood!

430
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,400
Bob called me.

431
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,100
I sing the body electric.

432
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,720
I sing the body electric.

433
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,040
I sing the body electric.

434
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,240
I sing the body electric.

435
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,500
Burn up.

436
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,580
But I made love.

437
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,280
I can't even play Perry Como.

438
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,340
Chip off the old block.

439
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,380
Chip off the old block.

440
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,080
Come on out.

441
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,380
A dimension of mind.

442
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,220
Don't make any noise when the music's playing.

443
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,520
Don't paint the sun anymore.

444
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,760
Don't paint the sun anymore.

445
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,460
Don't touch.

446
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,020
Don't touch my tool.

447
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,920
Depths paid.

448
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,140
Listening to someone talk about who or what they love,

449
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,140
isn't that a pleasure,

450
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,700
no matter who the who is or what the what is?

451
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,900
Listening to someone talk about who or what you are supposed to love,

452
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,820
eh, a mixed bag, eh?

453
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,480
Except when it's the church of the subgenius.

454
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,140
Everybody likes,

455
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,260
dislikes,

456
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,660
is indifferent to,

457
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,060
or is ignorant of,

458
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,020
Bob.

459
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,220
And that's a fact.

460
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,360
Oh, thank you,

461
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,580
er,

462
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,620
the Rudy Schwartz project for the background music,

463
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,780
which is called,

464
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,660
uh,

465
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,900
well, the album is called Frop Music.

466
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,580
And now this.

467
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,280
The men in white picked him up yesterday.

468
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,060
With a nutskin.

469
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,140
Not the squirrels, ha ha.

470
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,480
We ish, and I ish, ma allus.

471
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,580
Yoizay, yoizay, yoizay, yoizay, yoizay.

472
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,400
Oh, and then the days got worse.

473
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,440
And then the days got worse.

474
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,340
How it last days let me out.

475
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,260
I needs to pray.

476
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,540
Beg, oh yes, I.

477
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,580
I need to take me away.

478
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,620
Ha ha, yeesh.

479
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,680
We are sitting in a

480
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,560
gaza high.

481
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,380
The funny farm where life is

482
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,560
beautiful all the time.

483
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,400
And you'll be

484
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,460
stay and play with my new friend.

485
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,180
I'm normal, I'm okay, uh.

486
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,400
Where the people all smile while I

487
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,280
I'm here.

488
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,460
But this.

489
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,440
He, hoizay, oh.

490
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,460
You would make me flip my lid.

491
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,620
It was a joke and so you laughed.

492
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,580
And you, the day you swore you'd all

493
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,240
Ha ha.

494
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,280
Ha ha, they're coming to take me away.

495
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,740
Oh, hee, ha ha.

496
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,480
To the valley.

497
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,980
There's no arms in the distance

498
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,420
to serve you.

499
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:34,980
We mad.

500
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,140
And

501
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,840
happy they took you away.

502
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,500
Ha ha.

503
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,120
Oh, no!

504
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,560
Bird ham and ass bread rumors had stopped.

505
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,400
Who and how I should cut my hair.

506
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,480
Look upon all them tom-tom-tom-tom.

507
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,120
And you're right.

508
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,180
I am making friends.

509
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:48,480
You.

510
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,440
I cooked your food, I

511
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,060
And that gives me the

512
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,620
get-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a

513
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,400
Losing you would surely make me

514
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,000
And

515
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,580
They're coming to take

516
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,580
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

517
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,140
Bush as though they are sweet.

518
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,140
Ha ha.

519
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,440
Well, you just

520
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,280
You'll get just what you deserve.

521
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,660
Where's trees and grass and I don't

522
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,500
Just my thumbs and feed my lizard.

523
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,700
To drive me sane.

524
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,360
He he only miss ah ha ha ha he he.

525
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,220
Here to you.

526
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,380
And that's the day

527
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,460
And they're coming

528
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,760
Where life was ludicrous all the time

529
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,540
And they're coming

530
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,260
They're coming

531
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,860
They're coming

532
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,600
They're flowers and chirping birds and birds

533
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,560
Who speak and smile and twiddle their

534
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,260
On the wall

535
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,260
Big and tough

536
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,340
At the start of every disaster movie

537
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,060
There's a scientist being ignored

538
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,820
And or a scientist being heated

539
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,520
But that's what disaster movies are for

540
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,000
Disaster

541
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,120
If you're making movies in your head

542
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,340
And most of us do

543
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,200
Make the ones you want to see

544
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
That might be a disaster movie

545
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,400
But it might be some other kind of movie

546
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,200
See what other genres are available

547
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,300
In your mind

548
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,220
When I don't have my head stuck

549
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,120
In a black hole

550
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,620
I always listen to the hour of slack

551
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,980
Because it makes me

552
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,180
Less than I like to listen

553
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,240
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

554
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,840
In Bedlam Cathedral

555
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,640
Organ grinders float

556
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,260
Pokas up to the vaulting

557
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,420
While a chorus of he-nuns

558
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,900
Speak in tongues

559
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,040
Behold the high pope of insanity

560
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,040
Drooling into the

561
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,160
Sacred clemato

562
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,660
Preaching the oral

563
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,060
Torah of ghost stories, knock knock jokes

564
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,220
And Paul's letters

565
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,860
To the penthouse forum

566
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,180
This is the chapel of

567
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,920
Madness

568
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,700
Where the holy trinity goes

569
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,720
Nyuk nyuk nyuk

570
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,300
Spam transubstantiates

571
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,000
Into the flesh of Liberace

572
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,580
And one plus one

573
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,880
Plus one

574
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,360
Equals one

575
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,920
Here's one in the EC style

576
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,820
Greetings

577
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,860
My fellow parish

578
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,720
Inners

579
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,740
And welcome to the catacombs of Rome

580
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,440
I'm your faithful

581
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,540
Storyteller

582
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,080
The sub-pope

583
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,420
Caretaker of the Catholic Church's

584
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,220
Forbidden library of pornography

585
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,480
And apocrypha

586
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,700
I call this little yarn

587
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,380
Rubbed raw

588
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,920
The USS Nazarene

589
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,000
Recon ship for the church's

590
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,560
First interstellar crusade

591
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,900
Streaks through space

592
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,980
In search of souls to convert

593
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,800
The mother superior was deathly afraid

594
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,600
Of star travel

595
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,880
So afraid that her praying became

596
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,680
Almost

597
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,040
Most ungodly

598
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,700
Oh please god don't let me die here

599
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,980
Please god don't let me die

600
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,180
Look at her

601
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,960
The way she obsessively rubs those rosary beads

602
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,440
It's inhuman

603
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,000
The space papists

604
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,300
Finally arrive at Pius 12

605
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,280
Look crucifixes as tall as skyscrapers

606
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,120
Steeples that reach the clouds

607
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,520
Could it be possible

608
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,800
Wait wait

609
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,860
What's that up ahead

610
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,440
Jesus Mary and Joseph

611
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
It's freaking huge

612
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,140
Oh god no!

613
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,660
No!

614
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:12,660


615
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:12,660


616
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:12,660


617
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,200
The giant creature cracks open the ship

618
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,000
Decapitates the crew

619
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,100
And strings their heads on a long cable

620
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,780
It bellows in a strange tongue

621
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,480
As it rubs the mother superior's skull

622
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,600
Between its fingers

623
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,540
And as everything goes black

624
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,680
She realizes what the alien is doing

625
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,580
It is praying

626
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,420
Well sister

627
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,700
How does it feel to have someone

628
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,660
Praying on your ship?

629
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:42,840
On you

630
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,480
Amen

631
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,800
Eh eh eh

632
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,180
And the monster oar is saying

633
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,260
Spa Fon Squa Chonk

634
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:02,000
Which is secret comic book code alien talk

635
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,100
From the olden days

636
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,240
And you know let me say this

637
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,300
His number is 13013

638
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,580
And he also has an email address

639
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,720
It's uh uh at uh uh dot org

640
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,680
That's uh uh at uh uh dot org

641
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,340
And that's all well and good

642
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,440
But here then is the story of the 26th X Day drill

643
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,280
Previously called 24 X Day quote 2021 unquote

644
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,680
Uh uh this is my story of what I just did last week

645
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,460
And how it came about

646
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,840
This beautiful young subgenius

647
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,620
Named Reverend Exanthea Octoshroom

648
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,680
Started suggesting to me

649
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,740
Way back in the days of Myspace

650
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,440
That we hold an event at

651
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,360
The Land of the Lakes Florida

652
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,060
Nudist Resort

653
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,500
Owned by her and her dad

654
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,300
Oh nothing happened for many years

655
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,100
Then in 2019

656
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,800
Exanthea visited us at Stang Ranch

657
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,780
In person

658
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,280
And amazed me at how together she was

659
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,300
Despite her jaw dropping good looks

660
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,800
She's a professional model

661
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,260
As well as a hard working art bum

662
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,680
Like myself and a fossil collector

663
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,840
And nudist resort owner

664
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,020
In 2020 I started letting people know

665
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,920
That for a bunch of reasons

666
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,020
I was having to retire from running

667
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,660
X Day at Wisteria or anywhere else

668
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,820
Dr. Argus Fox, Fid Chooley, Reverend Pease

669
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,960
And a few others heard that as a clarion call

670
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,920
They visited the resort

671
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,760
And the next thing I knew

672
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,040
They'd bought me a plane ticket

673
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,360
To 24 X Day at Land O' Id

674
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,380
Promising me fine health food

675
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,640
Turned out to be all McDonald's

676
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Because they just got too busy

677
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,840
And they even hired a subgenius Uber driver

678
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,600
Our friend Reverend Nugget

679
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,500
To take me to and from the airports

680
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,900
How could I say no?

681
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,020
They also offered Philo

682
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,520
And he said no

683
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,860
So they called Dr. Hal

684
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,080
Who is up for any program

685
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,780
And despite some challenging thunderstorms

686
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,860
Which are typical of any X Day drill

687
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,520
The event went great

688
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,740
Largely because the venue

689
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,560
Land O' Id

690
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,260
Is perfect for our purposes

691
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,800
Flush toilets

692
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,860
A pristine swimming pool

693
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,280
Indoor clubhouses

694
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,220
Covered stage

695
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,900
And it's in town

696
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,060
No more 45 minute drives

697
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,100
For beer, cigarettes and hot dogs

698
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,620
It's a huge supermarket

699
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,920
Five minutes away

700
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,100
The turnout was like the last several drills

701
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,760
At Wisteria in Ohio

702
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,460
Only about 40 people

703
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,600
Many of them were new to me

704
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,500
And some were local Floridians

705
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,960
But I was astounded

706
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,620
How many came from far away

707
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,480
Like the band Rubik's Cube

708
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,440
From Pennsylvania

709
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,160
They're veterans of X Day

710
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,240
Ohio and New York X Day

711
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,540
Since Lord Rockstar was about 15

712
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,960
Because he's the son of

713
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,040
Old Reverend Sintholtimus X Mortis

714
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,440
Reverend Negative

715
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,660
And Reverend Katana 007

716
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,560
Of the band Sub G Kids

717
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,040
Came from I think Indiana

718
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,860
They got engaged on the way there

719
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,800
And I married him

720
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,660
On July 4th

721
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,420
After their wedding

722
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,100
Before the performance

723
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,720
Or maybe before the

724
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,400
I don't remember

725
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,920
Lord Ferg came

726
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,500
Also I think from Indiana

727
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
With a house trailer

728
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,180
Which came in really handy

729
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,700
For our great preacher

730
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,640
Papa Joe Mama

731
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,740
Who had his little daughters with him

732
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,480
And he did not let them see

733
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,460
His performances

734
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,640
Or much of anything else

735
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,180
Lord Ferg's been a huge help

736
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,620
In every way at X Days

737
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,340
Going back to the Brushwood days

738
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,600
Also super helpful

739
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,340
Were Reverend Aster

740
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,440
The wife of Fox

741
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,700
I married them too

742
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,760
Many drills back

743
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,600
She was kind of the mom

744
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,560
Of this drill

745
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,340
Reverend Walter Cosmack

746
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,280
Was once again another great help

747
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,320
And supplier of the coolest art gizmos

748
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,360
And art robots

749
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,660
A new person who helped a lot

750
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,660
Was Reverend Dirty Instigator

751
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,340
She was one of the few subgeniuses

752
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,600
Who was actually nude

753
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,120
Most of the time

754
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,940
Luckily she's young and healthy

755
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,740
And we had the cleanest

756
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,660
Bobtism of all time

757
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,420
For the land of Id

758
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,040
Has a swimming pool

759
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,120
A really nice one

760
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,620
No more water spiders

761
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,500
Leeches

762
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,760
Or mystery moss

763
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,060
And no old sequoia either

764
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,060
But that just means

765
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,660
Nobody had to be sacrificed

766
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,580
This year

767
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,940
Every day there were

768
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,360
Radio shows during the day

769
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,520
Some with boring old pros

770
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,840
Like Dr. Howell, Papa Joe and myself

771
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,440
Some with highly excited rank amateurs

772
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,960
Some with modern podcaster baiters

773
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,680
Like the Time for the Show Boys

774
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,680
There was an Ask Dr. Howell show

775
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,040
And there were so many bands

776
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,020
That I'm still trying to sort out their names

777
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,720
As well as my recordings

778
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,840
Apparently I'm the only person

779
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,140
Whose recordings weren't destroyed by the rain

780
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,880
Unfortunately mine are all from my phone

781
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,340
Or my little ambient laptop

782
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,000
Or my location recorder

783
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,960
The line recordings that we wanted most

784
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,900
Got drowned on the last night

785
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,880
And the roughness of my recordings

786
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,140
Means longer editing and tweaking time

787
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,080
So getting the good bits out on this show

788
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,500
May happen gradually

789
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
An excellent bob dummy was burned

790
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,220
On the last night

791
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,040
The head was provided by

792
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,600
Hel Swami Satellite Weavers

793
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,820
Who made the best bob sculpt

794
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,880
And can make plastic masks from it

795
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,900
Under that plastic mask was

796
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,680
A skull

797
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,620
In theory the fire would melt the plastic face

798
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,900
To reveal the skull

799
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,500
A la the melting Nazi face in Indiana Jones

800
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,360
Sadly the body of the dummy

801
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,820
Which was sitting up in a chair

802
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,840
Was spineless

803
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,340
And it flopped forward during the burn

804
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,040
So the skull reveal never happened

805
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,820
Still it was a bob burning

806
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,820
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!

807
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,880
We have a flashlight

808
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,820
We have a flashlight

809
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,480
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!

810
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,340
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!

811
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,200
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!

812
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,020
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!

813
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,920
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!

814
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
It's a bob on fire!

815
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:50,860
Uh oh

816
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,780
He's caught on fire

817
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,460
His suit blazer is ablaze

818
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,560
His lap is hot

819
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,160
Hot lap of bob

820
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,260
Take that bob

821
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,940
Burn it to hell pink boy

822
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:12,800
Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

823
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,120
Oh, he's spoken now!

824
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,620
Hey, look at that!

825
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,360
Look at the collar there, Bob!

826
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,300
Hey, Bob! Do you got a lighter?

827
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,700
Where's the hot dogs?

828
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,420
There goes the pipe.

829
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,080
The pipe is hanging.

830
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,900
He's about to let go.

831
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,220
That's it, man, when the pipe falls.

832
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,180
The pipe!

833
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:46,940
The pipe!

834
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,320
The pipe!

835
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:56,140
My God, it's like his face is just melting off of that stupid thick bonehead skull of his.

836
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,060
Sick. Sick, sick, sick.

837
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,100
This is just a sick, sick spectacle.

838
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,200
Oh, I can't believe it.

839
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,700
Oh, my God, look at that.

840
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,800
Oh, no! That's it.

841
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:18,060
Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

842
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:24,140
More fire! More fire! More fire! More fire! More fire!

843
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,680
I need a rag.

844
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,820
Look what we're doing.

845
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,000
To Bob, man!

846
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,920
What a nightmarish spectacle.

847
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,580
The rams, they just stand there staring at the burning of Bob.

848
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,540
I want to hear some Kill Bob's and watch people run around that ring.

849
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,980
Too bad there's no pagans around to be drumming and, you know,

850
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,720
celebrating everybody stripping their clothes off.

851
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,180
Dancing around the damn thing.

852
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,020
Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs!

853
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,680
You kind of need the pagans sometimes.

854
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,700
Yeah, I agree.

855
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,100
We got him. We finally got that bastard.

856
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,660
We killed Bob. Again.

857
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,940
There doesn't seem to be anything left of him in here.

858
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,140
Well, I can't wait for the sausage to come.

859
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,040
I'll stick around the damn reverend's thing.

860
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,360
I know we're kind of bonded by a murder now,

861
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,940
but let's just make sure we don't call the cops, guys.

862
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,060
No. When you have problems,

863
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,200
you call the cops, as Chicken John said.

864
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,320
Then you have the problem and the cops.

865
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,400
Well, now that we're bonded forever by this murder,

866
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,480
we have to take a blood vow.

867
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,220
No, we don't. No?

868
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:40,800
Isn't that how it goes?

869
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,000
No, we just don't advertise it.

870
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,800
We don't leave our DNA at the seams.

871
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,020
Smart move. Smart play.

872
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,440
Proof that Bob does not just quit.

873
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,000
He gets fired.

874
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,900
You're fired, Bob.

875
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,120
You must remember.

876
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:02,140
People watch the line of drinking to make sure you have alcohol and fire on every level of your home.

877
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,380
Remember.

878
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,000
If someone in your household smokes or is under the influence of fire,

879
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,940
you must be aware of Ontario.

880
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:09,560
You must remember.

881
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,180
I'm a dangerous drinker.

882
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,920
You must remember.

883
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,280
There's more to responsible drinking than alcohol and fire on every level of your home.

884
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,500
Orange Blossom Brewery donated 50 cases of beer.

885
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,760
They arrived on Friday and we were down to only 10 cases by Monday.

886
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,440
Miraculously, no one was hurt or had to be dragged out of the road by me.

887
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,660
Simply amazing.

888
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,220
One reason may be that it was all IPA beer.

889
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,180
Specifically, back in the day, IPA.

890
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,020
And many people can't handle the bitter taste of IPAs.

891
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:54,360
I love them, but as a good role model, I didn't ever get very much of an impact.

892
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:54,940
I'm a very good drinker.

893
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:54,940


894
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,080


895
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,080


896
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,980
Very drunk.

897
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,400
Crap, that's the one we got.

898
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,100
It's the only one they had, dude.

899
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,220
Orange Blossom Brewing.

900
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,280
Back in the day.

901
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,160
IPA.

902
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,060
Stang, you should come see this.

903
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,160
Oh my god.

904
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,660
Orange Blossom Special.

905
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,140
Oh, this is dangerous, man.

906
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,480
This is an accident waiting to happen.

907
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,340
This is suicide.

908
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,900
Well, yeah, but...

909
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,820
This is Jonestown.

910
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,660
We're walking Heaven's Gate all over again.

911
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,820
You guys are nuts.

912
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,300
I thought we were a different UFO cult.

913
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,840
Yeah, how many...

914
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,840
There's only going to be about 40 people here.

915
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,080
This just gives me a feeling of utter horror.

916
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,580
And fear.

917
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,920
Well, that's why I brought you here.

918
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,620
No, to terrify you.

919
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,480
I'm so glad this didn't happen under my watch.

920
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,700
I fear the vomit.

921
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,960
I fear the bodies in the road.

922
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,060
I fear the bodies in the road.

923
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,800
Somebody's hitting the garden hose.

924
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,720
They're not dead, but they'll feel that way the next day.

925
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,260
Shit and puke.

926
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,160
Shit and puke.

927
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,040
Shit and puke.

928
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,860
The forces. Australian for undrinkable piss.

929
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,640
You guys are all going to end up like me and Hal.

930
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,300
Amazing orange blossom.

931
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,160
Broken backs.

932
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,940
Yep, that's a lot of beer.

933
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,840
How I began my career as an alcoholic.

934
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,060
Many people think that.

935
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,720
It will take years to fall under the spell of John Barleycorn.

936
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,620
But here at the Church of the Subgenius,

937
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,560
we have our accelerated program of

938
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,440
inebriation for the enlightened.

939
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,600
Which I will now initiate.

940
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,840
I also spent about every other hour inside Reverend Xanthea's house,

941
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,680
which has AC,

942
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,100
and also is a lot like my house,

943
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,780
since she's also a fossil hunter

944
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,060
and a connoisseur of crazy art and antique furniture.

945
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:55,060


946
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,340
And weird decoration.

947
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,200
Including her own excellent

948
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,000
sexy sci-fi surrealist paintings

949
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,080
shown here on slide three.

950
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,940
I was treated like a king

951
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,560
when I wasn't getting ball busted

952
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,140
for being a high muckamuck.

953
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,600
The Bulldotta auction was full of killer stuff.

954
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,060
I got some rare Doc Savage reprints

955
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,940
and a 2020 election chess set

956
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,540
that has to be seen to be believed.

957
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,060
And my old friend,

958
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,060


959
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,060


960
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,180
my old pal Papa Joe Mama,

961
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,320
had action figures made of him and me.

962
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,340
They don't look anything like

963
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,280
either of us really,

964
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,840
but hey, at least we have action figures.

965
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,180
Friends, I have to drop in

966
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,120
and mention that

967
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,760
those action figures

968
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,860
are not available.

969
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,760
They were banned from stores

970
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,520
after protests by the

971
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,040
National Union of Teachers and Nurses.

972
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,920
How about that?

973
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,020
And a new guy,

974
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,600
Reverend Grindstaff, brought a

975
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,840
dozen of Dobbshead spin art

976
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,420
paintings that a lot of people bought.

977
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,000
And he was a new guy who seemed

978
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,740
to quickly make friends with everybody

979
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,260
and there were a lot of new guys.

980
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,420
He made a lot of new friends.

981
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,100
And when I say guys, I mean ladies as well.

982
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,060
That's kind of

983
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,780
sort of what X-Day drills

984
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,780
are good for. Standing around

985
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,040
in the road talking.

986
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,320
That's my favorite part.

987
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,780
Although a lot of us

988
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,900
old timers missed a lot of

989
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,680
fellow old timers like Reverend

990
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,780
Fousey, Reverend Fousey,

991
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,820
Reverend Fite,

992
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,080
the amino acids,

993
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,640
the circus apocalypse clowns on drugs,

994
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,100
Potter and Petal Nostril,

995
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,120
Philo,

996
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,780
and also everyone who died

997
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,180
such as Reverend Heathen

998
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,780
and Dr. Dart, just to name

999
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,660
a very few.

1000
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,860
On the last day, Tropical Storm

1001
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,740
Elsa was bearing down on Tampa

1002
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,700
and I basically got the last

1003
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,080
flight out to Dallas

1004
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,780
because the airport closed

1005
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,120
hours after we took off.

1006
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,260
Awaiting me at home

1007
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,940
were a ton of orders

1008
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,220
to fill including 16 memberships

1009
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,100
bought between July 1st

1010
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,020
and July 5th. That happens

1011
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,120
every X-Day drill.

1012
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,480
Are these people smart?

1013
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,280
Or superstitious?

1014
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,820
Or both?

1015
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,180
Because

1016
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,880
they're held at campgrounds instead of

1017
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,120
in motels, every X-Day drill

1018
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,600
presents

1019
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,480
some kind of terrifying

1020
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,040
and inspiring

1021
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,100
miracle of nature.

1022
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,760
And those are always my favorite

1023
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,340
parts of the drills because

1024
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,760
I love nature.

1025
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,920
When the rain

1026
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,480
started drenching everything

1027
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,280
the first day the miracle happened.

1028
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,660
Suddenly there were walking

1029
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,780
catfish all over

1030
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,280
the yards and porches.

1031
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,100
The whole resort.

1032
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,320
I mean everywhere.

1033
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,760
There are these smallish black

1034
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,740
stinking catfish that

1035
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,020
drag themselves by their front fins

1036
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,060
out of the big central

1037
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,920
pond looking for new

1038
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,840
bodies of water and bodies

1039
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,840
of new spouses.

1040
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,080
I loved it. It was so

1041
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,920
weird for me. I come

1042
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,760
from a dry, dry land.

1043
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,180
But here fish

1044
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,000
rained from the sky and walked

1045
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,440
upon the land.

1046
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,060
Signs in the heavens and signs in the

1047
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,060
earth. It had to be the real X-Day.

1048
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,920
Or at least Exanthia Day.

1049
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,020
I spent an hour helping

1050
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,760
Exanthia clear them from her

1051
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,100
big enclosed porch

1052
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,120
which has its own little pond.

1053
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,540
And I ran around helping all the employees

1054
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,500
and residents carry the stranded ones

1055
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,520
back to the pond lest they

1056
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,560
dry out and stink later

1057
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,820
before they got wherever they were going.

1058
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,700
I mean they stink

1059
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,660
bad enough when they're still alive.

1060
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,600
Anyway friends let me

1061
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,700
close by saluting my new

1062
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,560
fellow victims of

1063
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,040
Devival Host Syndrome.

1064
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,500
Not that many people have had it.

1065
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,160
But here's some new ones

1066
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,340
that lived through it.

1067
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,640
Dr. Argus Fox, Reverend

1068
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,980
Fid Chooley, and Reverend

1069
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,700
Pease, and Reverend

1070
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,640
Exanthia. They

1071
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,440
saved X-Day.

1072
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,860
Praise them.

1073
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,940
And praise that man

1074
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,660
Bob. And

1075
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,680
thanks to CyberChump

1076
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,900
for the background music which is from

1077
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,880
their CD called

1078
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,440
The Construction of Things.

1079
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,060
We're pointed at the

1080
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,060


1081
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,060


1082
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,660
I'm half crazy.

1083
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,560
I'm half crazy.

1084
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,800
I'm half crazy.

1085
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,760
I'm half crazy.

1086
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,660
I'm half crazy.

1087
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:14,820
Crazy.

1088
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,460
I'm half crazy.

1089
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,280
Colossus have been by Norrell Preff

1090
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:27,640
and the New York Times.

1091
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,140
And also Lee Murr.

1092
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,760
Incidentally, I got some good news.

1093
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,880
The recordings from X-Day that I was hoping for

1094
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,240
came through.

1095
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,240
The rain did not destroy everything after all.

1096
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,600
But next, well, you know how sometimes

1097
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,220
the only way to get rid of a maddening earworm

1098
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,380
is to foist it onto others and infect them with it?

1099
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,560
Well, that's what I'm about to do to you

1100
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,200
with this song by the Swingin' Love Corpses.

1101
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,860
It's one of my favorite songs of all time,

1102
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,460
but I was never,

1103
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,060
satisfied with the recording,

1104
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,080
which is from a cassette of a VHS tape.

1105
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:05,240
But I worked it over with my magic compression

1106
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,300
and normalizing tools and just with magic.

1107
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,240
And either I've ruined it because I'm, after all,

1108
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,200
partially deaf and have no business

1109
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,720
attempting to sweeten sound,

1110
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,840
or I actually did make it sharper and clearer.

1111
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,120
Hopefully, it's still the worst, best brain worm ever.

1112
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,640
It's unusual for a Swingin' Love Corpses song

1113
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,640
because it's not by any means a good song.

1114
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,900
It's by either of the Drummond brothers,

1115
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,520
but by their cousin, guitarist Ray Hay.

1116
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,740
Remember how earlier I said I loved nature?

1117
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,700
I said that because I knew I'd end with this.

1118
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,580
Here's Nature, I Hate It.

1119
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,700
Oh, this music in the background, by the way,

1120
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,740
is Cyber Chump.

1121
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:07,080
It's Después de Nadir-

1122
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,340
We don't expensively worry too much

1123
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:08,340


1124
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,000
It's Después de Nadir.

1125
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,080
It's Pies Seh körner-

1126
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,800
Don't ask me about clockwork-

1127
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,780
It's I guess I've made something已經

1128
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:11,780


1129
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:11,820


1130
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:11,820


1131
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:11,820


1132
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:11,820


1133
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:11,820


1134
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,000
It'sní uma fiel 이거는

1135
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,020
Конечно in husbands

1136
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,020


1137
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:22,620
My line

1138
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:27,000
You're the best

1139
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,060
Well, it's been a while since time began.

1140
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,680
A bad struggle against nature, forcing nature against man.

1141
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,580
Tectonic plate movement, a simple quicksand.

1142
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,820
Nature has the power, nature has the upper hand.

1143
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:44,880
Nature!

1144
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,160
I hate it!

1145
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,020
Nature!

1146
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,280
I hate it!

1147
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,060
Well, the forces of nature come in many degrees.

1148
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,600
Maybe a forest fire, plague or killer bees.

1149
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,840
Maybe an earthquake or maybe typhoon.

1150
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,580
Tornadoes, volcanoes, rains and monsoon.

1151
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:15,980
Nature!

1152
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,400
I hate it!

1153
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,220
Nature!

1154
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,520
I hate it!

1155
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,120
In the baby's direction.

1156
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,380
Blue glitters.

1157
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,400
Wipe out a whole species.

1158
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,860
How does that make you feel?

1159
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,820
Got your hole in the earth.

1160
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,940
Fill that hole with plastic.

1161
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,840
The way we treat our planet.

1162
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,840
One other planet.

1163
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:06,020
A relation of strength and knowledge.

1164
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,400
Way out of your world.

1165
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:07,400


1166
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:13,860
No time for words.

1167
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,800
Green jungle.

1168
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,060
Humanly romantic children.

1169
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,020
Blue widget

1170
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,340
Thank you.

1171
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,120
Thank you.

1172
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,760
Thank you.

1173
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,560
Thank you.

1174
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,760
Thank you.

1175
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,680
Thank you.

1176
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,540
Come on!

1177
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,280
Ugh!

1178
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,020
Come on!

1179
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,400
I don't want to get off the stage.

1180
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,700
Who told me to get off the stage?

1181
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,920
Am I just paranoid?

1182
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,180
Rationing reason?

1183
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,360
You can't think that.

1184
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,560
What if everybody thought like you do?

1185
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,920
That's what some people say.

1186
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,980
Friend, the evidence is clear that not everybody thinks like I do.

1187
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,460
You can pick your battles and you can pick your friend's nose,

1188
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:14,220
but picking your battles is better than letting a nosy friend pick them for you.

1189
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,600
I support my thinking far less about what people support, including myself.

1190
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,080
Heck, is some other people.

1191
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:30,620
Thank you, Uncle Dr. Onan Canabite, for the Dobstown Mirror.

1192
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,960
I'm falling.

1193
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:44,400
And I can't get up.

1194
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,420
Calling Dr. Howard. Dr. Fine. Dr. Howard.

1195
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,360
No, I'm a doctor, not a mechanic.

1196
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,660
We're losing potency in our antimatter parts.

1197
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,740
My mind is growing.

1198
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,460
I can feel it.

1199
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,200
You see? You see?

1200
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,660
You're stupid minds.

1201
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,320
Stupid. Stupid.

1202
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,500
Mark it with a T.

1203
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,660
There are any number of popular ethical thinkers who are now forgotten

1204
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,720
because they said things like,

1205
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:18,960
do not turn to bitterness because an object you covet is unobtainable.

1206
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,400
But here we are, all these centuries later,

1207
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:23,740
still repeating,

1208
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,800
the jokes of the funny animal stories of Aesop.

1209
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:32,700
I say, sour grapes, and you know what that means.

1210
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,280
But animals can't talk.

1211
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:41,640
Is that too smart for your own good 1990s atheistic attitude

1212
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,640
that assures alienating the audience?

1213
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:52,520
And that's a whole bunch of A's there from the hole called the Dobstown Mirror.

1214
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,160
About what?

1215
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,580
Which you may learn more if I can find the inside front page.

1216
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,880
Go ahead, I'll fold it up.

1217
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,600
Yeah.

1218
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:11,940

Reverend Onan Kanabite at P.O. Box 3,

1227
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:47,720
Columbus, Indiana, 47202.

1228
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,000
Yes, that really is P.O. Box 3.

1229
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:58,320
And Bob's P.O. Box really is not Box 808,

1230
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,140
as much as I would like it to be.

1231
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:10,320
It's P.O. Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1232
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,220
Thank you, the Rudy Schwartz Project, for the F.R.O.P. music album in the background,

1233
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,980
and to Dr. Onan Kanabite,

1234
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:23,500
for all of that stuff I read.

1235
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:28,660
For you see, friends, as it says in Prescriptures 55-58,

1236
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,500
the devil cannot seize up a bald man by the hair,

1237
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:36,980
but God will put food in the beard of a man.

1238
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,080
Pretty cool, huh?
