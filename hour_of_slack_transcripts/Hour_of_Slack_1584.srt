1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
I want to see the last places on earth.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,760
Now, why are you here?

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,460
We're looking for the Marifesa Lupino Lumino,

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,660
a strange flower which grows only in Tibet

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,400
and which, it is said, takes its life from the moon.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,140
Is there really such a flower, Father?

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,020
There are some things it is better not to bother with.

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,840
Our coolies tell us the valley we want to visit is filled with demons.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,260
Then we're right. This is the place. Get the ponies.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:26,560
Right.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,560
You are foolish, but without fools, there would be no wisdom.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,560
Pax vobiscum.

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,460
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slang.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,820
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,400
And then this Democrat mayor gets up.

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,160
He said, wow, I think it was Donald Trump.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:26,360
I think it was Donald Trump.

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,500
It was done for us.

19
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,660
Everyone's a fuckhead. Their brains are full of pus.

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,460
Tra la li.

21
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,640
With the yodel fire.

22
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,800
Everybody gather up. Come on, go past the bar.

23
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,280
Straddles get down from a main to Seattle.

24
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,860
Hop and skip and chop.

25
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,400
It's time to be a sociopath.

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,000
They vote for Donald Trump.

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,580
Part of the problem and part of the reason it takes so long

28
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,960
is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore.

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,540
Right.

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,700
And they're being politically correct the way they take them out.

31
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,660
Look at my African-American over here.

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,520
Look at him.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,060
Are you the greatest?

34
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,440
I love the old days.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,760
You know, I think you should do the guys like that when they were in a place like this.

36
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,480
They'd be carrying them on a stretcher.

37
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,380
Oh, Lord, how will we dance and how we talk?

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,380
The coast.

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,020
The fluster.

40
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,520
Maddox will rise up and sing the song.

41
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,020
Wopty doodle buddle dum.

42
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,520
He's completely nude.

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,940
Donald's got a boner.

44
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,860
That's because he's not a prude.

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,160
Knock on doors and get involved.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,920
Rise up and take a stand.

47
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,000
Donald Trump's the guy to make America great again.

48
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,120
Are you watching Infowars or spit it all on your chin?

49
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,320
Lubricate your rectum with your fist.

50
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,560
It will distend.

51
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,260
Tra la li.

52
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,360
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

53
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,360


54
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,520
He'll depart the Mexicans, the Muslims and the Jews.

55
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,540
Draw Italy down.

56
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,700
Stump your head inside your own.

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,860
Join the clan, pick out your sheet and vote for Donald Trump.

58
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,480
Hop on dance, go bonnet, prance.

59
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,480
It's Mussolini's second chance.

60
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,120
Twenty million whites, supremacist, can't be wrong.

61
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,060
Tra la la.

62
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,260
You can tell me damn.

63
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Donald Trump can flatter and fool.

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,440
Depart the world.

65
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,620
Party hand in hand.

66
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,320
Ho, yo, yo.

67
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,560
Slippity-dippity-slump.

68
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,700
It's time for all the yelping cause it's time for Donald Trump.

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Everyone's a dumbass and the brains are full of lust.

70
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,980
It's time to bear the anger of all those who are for Donald Trump.

71
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,280
I can punch him in the face, I beg it.

72
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,480
We having a good time?

73
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,240
USA, USA.

74
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,360
USA, USA.

75
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,000
All right, yeah, get him out.

76
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,120
Try not to hurt him.

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:00,900
USA, USA.

78
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,740
If you do, I'll defend you in court.

79
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,540
Don't worry about it.

80
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,860
USA, USA.

81
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,120

USA, USA.

84
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,100


85
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,100


86
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,400
USA, USA.

87
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,400


88
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,400

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,400

USA, USA.

91
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:54,340
It's time for all the yelping cause it's time for Donald Trump.

92
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,800
Get in the car, get in the car.

93
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,380
Or sit in the home of a保守校.

94
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:56,380


95
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,560
Maybe it's all a temptation

96
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,040
Maybe not a combination that robs you blind

97
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,320
Or of the Africa damn time

98
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,120
Maybe I'm a little next time

99
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,180
Maybe I'm a little next time

100
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,080
Maybe it's all a temptation

101
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,200
Maybe I'm a little next time

102
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,540
Maybe it's all a temptation

103
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,900
Maybe it's all a temptation

104
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,260
Maybe it's all a temptation

105
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:11,220
Maybe it's all a temptation

106
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,040
Now I'm looking for a reason

107
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,880
To live without love

108
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,080
Now I'm looking for a reason

109
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,980
To live without love

110
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,180
This is a piece of dark time

111
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,280
This is a piece of dark time

112
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,280


113
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Maybe it's warm

114
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,260
just right for both you and me

115
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,200
Maybe it's warm

116
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,460
to be me

117
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,840
Maybe it's warm

118
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,620
to be me

119
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,860
probably just came for a train ride

120
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,860
just like the mountain

121
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,500
just like the mountain

122
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,160
will not be the same

123
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:39,100
Maybe it's Bob, maybe it's Bob, maybe it's Bob, maybe it's Bob.

124
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:47,100
Maybe it's Bob, maybe it's Bob, maybe it's Bob, maybe it's Bob.

125
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:56,880
Now I'm looking for a reason to live without love.

126
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,900
Now I'm looking for a reason to live without love.

Praise Bob!

138
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,420
I am the Reverend What the Fock, and I preach a holy trinity.

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,660
Father Reason, his loving daughter Tolerance, and the blessed Holy Spirit of

140
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,120
How you worship or don't is none of my goddamn business.

141
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,240
That is a trinity that can save the world.

142
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,460
Slack out.

143
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,680

And now you're on.

145

Your core is hot.

146
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,760
Meltdown.

147

Simulation is bound.

148
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,860
When life.

149
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,940
Shines.

150
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,460
Down!

When we connect, there's a chain reaction.

152
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,720
Keep our mind from getting close to distraction.

163
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,860
5, 6, 7, 8, now you must cooperate.

164
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
9, 10, 11, 12, never stop.

165

178
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,700
Oh, yes, dear friends.

179
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,960
This is fired by a huge Comet.

That band was the Fantastic Plastics.

183
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,480
And we heard them last night.

184
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,980
We went to see them last night at the Devotional.

185
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

186
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,240
At the Beachland Ballroom.

187
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,600
That was Friday and Saturday nights.

188
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,740
It was fabulous.

189
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,180
We saw a lot of our old friends and some great new bands,

190
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,940
including the Exposed Foreheads.

191
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,760
I've been playing them a lot on the show.

192
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:07,480
They did also a really, really tight show last night.

193
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,040
I'm going to play some of them in a minute here.

194
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,600
In fact, this in the background, Princess Wee,

195
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,780
is the other band by the same people called Cyber Chump.

196
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,440
It's instrumental music.

197
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,320
They're so good.

198
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:24,940
Yeah.

199
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,820
Really, really talented musicians.

200
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,580
Anyway, let me do credits here.

201
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,740
Yeah, we just heard the fanfare.

202
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,820
Fantastic Plastics.

203
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:37,300
And they do an amazing live show with excellent video projections.

204
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,000
Very slick.

205
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,440
And they're both real easy on the eyes.

206
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:49,160
That short rant there was Reverend Watt D. Falk.

207
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:56,440
That's his last name, F-A-L-K, D. Falk, with a little short rant.

208
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,620
The strange, somber, long song.

209
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,000
Maybe it's Bob.

210
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,000
It's from a new contributor, Reverend Experimental.

211
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,880
The aptly named Reverend Experimental.

212
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,000
And that song at the beginning, It's Time for Trump.

213
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,700
Well, of course, that was the Rudy Schwartz project.

214
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,940
That one was hot off the presses.

215
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,800
I think he put that out on the internet just like two days ago.

216
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,640
But we got a cherry.

217
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,180
Good copy.

218
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,920
Mm-hmm.

219
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:37,240
And yes, and now back to the folks who played at the devotional.

220
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,400
Two songs by the exposed four heads.

221
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,260
That's spelled with an X and a numeral four.

222

¶ Our innocence committed no sin.

242
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,780
¶ But the boat was tipping as the others got in.

243
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,200
¶ Disconnected, disconnected.

244
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,340
¶ We could be electric.

245
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,000
¶ Disconnected, disconnected.

246
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,200
¶ We could be electric.

247
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,440
¶ Disconnected.

248
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:28,440


249
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:39,960
¶ We could be кусack on a bottle. ¶ Disconnected.

250
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:39,960


251
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:39,960


252
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,120
You told me how you stole your heart. scheur!

253
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,940
¶ You told me how you stole your heart. ¶ But I know that you did your part.

254
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,260
¶ You told me how you stole your heart. ¶ But I know that you did your part.

255
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,920
¶ I've heard we're all in the same boat. ¶ Your friends or vampires bear your throat.

256
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,520
Disconnected, disconnected, we could be electric

257
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:02,480
Disconnected, disconnected, we could be electric

258
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:02,800
trick

259
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:20,520
Hang up, hung up, I got hung up

260
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:49,260
Disconnected, disconnected, we could be electric

261
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,100
Disconnected, disconnected, we could be electric

262
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,700
I got a box, what's in the box?

263
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,320
I got a box, what's in the box?

264
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,000
I don't know

265
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,380
I got a box, open the box

266
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:57,060
Alright, alright, stop. What now?

267
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,440
Open the box

268
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,000
You want me to open the box?

269
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,420
Yeah

270
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,220
I got a box, what's in the box?

271
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,360
Uh, nothing

272
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,420
I'll take more

273
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,480
Black, uit of the planets

274
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:49,500
Why?

275
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,680
I won't stand around

276
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:00,080
Pound I

277
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,280
Thank you.

278
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,120
Thank you.

279
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,260
Thank you.

280
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,000
Thank you.

281
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:14,740
Thank you.

282
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,520
Thank you.

283
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,180
Thank you.

284
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,460
Thank you.

285
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,760
Thank you.

286
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,900
Thank you.

287
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,680
Thank you.

288
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,680
Thank you.

289
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,360
Oh, yes, dear friends.

290
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,960
We're back in the studio,

291
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:52,260
and I think Lonesome may also have just joined us.

292
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,080
Mongoloid fue Mongoloid.

293
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,860
No longer...

294
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,140
Y lo determine lo que puede ser.

295
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,060
Mongoloid fue...

296
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,700
Fue Mongoloid y lo determine lo que puede ver.

297
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,520
Y lo prenie a casa del bacon y...

298
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,580
No, never mind, I'm sorry.

299
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,420
Por qué pork?

300
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,240
Yes, por qué pork.

301
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,100
Hmm.

302
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,580
That means it's porky pork.

303
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,740
Por qué pork.

304
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,580
My father thought that the word pork

305
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,900
was the most ugly word in the English language.

306
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,700
Well, that's why you used to slap him around, didn't you?

307
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,040
No, I never slapped my father.

308
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,340
Never ever.

309
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,740
Slap your mammy now.

310
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,560
Slap your mammy now.

311
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,320
Slap your daddy?

312
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,860
No, I've never slapped my daddy.

313
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,380
Well, we heard, Dave,

314
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,000
we must have heard eight different versions

315
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,860
of uncontrollable urge over the weekend.

316
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,060
It was great.

317
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,260
That's why I always want to convert my Mongoloid,

318
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,240
my Norteño version of Mongoloid,

319
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,300
and I never...

320
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,460
It's been, what, how many, 20 years now

321
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,040
when Reverend Tove invented the idea?

322
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,140
More like 100 years, Dave.

323
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,540
Oh, now I know you're trying to get my toenails to curl up.

324
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,320
Oh, before we forget, though,

325
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,340
your toenails curling up reminded me

326
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,140
of the cut we just played,

327
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,960
the rather amazing cover of a song

328
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,320
by They Might Be Giants originally.

329
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:18,740
Oh, yeah.

330
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,420
Called I Am Awake.

331
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:20,880
The Rick band.

332
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
It's called Am I Awake.

333
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,760
Am I Awake.

334
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,160
That was done by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,

335
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,880
who I think...

336
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,920
I think it was a friend of that.

337
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,360
They were old friends of his from a long time ago.

338
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,040
Was that when Tony Maimone was in the band, briefly?

339
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,300
I know nothing of...

340
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,620
In the late 1980s, I think.

341
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,380
I know no more about the Giants

342
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,440
than the way the dandruff piles up

343
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,220
on their shoulders where I'm standing.

344
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,280
Well, it's a good thing you understand things like that.

345
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
It's important.

346
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,780
Before that song by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,

347
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,200
there was a hard rock instrumental

348
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,860
that was by our buddy, Reverend Jimmy Ryan.

349
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,920
And that song, What's in the Box?

350
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,840
And the one before it disconnected,

351
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,420
those were both by Exposed Foreheads,

352
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,720
who we met for the first time.

353
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,180
And their foreheads are, in fact, exposed.

354
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:19,780
Yes.

355
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,720
And they did that song about sex aliens

356
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,020
that we played a couple of shows back.

357
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,940
They did that live,

358
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,500
and they had alien sex girls on stage.

359
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,020
They did.

360
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,560
Gosh.

361
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,120
I don't know if they were sex girls,

362
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,440
but they had kind of mini skirts and shiny outfits

363
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,820
and little antennae.

364
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,920
I'd call them space princesses.

365
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,560
Moon girls, actually.

366
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:39,900
Moon girls.

367
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,120
They looked a lot like the moon girl of Dick Tracy.

368
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,960
Mooner ladies, yes.

369
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,280
Yeah.

370
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,300
So, okay, I think that was the credits.

371
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,680
Oh, Dave, I wish you could have been there

372
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,480
at the devotional.

373
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,980
There was a band called We Are Not Men,

374
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,540
and they weren't.

375
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,620
They were young ladies who performed...

376
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,080
Sizzling hot young ladies.

377
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,180
Real accurate covers of Devo songs,

378
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,140
and while in costume,

379
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,020
the yellow radiation suits and red hats,

380
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,620
but then they did a costume change into negligence.

381
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,140
Their last song, they doffed the yellow suits

382
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,200
and were just wearing their black undies.

383
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,120
It was quite hot.

384
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,980
And stockings over their faces,

385
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,880
so their heads looked ugly,

386
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,300
but their bodies were...

387
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,400
Oh.

388
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,340
And the guitar real well.

389
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,520
And stuff.

390
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,260
I'm not really fond of that routine

391
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,320
of damaging your face

392
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,160
and then, like, putting on a pair of T-box or shorts

393
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,740
or, you know, letting your underpants grow.

394
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,300
Well, that was what...

395
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,880
No, you're thinking of the Spud Boys

396
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,760
who performed the next night.

397
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,380
That was the Spud Boys.

398
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,120
And they were, like, in the microgreens,

399
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,360
and they despoiled their panties.

400
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,720
You know?

401
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,000
Have you ever seen a rock band that used a trombone?

402
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,000
Yes, in fact, I have.

403
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,420
I was just over the house of a trombone player

404
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,620
who also played bass

405
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,420
and was in the Chronix band,

406
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,020
the Test 2 Baby.

407
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,640
I don't know if you remember hearing about that band

408
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,620
and song I was in,

409
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,400
the Punk Rock Days, Test 2 Baby.

410
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,740
No.

411
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,140
Chronix.

412
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,460
And Calling All Cardinals was the other side.

413
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,140
It was after they kidnapped the Pope.

414
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,060
And, yeah, he used to play trombone once in a while.

415
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,040
Well, yeah, bands have to change their names.

416
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,380
They have to change their names.

417
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,340
They kidnapped the Pope.

418
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,560
Well, this trombone player was Al Mothersbaugh,

419
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,820
part of that large Mothersbaugh clan

420
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,200
of musicians and artistes.

421
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,500
And he played, his band is called Massive Hot Dog Recall.

422
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,000
Mm-hmm.

423
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,320
And that was actually really funny.

424
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,220
It was hilarious.

425
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,600
Like other Devo-related stuff,

426
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,260
it has a real funny side.

427
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,360
How can you not?

428
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,700
All the bands that we know are novelty bands

429
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,620
where everybody has funny names and costumes

430
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,080
and wear masks.

431
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,420
That guy was absolutely hilarious.

432
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,320
He had so much energy, and he's just a nut.

433
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,980
Yeah, it was actually a really good musician.

434
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,020
It was like Herb Alpert, Eat Your Heart Out.

435
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,440
Yeah.

436
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,500
Trombones always add that comical effect

437
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,080
to any musical orchestra.

438
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,140
You know, frar, rar, rar, frar.

439
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,440
This was rocking, and he wasn't mic'd, I noticed.

440
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,020
He didn't need to be.

441
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,340
If you weren't kind of close.

442
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,460
If you weren't close, you might not hear it as well.

443
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,960
The trombone didn't need to be mic'd.

444
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,040
Yeah, and back in those days,

445
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,380
you never mic'd the horn section.

446
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,100
They were big and bad enough to do goodbye on their own.

447
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,800
Even a small band, like an old-time music band,

448
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,980
doesn't like to play completely acoustically,

449
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,680
and the singers stick out like someone at a caning,

450
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,760
which is what they used to, in Kentucky and West Virginia,

451
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,000
used to call a wake.

452
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,240
Huh.

453
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:54,980
A wake.

454
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,880
Especially if they were sleeping.

455
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:58,920
We, uh...

456
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,900
Saturday afternoon, we got there,

457
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,240
and our friend K.R.K. Ryden,

458
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,360
Reverend K.R.K. Ryden,

459
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,220
his band was playing,

460
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,600
called Ken the Magic Corner God.

461
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,180
I'll say the name of that band again.

462
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,160
Ken the Magic Corner God.

463
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,960
Not dog.

464
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,840
No.

465
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,580
No, God.

466
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,200
No, that's massive.

467
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,880
You're thinking massive hot dog recall.

468
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,780
This is Ken the Magic Corner God,

469
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,740
and believe it or not,

470
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,100
Dr. Philo Drummond is normally in that band.

471
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,380
Among other bands.

472
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,300
And he would have been there,

473
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,580
but he's moving to closer to Ohio,

474
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,020
so he probably will be.

475
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,420
Oh, and we saw our old subgenius friend,

476
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,040
Reverend Galaxina,

477
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,940
who's not old, but young.

478
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,300
Relatively young compared to us.

479
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,140
And we got to congratulate her

480
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,340
and Jerry Casale of Devo on getting married.

481
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:54,900
Yes.

482
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,260
Because Reverend Galaxina is Mrs. Jerry Casale now.

483
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,320
Another Jerry.

484
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,020
And we met Roger Casale,

485
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,660
the non-famous,

486
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,440
but equally funny and hard-working brother.

487
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,080
Yes.

488
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,760
And we gave our condolences

489
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,760
over the brother who died, you know,

490
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,300
because there's only three of the Devo's left.

491
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,820
Two of them were there last night.

492
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,180
Bob One was there also,

493
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,080
and I never got a chance to talk to him.

494
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,700
I didn't either.

495
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,840
And they didn't mention the earliest Bob drummer,

496
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,200
who...

497
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,560
I sued them for a million dollars

498
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,680
and remained friends while

499
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,840
pretending to be bare naked in the shower.

500
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,000
When we were fully clothed.

501
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,240
I don't know.

502
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,180
It's been a real Devo'd-up week

503
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,740
because we went to see that Mother's Ball art show

504
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,520
at the Museum of Contemporary Art,

505
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,160
which is...

506
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,520
Which is really not to be missed,

507
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,620
even if you weren't a fan of the band.

508
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,340
It's only five bucks on Fridays.

509
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,900
After five o'clock.

510
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,380
Right.

511
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
That's when we met.

512
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,620
Oh, it's so worth seeing.

513
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,760
And I want to go back.

514
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,080
It's only there for one more week.

515
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,060
Yeah, if you like that Devo Spuddy stuff

516
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,600
and related things,

517
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,620
boy, it was lots of fun.

518
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,680
Tremendous show.

519
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,780
And I'm a Devo fanboy.

520
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,800
I got up and spoke

521
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,580
and told my sexy gossip.

522
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,940
I didn't know that Jerry was going to be hearing all that,

523
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,640
but he heard me talking about some stuff that...

524
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,200
I guess if he didn't mind sharing it,

525
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,220
he wouldn't have been saying it in the first place

526
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,640
at the top of his lungs in a fancy restaurant.

527
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,160
It was about his first sex,

528
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,700
with a transgender person who'd had a sex change operation.

529
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,340
And he was...

530
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,180
Oh, I thought she was a transnationalist human.

531
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,000
He was told later...

532
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,560
Now, is it Alexina Casale is a transgender?

533
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,000
Well, no, but they...

534
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,620
No, but...

535
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,240
I don't know.

536
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,220
I mean, who knows?

537
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,860
Why not both?

538
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,820
That's my motto.

539
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,920
Why not both?

540
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,600
Well, why didn't you say so?

541
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:55,200
You made it sound like she had changed his neuter gender

542
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,700
to become a part of the...

543
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,580
No, no, no.

544
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,360
You weren't listening.

545
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:58,780
I was...

546
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,380
He was telling a story of his...

547
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,300
of being told after his night with a lovely young lady

548
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,000
that she had not necessarily been born as a lovely young lady,

549
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,260
but probably as a lovely young man.

550
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,660
And I can't repeat on public radio what his response was.

551
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,040
There's not a single bad word in it,

552
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,180
but just the concept is not suitable

553
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,240
for people to be able to think about.

554
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,420
The concept makes it...

555
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,080
an illicit thought.

556
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:29,740
Yeah.

557
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,060
The whole of the context is real, real, real funny.

558
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,080
So it leaves you open to about nine million different thoughts, right?

559
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,000
Like trying to get out of the elevator shaft, everything you...

560
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,720
Again, why does it have to be either or?

561
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,580
Why not both?

562
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,500
Okay.

563
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,140
Both.

564
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,740
I agree.

565
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,620
Well, the bathroom people are all upset.

566
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,800
We have to be either or.

567
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,500
I don't know about that.

568
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,960
Why not both?

569
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,400
The bathroom people...

570
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,360
The bathroom people are always upset

571
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,320
because their very name indicates that's what they are.

572
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,420
Bathroom people.

573
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,680
The bathroom people.

574
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,760
A John Waters film.

575
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,880
Dr. Bath...

576
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,060
Yeah.

577
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,540
Really, John Waters.

578
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:18,440
With Divine gobbling a French poodle from behind or something.

579
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,520
I don't know, but I certainly don't want to live there for too long

580
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,400
because they're out to get us.

581
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,740
Uh-huh.

582
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,160
Uh-huh.

583
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,140
Snack.

584
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:37,020
Speaking of John Waters, we listened to his hitchhiking book.

585
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,520
Yes.

586
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,520
He went hitchhiking across the country and wrote a book about it.

587
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,020
And you quoted some of it on a show once, didn't you?

588
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,200
I may have played a little bit of it.

589
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,160
Again, there was a lot of context stuff that was pretty intense.

590
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:57,060
It's tricky for public airwaves where there's a community that has standards.

591
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,080
It's a lot of decency.

592
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,100
Unlike our listeners who wouldn't...

593
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,240
Well, that's why we have the internet version, see?

594
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:04,780
Right.

595
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,200
And we are due to have an X-rated show that will not be on any of our beloved stations.

596
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,320
It will only be on the podcast, as it were.

597
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,160
On the Blue Channel.

598
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,520
Yeah, the Blue Channel.

599
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,760
There's some pretty sexy stuff on the subgenius Roku Channel.

600
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,480
It's a channel you can watch if you get a Roku device.

601
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,400
Stick it.

602
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,820
Stick it onto your modern-day TV.

603
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,380
It tunes in...

604
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:30,780
But it's Japanese, though, right?

605
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,380
Huh?

606
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,900
Roku devices are Japanese, aren't they?

607
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,940
I don't know.

608
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,980
It sounds like it.

609
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,300
It does sound like it.

610
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,820
But it rocks you.

611
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:47,100
Because you can look at Philo Drummond's subgenius channel on the OSI 74 channel.

612
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,300
Which, and a lot of other goofy stuff.

613
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,640
Sleazy P. Martini, Gwar's manager, has his own show.

614
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,920
He has a...

615
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,380
Yes.

616
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:57,380


617
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,040
Fright show.

618
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,300
There's a lot of horror hosts.

619
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,980
The network was founded by...

620
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,080
Mr...

621
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,080
Mr...

622
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,580
Mr...

623
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,380
Mr...

624
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,760
He's a Wolfman guy.

625
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,120
Yeah, Mr. Lobo.

626
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,920
Yeah, that's it.

627
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,660
Mr. Lobo.

628
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,680
How could I forget that?

629
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,020
Yeah.

630
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,900
He's a horror host in Detroit, I think.

631
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,640
Yeah.

632
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,360
They used to have Detroit and Cleveland hosts going back and forth.

633
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,760
Like, starting with Goulart and then going into the ghoul who was playing in Cleveland.

634
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,760
Then he would play in Detroit.

635
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,460
Then he'd explore some other place east and some other place west.

636
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,600
And then return to Cleveland.

637
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,760
Those horror hosts are an interesting breed.

638
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:43,860
They are.

639
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:44,900
I was...

640
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:50,120
We were in the company of one just last night.

641
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,680
We were?

642
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,800
Angry Lord Larry.

643
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,280
Yeah.

644
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:53,900
Oh, that's right.

645
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,280
Reverend Angry Larry is a horror...

646
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,340
Sir Cleveson.

647
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,340
He's been a horror host for years now.

648
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:01,520
Now, Sir Cleveson is his current character, who's a drunken vampire.

649
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,780
Who shows...

650
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,080
He shows bad movies and he makes them even worse.

651
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:13,860
He showed Mono's Hands of Fate and he re-edited it so it was even more spaced out.

652
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,240
How is that possible?

653
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,900
And he made it black and white.

654
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:17,960
Wow.

655
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,400
But, yeah.

656
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,400
Yeah, it's like he takes a movie that already kind of gives you a weird spaced out feeling

657
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,600
because it's so ineptly...

658
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:27,660
It's so ineptly done.

659
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:38,120
And then he exaggerates those like uncomfortably long takes and pointless reaction shots in

660
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,200
the wrong place and just kind of extends...

661
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,280
Does more of that.

662
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,320
The stuff that makes you stare.

663
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,820
Well, do you mind if I ask you one simple small question?

664
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,380
What was the name of the film where...

665
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,000
Where...

666
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,020
What's his name?

667
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,320
Where's the last man...

668
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:57,800
The last man in the world?

669
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,540
Well, there have been many versions of that.

670
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:07,600
You're probably thinking of The Omega Man was the version with Charles...

671
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:07,980
No, the Italian one with Vincent Price?

672
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:08,660
Yeah.

673
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,820
The same...

674
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,860
It's the same story.

675
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,680
It was called I Am Legend.

676
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,420
It was the original novel.

677
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,220
Yeah.

678
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,620
The...

679
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:21,380
And I think that's the title of the first movie of...

680
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,680
Richard Matheson wrote the book and a lot of other great things.

681
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,420
And...

682
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,320
And...

683
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,720
And I am Legend had a director who was a great actor.

684
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,700
And then they remade it with Charlton Heston and called it The Omega Man.

685
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:43,680
He dies crucified yet floating in water like his blood is going to save the world.

686
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:50,280
And then it was redone again with Will Smith as the human protagonist.

687
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,580
Yeah.

688
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,220
That's the most recent one.

689
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,540
And he was also the lamb's bread puppy.

690
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,000
He was one of those refused.

691
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,860
That's what they used to call them when everybody was Russian.

692
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,180
Remember that? The Dvořák days?

693
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,160
I remember the Refuseniks.

694
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,820
That was a great band.

695
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,960
They were against everything, but then there was also Blank Riot,

696
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,980
which I shouldn't say the name, but it reminds you of a cat.

697
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:14,720
Right.

698
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,600
Yeah. And so the archbishop was against them,

699
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,540
so that's why they all had to wear underpants at one time.

700
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,760
Well, we all had to wear underpants at one time,

701
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,200
and some of us have to wear extra giant, thick, huge underpants.

702
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,580
Not that the listeners have to envision that yet.

703
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,500
Why would you want to refuse them like a Refusenik?

704
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,140
In our case, quite yet.

705
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,500
But, you know, there's going to come a time, I guess.

706
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,680
Oh, Dave, this is exciting news.

707
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,220
You know how I'm completely deaf and have to guess what you're saying all the time?

708
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,080
No.

709
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,760
Well, I still am, but I got tested for hearing aids.

710
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,280
Princess Wee and I both went.

711
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,080
We went to the internet, finally, and she's got them.

712
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,540
And they work great for her.

713
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,560
Are you wearing one right now?

714
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:06,180
I had to take them off because there's a lot of feedback inside the headphones.

715
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,240
So I had to take them off temporarily.

716
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,880
I had to take them off all through the devotional because it was way too loud.

717
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,560
Right, we put plugs in our heads there.

718
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,640
Which, dang, does not have any of these earplugs.

719
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:24,140
Man, I not only flunked the hearing test, I flunked it so bad.

720
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,680
That they sent me to, let's say, a real doctor.

721
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,420
They said, you need your head examined, boy.

722
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,120
Your left ear and your right ear are completely different.

723
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,460
Damage.

724
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,680
He's got real serious damage.

725
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,460
He's got to have everything looked at before they'll even amplify it a tiny bit.

726
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,380
They're afraid they'll hurt him even more.

727
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,920
Yeah, so I've got to go to the shrink head.

728
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,840
Not the head shrinker, not a psychiatrist.

729
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,520
But I have to go to a guy who could...

730
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,980
An ear, nose, and throat guy.

731
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,800
Yeah, and they'll scan my head and scam my insurance company.

732
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,620
Yes, but you still won't be able to wear a hearing aid?

733
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:11,000
Well, eventually they'll go, okay, yeah, he's in bad shape, but there's no reason he can't have a hearing aid.

734
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,300
That's the eventual goal.

735
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:15,220
Or they may go, Mr. Stang...

736
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,340
That's Reverend Stang.

737
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,600
Reverend, whatever.

738
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,920
Mr. Reverend.

739
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,440
Mr. Stang, you're...

740
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,460
That...

741
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:30,780
You need to have another one of those operations where we split your face in half and drain all the pus out of the right side of your head.

742
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,380
It's like...

743
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,300
It's so old, it's like rocks.

744
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,760
There's insects from the Jurassic period trapped inside the amber in your head.

745
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:48,380
And we want to get that stuff out of there and extract the DNA from the blood in those mosquitoes, those ancient mosquitoes that flew in your ear.

746
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,940
And they make dinosaurs with it.

747
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,360
Right.

748
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,160
And make new...

749
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:52,880
Little dinosaurs.

750
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,580
Well, I'm not that old.

751
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,080
But maybe a woolly mammoth, you know?

752
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,840
Maybe a John Birch Society member, at least, you know?

753
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,040
We still have those once in a while.

754
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:06,920
I know, I know.

755
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,280
We kind of know one.

756
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:16,880
We have a friend who was raised by birchers and sort of would be a kind of a bircher, if you could.

757
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,560
Yeah.

758
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:21,040
Well, the John Birch Society was started by Mr. Coke.

759
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,700
$52 million off Joe Stalin while he was writing a book about how much he hated him, which...

760
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,680
Well, he should run for president on the Republican ticket.

761
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,220
Yeah.

762
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,740
It's not perfect.

763
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,160
Oh, no.

764
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,740
Unfortunately, this is the world we must live in.

765
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,140
There's not a shadow of truth anywhere, no matter where we look.

766
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,020
There's not an inkling, the smallest teeny iota of truth anywhere.

767
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:52,140
Oh, well, you can wait until you see my doctor's, my health report from my doctor.

768
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,560
And my hearing test.

769
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,460
That'll get me elected.

770
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,860
And we'll get you out of the army, that's for sure.

771
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,740
I don't know...

772
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,660
Well, I'll bet your mind won't be as funny as Trump's.

773
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,060
Have you seen that?

774
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:11,140
The thing that his campaign gave out as a doctor's report?

775
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:11,920
No.

776
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:12,840
I thought you were talking about...

777
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,000
It said flat out that he tested positive for every single test.

778
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,220
That means he's got everything they tested him for.

779
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,500
AIDS, syphilis.

780
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:21,580
Yes.

781
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,500
Dementia.

782
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,680
Scott Maria.

783
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,240
Yeah.

784
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,920
I mean, and it basically said,

785
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,480
this will be the healthiest man ever elected president.

786
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,460
Because he tested positive.

787
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:36,040
As if this doctor had tested the health of any other presidents lately.

788
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,940
But, yeah, it was written by Trump.

789
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,680
It was like something you'd bring your teacher to explain,

790
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,740
you know, like a fake doctor's note.

791
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:45,800
The dog ate it.

792
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,000
It was so obviously fake.

793
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,640
I still don't understand.

794
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,160
And yet, and yet,

795
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,120
they managed to turn it completely around and go,

796
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,380
well, Hillary slipped that one time.

797
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,120
And she's on some kind of medication.

798
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,200
So, obviously, she's mentally deranged.

799
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,300
Completely lost it.

800
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,840
Anybody could have done that hour-long speech at that convention.

801
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,560
Now, that wouldn't wear him.

802
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,380
Anybody could do that.

803
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,920
Yes, they certainly are.

804
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,580
You know, yeah, anybody with dementia could stand there for an entire hour

805
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,940
and never look like they were reading cue cards.

806
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,160
And never crack...

807
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,260
Never crack up.

808
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,420
So, who knows?

809
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,320
Yeah.

810
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,200
I know what you mean.

811
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,840
I certainly do understand that.

812
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,400
Because I've met people just recently who wanted to argue with me,

813
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,460
who claimed to have dementia.

814
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,060
They wanted to argue with me,

815
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,000
and they forget what they were arguing with me about

816
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,160
a few short minutes after they were done.

817
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,020
Really?

818
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,140
And they didn't have a teleprompter either.

819
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,980
They just had, you know, like some notes that you write on the inside of your hand,

820
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,560
like at school and stuff like that.

821
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,240
Like the secret answers to the secret tests and stuff.

822
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,200
And that's why I think everybody in this country,

823
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,560
the electorate, if you would call it that,

824
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:00,340
if you had the nerve or the bells to receive it in such a way,

825
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,300
is insane.

826
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,260
It's completely and totally insane.

827
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,780
I would say the average subgenius is saner than the average electoralist.

828
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,620
Well, we've always said that.

829
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,880
But, of course, we define sanity ourselves.

830
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,480
So, it's kind of a moot point.

831
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,200
We don't expect them to agree, but they can't even understand.

832
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,480
So, why would...

833
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:21,480


834
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,820
It's a moot point.

835
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,240
We can have great big fish fights like they used to have in Germany

836
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,800
before the Nazis took over.

837
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,000
We could, like, be punching each other in the street

838
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,560
and then police come out on horses and stuff

839
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,320
and club us over the head with broom handles.

840
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,440
We can do that now.

841
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,560
Well, yeah, we do do it now, don't we?

842
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,100
But just not enough, dude.

843
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:40,840
Not enough.

844
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,140
Well, now, you could have come to the Republican convention

845
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,540
here in town and caused a bunch of trouble,

846
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,640
but hardly anything really happened.

847
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,140
Everybody stayed indoors.

848
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,260
Everybody stayed indoors that whole week.

849
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,560
But weren't there some...

850
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,760
Except for the smattering of protesters

851
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,980
who were cowed and depressed.

852
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,580
Well, by the, you know, the presence of the man in blue everywhere.

853
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,520
Yes.

854
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,480
Our friends went to the farmer's...

855
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,380
Our buddies went to the farmer's market downtown

856
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,560
and said there were...

857
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,080
And they were not exaggerating.

858
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,120
There were more police than there were customers.

859
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,260
And our friend Michelle was out on Lake Erie

860
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,360
and police boats with arms...

861
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:21,920
That's right.

862
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,060
Boats with guns stopped her.

863
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,480
And she's like, I'm fishing.

864
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,960
You know, excuse me?

865
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,720
Michelle went fishing?

866
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:30,860
Yes.

867
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,360
Yeah, she was out fishing, I think, with some friends on a boat.

868
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,280
And they got...

869
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,160
They got not just pulled over by the boat police.

870
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:43,580
They got rather rudely handled.

871
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,360
Yes.

872
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,660
For no real purpose, you know.

873
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,560
Scared the dickens out of them.

874
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,420
And all they were doing was fishing.

875
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,400
Pointed guns at them, right?

876
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:50,820
Yeah.

877
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:51,100
Yeah.

878
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,460
Yeah.

879
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,240
Well, that's always fun.

880
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,300
Pointed damn guns at people who were out fishing.

881
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,480
There were mounted guns on the ship that they...

882
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,000
Or on the boat that came up to them, as I understood her post.

883
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,060
It was just ridiculous.

884
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,760
Yeah, I was exposed to something equally ridiculous.

885
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,400
I hate to say it, but good thing for her that she's Caucasian.

886
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,080
Yeah.

887
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,900
Because in this town, they've been known to shoot first

888
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,100
and ask questions later,

889
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,480
depending on how shiny you are in the light.

890
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,280
Yep.

891
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,920
Kind of unfair, if you asked me.

892
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,420
Way unfair.

893
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,580
It's where it's good to have pallor rather than squalor.

894
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,720
In Cleveland, O.H.

895
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,320
Place you want to be.

896
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,180
Especially if you're 12 years old

897
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,300
and you want to carry a pop gun around with you.

898
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,560
A BB pistol or something like that.

899
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,200
Yeah.

900
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,360
Could be attacked by helicopters, you know.

901
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,640
I used to do that.

902
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,820
But I had...

903
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,420
In those days, little kids could just walk around

904
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,880
and do anything with their dog.

905
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,940
And no leash.

906
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:53,840
Not that way.

907
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,940
And the dog was allowed to just poop anywhere.

908
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,880
Do anything with your dog.

909
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,120
That's not nice.

910
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,200
No, we could.

911
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,840
Back then, back before 9-11.

912
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,060
Speaking of 9-11 and going fishing,

913
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,680
I remember Bush was coming to Cleveland

914
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,460
right after 9-11 one time.

915
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,940
And the car...

916
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:17,840
And every town east and west of Cleveland

917
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,920
must have been full of these Secret Service guys

918
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,020
really angry looking.

919
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,240
And obviously not from around there.

920
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,480
You know, they thought they were in some kind of movie.

921
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,360
They all had sunglasses

922
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,220
and they dressed just like the movies and stuff like that.

923
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,720
And they had these government cars.

924
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,140
They'd drive around giving everyone angry looks.

925
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,580
I never understood what that meant.

926
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,780
That's a true story, too.

927
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,800
You should see how out of place they look

928
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,620
when they come...

929
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,500
When the FBI drives a caravan

930
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,160
into the Indian Reservation.

931
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,420
I was living at Rosebud Reservation

932
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,000
during the time I was there.

933
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,300
The time when the Crow Dogs Paradise

934
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,200
was being raided all the time.

935
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,880
That was a ranch that was people associated

936
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,280
with the American Indian Movement.

937
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,860
And it was...

938
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:09,780
I drove somebody else out there

939
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,760
to run in and warn them.

940
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,000
I was told,

941
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,340
if you run in and warn them,

942
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,460
they'll probably just sheet you

943
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,520
because you're a washi-chu.

944
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,280
And they don't know you.

945
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,460
But...

946
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:20,980
But...

947
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,140
But...

948
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:21,760
But...

949
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:21,760


950
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:21,760


951
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:21,760


952
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,860
We basically ran and said,

953
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,540
but there's a big caravan of dark cars

954
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,640
with guys in suits

955
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,520
coming slowly this way.

956
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,560
And they went, oh, okay.

957
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,740
But then it drove right past

958
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,200
and went to the other Crow Dogs Paradise.

959
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:40,280
And I think they did have some weapons there.

960
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,540
Because they were Vietnam veterans

961
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:47,280
and they had learned how to use heavy arms and stuff.

962
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,700
And they did have some stashed away.

963
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:50,980
Okay.

964
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,300
But it's never a good idea

965
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,160
to have a shootout with the FBI.

966
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,320
And if you ever hear about a shootout

967
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,380
with the FBI with me involved,

968
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,000
it's a lie.

969
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,560
Because I would never, ever do anything

970
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,980
to resist arrest.

971
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,100
Because I know that it lets the job for lawyers

972
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,360
to do all the shooting.

973
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,940
You let the lawyers do all the resisting and stuff.

974
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:17,640
Right.

975
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,720
I got beat up by five policemen

976
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,980
for about three hours.

977
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,340
And they never explained to me

978
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,220
until the very end

979
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,380
when I finally figured out

980
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,260
what it was all about.

981
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,600
I was charged with being left of center

982
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,560
on a one-way street.

983
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,580
Which sounds humorous,

984
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,980
but that was the actual charge

985
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:33,700
they were holding on.

986
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,560
They had no charge.

987
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,660
And they were just looking for stuff.

988
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,880
And they'd beat me up a little while,

989
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,920
throw me back in the cell.

990
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,540
Took all my clothes off

991
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:41,740
and burned me a couple times.

992
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:42,600
What?

993
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:43,880
And yeah.

994
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,440
And they had mace

995
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,640
and sprayed mace directly in my eyes.

996
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,740
I don't know why I can see to this day

997
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:50,440
because they were like,

998
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:50,820
I don't know why I can see to this day.

999
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:50,840
I don't know why I can see to this day.

1000
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:50,840


1001
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,400
The idiot sprayed me right in the eye.

1002
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,820
And they kept on saying stuff like,

1003
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,820
get the gun.

1004
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,580
Which when you hear someone,

1005
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,320
a cop say, get the gun.

1006
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:00,600
Right.

1007
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,940
That means you're dead.

1008
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,380
That means they're going to claim

1009
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,860
that you're trying to get a cop's gun.

1010
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,600
Anyway, I mean, you have to be insane.

1011
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,060
But police, people believe this stuff.

1012
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,300
And I was beaten so badly

1013
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,960
I couldn't open my eyes

1014
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,980
or shut my mouth.

1015
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:16,700
Goodness.

1016
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,140
I don't mean that in a funny way,

1017
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:18,560
but it's true.

1018
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,940
My eyes were kind of, you know,

1019
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,420
puffed shut.

1020
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,400
My mouth was puffed open.

1021
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,220
And we couldn't even get it.

1022
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,100
They were so tight until later.

1023
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,760
We couldn't even get a lawsuit against them.

1024
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,540
And then they finally did.

1025
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,340
And by that time,

1026
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,220
it was because they discovered

1027
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,520
vast inequities in that police department

1028
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,640
there in Columbus, Ohio.

1029
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,600
They were doing even weirder things

1030
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,360
to other people.

1031
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,180
I was just one of the many.

1032
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,060
I'm so glad you survived that, Dave.

1033
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:46,880
It's really scary.

1034
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,420
Oh, it is really.

1035
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,880
It was very, very scary.

1036
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,940
I have a gun pointed at your head

1037
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,620
and then click.

1038
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,640
Now, most of the time, to be fair,

1039
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,620
most of the time,

1040
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,980
police officers aren't beating people up.

1041
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,640
Most of the time,

1042
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,940
they're doing their job pretty much.

1043
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,660
It's just, but, you know,

1044
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,580
because I've known a lot of police officers

1045
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,420
and there is such a thing as good police officer

1046
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,860
and there's nothing better than that.

1047
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:13,300
But then there's the bad apples.

1048
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,360
And, oh, well.

1049
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,060
Oh, well, this is supposed to be

1050
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:17,900
the hour of slack,

1051
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,720
not the hour of black and blue memory.

1052
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,000
of poor, poor Dave.

1053
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,180
No.

1054
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,500
You know, I've tended to blame the victim

1055
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,460
in this case, though,

1056
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,380
just because you can.

1057
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,080
Why not?

1058
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,740
Yeah, yeah.

1059
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:34,980
Yeah, yeah.

1060
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,800
But that's what living America is all about.

1061
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:38,560
I was telling you,

1062
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,640
I was reading about that Howard Zinn book

1063
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,320
of people's history of America

1064
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,360
and I guess stuff like that's been going on

1065
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,140
for a long time.

1066
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,340
We just prefer not to pay attention to it.

1067
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:50,820
We prefer not to pay attention to it.

1068
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:50,820


1069
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,040
We prefer to switch off those reasoning lights

1070
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,900
and change channels, so to speak.

1071
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,700
Yeah.

1072
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,040
Yeah.

1073
00:54:59,480 --> 00:54:59,940
Yeah.

1074
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:00,860
Yeah.

1075
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:01,860
Yeah.

1076
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,060
Yeah.

1077
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,740
Friends, you're listening to the hour of slack

1078
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,880
from the church of the subgenius.

1079
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,220
We haven't been very religious tonight, have we?

1080
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:13,580
What do you mean?

1081
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:13,600
It's all religious.

1082
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,240
Okay, praise Bob.

1083
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,180
There, that part's done.

1084
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,860
Okay, Bob, now we can get paid, right?

1085
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,920
We should praise Bob.

1086
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,560
Bob will pay us now.

1087
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,500
Finally, after all these decades.

1088
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,000
Hmm.

1089
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,840
Heh.

1090
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:25,580
Heh.

1091
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,640
It's hard working for the rich.

1092
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,460
Just think of what a tautology that is

1093
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,140
or a twitch torment

1094
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,000
or a twitch torment.

1095
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,180
I used to shoot videos for rich people

1096
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:40,500
of their weddings and coming out parties,

1097
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,540
debutante balls.

1098
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,560
Yeah.

1099
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,680
That was when I learned

1100
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,380
that the most dangerous creature on the planet

1101
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,500
is not the deadly Tyrannosaurus Rex

1102
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,580
nor the brain-eating,

1103
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:50,820
immune-eating,

1104
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,380
but a rich, drunk person.

1105
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:54,700
Mm-hmm.

1106
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:58,440
That's the most dangerous, deadly monster on the planet.

1107
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,380
Too dangerous.

1108
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:03,720
Two drunk squires attacked me on their horses once.

1109
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:04,820
What?

1110
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,720
Like, what are you doing here?

1111
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,860
The road was clearly defined as a township

1112
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,700
or a city, whatever it was, road.

1113
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,900
But you're a cowboy.

1114
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,860
How could they attack a cowboy?

1115
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,720
And this one, you can tell they were both drunk.

1116
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:20,800
Yeah.

1117
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,120
Two of their faces are all red.

1118
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,200
And the woman did all the talking.

1119
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,320
The rather large, but not too large,

1120
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,820
like a poor person, large woman,

1121
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,260
she did all the talking and he did all the smirking.

1122
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,300
And they used their horses to bump against my car

1123
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,720
while they asked me what I was doing there.

1124
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,400
And of course, I got the hell out of there quickly,

1125
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,440
but it wasn't a private place.

1126
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,420
They thought they owned everything.

1127
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:50,780
They thought they owned everything.

1128
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,740
And they used their horses to bump against my car

1129
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:51,740


1130
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,080
I'm sorry.

1131
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,500
It was their wealth and drunkenness.

1132
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,840
I hate to tell you this, Dave,

1133
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,280
but that was me back before we knew each other.

1134
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,700
I remember that.

1135
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,460
This was a very, no, no.

1136
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,940
This man was very strange looking.

1137
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,660
He's the kind of rich person that made you go,

1138
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,460
it's one of them, the enemy.

1139
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,760
Well, if anyone needs to know more about how to escape

1140
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,360
the planet of the clocks,

1141
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,320
you can look at our website, subgenius.com.

1142
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,660
Although you may end up spending more time

1143
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,380
on any of the numerous Facebook pages

1144
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,020
because they change a lot more often.

1145
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,100
Subgenius.com changes once a week,

1146
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,400
usually on Monday or Tuesday

1147
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,740
when I put this show on the internet.

1148
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,220
And it's the X-rated version, by the way.

1149
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,400
It'll be slightly different.

1150
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,860
That Rudy Schwartz project song about Trump

1151
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,400
will sound different on the internet than it did.

1152
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,180
And it'll sound different every time you play it too,

1153
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:53,800
right, Stane?

1154
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,520
Well, we try for that.

1155
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,060
But now we have to go,

1156
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:02,020
and I think we did everything right.

1157
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,060
And the last thing I'm going to do

1158
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:08,720
is play this short one and a half minute,

1159
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,420
no, one minute and ten seconds,

1160
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,720
Reverend Jimmy Ryan.

1161
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,680
Here it is.

1162
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,380
So the music in the background was all cyber chump,

1163
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,680
involving the people that are also in exposed forehead.

1164
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,960
And so, thank you.

1165
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:23,960
See you, Dave.

1166
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,260
Thank you.

1167
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:25,700
Bye.

1168
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:49,320
This has been an kunnen-ass podcast.

1169
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:49,320


1170
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:49,320


1171
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:49,340


1172
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:49,340


1173
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,700
I wanna thank my friendeté,

1174
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:50,700


1175
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:50,700


1176
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:50,700


1177
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:50,700


1178
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:50,700


1179
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:50,740


1180
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:50,780


1181
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:50,780


1182
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:50,780

solo

1191
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,280
Oh, sire, there is no more money.

1192
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,720
We gotta get some money.

1193
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,820
That dirty

1205
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:48,720

00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,160
B-O-B

1207
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:50,600
B-O-B

1208
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,520
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1209
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:58,260
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going

1210
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,780
for another couple of months.

1211
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,800
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1212
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:11,880
But if you truly love Bob, and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1213
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:19,420
you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

1214
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,720
and help out financially as best you can.

1215
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:30,720
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1216
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,740
But some of you still have jobs.

1217
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:40,580
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1218
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,980
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1219
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,360
All we're saying is that...

1220
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,400
blowjobs could go the way of steel, but they're not the same as the steel industry.

1221
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,780
You can't leave jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1222
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:57,260
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1223
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:09,720
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1224
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,940
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1225
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,980
Our job is to get into the middle part.

1226
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,500
I'm out.

1227
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,880
You can go tweet, Google, Twitter, Instagram, or Twitter.

1228
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,020
I look out for you online at subgenius.com.

1229
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:43,460
Get your stuff up.

1230
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:43,700
And you guys are now open.

1231
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,940
Big times, good stuff.

1232
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:46,720
See you next time.

1233
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,760
Have a great day.

1234
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,380
Green pills!

1235
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,900
Kill me!
