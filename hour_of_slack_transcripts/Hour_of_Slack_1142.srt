1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,640
Uh, yes, dear friends, this program, Hour of Slack number 1142, might have been a compendium of the new material gathered on our most recent expedition to San Francisco,

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:22,060
but instead, we've opted for Insta-Slack, and instead, present as a sort of follow-up to last week's rerun,

3
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:34,600
Hour of Slack number 42, recorded at KON in Dallas on August 11th, 1986, exploiting several subgenius shows of the past.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:48,440
We start, however, with the band that dare not speak its name performing Palmer Freedy's Gun or a Job at Dock Stock 2 of 1985 or so.

5
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,660
The Sky J.R. is on!

6
00:00:52,060 --> 00:01:00,020
My TV, I took my pills, I didn't get any money, what's this guy down trying to do to me?

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:09,200
I gotta, gotta, gotta get a gun or a job, I gotta, gotta, gotta get a gun or a job, I'm sick of the bomb.

8
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,640
I don't have to run away from anything, cause I don't believe in anything.

9
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,440
What direction's the zoo in?

10
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Back that-a-way.

11
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,680
That where you escaped from.

12
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:45,020
But let's leave things of this world behind, and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

13
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,820
The devil owes you money, friend, but Bob Dobbs is the bank where you can cash it in.

14
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,320
We gotta burn out the banks of the devil, we gotta root him out, burn out the hate, burn out the radiation, burn out the fire!

15
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:06,380
Standin' around actin' like you got wires of blood and anybody else, but you ain't, cause I'm the one that has it, not you, me.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,360
What are you talkin' about?

17
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,720
About unknown things I ain't never learned.

18
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:21,100
How I can see signs, and somethin' that just happens, and I got to do some things sometimes, I got to do some things sometimes I don't even wanna do.

19
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:30,400
And sometimes inside me I can feel it, I can feel it pullin', and tuggin' at me and pushin', and I can feel my blood beatin', and I got to do this thing right now.

20
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,340
It's-it's wires of blood.

21
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,760
Ain't everybody has it.

22
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
See, it's a gift.

23
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,280
It's a gift, like, uh, the gift of the prophets.

24
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,580
Now, I ain't sayin' I'm a prophet, no, it ain't like that, but it's like that.

25
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,600
You're crazy, boy.

26
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,900
You get away from me and you stay away.

27
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,180
I'm goin' where I'm goin'.

28
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,500
I got a woman, I got a woman, see?

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,960
And that's where I'm goin', to visit her.

30
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,420
Who thinks if he keeps on insulting you that you'll go away?

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,480
Whoa.

32
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,200
Whoa.

33
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,940
We're scarein' the neat.

34
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,640
Oh.

35
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,320
Oh, no, more cars going.

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,540
We're out of little car doors.

37
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,280
We can do those clicks, too.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,640
Oh, there he is.

39
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,260
Quick, fire, fire one.

40
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,500
Oh, oh, he missed him.

41
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
There he is, quick, fire another one.

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,780
Hey, are you fed up with boring radio?

43
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,960
Ooh, you left me just when I need me.

44
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,800
Tired of turgid and tedious top 40s?

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,700
Are you in love with your precious love?

46
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,620
I'd do anything, yes, I would.

47
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,960
Prepare the puke of a pretty paw.

48
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,620
I'm in love, I'm in love.

49
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,060
Well, it's time to tune in, cousin.

50
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,020
The Soap Genius.

51
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,820
Hour of Slash.

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,740
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,380
Driven to suicide with the pressures of a crumbling society?

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,940
Fed up with hip lightweights?

55
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,180
Well, get ready to kick back and explore the psychodynamics of abnormality.

56
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,000
Because...

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,940
Because...

58
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,580
The Doctors...

59
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,160
The Doctors...

60
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:21,780
The Doctors are...

61
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,400
The Doctors are... Here!

62
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,840
The Doctors are... Here!

63
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,200
Yes, don't worry.

64
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,560
Everything's all right.

65
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,880
Everything's just fine.

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,460
Everything's just fine.

67
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,380
Everything's just fine.

68
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,840
Ah, yes, dear friends, everything's just fine.

69
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:49,860
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, and it's so good to be back in Dallas after another sojourn afar,

70
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,980
in search of Historic Bob.

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,500
This time it was New York City, and yes, friends, I left that package of Soap Genius video PR at MTV,

72
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,080
just like they asked me, and I haven't heard a peep out of them since.

73
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,680
And that's good.

74
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,740
For MTV not to call us back after finding out what we were really about, I think, says something in our favor.

75
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,980
Praise that old Bobby.

76
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,340
We did have better luck at Spin Magazine.

77
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,380
Screw a magazine.

78
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:28,620
And Simon & Schuster, who will now be, praise Bob, officially reprinting the book of the Subgenius this spring.

79
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:36,820
Praise Dobbs, praise Dobbs, and you'll all have to buy new copies now, because the second edition will be a little different from the first.

80
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,880
So things are looking up for the mighty church of the Subgenius, friends.

81
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:48,480
Now, last week, you listeners were sadly banished from the glowing, benevolent rays of the lofty,

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:58,220
intellectually high-faluted, urethodox, Stanyan paradise type of show to the bitter hell of the butt-naked doctrinal schism.

83
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,520
Now, friend, you're going to have to decide.

84
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:08,460
Are you a Stangite, a Nakedite, or just a U-ite, eh?

85
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,320
You're going to have to pick a side.

86
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,320
Well, friends, I want you to know that I could be out hunting me some prairie squid tonight.

87
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,400
I could.

88
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,260
But I mean, I don't have to do this show.

89
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,440
Most of y'all don't even deserve the sweet word of Bob.

90
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:35,300
But this is going to be an easy one, though, because tonight we offer you a sampling of other Subgenius radio ministries in other states and even other lands.

91
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,600
The airwaves tonight, friends, will be fraught with peril as shows collide around you for the next hour.

92
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,300
Because last week we got tapes from the serious abuse of the Stangite.

93
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:47,740
And we're going to be talking about the Subgenius show.

94
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,540
These are weekly Subgenius programs for friends.

95
00:06:51,920 --> 00:07:02,900
The Subgenius serious abuse show from Richmond, Virginia, which is a brand new one and mighty fired up with the pure hate, the gospel hate and dobs, friends.

96
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:09,660
And from the brand new hour of Slack in Boston, Massachusetts with Bleepo Abernathy.

97
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,360
From the Sister Chris Subgenius half hour at WFMU in New Jersey.

98
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,200
And last but not least.

99
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,500
First, the more than an hour, less than a show show from KPFA Berkeley.

100
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:26,240
And you'll see how lucky you heathens are to have the Dallas hour of Slack right here in the very cradle of the Bob.

101
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,320
Because these foreign shows, some of them are a little bit better at sacred.

102
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,420
The sacred church accultation technique known as listener elimination.

103
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,140
Of course, Buck and I have been known to show the occasional total disregard for the listeners feelings.

104
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,980
But we don't hurt you randomly, dear friends.

105
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,660
We aren't doing this.

106
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,640
We aren't tormenting you just to amuse ourselves.

107
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,960
Nay, we hurt you for a reason.

108
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,380
A good reason.

109
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:01,480
And that reason is our great thrice killed guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

110
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:10,300
This show and all other Subgenius shows are designed to have a calculated effect on the bicameral split between your left and right brains.

111
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,660
And that's why you have to listen in stereo.

112
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,180
Otherwise, you won't be able to get the strands separated.

113
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,300
You'll get all tangled up in the dogma that we broadcast at you.

114
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,240
Now, all of we radio doctors are accredited surgeons of the airwaves.

115
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,300
Bred to make media in the festering cauldrons of childhood sci-fi shows.

116
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,400
Children of the media age, my friends.

117
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,320
So mutated that the media itself becomes for us far more important than those who watch or listen to it.

118
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,260
This show is not a privilege of ours.

119
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,960
We do not consider ourselves obliged to help you or even to entertain you, dear friend.

120
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,780
Because of the existence of J.R. Bob Dobbs, it's the other way around.

121
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,280
It's mandatory that you listen to us.

122
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,720
And you're mighty lucky you're allowed to, dear friends.

123
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,900
Now, that understood, we may now proceed with the tape recording.

124
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,340
All the callers are lining up right now to talk to the doctors.

125
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,820
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

126
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,060
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

127
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,780
But don't worry.

128
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,720
Everything's all right.

129
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,520
Your radio is taking control of you.

130
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,660
Relax.

131
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,360
You're in the hands of the doctors.

132
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

133
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

134
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,740
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

135
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

136
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:38,100
The motion picture you're about to see contains scenes so terrifying, the public must be given grave warning.

137
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:50,480
Therefore, the management has instituted visual and audible warning at the beginning of each of the four supreme fright points.

138
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,020
The fear flasher is the visual warning.

139
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,780
The horror horn is the audible warning.

140
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,060
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

141
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

142
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,960
See the fear flasher.

143
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,460
Close your eyes.

144
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,620
You hear the horror horn.

145
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,620
Stop!

146
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,800
Stop!

147
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,820
Stop!

148
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,200
Stop!

149
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:29,840


150
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,800
What must the listeners at home think?

151
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:45,120
It's terrible in the cavernous echoing shell of our rocket with all these floating babies and the zero gravity.

152
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,120
The dogs pinwheeling by.

153
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,980
And we're having a little bit of navigational difficulties.

154
00:10:51,060 --> 00:11:03,980
But we're still transmitting to you the subgenius hour and a half of true cosmic puzzling and evidential nausea and the will to disbelieve.

155
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,780
Urbain curiosity.

156
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,600
The magic comes, but wisdom lingers and it bears a laden crest.

157
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,160
Full of sad experience moving toward the stillness of your rest.

158
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,260
It's all hysteria.

159
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,300
People discomfort or loneliness.

160
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,560
The cure is obvious.

161
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,020
I always wanted to be on the radio.

162
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,540
Now I have a chance better than Christmas.

163
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,780
He's boring, megalomaniacal, monotonous.

164
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,640
A movie camera, table tennis, a wallet, a dog.

165
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,280
Wallet?

166
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,780
I hear the magic word boing.

167
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,860
Boing, me!

168
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,580
Yeah, that's closer. That's closer.

169
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:45,320
You can achieve it. You will achieve the cider spasm with the excess if you do that enough, friend.

170
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:51,140
This caller has just requested that I perform a wedding for him this coming weekend.

171
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,940
It's the first wedding over the phone now.

172
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,360
We can historically probably say at WMBR at least.

173
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,180
We can perform this wedding over the phone right now if you would like.

174
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,900
Yes, okay. Rachel and Stefan.

175
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,260
You know the seriousness of the commitment you're bringing yourself to.

176
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:16,820
And you realize that all the consummations that make up a relationship between a man and a woman that you've done, you've already done before.

177
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,200
But where you're at now is you're going to make the deal that binds it all together.

178
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,020
So, do you, Rachel, take Stefan to be your lawfully wedded husband?

179
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,260
With the word of Bob to be your guiding light?

180
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,900
Yes, so help me, Bob.

181
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,880
And you, Stefan, take Rachel to be your lawfully wedded husband?

182
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:40,480
With Bob's true slack, true slack being your guiding force in your lives.

183
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,640
Help me, Bob.

184
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,300
Okay, I want you to...

185
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,800
I can't take this, Dr. Fischmacher. It's too beautiful.

186
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,020
I want you to, I want you two to join hands.

187
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,680
I want you, I want you to shake hands.

188
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
Hold on a sec.

189
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,760
I want you two to shake hands.

190
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,400
Yes.

191
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,360
Yes.

192
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,080
And say, it's a deal.

193
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,520
It's a deal.

194
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,900
Praise Bob.

195
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,780
Praise Bob.

196
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,340
Yeah!

197
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,980
Oh, praise Bob. That was a beautiful thing.

198
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,380
Beautiful, beautiful thing.

199
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,260
And we're going to have a wonderful life together.

200
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,640
That's the first legal marriage over the airways of WMBR, Cambridge.

201
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,860
That's right. The reverends of the Church of the Subgenius are legally empowered to perform marriages.

202
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,160
So, we do invite your calls here at 1-1-1.

203
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,320
D.G.C.

204
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,340
Jesus calls you.

205
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,640
Jesus calls you.

206
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,540
Hey, looky down yonder.

207
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,740
You see that blind man down there?

208
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,960
He's giving out tracts and begging Jesus you ought to see him.

209
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,080
And he's got this here ugly child.

210
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,640
You better get on the other side, lady.

211
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,260
There's a fool down there giving out tracts.

212
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,700
Don't pay no attention to that fanatic up there.

213
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,360
Don't I know what exists and what don't?

214
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,700
Ain't I got eyes in my head?

215
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,600
Am I a blind man?

216
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,000
Let me tell you something.

217
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,100
Maybe you think that you ain't clean because you don't believe.

218
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,080
Every one of you are clean.

219
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,080
And I'll tell you why.

220
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:14,420
If you think it's because of Jesus Christ crucified, you're wrong.

221
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,900
I ain't saying he wasn't crucified, but I say it wasn't for you.

222
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,340
I'm going to start a new church.

223
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,900
The church approved me without Jesus Christ crucified.

224
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,980
And it won't cost me anything.

225
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,020
I cost you nothing to join my church.

226
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,320
I'm here, folks.

227
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,660
It ain't started yet, but it's going to be.

228
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,260
I don't need Jesus.

229
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,200
What do I need Jesus for?

230
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,240
I got Leora Watts.

231
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,340
Preachers, babes, there be seen.

232
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,520
Attention, Richmond.

233
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,900
This is the voice of the Rat Cave Media Center, loosely affiliated with the Church of the Subgenius.

234
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,960
Broadcasting to you from the subgenius.

235
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,720
The radio's a .

236
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,880
The doctor is in.

237
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,420
Yes, the doctors are in.

238
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,380
Just straight talk.

239
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,440
Just some straight BS.

240
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,580
From your hosts, Dr. Can't Sleep, Dr. S.B. Boyd, and Dr. T.M. Oscar.

241
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,740
Tired of the conspiracy telling you what to do-do?

242
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,960
Just listen to the doctors, or even call 289-UR-90.

243
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,840
No, don't call that.

244
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,120
Don't call that number.

245
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,180
Don't call any number.

246
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,800
God don't like it.

247
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,200
And Bob don't like it neither.

248
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,840
And now, the doctors.

249
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,340
Ah, yes, dear friends.

250
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:56,180
And what we just heard was a sampling of, oh, you got a little bit of your Berkeley show with Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Al, and the show that dare not speak its name, and Gary the Broke Friend.

251
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:06,960
And you got your Rat Cave media show with Steve Slack and T.M. Oscar doing that from some horrible little college station.

252
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,160
You're a hateful bunch of ranters there.

253
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:16,400
And a bit of the Hour of Slack, Boston, Massachusetts version.

254
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,600
Now, of course, the Berkeley was the first weekly subgenius radio show.

255
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,160
But, friends, you know, the subgenius shows are not the only thing that are the most important.

256
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,100
They tend to fall into two groups.

257
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:38,620
Either the well-manized, willy-nilly, happening, be-in, call-in, love-in kind of show, a la that Berkeley show or the Rat Cave, Virginia show.

258
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:55,160
Versus your Stangian or Abernathy and Bostonian show type shows, which are the tightly scripted and heavily edited and censored pieces of Bob packaging, which you have come to so know and love, baby.

259
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,140
Yeah.

260
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,160
And let's just see.

261
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh, and this here on camera three is a WFMU in New Jersey.

262
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,640
This will be the fifth one we're playing.

263
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,920
This is Sister Chris.

264
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,980
Or this is actually a guest of the mighty Sister Chris who came in from Poland, I believe.

265
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,660
Now see another dimension on your TV.

266
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,020
Wait a minute.

267
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,240
I don't want to see any more dimensions on my TV.

268
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,160
Oh, shoot.

269
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,240
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,200
There was a little Super 8 video cassette that confused me with this audio.

271
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:43,320
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior to explore new ways of going over the edge.

272
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,240
Yes, indeedy.

273
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,560
This is Sister Grajina back on the airwaves of WFMU.

274
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:56,140
Sister Chris and I have reconciled our differences about muscling images.

275
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,480
We've been on airtime and spontaneous feelings, et cetera.

276
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:10,780
And I'm here to tell you out there in the ether about my experiences with UFOs and my religious convictions.

277
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,880
And I don't mean arrest records.

278
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,400
You understand?

279
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,620
I'm rambling about the spiritual, the metaphorical, and the comically cosmic.

280
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,460
And my first visitation happened when I was four years old.

281
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:35,000
One overcast and communist-oppressed day, I was playing in the family beat field with my hometown of Viborova.

282
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:47,060
When this strange bosom sound was boring what felt like a big hole in my skull and a stiffening inaction took over my whole body and my toes, too.

283
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:55,200
And then it seemed as if the sound tried to pull me out, my living soul out of my body shell.

284
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,920
But there was too much resistance.

285
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,600
Too bad no one was around to witness this extraterritorial shenanigans there.

286
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,540
It must have looked pretty weird from the outside.

287
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,120
On the inside, I was confused and terrified.

288
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,120
I was literally excreting building material.

289
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,600
But the crazy kid I was, it started to feel nice.

290
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,760
Like new kind of amusement ride.

291
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,760
I don't remember much else about that first experience or how long it lasted.

292
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:39,620
The thing is, ever since that time, I've been hearing strange voices and been on the receiving end of many bizarre visions.

293
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:49,640
Psychiatrists and other members of the craziness oppression caste call me and the others of the chosen sect insane.

294
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,800
But I know.

295
00:19:51,800 --> 00:20:01,200
I am positively sure that I communicate regularly with the angels, the messengers of Jehovah One,

296
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,360
who travel like the wind and turn not as they go.

297
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,680
And Bob say, yes, I know, I talk to Bob, too.

298
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:21,780
Bob say, it's all right to rock out and jam with these aliens as long as I get the minimum daily requirement of sleep.

299
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,520
And I know that I have the lack that I need.

300
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,960
And they don't.

301
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:30,360
And as long as they don't rip my lungs out my chest, if I do something, you know, that they don't like.

302
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,220
Yeah.

303
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:31,960


304
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:31,960


305
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,500
I.

306
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:32,960
I.

307
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,280
I.

308
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,460
I.

309
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:33,600
I.

310
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:33,660
I.

311
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:33,800
I.

312
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,260
I.

313
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:34,980
I.

314
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,080


315
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,080


316
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:35,740
I.

317
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:35,980


318
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:35,980


319
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:39,840
I.

320
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:39,920
I.

321
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,260
I did you think something ended up like.

322
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,960
We were just on it.

323
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,380
What's that yet?

324
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,740
Oh, where are you going?

325
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,320
Well?

326
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,460
I'm out of here.

327
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,020
That's why I got some company.

328
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,640
That's why I said that.

329
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,120
So so I got a previous partner from Shit factsная Il

330
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,480
hell on the bottom, then your Christian heaven, then your earth, which is, of course, another

331
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,500
layer of hell. Then you got higher than that, though, a lot more comfortable is the subgenius

332
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,900
hell, which wouldn't really be punishment. But really, believe me, I, you know, you believe me,

333
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,340
don't you? This is eternal salvation or triple your money back. We wouldn't try to lead you down

334
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:38,040
the wrong path. Yes, the subgenius heaven is even above the subgenius hell, and that's Asgard.

335
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:44,800
Asgard, known in other tongues or, you know, Nirvana. Actually, it makes Nirvana seem like

336
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:52,240
getting your eyes carved out with a pair of pliers and just one end of the pair of pliers,

337
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,020
not yanked out, but gouged out. That's what Nirvana is like compared to the mighty spurt

338
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:06,760
universe of the subgenius heaven. Oh, don't that bless your heart, friends. Well, this is the

339
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,900
subgenius hour.

340
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:15,060
Slack radio ministry with the church of the subgenius here at KNO and 90.9 FM in Dallas,

341
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:23,480
Texas and in Virens. And and then we're playing we're playing excerpts from a sister and brother

342
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,060
shows all over the place. What you just heard was an excerpt from the sister Chris show. She gets

343
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:37,200
tapes from a one of the lovely nun snakes in Poland, in communist Poland. And and I've been

344
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,020
getting tapes from the sister Chris show. And I've been getting tapes from the sister Chris show.

345
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,140
And I've been getting tapes from the sister Chris show. And and I've been getting tapes from the

346
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:49,760
from the Pope of all China, common red communist China. This is Dr. Lee Li Jing in Beijing. And you

347
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,900
can't write to him because that would get him in a whole lot of trouble, dear friends. But he's

348
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:00,360
going to be sending some more updates of his Chinese three minutes of slack in Chinese. By

349
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,140
the way, speaking of Chinese, it's a great movie last night, a great wall. Can't tell you where

350
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,020
because that would be an advertisement, which you didn't see. I'm going to give you an advertisement

351
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,020


352
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,020


353
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,020


354
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,020


355
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,020


356
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,260
pay for. But anyway, here we go.

357
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:25,680
Chris Bob. Oh yes, dear friends. This is Li Biqi, the Chinese subgenius. And you are listening

358
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:34,620
to the Hour of Slack. Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people. He is a China, just like an

359
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:43,760
American. People need slack. In Chinese, we call slack Liu Tianpai. But it must be true

360
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,300
slack, not the bad slack of the conspiracy. Chris Bob, help me somebody.

361
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:04,520
Wake up! He said wake up! This is Dr. Can't Sleep and you can't sleep.

362
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:12,840
No sleep in Richmond tonight because the doctors have taken control of WGCE-FM. As forewarned.

363
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,380
Oh, you were fooled by the dates on the flyers. You thought it was tomorrow night.

364
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,600
Well, we're always ahead of time. Yes, we have time control. And we'll be telling you

365
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,420
how you too can exercise time control later tonight on tonight's show. This is Dr. S.

366
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,840
B. Voigt, ready to shave off the top of your head at a moment's notice.

367
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,900
I guess we should be grateful for the media manipulators who have allowed us to be on.

368
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,580
What, what, Bob? What did you say? I'm sorry, Bob was just talking to me there.

369
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,880
Is Bob there in the background squeaking among those trays of white mice?

370
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:54,300
Yes, Bob might show up tonight if we get enough callers. What's the number there, Dr. Voigt?

371
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,240
That's 2-8-

372
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:03,340
Yes, call us up in our official subgenius all-night radiothon for mental dystrophy,

373
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,600
a frightful night.

374
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,080
It's a frightening disease which is crippling most of the minds here in the Commonwealth.

375
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,860
Call up and...

376
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,020
Well, you know, we...

377
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,160
Yes, you have reached the show.

378
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,060
How about that?

379
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:22,180
Oh, that was certainly unintelligible. Well, thank you for that holy pronouncement there.

380
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,520
Holy...

381
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm enlightened.

382
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,860
Thank you for that holy distribution.

383
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:30,260
I see the light. I understand now. I understand it all. We can just pack up the show and go home.

384
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,820
We've answered all the questions in just 10 minutes.

385
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,040
That's right. We've steamed...

386
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,720
Oh, my God.

387
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,920
Big beans.

388
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,660
All it takes is one call and all your problems are over.

389
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,220
Yes, I believe that was the theme for this current show, the corpulence of a crumbling society.

390
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,560
I'm so tired.

391
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,980
Oh, so this is the boring part of this show.

392
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,500
Oh, it's getting so boring.

393
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,080
This is the part where you go out for coffee and donuts.

394
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:02,580
Oh, let's just go out and watch a hardcore show and get drunk and go home and pass out.

395
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,800
Why listen to this show?

396
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:10,280
We're stalling. We're actually stalling. We're saving the better part of this show until 2.30 when everybody comes back home.

397
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,940
You'll have to stay up till 5 a.m. to hear the good part of this show.

398
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,780
And the sounds of the stress and strain.

399
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,860
We're in the final countdown of what is hoped will be mankind's first orbit around the moon.

400
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,900
I was wondering, has the show started yet?

401
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,540
No, no.

402
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,280
This is the warm-up. We generally warm up.

403
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,240
It's Tuesday night for the pre-show warm-up?

404
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:27,540
Yes.

405
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,220
We're broadcasting from outer space to radio station KPFA.

406
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,660
Yes.

407
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,700
And a garbled version is...

408
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,400
Raging you.

409
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,540
Oh, I'll get it.

410
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,780
Oh, why, come in.

411
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,840
Welcome to our show.

412
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,000
Hi, Roger.

413
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,240
We're doing whatever you'd like to record today.

414
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,900
Set recorders for a start.

415
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,680
And as the message is broadcast back to the Earth,

416
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:56,860
Mobius Rex turns it into code which only the high masters, the elders, can understand when they listen to this show.

417
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:03,780
We're passing through clouds of images and words which were sent off from Earth many years ago.

418
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:03,780


419
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,260
Fortunately, we catch up with them and then we pass them.

420
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,940
But our linguistic scoop brings them to you for your listening pleasure.

421
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,320
The amazing tales from the Church of the Subgenius.

422
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,420
Be there for the end of the private life and the destruction of the American dream.

423
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,720
Don't say you weren't warned.

424
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,080
We've got to save you.

425
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,180
You already have.

426
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,180
Oh, do they care?

427
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,680
Oh, oh, oh.

428
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,680
You are normal, aren't you?

429
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,060
Stay away.

430
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,620
Keep your distance.

431
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,920
You are normal, aren't you?

432
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,940
I mean, you are normal, aren't you?

433
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,860
Oh, yes, dear friends.

434
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,380
Well, I'll tell you what.

435
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,940
That was so that last one was the Berkeley show.

436
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,200
Just so you keep track.

437
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,940
That was the show with one guy with a really heavy eyebrow right across the middle.

438
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,660
That's a unibrow.

439
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,880
And then there was the heavier guy with the glasses and the incredible vocabulary.

440
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,420
And that's Dr. Howell.

441
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:17,880
And then there is the Rastafarian with real pale face and really tanned fingers and palms.

442
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,060
And that was Gary Gubrog, friend.

443
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:31,760
Well, friends, I have to pause here in the midst of these this wonderful barrage of tapes and explain to you why you can't call in.

444
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,660
Now.

445
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:43,760
Two weeks ago, dear friends, many of you, many of you faithful who listen to every hour of slack because you need every hour of slack in your week.

446
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:55,380
Many of you heard the sermon about our friend, the prairie squid, that frisky and fecund mollusk so dear to the hearts of all us country boys and girls.

447
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:03,660
But Dr. G. Gordon Gordon and I got so carried away with ranting about the forbidden delights of that pesky land squid.

448
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:13,600
And we completely neglected the warnings, the stern warnings, friends, that should be delivered to all squid fornication novices.

449
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:22,980
I.E. we forgot to mention the arboreal squids, which, dear friends, secrete a poisonous fluid from their inner sheath.

450
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,060
We forgot to mention the night squids, which carry foul diseases.

451
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,740
And the toothed squids, which are rather hard to dislodge from your.

452
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,680
Body once you start to.

453
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,000
You know, do what you do with a prairie squid.

454
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,020
I don't think I have to spell that out.

455
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,100
But worst of all, friends, and I can only beg your forgiveness for this.

456
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,280
This this if this morning comes too late.

457
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:56,260
We forgot to tell you about the beak, the beak of the prairie squid.

458
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,680
They all have that beak, friends, even though you can't see it.

459
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,240
And you have to pull the beak with a pair of pliers before you start to, you know.

460
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,280
To before you make them safe to use.

461
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:17,260
And Dr. Gordon and I sort of took it for granted that that was common knowledge that everybody that everybody knew to be because squid before you get on with your business.

462
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:27,320
And as much as we make fun of people who don't know what a prairie squid is, we don't want the responsibility for a bunch of city boys getting out there.

463
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,160
And I don't know jack about a squid friend.

464
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,420
And they don't have to.

465
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,560
A pink boy.

466
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,220
I don't have time for foreplay with a prairie squid.

467
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,860
Oh, it's just an animal.

468
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,660
What do I have to worry about?

469
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,440
These pink boys, they don't want to mess with tickling that squid to get it to quiet down a bit.

470
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,700
Calm it down.

471
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,860
Oh, they're afraid to pull the beak because, oh, it might hurt the poor beast.

472
00:30:53,240 --> 00:31:02,700
And we'll be getting all these calls on our answer machine at the Bulldog of Time Control headquarters from boys with high voices saying, oh, Reverend Stagg.

473
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,420
I should have.

474
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:03,760
I should have.

475
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,260
I should have.

476
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:07,280
I should have.

477
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,280


478
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,280


479
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,280


480
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,280


481
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,280


482
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,280


483
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,280


484
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,380
Oh, they'll be wailing and holding their stitches, friends.

485
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,560
Oh, those of you who were too dumb to know what a prairie squid is to begin with.

486
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,200
You'll be finding out the once hard way, so to speak.

487
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,840
So beware the prairie squid, my son.

488
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,800
Beware that beak that bites.

489
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,720
And the girls don't have to worry about that.

490
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,340
Because the part of a prairie squid.

491
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,760
A girl usually doesn't have a beak.

492
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,820
Although in the South American variety, they sport little spines up and down.

493
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,420
And, of course, those are treasured by some sophisticated ladies of society.

494
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,000
Oh, yeah.

495
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:55,240
And, friends, now, as you know, we have recorded some 41 hour of slack shows.

496
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,320
This one is number 40.

497
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,880
No, 42.

498
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,120
But two weeks ago, friends, someone else screwed up royally.

499
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,420
And the mighty prairie squid show was not recorded in its entirety.

500
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:12,280
We're missing a good tape of the first half hour of one of our shows.

501
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,380
So to those beloved diehards out there who take this show, and I know there's some out there.

502
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:23,560
Please, dear friends, for the love of Bob, send us your tape of the prairie squid show.

503
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,140
Send us a copy if you must.

504
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,420
Send the original and we'll make it worth your while.

505
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,080
You'll get a free extra copy of all subgenius books and publications.

506
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,980
Plus several uncut media.

507
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,600
Media barrage.

508
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,700
Audio tapes as well.

509
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,340
And a chance to be in Bob's new music video.

510
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,760
So why don't you just send that tape to P.O. Box.

511
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,280
This is Bob.

512
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,160
This is the number where you can write for information about prairie squids.

513
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,240
Prairie squid safety.

514
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,740
About where to get the slack that the conspiracy denied you.

515
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,720
About where to find Bob and put him in your life.

516
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:02,140
And get back the juices that were stolen in the night by those evil succubi and things of the darkness.

517
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,960
And, friends, that's...

518
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,980
You got that pencil now?

519
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,880
The number to write is Bob.

520
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,540
That's the number.

521
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,800
At P.O. Box.

522
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:20,000
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

523
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,600
www.subgenius.com

524
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:24,880
That's right, friends.

525
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,460
Send that tape of the prairie squid show.

526
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,060
And we'll...

527
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,420
And send us your return address.

528
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,060
Send us anything.

529
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,880
We will pay you back in ways you can't imagine.

530
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,000
The Church of the Subgenius can pay you back for that tape of this mighty show that we so need.

531
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,140
Because it was such a nasty one, you know?

532
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,100
Without using any bad words.

533
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:49,900
So I'll praise Bob so they won't be having a Senate committee investigate us this year.

534
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,800
Yeah!

535
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,400
There's mighty Li Jing, the agent for Bob in China.

536
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,860
He's about to close in on those conspiracy bad guys who stole that bucket of water.

537
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,740
And he's gonna get a slack in that beautiful girl.

538
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,340
Pope Li, Li Jing.

539
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,840
He's a bad, bad spy for Bob in Red China.

540
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,040
And he's closing in on us.

541
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:24,600
That one looks pretty good.

542
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,620
Well, sir, I'm telling you.

543
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,660
In fact, I'm gonna come right out and say it.

544
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,680
Nobody listens to this show.

545
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,640
Bob came out of that book.

546
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,680
He came out of the Senate.

547
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,320
Yes, it was.

548
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,200
The future.

549
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,980
Bob came out of the phone book.

550
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,420
Who knows?

551
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,260
Bob came from the phone company.

552
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:40,780
But it was another chapter.

553
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,240
The phone company created Bob.

554
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,980
It was the phone company.

555
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,140
This is the truth.

556
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,340
This is the truth.

557
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,140
Nothing else on this show is true but this.

558
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,360
This is the moment we've all been waiting for.

559
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,020
Done, pal.

560
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,320
I know I'll be taken out in a shot.

561
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,620
You forget to tell us which phone company.

562
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,740
At that time, there was only one phone company.

563
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,700
Just the same.

564
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,640
At the time I speak of, there was only one phone company covering the Earth.

565
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,760
Its tendrils extended in every direction.

566
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,880
Listen, you shouldn't be wasting your time with this stuff.

567
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,560
So it was that I.B. Stang came upon the sacred tether of the phone book,

568
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,700
which he found in the men's room of the bus station.

569
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,300
And in that phone book was the face, the face that we know as a mass of dots.

570
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:27,580
A mass of malignant dots, a strange convoluted grouping of energy

571
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,280
which may have traveled through space and time for longer than anyone knows.

572
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,620
But it came out of the phone.

573
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,300
I'm trying to tell you.

574
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,500
I know they want to sell it to you because they don't want this to get through.

575
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,620
But he came from the phone.

576
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,520
I think there's something wrong with your tape.

577
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,680
It's 19.

578
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,160
Yeah, it was igneous.

579
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,360
The tape is warm.

580
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,400
Death is like a home.

581
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,740
What I like about the Church of the Subgenius is that you can totally screw up

582
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:58,160
and then become pope and collect an enormous amount of money and gain eternal salvation

583
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,280
or at least a nice piece of beachfront property.

584
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,180
That's right.

585
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,860
Bob is just a wonderful thing, whatever he is.

586
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,660
He doesn't forgive your sins.

587
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,000
He doesn't care about your sins.

588
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,760
He justifies your sins.

589
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,980
You can hate him.

590
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,260
You can kill him.

591
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,360
You can love him.

592
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,340
It doesn't matter.

593
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,480
You just kind of like pop up and down to it.

594
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,780
I just love it.

595
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,280
And I like the Southwest.

596
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,580
It will probably kind of sneak over and eat you and the West.

597
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,220
It's kind of a bi-location deal.

598
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,720
Oh, Mom.

599
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:29,940
What's happening?

600
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,480
Oh, no.

601
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,000
I think you've been duplicated, Dr. Gordon.

602
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:34,680
Oh, no.

603
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,760
What's happening?

604
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,900
Oh, no.

605
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,360
What's happening?

606
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,460
I can't tell.

607
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,100
Oh, no.

608
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,840
Can you?

609
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,440
What's happening?

610
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,880
I can't believe this is happening to me.

611
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,180
What's happening?

612
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,040
I'm crawling into those black holes.

613
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,880
They're so enticing.

614
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:49,540
Enticing.

615
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,800
What's happening to me?

616
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,940
You've been duplicated.

617
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,580
Well, hey, let's trade those.

618
00:36:59,580 --> 00:36:59,920
Like, you know what?

619
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,760
I can do that too.

620
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,500
I can click through

621
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:01,500


622
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:01,500


623
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:01,500


624
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:01,500


625
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:01,500


626
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,780
Have another collar here at the subgenius.

627
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,560
Asylum.

628
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,780
Hello.

629
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:11,640
Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes, this is Reverend Bleepo Abernathy. How may we serve you?

630
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:16,300
Hello, Reverend, and I'd like to address a question to Dr. Amit Fishmonger.

631
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,860
Fishmonger here. Yes, doctor.

632
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:28,360
I was wondering, the caller mentioned earlier the question of whether one has to be in the water sports to hit Bob.

633
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,680
And you had explained it as the elements which you used for your hatred weren't important.

634
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:43,200
I think that the listeners should also know, though, that although other elements can be used,

635
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,480
I think that bodily fluids are the most vital.

636
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,420
Well, it is indeed a holy right, and we talk about it frequently, to pee on Bob's head.

637
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,560
And when I talk about the elements of fire and water...

638
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,080
You can pee on Bob's head, friend, and R and S and T-U-V, of course.

639
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,720
All of those.

640
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,700
Any of those things.

641
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,220
But, like, it is...

642
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,760
It's all...

643
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,240
It's also important to note that, like...

644
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,840
We're just talking about the letter P, of course, friend.

645
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:17,340
When we talk about, like, you know, using the elements, I mean, when we talk about using the elements to honor Bob with, I mean,

646
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:22,720
so that represents, that fluid represents the water element in life.

647
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,220
And we use the air element when we breathe the sacred church air.

648
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,060
And we use the fire element when we fire up the sacred frock stick.

649
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:36,400
And, yea, even upon Bob's head we can deposit earth in the form of the sacred night soil.

650
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,260
Well, what if drinking liquid slack until one has to, uh...

651
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,260
Well, you know, liquid slack can come in any one of a number of forms, friend.

652
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,940
Uh, it can be Jack Daniels, it can be Pepsi Cola.

653
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,980
Liquid slack is...

654
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,980
In my case right now, it's Canada Dry Ginger Ale.

655
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,780
Ginger Ale, yea.

656
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,280
Free plug.

657
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,820
No, no, no, we can't do that.

658
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,800
It's non-commercial radio.

659
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,100
We have to give a plug to everything.

660
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,000
Every other soda in the world now.

661
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,300
Oh, Dr. Fishmonger, what have you done?

662
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,160
Classic.

663
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,260
Oh, lord, uh, we have to equal time.

664
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,020
Oh, no.

665
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,500
The word human is slowly losing its meaning under a vast tidal wave of inhumane behavior.

666
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:20,600
It's a tug of war between the fiercely retroactive steel-trap-mouthed boot boys on the right

667
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,500
and the equally insidious, artsy, snotty-ass, psychopathically hip squids on the left.

668
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,420
The conspiracy has twisted the words good sex around to mean everything that you don't get.

669
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,560
That way, they can humiliate you into obedience,

670
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,760
run your treadmill trip, make you fill out a scorecard.

671
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,140
They tell you you have to have career goals,

672
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,180
which is twisted to mean absolute obedience to whatever rut you happen to fall into.

673
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,680
They can make you ugly and fat and bored,

674
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,020
and then they want you to go home and beat off the solid goals.

675
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,540
Discuss this with the foreign minister and the president.

676
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
What about Bob?

677
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,920
They never considered Bob.

678
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,460
They never consulted me.

679
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,440
I'm Bob's secret guy.

680
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:05,760
I'm not your owner.

681
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,880
What he's out in the ranks at is this.

682
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,380
We'll be taking opinions on this land when we feel like it.

683
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,700
He has made observations about the situation in South Africa,

684
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,280
which are inconsistent with the facts.

685
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

686
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,600
289-UR-90, tell us everything we don't want to hear.

687
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,660
Mr. Trudeau doesn't presume to be a political leader.

688
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,040
They don't stay on listening shows like this.

689
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,700
It's too much trouble to listen to.

690
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,320
I'm a spokesman for A.B.

691
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,480
289-UR-90.

692
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,720
It's our phone number.

693
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,200
You have the first call.

694
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,960
I want to know, what has Reverend Stang got to do with this conspiracy?

695
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:44,880
No, no, no, wait.

696
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,300
Now, wait.

697
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,320
You may say, Stang, oh, he couldn't do nothing.

698
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,900
He's in charge of this radio show.

699
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,420
He's the one responsible for putting my words over the air and all that over there.

700
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,500
But, friends, that's completely impossible.

701
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,680
You say, yeah, well, what about, like, Johnson and the JFK assassination?

702
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,960
You ever ask yourself that?

703
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,000
Sure, sure.

704
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,640
You know, mourning for the world and all that.

705
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,820
Now, let's be frank here, folks.

706
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,420
Now, I'm not saying.

707
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:05,540
I'm not saying.

708
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,520
Lyndon Baines was a bad man.

709
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,460
But Lyndon Baines was a powerful man.

710
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,540
Lyndon Baines was a man who could withstand pain.

711
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,800
Who's to know what kind of strange hypnosis he underwent with them hypno-demons back when

712
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,880
he visited that flying saucer on that Air Force base in 57 with Eisenhower.

713
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,220
Yeah, he was a senator that was there that day.

714
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,080
He was supposedly standing there watching the whole damn thing.

715
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,640
Well, if you ask me, those aliens just hypnotized him, took him both aboard the spaceship there

716
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,940
and, of course, erased part of the mine and then put it back and then made them forget

717
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,100
that they could ever remember it.

718
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:41,000
Which just, you know, makes the whole subconscious drive to do the insane thing even stronger.

719
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,680
I love those aliens.

720
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,780
You gotta love those aliens.

721
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,880
Anyway, I mean, you gotta admire them, let's say.

722
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,400
Maybe you can't exactly embrace them with what we call love.

723
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,900
You know, sort of.

724
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,540
I can't go into that right now.

725
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,920
But anyway, so, at any rate, so what I'm just saying there is, you know, it's entirely possible.

726
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,960
But please, I don't want any lawsuits.

727
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,640
You know, there's just a theory I'm proposing.

728
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,800
I'm just talking.

729
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,420
Please.

730
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,740
We're on the eve of destruction.

731
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,880
My blood's on the line.

732
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,520
There's no way to wait.

733
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:27,680
I'm sitting here just trying to thank you.

734
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,500
You can't put the pieces on the line.

735
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,420
You're waiting.

736
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,420
And I have to wait.

737
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:34,980
I'm waiting.

738
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:52,180
Are you done?

739
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:52,400
See?

740
00:42:52,400 --> 00:43:01,200
I can't do those things over and over and over again, my friend.

741
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,460
I will trust in you.

742
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,560
You're all I need.

743
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
Don't distract me.

744
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,420
I'm a fool.

745
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,520
I'm a fool.

746
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:12,860


747
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,200
I'm a fool.

748
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:14,980
I'm a fool.

749
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,080
I'm a fool.

750
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:15,520
I'm a fool.

751
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:15,560
I'm a fool.

752
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:15,660
I'm a fool.

753
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:15,660


754
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:15,660


755
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:15,660


756
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,380
Cross the surface of the skin for the nearest opening.

757
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,040
How many openings does the body have?

758
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,740
Whichever one it's closest to.

759
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:34,860
The tattoo slowly enters the opening and disappears inside the body and there moving through the

760
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,520
endothelium.

761
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,240
It makes its way God knows where.

762
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:48,600
One tattoo might get trapped in the musculature behind the knee or the right knee.

763
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,360
Gentle massage would break it.

764
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:50,740
Make it loose.

765
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,780
But then a strange change takes place in the tattoo.

766
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,700
And as it reappears through whatever opening, you can see that it's changed.

767
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:17,120
It's been digested somehow from its two-dimensional purple-red reality into some otherworldly hologram.

768
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,540
Tattoo holograms.

769
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,360
And there it dances across the...

770
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,780
The body of the tattoo subject.

771
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:22,660
Beautiful.

772
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,020
There'll be one thing I'd like to see done.

773
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,100
Oh, I hope we do it.

774
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:32,380
Or how about the musical that I've never gotten around to called Mmm.

775
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,540
Starring the Siamese twins connected by the lips.

776
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,740
The lips?

777
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,600
All sorts of things we never do.

778
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,060
Crumple.

779
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,140
I was going to write a book called Crumple once.

780
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,140
All the pages would be crumpled.

781
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,820
You'd reach in.

782
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,340
Take out a book.

783
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,580
Crumple.

784
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:50,960
Read it.

785
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:52,840
Crumple it up.

786
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,400
Put it back in.

787
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:53,800
Reach in.

788
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,700
Take out another.

789
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,760
Short stories.

790
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,160
With each page numbered.

791
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,060
If you took them out, one, two, three, four, five, and the odds against that are pretty great.

792
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,460
True.

793
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,380
You'd wind up with the actual true meaning that was meant by the author.

794
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,080
But the difficulty there is to find someone who can crumple all those pages.

795
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,360
What if it were a bestseller?

796
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,120
Think of the problems we'd have.

797
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:35,400
Of course, there's one other thing that I wanted to do, and that is find a plastic surgeon who could change pets to look like their owners.

798
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,700
What about the other way around?

799
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,060
Yes, we should resolve to do all these inappropriate things.

800
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,020
Like what way?

801
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,100
Like, um, well, let's see.

802
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,320
Like the, uh, levity.

803
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,780
The one that I knew who was a marvelous levitator.

804
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,920
Gave lessons in levitating.

805
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:58,720
Let's do it.

806
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,220
Tried to teach me.

807
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,560
But, uh, I never could get off the ground that way.

808
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,200
He wanted to be a singer, though.

809
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,740
He wanted to sing in a nightclub.

810
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,000
And he was a horrible monotone.

811
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,360
Really couldn't carry a tune.

812
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,700
He would sing,

813
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:19,820
My,

814
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,140
Funny Valentine,

815
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,460
Sweet,

816
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,800
You know, it was awful.

817
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,240
But he was good at levitating, and

818
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,800
as the devout catalyst,

819
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,540
I got him into this nightclub.

820
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,100
The happy medium.

821
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,180
Marvelous.

822
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:41,540
He didn't sing well, but he levitated beautifully and had this

823
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,180
girl with sequins and

824
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,100
very large girl.

825
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,020
Showbiz type girl.

826
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,480
With a hula hoop with

827
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,060
sparkles on it.

828
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:51,840
And she'd,

829
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,720
as he levitated singing My Funny Valentine,

830
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,580
she'd run the hula hoop so you could see that there was no trick to it.

831
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,320
Nice touch.

832
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,360
You know,

833
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,660
let's get together.

834
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,580
We are together.

835
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,160
In the pub.

836
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,220
And we're here.

837
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:09,580
Sometime.

838
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,480
And write down all these things.

839
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,720
You know, make a scenario.

840
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,780
Then we'll go to Hollywood.

841
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,320
I've recorded the whole thing.

842
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,860
I don't know.

843
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:25,260
Maybe they wouldn't think it was commercial enough.

844
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,780
Let's do it in Des Moines.

845
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,940
We can make the resolution anyway.

846
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:29,800
Oh, okay.

847
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,740
We'll do it in Des Moines.

848
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,060
Yes, dear friends.

849
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,260
We're together in the bub.

850
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,220
That was Ken Nordean, a tape called Triple Talk.

851
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,200
And you know, some of y'all may have heard his stuff now and then.

852
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,340
It's hard.

853
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,740
You can only buy these from Ken Nordean.

854
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,280
Yes, dear friends.

855
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:56,540
And this is Sister Chris speaking to the lost and the faithful alike.

856
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:01,040
The damned and the blessed under Bob in New Jersey.

857
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,900
On another station.

858
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,620
Sister Chris here with you to tell you that in the past weeks,

859
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:16,200
I've delivered bits of rants and such things as slack, time control,

860
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,180
and other aspects of the subgenius church.

861
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,040
And time has come for Sister Chris to relate to you my personal testimony

862
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:29,000
to the salvation in slack that was released to slash by me

863
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,920
through the all-encrusting power of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

864
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,500
Shameful though it may sound,

865
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:40,260
it was a long period in my life when I had tripped and fallen off the luck plane of slack

866
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,080
and knocked my head ad nauseum on the railing of the conspiracy stairway to doom.

867
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:49,460
And the rut at the bottom of the stairwell was deeper than the valleys of Jane Manson's.

868
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,580
And the rut at the bottom of the stairwell was deeper than the valleys of Jane Manson's.

869
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,060
Food had no taste.

870
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,580
My vision was constantly blurry.

871
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:59,320
And television terrorized my time like a vampire sucking my imagination dry.

872
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,620
Life seemed drab and pointless.

873
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,660
At best, droning irritation.

874
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,540
I sought help in the blind alleys of nightclubs and other vices,

875
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,320
but they only seemed to aggravate the situation.

876
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,740
It was no fun.

877
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:18,680
Then I literally stumbled onto a group of enlightened ones.

878
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,800
Ones who were filled with the power and the glory of Bob.

879
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,540
Words like slack, Bob, and WFMU in free form

880
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,420
hung in the air like sweet-smelling pipe tobacco.

881
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,340
At last, the burning irradiated light of slack began to sear my brain pan.

882
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:39,360
I began to forget to be anxious among the pink boys and girls.

883
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,340
I explored the remnants of my subgenius heritage and ethics,

884
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,980
and they were long forgotten during the amnesia of the zombie years.

885
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,460
I can't describe to you the pain I felt.

886
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:49,460


887
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:49,460


888
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:49,460


889
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:49,460


890
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:49,460


891
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:53,100
I can't describe to you the step-by-step dismantling of all that conspiracy programming.

892
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,200
Because events didn't happen in a singular, linear fashion.

893
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:05,100
The closest comparison would be to taking a shower in truth and slack under a pulsating nozzle.

894
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,760
I still had problems and vices, but it was a lot more fun.

895
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,880
My third eye had the clarity of the telescope at Mount Palomar.

896
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,660
I relaxed in the safety of different illusions every day.

897
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,900
The bottom line comes down to having fun.

898
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,280
Yeah, Bob's human shell may be dead, and some people are depressed about that,

899
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,860
some subgenius and latent subgeniuses.

900
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:38,040
But his almighty power lives on through the gifted and the possessed.

901
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:59,380
And it's off to the moon that I should found a boy Inecessarily fed to me.

902
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,160
I set the antenna for the gullet

903
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:01,160


904
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,100
when hosts come to take the

905
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:13,840
and those who live in

906
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,720
ou

907
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,560
We're going to move down here.

908
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,120
I don't even know what's on this one, friends.

909
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,920
Oh, it hurts, though.

910
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,860
Better turn your volumes down.

911
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,660
And those of you who are trying to listen in mono...

912
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,740
Boy, friends, those shows are banging into each other over there on this left channel.

913
00:51:51,620 --> 00:52:09,560
Oh, my God!

914
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:37,220
Oh, my God!

915
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:53,960
We intervene when crises threaten the stabilities and well-beings of our heartlands.

916
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:59,120
Now, let's party!

917
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:07,620
Seeing someone sleeve job a 14 1⁄2-inch John Holmes Wang Dinger special is offensive

918
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:11,720
if nobody's sleeving yours or you're not sleeving anybody's.

919
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,560
You know, that's the whole problem.

920
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:19,120
When you give something up, you expect everybody else to give it up.

921
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:19,640
Too.

922
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,460
And I think that's worse than if you take something up new,

923
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,600
you should expect everybody else to.

924
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,420
Because, obviously, a lot of other people are already doing something

925
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,740
because they want to or think they want to or they like to

926
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,840
or they like to think they want to

927
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,060
or they want to think they like to

928
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,020
just because they want to swear and smoke and drink

929
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,500
and, in your opinion, go to hell.

930
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,640
That's their business.

931
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,180
Not yours.

932
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,320
The only business that's yours is yours.

933
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,320
And if it's yours and it offends you,

934
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,280
you better pull it out and look at it closely

935
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,240
and find out why it offends you.

936
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,140
Because I tell you, it offends you mostly because

937
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,640
it reminds you that you're missing out on something.

938
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:15,040
And that's why sometimes when we say things in the church of the subgenius,

939
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,240
we offend people because it reminds them that they're in the grip of the,

940
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,740
because it reminds them they lead dreary, empty, stilted,

941
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:28,100
hungry lives of desperation and quietness.

942
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,820
They don't like the way we talk

943
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:36,180
because it reminds them that they've got sexual organs

944
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:40,920
and if they could just make an effort, they could use them.

945
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,280
They don't like the way we talk because we remind them that we're all animals

946
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,240
and daily must fulfill our biological functions.

947
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:54,200
And as they are something of which God Almighty or whoever brought us here,

948
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,680
gave us, we have no control over them.

949
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,340
Therefore, they've been told,

950
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,200
oh, that's nasty, put it in that little clean white bowl,

951
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,000
that symbol of purity.

952
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:09,220
Why do you have to flush away pure water

953
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,980
with nothing but biological salts dissolved in it

954
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,040
with five and a half gallons of fresh water

955
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,320
that somebody could be cooking dinner and drinking.

956
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,580
And our friends, it's because some people don't like to be reminded.

957
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:34,260
They pretend that if they don't talk about it

958
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:38,420
and don't think about it, then they can forget about it.

959
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,840
And if they're not reminded that they have to squat down

960
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,340
like every other monkey on this planet every day,

961
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:46,620
if things are working right,

962
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,100
then maybe they think they aren't.

963
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:49,440
Right?

964
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,440


965
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,440


966
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,440


967
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,440


968
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,440


969
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,260
They're the monkeys that's on this planet.

970
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,120
But the big, smart, dumb monkeys with too much s**t,

971
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,240
not enough time,

972
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,680
yeah, talking about you

973
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,460
and all you other signifying monkeys,

974
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,500
that's why people get offended.

975
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,480
That's why they don't like to hear us talk about peri-squid.

976
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,740
Oh, God, how disgusting

977
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,900
to use an aphorism of that disgusting nature.

978
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,720
But what they're missing is the point that we're saying is

979
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,020
that,

980
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:23,080
a prairie squid is just like any other wild animal.

981
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,380
It's a natural thing.

982
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,780
You can't cover up a prairie squid

983
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,760
because it'll come creeping out some.

984
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:33,100
And you stamp out the prairie squid and you stamp out life itself.

985
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,940
That's what we're saying.

986
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,340
We're saying that our biology is what we are

987
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,860
and there's nothing we can do about it but enjoy it.

988
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,360
That's why sometimes we offend people.

989
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,000
That's why the church will never,

990
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,000


991
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,780
never be something you'll see in prime time television

992
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,920
because they don't want you to be reminded of what you really are

993
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:02,900
because then you take a good look at yourself and realize,

994
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,660
the hell, what am I doing all this s**t, them for?

995
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,500
That's why they don't like for us to see these things.

996
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,240
That's why prairie squid,

997
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,600
poo dog, poo dog,

998
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,100
poo dog, poo dog, poo dog.

999
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,560
All those strange, strange cult references.

1000
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,380
Ah, yes dear friends.

1001
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,260
All those strange cult references.

1002
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,980
That's why it's all so important.

1003
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,260
And I'm sorry we couldn't get out of here

1004
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,180
quite quick enough,

1005
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,840
but dear friends, you can write for information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1006
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:45,320
And you will get real information in the mail if you want to call it mail.

1007
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,140
It's a p-bob at p-o-box,

Praise Bob

1014
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,100
and tune in next week

1015
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,940
for one more breath

1016
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,400
of that church air

1017
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,660
that mighty church air

1018
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:08,580
I've got to get out of here now

1019
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,260
Thanks, Praise Bob

1020
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,780
Yes, that was old friends

1021
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,580
a rerun of Hour of Slack

1022
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,540
number 42 from August 1986

1023
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,420
First broadcast

1024
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,140
on K&ON Dallas

1025
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,560
featuring examples of subgenius shows
