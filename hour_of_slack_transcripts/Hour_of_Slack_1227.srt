1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,260
The radio, remember? Make it work.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,420
The hour of slug.

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,180
So you did bust it.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,160
Stations aren't strong enough in the daytime.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,080
Tonight it'll work.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,060
Tonight it's better.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,180
Can't you smell it?

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,180
Hey, at IONET, we like to keep things simple.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,040
But this new product that we're launching today is pretty amazing.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,020
So we thought we'd make our new TV ad something special.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,860
Ready, guys?

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,440
Australia.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,500
This is Bob.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,360
Hallelujah.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,700
Bob stands for Fox.

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,960
Hallelujah.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,480
Bob gives you fast wireless broadband and phone in one sexy little box for one little monthly bill.

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:56,980
Hallelujah.

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:57,860
Hallelujah.

20
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,480
Hallelujah.

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,780
To find out more about Bob, give us a call.

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,700
Or go online.

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:02,740
What?

24
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:05,820
Hallelujah.

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,020
Hello.

26
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,220
I'm speaking again.

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,160
This is me.

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,200
Yeah, I did have a drink.

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,860
I'm having a drink right now.

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,560
This is me, Bernard in Braithwaite.

31
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,240
I just want to say that, you know, the subgenius ministers call the pink.

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,500
They put their hands on one of us.

33
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,140
They are going to get...

34
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,760
their ass kicked.

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,600
I'm saying it up front, close and personal.

36
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,880
No room for misunderstanding.

37
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,460
These pinks put their hands on me.

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,400
They are going to get their ass kicked.

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:54,200
These Americans and those who are friendly with the United States and the rest of the world of these superficial humans mess with us.

40
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,840
They're going to get their ass kicked.

41
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,500
Okay.

42
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,280
From PR News in Washington, I'm tortured with electric metal bars.

43
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,980
President Obama says clunkers like Vice President Joe Biden have helped workers.

44
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,040
There are no reports of injuries.

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,680
An industry trade group predicts 5662.

46
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,540
PR News.

47
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,820
You're listening to PR.

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,940
The chairman of the Federal Reserve won't get better until 2012.

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,820
Ben Bernanke spoke in Washington today saying Bernanke has been released from prison.

50
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,160
The man who threw his shoes at President George W. Bush said...

51
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,020
has retail sales rose 7% last month better than PR News.

52
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
All right.

53
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,600
He's the president.

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,740
And I ringing master key.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,060
Here he is.

56
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,780
I did it.

57
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,680
Starwood culminates in a giant bonfire

58
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,720
where everybody who's not a spoilsport

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,160
joins in this big dance around a truly immense bonfire.

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,460
It's not thrown together by amateurs.

61
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,000
It's built by people who've been building

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,100
house-sized bonfire log piles.

63
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,600
For decades.

64
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,420
And it's actually, although I'm one of the eight people

65
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,460
who appear to light the bonfire and the big ceremony,

66
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,420
it's actually lit from offstage,

67
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,120
or from out of sight, by remote control,

68
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,400
by rocket scientists.

69
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:51,120
So what appears to be almost a caveman-looking scene,

70
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,200
it's actually a false front.

71
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,180
It looks like a bunch of people in caveman garb

72
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,980
lighting a big fire, but it's really pretty high-tech.

73
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,220
I was just looking at some of the featured speakers

74
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,960
you've had over the years, and one of them,

75
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,700
someone I've always wanted to see speak,

76
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,840
is Isaac Bonwitz.

77
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,500
Did you ever see him?

78
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,880
Yeah, it's funny you should mention that.

79
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,720
We've got a real nice picture of Isaac and me

80
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,580
standing together out next to the bonfire.

81
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,500
And Satan was also there that day.

82
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,400
I'm jealous of Isaac Bonwitz.

83
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,640
He's the head of the Druids in America.

84
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,820
North American, isn't it?

85
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,480
Yeah, the American Federation of Druid,

86
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,600
Druidic whatever.

87
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,820
They have a nice Gaelic name for it,

88
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,940
or Scottish, Old English, or something.

89
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,700
I can't pronounce.

90
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,480
But I'm jealous of him,

91
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,520
because he's been featured as a villain

92
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,100
in Christian comic books.

93
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,800
Oh, really?

94
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,800
And I haven't.

95
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,640
In fact, a couple of my friends from Starwood

96
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
have been featured as villains.

97
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,880
Gavin Frost, who is a Wiccan author,

98
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,700
he and Isaac both were featured

99
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,900
in a big, elaborate Jack T. Chick Crusaders comic,

100
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,040
and were shown as,

101
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,440
they were depicted as these rich, sleazy,

102
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,800
highly-placed businessmen

103
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,500
that had minions.

104
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,820
They were like gangsters

105
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,280
with whole endless gangs of minions

106
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,620
placed in government

107
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,260
who would do their bidding.

108
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,000
And they controlled many crooked cops.

109
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,240
Now, in reality, I know both of these characters.

110
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,480
Isaac Bonwitz is actually

111
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,940
a kind of a filth-singing geek.

112
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,480
I am also what one might term

113
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,920
a filth-singing geek,

114
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,460
so that's not a put-down.

115
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,140
But he's certainly not a threatening character,

116
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,740
and I've never seen him with even one minion.

117
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,480
At best, he'll have a classroom full of people

118
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,960
talking about how to do magic properly.

119
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,560
Yeah.

120
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,620
Didn't he start his group

121
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,940
because he wanted to get out of the

122
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,700
sort of mandatory Sunday masses

123
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,580
when he was at university?

124
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,220
I think all the students had to go,

125
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,160
it was like mandatory,

126
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,660
they had to go to some kind of, you know,

127
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,500
Christian mass every Sunday,

128
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,900
unless they had their own religious group,

129
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,320
and he started the druidic group

130
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,040
as a way of getting out of having to go to the...

131
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,600
Oh, I didn't know that.

132
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,820
Why didn't I think of that in high school?

133
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,680
If only I'd come up with the Church of the Subgenius

134
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,380
a little earlier.

135
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,280
I went to a private school

136
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,140
where I had to sit every morning.

137
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,580
We had to go to chapel and sing hymns,

138
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,680
which was kind of...

139
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,300
silly, because about a third of the kids

140
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,620
in the school were Jewish.

141
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,180
And even they had to sit there

142
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,600
and either sing hymns

143
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,220
or twiddle their thumbs patiently.

144
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,500
It was kind of ridiculous.

145
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,420
But that's not why I got into

146
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,980
kook bashing and God-hating and so forth.

147
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,860
I don't actually have any bone to pick

148
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,220
with any specific religion.

149
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,480
I personally was raised

150
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,520
a pretty much secular humanist,

151
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,040
a scientist, you might say.

152
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,280
But when I was very young,

153
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,560
I took that first walk down the occult aisle

154
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,260
of the used bookstore that we've all done.

155
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,600
And I did believe everything at first.

156
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,860
I was like, oh my God, UFOs, levitation, ESP,

157
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,540
all of this is...

158
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,680
If this is for real,

159
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,020
this is the most important thing in the world.

160
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,000
And after about 10 years of really studying

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,620
all that stuff and looking into it,

162
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,140
I decided that what it really had to offer

163
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,000
was some of the most interesting people in the world.

164
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,900
It was not necessarily the most important stuff in the world

165
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,360
because it has remained exactly where it's been

166
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,780
throughout history,

167
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,760
in the realm of myth, legend, and urban myth,

168
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,980
for the most part.

169
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,740
You know, until it happens to you,

170
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,200
then all of a sudden it's different.

171
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,540
But I'm one of those people

172
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,220
that the aliens do not reveal themselves to.

173
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,180
I've actually been in a situation

174
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,160
where everybody else in the trailer court

175
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,180
could see a UFO and I couldn't.

176
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,680
So that proves that the aliens must have adopted me

177
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,240
and hypnotized me

178
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,520
and implanted an anti-hypnosis program

179
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,200
so that I could never again be hypnotized

180
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,460
or see anything that was really there.

181
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,300
They don't...

182
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,320
They don't want you flirting with other aliens, maybe.

183
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,280
Right.

184
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,240
Well, I was wondering,

185
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,880
in one of those Terry Pratchett books,

186
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,520
one of the wizards says,

187
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,440
oh, you know, we wizards,

188
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,840
we can see things that really are there.

189
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,740
Actually, I could go stand at the pulpit.

190
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,300
I have a whole rant script.

191
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,680
I always do, every X day,

192
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,460
and I never use it

193
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,520
because there's never enough people around

194
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,680
to feel like hollering.

195
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,740
Well, don't you want to...

196
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,640
I save it for Starwood

197
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,240
and...

198
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,860
I hate to say this, kids,

199
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,480
but at the Pagan Festival,

200
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,020
I get an audience that fills this entire thing

201
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,420
and spills out over into the field.

202
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,040
Now, that will get you ranting.

203
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,740
That's the kind of fear, man,

204
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,200
when you have 700 primate eyes staring at you.

205
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,580
It inspires a certain amount of energy

206
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,240
on the part of the focused-upon person.

207
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,440
There's...

208
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,460
been a tremendous misunderstanding

209
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,180
among subgeniuses,

210
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,840
and that makes its own sense,

211
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,340
so I'll just leave it at that.

212
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,800
But let me muddy the waters even further

213
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,080
and say what you think.

214
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,500
Quit your job for Bob.

215
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,680
Now, think about that.

216
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,280
You've probably all heard it.

217
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,200
In fact, half of you

218
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,540
probably already paid the fee to say it.

219
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,420
But are you still working for Bob?

220
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:18,820
Quit!

221
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,060
I don't practice what I preach

222
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,540
because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to.

223
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,280
You think you're special.

224
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,580
You say, oh, you can't put me in a box.

225
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,320
Friends, we all end up in a box.

226
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,180
Your only choice is what you're going to do

227
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,940
between now and then.

228
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,020
You need to find your own personal

229
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,740
short-duration Savior

230
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,420
because you have a short-duration Savior.

231
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,940
You need to find your own personal

232
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,300
existence.

233
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,180
So why not start with Bob

234
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,660
and let him point the way

235
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,940
to the next short-duration personal Savior?

236
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,540
Follow his pipe.

237
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,300
Now, it's been said that

238
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,320
the subgeniuses

239
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,340
are the good weirdos

240
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,760
making fun of the bad weirdos.

241
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,620
And, well, we're not necessarily good,

242
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,340
but we are trying to be funny.

243
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,040
We're here, friends.

244
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,560
Actually, what we're here for

245
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,680
is to make civilization fun again.

246
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,340
We're not into Bob.

247
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,280
We're into Bob.

248
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,660
We're not into wisdom,

249
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,100
but wisdom.

250
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,980
We're not wise women and wise men,

251
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,440
but wise guys.

252
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,440
Wise anchors.

253
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,160
Wisenheimers.

254
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,020
Wise asses.

255
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,960
Those who crack wise, my friends,

256
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,740
and the truly wise won't.

257
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,400
Don't look too closely into our cracks.

258
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,820
The church of the subgenius,

259
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,640
as it says in your program book,

260
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,840
is the Chinese finger trap of the mind.

261
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,500
But remember,

262
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,420
there's no I in Bob.

263
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,500
There is an I in subgenius,

264
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,740
and that I might be you.

265
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,500
The you in us.

266
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,520
The us that you become

267
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,220
when you give 30 USD's.

268
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,140
Dollars to us.

269
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,320
Because, friends,

270
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,340
Bob Dobbs gets it all in the end.

271
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,440
And then,

272
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,020
he gives it to us

273
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,240
in the end.

274
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,520
As our friend Andy Christ once said to me,

275
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,820
he watched me after a particularly stressful ex-day freak out.

276
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,320
And I apologized to him later.

277
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,680
He goes,

278
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,600
Stan, if I'd gotten ringed out by Bob as many times as you,

279
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,620
I'd freak out too.

280
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,620
I see babies cry.

281
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,960
I watch them grow.

282
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,400
They'll learn much more

283
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,280
than I'll ever know

284
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,280
when I say them a sound.

285
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,800
What a wonderful world.

286
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,520
Cheryl Flick Haunting

287
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:28,980
Move I Hope

288
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:29,620
Rem genau

289
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,380
Thank You

290
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,400


291
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,740
I Wish

292

I Wů

293
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,040
Oh.

294
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,920
Oh.

295
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:39,920


296
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,740
I'm in ecstasy.

297
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:40,740


298
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:40,740


299
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:40,740


300
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:40,820
to Kathryn

301
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:40,820


302
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,580
Prosшиб Week

Miss P

304
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,120


305
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,480
Go

306
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,020
Bel corpse

307
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,020


308
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,540
Like the flies and cockroaches

309
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,900
And other nasty bugs that buzz around and tell me

310
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,860
Why are people so cocked up?

311
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,540
And why do they want to blow things up?

312
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,120
Why do they hate each other when they're so much like each other?

313
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,120
I wanna know

314
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,180
Hey, what's going on with the weather?

315
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,800
I'm always oh so hot or very cold

316
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,040
It seems it's always raining or snowing

317
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,800
I tell you Lord, it's getting pretty old

318
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,500
And tell me

319
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,400
Why are people so cocked up?

320
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,040
And why do they want to blow things up?

321
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,740
And why do they hate each other when they're so much like each other?

322
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,800
I wanna know

323
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,780
Yeah, I really wonder just what you were thinking

324
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,380
How could you let it go so far astray?

325
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,160
You must have been down the corner drinking

326
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,640
And that's why we're all so fucked up today

327
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,120
Now I know

328
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,960
That's why we're all so fucked up

329
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,680
And that's why we love to blow things up

330
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,280
And that's why we hate each other when we're so much like each other

331
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,240
And now I know

332
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,300
Yeah

333
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:44,800


334
00:15:44,800 --> 00:16:14,800


335
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:44,800


336
00:16:44,800 --> 00:17:14,800


337
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:44,800


338
00:17:44,800 --> 00:18:14,800


339
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:44,800


340
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,680
I'm gonna see the next one

341
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,620
Which goes way higher

342
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,680
I don't even know what it is

343
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,420
Myself

344
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,820
I fear, I worry about that

345
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,620
We run into three types

346
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,940
There's those who really do get the joke

347
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,560
And those who think they get the joke

348
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,880
And those who are the joke

349
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,600
And those who haven't figured out yet that there's a joke involved at all

350
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,380
And those are the ones that scare me

351
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,840
Frankly

352
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,900
And sometimes they really do scare me

353
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,740
And then there's

354
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,560
There's the poser

355
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,300
Weirdos

356
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,520
Or poser enlightened people

357
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,200
Or poser gurus

358
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,800
And or poser subgeniuses

359
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:29,020
Who think that acting crazy all the time means that they therefore have slack

360
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:35,100
We got into a big discussion over that problem on our news group alt.slack

361
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,700
Some kid in England had made the news

362
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,180
I don't even remember what his mistake was

363
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,780
But it was his stupid excuse that was the main thing

364
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,600
It was like

365
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,860
Nobody could beli-

366
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,300
I don't even remember what it was

367
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,960
Somebody said

368
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,600
It seems to me the hospital should have checked that kid for mental problems

369
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,800
Even allowing for freedom of expression

370
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,760
He must have known that such a story wouldn't have been much good for his grades

371
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,720
If you haven't learned to put on a mask of normality

372
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,260
By age 17

373
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,100
There can be little hope

374
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,020
And then another subgenius said

375
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,600
Yeah that's exactly what they want!

376
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,820
They want the subgeniuses to do

377
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,660
They don't care if you're a subgenius as long as you act normal

378
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,160
Too much normalcy in developing weirdos acts to stifle their superpowers

379
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:31,540
They, the conspiracy, want the subgeni to be powerless

380
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,080
It's like Bob says

381
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,840
Act like a dumb shit and they will treat you as an equal

382
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,420
And our friend said

383
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,780
He said I don't think he's advocating that

384
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,500
It's more of a prediction of what's going to happen

385
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,940
Personally I don't care if they treat me as an equal or not

386
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,980
Like I said I had an inheritance

387
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,880
But really it's advice for getting along with the normals

388
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,420
Now maybe you were born rich and you don't have to worry about that

389
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,940
But as far as I'm concerned

390
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:10,760
Passing is the first skill any kind of weirdo from subgenius to a Wiccan has to learn

391
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,120
You know whether you're rich or poor you have to learn how to pass

392
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,060
Because the nail that sticks up will be hammered down

393
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,140
As our friend Ninslow pointed out

394
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,560
And he was pointing with a hammer

395
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:31,840
So you can choose which normal subgroup among whom you're going to try to pass

396
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,360
Some pass as office workers

397
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,960
Some pass as hippie bums

398
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,240
Some pass as craftsmen

399
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,740
Some pass as artists

400
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:47,120
Normals expect artists to smell funny and be socially clumsy

401
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,140
And scientists too

402
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,680
But if you look in the yellow pages under artists and scientists

403
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,140
You can see how much demand there is for those these days

404
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:02,920
So here I'm being paid to be a subgenius preacher

405
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,240
But in my little neighborhood in Cleveland

406
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,740
I don't wear Dobbs heads on my clothing

407
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,720
And I don't have a hat

408
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,260
I don't have any bumper stickers on my car

409
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,480
I think there's a little hint of Devo fandom on there

410
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,880
And everybody in the neighborhood knows me as Mr. Smith

411
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,080
Or else that old guy with the hat and the beautiful granddaughter

412
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,280
That he shouldn't be touching that way

413
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,280
And that's how I have managed to get away with murder

414
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,720
And not have my kids taken away from me for all these years

415
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
There are subgeniuses who think that's a good thing

416
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,040
But there are some who have had their kids taken away

417
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,680
By the way for those who are following the case of Reverend Magdalene

418
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,140
She has her boy back

419
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,460
And the whole family's been together for about a year or more

420
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,900
It's still a little bit up in the air

421
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,120
But by the time it's decided the kid's going to be grown up anyway

422
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,060
So they basically sort of

423
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,900
They won except that they'll be paying legal fees for the rest of their born days

424
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,020
Anyway friends I had to learn to pass as a normal

425
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,440
In fact I was thinking about writing a book called Pink Like Me

426
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,240
You know I had to wear what we call the masks of insanity

427
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,900
Which is really, it really means the mask of normality

428
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:34,860
In fact up until 1990 I used to get actual haircuts from real barbers

429
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:39,300
And work jobs just like a regular person

430
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,480
But remember friends!

431
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,660
No matter what situation you have to find yourself in

432
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,740
To you know pay the rent or find a couch to sleep on

433
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,180
Just remember this

434
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,840
They can't read your mind

435
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,020
In fact most of them can't even read subtitles

436
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,100
So um

437
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,760
And you know the funny thing about these festivals

438
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,300
I always end up saying them

439
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,280
Once a day at least I end up going

440
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,620
I'm so normal

441
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,300
I don't want to be told that they're hands off

442
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,300


443
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,300


444
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,300


445
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,720
don't tell the sub geniuses

446
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,660
But I really

447
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,980
Sometimes I'm ashamed to myself because

448
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,480
because I don't hate everything anymore.

449
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,920
Well, subgenius was, when I was an angry young man,

450
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,640
I was perfectly happy to work on this stuff for free

451
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,340
because I was sincerely angry.

452
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,860
I was preaching about slack, but I didn't really have it,

453
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,480
which gave my preaching a certain amount of fire.

454
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,180
But I hate to confess it, folks, I have to fight my hate now.

455
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,720
I actually did get slack.

456
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,700
It took a long time, but I've got a fair equivalent of slack.

457
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,400
It's hard for me to work up a fair steam of hate anymore.

458
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,020
And I am kind of normal compared to most of the weirdos.

459
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm not interested in anybody's pooper.

460
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,160
I stopped trying to take over the planet when I was in my early 20s.

461
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,480
I brushed my teeth and balanced my checkbook,

462
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,580
and I even know the difference between its and its,

463
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,560
which makes me a weirdo's weirdo.

464
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,320
In some respects.

465
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,660
Uncle Puzzling, will you tell me a bedtime story?

466
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,680
No, this is disgusting.

467
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,220
Will you tell me what the 60s were like?

468
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,020
Was it really like an Oliver Stone movie?

469
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,980
Probably, but Uncle Puzzling just doesn't want to speak to me.

470
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,320
Eh, eh.

471
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,860
Why, who's...

472
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,640
The wrong kind of question.

473
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,340
See, here they are.

474
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,700
Alright, here's what the 60s were like.

475
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,540
Oh, they were wonderful.

476
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,620
They were being, like, stuck inside a...

477
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,860
a ballgum machine.

478
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,900
Cool, man.

479
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,640
Yes, the 60s were very gory.

480
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,720
Hell's way along with...

481
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,440
Oh, it's the 60s, man.

482
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,140
The 60s are back!

483
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,100
Yeah!

484
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,540
I wish you didn't ask for the 60s.

485
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,280
Look what's happening.

486
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,400
Coming up, rerun of...

487
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:11,860
Yeah.

488
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,420
Yeah.

489
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:13,740
Yeah.

490
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,700
Yeah.

491
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,300


492
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,720
Now you think the 60s are back.

493
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:15,820


494
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:15,820


495
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:15,820


496
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:15,820


497
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:15,820


498
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,840
They're the big goes.

499
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,940
Hey, remember body painting?

500
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,000
Cheap awful records in your basement, real loud, on a cheap I-Fi.

501
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,820
Yeah, yeah, and painting it black and putting those black light posters up.

502
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,220
Like, look at this one.

503
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,520
When the light hits it, you can practically see it.

504
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,480
It's switching there.

505
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,280
Boy, that brought those colors out, man.

506
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,940
Everybody on the floor, let's dance.

507
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,240
It's the 60s.

508
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,240
It's the electric baboons, man.

509
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,660
Puzzling evidence.

510
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:52,140
There are friends from KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Howell, Doug Wellman,

511
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,700
and in this case, Phineas Narco.

512
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,220
The collages we heard at the beginning of the show are by Lee Murr,

513
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,380
Fernand and Andy Lee Murr.

514
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,740
And the music in the background here is Witch Disco,

515
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,740
the descendant of the band Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

516
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,600
It pretty much involves almost everybody from ESO,

517
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,000
except for the late Chaz Smith.

518
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,300
Recorded live at Starwood.

519
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,600
Now this is a little bit cynical, friends.

520
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,580
We have been pursuing the subject of fairness for years.

521
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,120
My wife and I often discuss how unfair everything is, especially to her.

522
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,300
And we've arrived at the conclusion, and this is pretty cosmic,

523
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,120
life is fair.

524
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,760
But only for people who are unfair.

525
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,060
It's unfair only for fair people.

526
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,080
But if you live long enough, you get used to the crap

527
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,080
and learn to sniff out the sugar instead automatically.

528
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,160
Now unfortunately for some people, long enough would require centuries,

529
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,420
but I don't think you're one of those.

530
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,240
The important thing is to stay alive.

531
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,160
And that may also require staying busy.

532
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,720
I agree.

533
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:11,720


534
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:11,720


535
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,760
I hope that doesn't wreck your idea of slack.

536
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,280
That actually is my idea of slack.

537
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,760
If you have nothing better to do,

538
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,400
helping people who are even more messed up than you are

539
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,120
has been known to work wonders for the spirit.

540
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,860
So if there's anybody here who's seriously depressed,

541
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,040
I'm not telling you to quit taking your pills,

542
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,200
but you know, there's people who've got it worse than you

543
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,980
that can't even walk or can't talk or can't something.

544
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,840
You know, might take your mind off some of your own problems

545
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,220
if you threw in some volunteer slack time for that.

546
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,340
People actually ask me serious things

547
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,880
as if I was a minister in a religion.

548
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,800
And they'll say things like,

549
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,360
Reverend Stang, is there an afterlife?

550
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,200
Friends, the church of the subgenius does believe in an afterlife.

551
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,700
It's called...

552
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,440
death.

553
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,000
What happens after your life?

554
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,040
You're dead.

555
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,600
Dead forever.

556
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,020
So if you've got some living to do before then,

557
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,420
get busy.

558
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,640
As Bob said,

559
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,580
pull the wool over your own eyes.

560
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,680
You'll still be blind,

561
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,560
but at least your head will be warm.

562
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,900
Death is not a fearful thing.

563
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,480
Take our life from us.

564
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
We lay it down.

565
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,740
Please get us some medication.

566
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,600
Take our life from us.

567
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,640
We lay it down.

568
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,680
Please get us some medication.

569
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,420
Let's just be done with it.

570
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,060
Let's be done with the agony of it.

571
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,380
Death is not a fearful thing.

572
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,520
Please get us some medication.

573
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,660
A little death trip there from Lord Camblore,

574
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,480
thanks to Sweetness McGee.

575
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,220
Oh, you got it.

576
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,580
So that's all I could think.

577
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:41,920
Are there any questions?

578
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:41,920


579
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,300
Do you...

580
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,760
Are there any questions?

581
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,280
There's one back there.

582
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,220
By the way,

583
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,320
I'm deaf as hell,

584
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,160
so you're going to have to really holler,

585
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,880
and Princess,

586
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,080
we may have to translate.

587
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,960
I'd really like to ask the first question,

588
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,520
but sometimes,

589
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,760
I don't.

590
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,600
Paradox?

591
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,940
I wish Dr. Hal was here.

592
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,680
Yeah, really.

593
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,480
Yes.

594
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,480
Yes.

595
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,920
There, that's a good enough for that question.

596
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,480
Jeez.

597
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,520
I can't even remember that one well enough to repeat it.

598
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,480
It's such a paradox.

599
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,540
Hey, what's up?

600
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,200
Do you always get questions like this?

601
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,260
Do I always get questions like which?

602
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,440
This.

603
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,400
That.

604
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,660
Every time.

605
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,140
So far.

606
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,900
This time.

607
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,620
Surely there's somebody who has crushing desire to know one of Bob's secrets.

608
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,300
What is in Bob's pipe?

609
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,840
What is in Bob's pipe?

610
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,120
We get that all the time.

611
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:05,220
Many kids assume, well, of course he's smoking marijuana because he's two.

612
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,620
Actually, technically, Bob is smoking Borkham Rift.

613
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,500
Which is this cheap pipe tobacco.

614
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,200
But, here's what Bob's really smoking in his pipe, my friend.

615
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:17,940
You!

616
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,460
You!

617
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,680
If you truly want to know Bob.

618
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,560
If you want to know what is behind each of those half-toned dots that make up his face.

619
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,160
If you want to know the real secret of Bob.

620
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,880
You throw yourself into that pipe.

621
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,300
You become the dottle raining down from that pipe.

622
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,600
You become the molecule that's going down.

623
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,880
You become Bob's esophagus into his lungs.

624
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,040
Or choking him or whatever happens if it goes down the wrong tube.

625
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,560
You might be the molecule that makes Bob get turned on.

626
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,460
You just don't know.

627
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,300
And you, on top of that, it's a moot point.

628
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,460
You don't have any choice.

629
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,140
Bob's gonna, as Onan said, Bob gets us all in the end.

630
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,520
I'm surprised I can still sit down at all.

631
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,020
Hello.

632
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,700
I'm Bob.

633
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


634
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


635
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


636
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


637
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


638
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


639
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


640
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


641
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


642
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


643
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


644
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,700


645
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,180
This is me, Bernard.

646
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,240
I just do not want to leave no room for misunderstanding.

647
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,900
We are subgeniuses.

648
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:25,540
We are not part of the human race of these ugly humans who represent society at large.

649
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,160
They are gonna get their ass kicked.

650
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,760
I don't want to be around when it happens.

651
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,520
The UFOs are appearing in the sky.

652
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,220
I had two dreams.

653
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,240
And one of the dreams that I will be taken aboard a spaceship.

654
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,600
And I will, and I believe that I will be taken away from here.

655
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,340
It's just a matter of time when they decide to come and take me away from here.

656
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,320
Because the UFOs are, they are appearing in the sky.

657
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,900
The UFOs are appearing in the sky.

658
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,540
Reverend Ivan Stang, send a message to Reverend Ivan Stang.

659
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm suspected of having ties to Al-Qaeda.

660
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:11,700
The Center for Disease says the first doses of H1N1 virus will be distributed in about two weeks.

661
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:19,440
Dr. Jabe says the first wave of 3.5 million doses of swine flu will be in a small nasal spray form.

662
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,180
And will be followed by prison overcrowding during normal business hours.

663
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,360
But the federal government has taken over.

664
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,860
PR News from Washington.

665
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:34,100
Oh, a question from the really red-headed lady there.

666
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:41,680
Oh, Reverend, I have a question from the chapel of the sub-division.

667
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,280
I'm a genius from the Maldives.

668
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,240
And they would like to know how Connie praises Bob.

669
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,840
And if that might be something that they should emulate.

670
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,940
Oh, do you want to know how Connie praises Bob and if that's something they should emulate?

671
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,840
Yes.

672
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,900
I don't know how Connie praises Bob.

673
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,960
But I do know that they better not try it themselves.

674
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,820
Because Connie, there's no telling what she's going to do.

675
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,680
Now, I don't know that she's going to do it.

676
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,500
Connie has apparently a lot of husbands.

677
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,580
And Bob supposedly has a wife in every state of the Union.

678
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,920
And every state of mind.

679
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:28,640
But there are some mysteries of Bob that we, she's writing it down.

680
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,460
That's a good, you saw the obsequious way she asked the question.

681
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,440
We'll be beating her later to beat the meekness out of her.

682
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,780
But, yeah.

683
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,540
The question of Connie and Bob.

684
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,380
Man, that's the mystery, isn't it?

685
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,240
It's the endless battle of man against woman.

686
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,580
And woman against man.

687
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,780
Or man against man.

688
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,300
Or woman against woman.

689
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,740
It's all getting, you know.

690
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,700
Where's that stripper, the pole?

691
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,500
Yeah, the pole camp.

692
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,140
Let's all blow this stuff off and go to the pole camp.

693
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,740
And see women up against women.

694
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,100
Men up against men.

695
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,800
And men up against women.

696
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,760
And your wife.

697
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,120
And your wife.

698
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,020
I could marry everybody here.

699
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,180
Let's just do it real quick.

700
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,440
Say I do.

701
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,300
I do.

702
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,840
You're all married now.

703
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,280
You can do anything you want.

704
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,900
You actually could already.

705
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,780
But it sounds better coming from somebody who paid $30 to be an ordained minister now, doesn't it?

706
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,040
You could be that ordained minister yourself.

707
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,580
Actually, I'm sure everybody I'm talking to is probably already in the Universal Life Church.

708
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:53,100
It's a fairly minor, I don't think it really even classifies as a cult, especially when you talked about some of the more, you know, the bigger, well, people like yourselves.

709
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,460
But the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

710
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,880
Are you familiar with it?

711
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,400
Oh, those.

712
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,160
They had it so easy.

713
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,640
Of course, I imagine the Discordians say the same thing about us.

714
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:05,880
Yeah.

715
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:13,940
Actually, I love our brethren in the rival cult of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

716
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,940
Although, let's face it, it's a takeoff on creationist kooks.

717
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,360
They don't really believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

718
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:34,520
The subgeniuses believe in J.R. Bob Dobbs enough to send in $30.

719
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,660
When they're serious.

720
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:45,300
I mean, I don't know if they're serious enough to subgenius.com or they're serious enough to make it out to that remote campground.

721
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:52,980
And I'd like to see the Flying Spaghetti Monster fans pull off a convention like we do.

722
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,520
Yeah, I know.

723
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:01,560
Speaking of which, our next convention will be at a giant science fiction and fantasy convention in Atlanta, Georgia.

724
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,100
How's that?

725
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,600
Dragon Con.

726
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,120
Yeah.

727
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,400
Yeah, Dragon Con.

728
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,880
It's the beginning of September.

729
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,800
Are you actually going to be there then?

730
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,220
Yeah, yeah.

731
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:21,460
There's a big subgenius event that also involves a group who makes music using Tesla coil equipment.

732
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,440
Oh, awesome.

733
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,160
You know, those big dynamos that shoot sparks between them?

734
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,720
Yeah, yeah.

735
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,080
And have like a Jacob's Ladder effect.

736
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,820
Those make a noise, you know, kind of a crackling noise.

737
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,660
And these guys have set it up.

738
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,220
They discovered that depending on the frequency, the noise is different.

739
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:46,020
And they can play tunes using these gigantic dynamos.

740
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:55,020
And it's not, it's the crackling noise made by the electricity can be modulated into notes.

741
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:02,800
So they'll play like Darth Vader's theme or the Pac-Man game theme on these gigantic, frightening cranes.

742
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:02,800


743
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,580
Crackling things.

744
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:08,120
And so we're going to intersperse our preaching between concerts by them.

745
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:08,940
Oh, awesome.

746
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,520
That sounds amazing.

747
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,040
That sounds amazing.

748
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,100
Yeah, yeah.

749
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,380
It should be a lot of fun.

750
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,780
That's my main interest.

751
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,320
My main interest.

752
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:15,880
My main interest.

753
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,420
My main interest.

754
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:16,900
My main interest.

755
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,020
My main interest.

756
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:24,380
And, dear friends, that was a little bit of the British podcast, Right Where You Are Sitting

757
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,060
Now, with Ken Eakins and Ken Monahan.

758
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,800
You can find more about that from sittingnow.co.uk.

759
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Say, say, say, yeah, yeah.

760
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,240
Yeah.

761
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:42,600
Yeah, you remember that Bob Doppelganger that they had selling quote unquote natural

762
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,020
male enhancements?

763
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,780
Oh, you're right.

764
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
I was wondering if you had a comment.

765
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,440
Recently they got mailed.

766
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,960
It turned out that, as we always suspected, Enzite didn't actually do anything.

767
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,140
And it was a literal mom, actually it was more like a mom and son operation.

768
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,060
He was living in her basement doing this shit.

769
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,780
And it was a little bit of a surprise.

770
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,900
And I don't know.

771
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,320
Apparently they're not supposed to be airing the advertisements anymore, but people are

772
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,300
still telling me they're still seeing.

773
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,040
Oh, yeah, yeah.

774
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,740
The Enzite.

775
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:16,520
Well, you've got, normally I'm the one, that's usually the answer to the question, what he

776
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:16,900
just said.

777
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:24,160
He was talking about the infamous Enzite commercials with Smiling Bob, which is very definitely,

778
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,860
obviously a rip off of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

779
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,200
They're ads.

780
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:36,780
You see, for those of you who watch TV, they're these, they're actually really funny.

781
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,920
Yeah, they are.

782
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,500
They're, you know, I mean, if somebody was going to rip us off, it should be a charlatan

783
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,880
company that makes hard-on pills that don't really work.

784
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,240
Although, like any placebo, if you think it's going to work, it'll work.

785
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,040
Half the time, anyway.

786
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,120
That's a sad thing, you know.

787
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,640
Half the time, the placebo works better than the tested medicine.

788
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,480
What does that tell you?

789
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,680
But anyway, yeah, there was this company, Enzite, that made, we couldn't sue them for

790
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:14,980
trademark, because the Bob didn't have a pipe, and it was, and we're not that rich, and they

791
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,200
were.

792
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,180
They were.

793
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,240
The fellow who started that company, and his mom, and his lawyer, were all found guilty,

794
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,160
and he got 25 years in prison.

795
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,100
And they got, you know, they basically, you know, they got a lot of money.

796
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,520
They basically had to give up almost all their profits, which was billions of dollars.

797
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,420
Which just goes to show what happens when you try to cop Bob.

798
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,620
Bob is not a man to cop.

799
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,740
Don't try to be like J.R. Bob's.

800
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,440
You aren't stupid enough, nor lucky enough.

801
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,800
Well, you might be stupid enough, but you're definitely not lucky enough.

802
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,800
Elsewise, I'd be preaching about you instead of him.

803
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,480
So, I don't know what to say about that one.

804
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,080
I just thought that was just, I was glad to hear that they were, you know, they were,

805
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,080


806
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,000
they got nailed.

807
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,660
But it's true, they're still selling those damn pills.

808
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,500
But like I say, it's not against the law.

809
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,040
Now, this is one thing I must say.

810
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:15,020
It's, there's no law against throwing your money away on stupid, idiotic, waste, meaningless

811
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:15,840
notions.

812
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:21,600
People sometimes just get so, they go, God, I just hate those televangelists, ripping

813
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,320
off that money from those poor, ignorant, little old ladies.

814
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,500
Well, who's spending the money more wisely?

815
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:33,240
I can promise you the televangelist is spending it on something useful, like hookers, liquor,

816
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,940
or yachts.

817
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,000
And being from Dallas, I know whereof I speak.

818
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,960
You know, I had cousins who used to fly Bob Tilton in and out.

819
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:50,100
But his, his days, he finally got whipped down.

820
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,300
But I don't think there should, I don't think there should ever be a law against, against,

821
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:54,300


822
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,300
I mean, people should be free to spend their money however they want.

823
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,640
God, I'd be out of business real quick.

824
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:02,960
Oh.

825
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,360
I had a question.

826
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:13,420
What is the secret to remaining, to remain, to, to being an enthusiastic kitch man when

827
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,060
you look out at your audience and you see they're all naked and clearly have no cash?

828
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,000
Well, that is a problem.

829
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:33,720
it is it's a problem that's the whole paradox the church of the subgenius it's an anti-business

830
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:44,360
business it's an anti-religion religion it's an anti-science science project and it's an anti-art

831
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:53,060
conspiracy art project so what the hell are we doing you got me I that's when it is a secret

832
00:43:53,060 --> 00:44:01,800
it remains a secret that's the answer you too can know the secret positive thinking I think

833
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:08,180
was that well yeah it's kind of frustrating it's we started a religion for non joiners

834
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,640
that part they don't notice we didn't call it Church of the genius

835
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:22,080
so yeah yes it's it's sad but that's why we have to laugh at ourselves

836
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:44,720
so

837
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,880
you

838
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,980

Lolita did that.

880
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,420
That's from my mother's collection,

881
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,360
Lolita performing La Luna.

882
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,220
Thanks to my brother for digitizing that.

883
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,280
And now back to Starwood.

884
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:50,000
We're getting near the end

885
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,740
and dinner time.

886
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,120
Dinner.

887
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,100
Friends, what is important in life?

888
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,320
I've had people ask me,

889
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,580
Reverend Stang, really,

890
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,820
what do you believe in?

891
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,340
What do you truly believe in?

892
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,020
Dinner.

893
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,200
I believe in dinner.

894
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,560
I think dinner holds a hope

895
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,860
and a promise.

896
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,680
You know, we talk about slack.

897
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,980
There's probably for three-quarters

898
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,800
of the world,

899
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:25,560
slack is one good meal a week.

900
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,000
You know, so think about that.

901
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,260
You may have more slack

902
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,080
than you really thought you had.

903
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,140
You kind of...

904
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,540
Again, when you're at your most depressed

905
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,700
and slackless

906
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,320
and you feel like nothing's working,

907
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,080
look around.

908
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,180
You might find that you've got it

909
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,740
better than you think.

910
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,040
And that's why I was saying,

911
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:46,760
the little kids,

912
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,200
I was hoping this thing,

913
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,100
talking about how...

914
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:50,760
There were these parents

915
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,480
standing in line,

916
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,100
paid $200 to be entertained,

917
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,400
and their two children

918
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,600
were rolling in the gravel,

919
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,080
having more fun

920
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,980
than probably anybody will

921
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,220
this whole festival.

922
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,300
I'm jealous of those two little kids,

923
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,400
and I never...

924
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,560
Well, actually, I might get to be...

925
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,260
If I follow in my mom's footsteps,

926
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,600
I'll get to be one and a half years old again.

927
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:17,700
My mom, I guess, had Alzheimer's.

928
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,940
We don't know for sure.

929
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,260
And it was sad and tough.

930
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,500
But she did say something

931
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,780
that sums up the human condition.

932
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,500
She had imagined

933
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,800
that my brother had...

934
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,240
Now, I used to be a filmmaker,

935
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,400
and my brother's a goat rancher,

936
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:40,340
but yet she imagined in her dream world

937
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,140
that she had gone to the movie theater

938
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,540
and seen a movie that my brother had made,

939
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,280
a slick movie,

940
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,860
not an underground-looking thing,

941
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,260
but like a big Hollywood thing,

942
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,540
and my sister played dozens of parts in it.

943
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,920
And this story was so real to her,

944
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,980
she was telling my daughter about it,

945
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,240
and my daughter was flabbergasted.

946
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:02,100
She believed it.

947
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,080
And she had called my brother,

948
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,540
saying she wanted to see the movie,

949
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,980
and my brother came over,

950
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,480
and he said to my mom,

951
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,580
you know, Mammy,

952
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,320
that was really just part of the dream.

953
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,900
And my mother,

954
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,540
my mother shook her head,

955
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:19,780
and went,

956
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,180
well, all I can say is

957
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,080
you people missed a damn good movie.

958
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,400
So reality is whatever.

959
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,380
And I should close on that note,

960
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,580
because now it's time

961
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,680
to set up for the great...

962
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,660
Jagged

963
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,140
a young fool

964
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,480
in the red lead stamp

965
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,500
the outfall shimmered

966
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,520
the light black in steam

967
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,240
and all about

968
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,860
a feel-en- preaching

969
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:18,920
a fate-repeating

970
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,200
and sent your presence near

971
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,540
But lines are drawn

972
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,100
the wrong direction

973
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,220
Then I am aware

974
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:30,100
that words in books here

975
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,100
have a reason

976
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,580
and something in the end

977
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,800
Measurements of time

978
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,160
crumble and climb

979
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,320
for Jaguar, Knight

980
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,100
and White Deer

981
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,360
guitar solo

982
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,460
Strong to roll over

983
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,600
and start to play

984
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,340
Joy's left over

985
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,060
from yesterday

986
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,740
But just now

987
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,200
on the road

988
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:18,900
I'm on my way

989
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:18,900


990
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,180
The pain is all aglow

991
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,720
While they wait

992
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,200
and they watch

993
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,220
for the gates to close

994
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,100
And now they only see

995
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,180
each other in the blackened streets

996
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,600
And measurements of time

997
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,880
crumble and climb

998
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,160
for Jaguar, Knight

999
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,820
and White Deer

1000
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,120
Gorester Jr.

1001
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:16,520
Jack spindle

1002
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:16,520


1003
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:16,520


1004
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,840
In clinical starters

1005
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,820
he'll bring you away

1006
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,560
Never, now, forever, or yesterday

1007
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,620
Just know it's the air

1008
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,680
Where black becomes clear

1009
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:37,260
For jaguar, knife, and white deer

1010
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:42,300
Know that the books here have a look

1011
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,820
There's something in the air

1012
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,840
A measure of time

1013
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:52,360
Trouble and crime for jaguar, knife, and white deer

1014
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:41,700
Jaguar, knife, and white deer

1015
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,820
Jaguar, knife, and white deer

1016
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:46,820


1017
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,480
Jaguar, knife, and white deer

1018
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,900
Jaguar, knife, and white deer

1019
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,380
Jaguar, knife, and white deer

1020
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:28,920
Jaguar, knife, and white deer

1021
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:42,320
Jaguar, knife, and white deer

1022
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,280
Jaguar, knife, and white deer

1023
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,280


1024
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,280


1025
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,280


1026
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,280


1027
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,280


1028
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,480
Not yet.

1029
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,740
Plug him in,

1030
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,780
and Bob connects to IONET by himself.

1031
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,520
Sorry.

1032
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,300
And he downloads everything he needs

1033
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,300
to get you online.

1034
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,500
It's that easy.

1035
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:01,940
Ah-

1036
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:26,000
President Obama is completely wasted, just completely wasted.

1037
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:35,720
Well, Obama is wasted, but far more importantly, the United States have been degraded.

1038
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:36,900
Why?

1039
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:42,640
They have less than one-tenth of 70 percent of 90 percent.

1040
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:50,520
There are between three and four and a half times, down to a depth of one percent.

1041
00:58:51,200 --> 00:59:04,240
And then just two weeks ago, the House of Representatives put a price on carbon, $80, and the...
