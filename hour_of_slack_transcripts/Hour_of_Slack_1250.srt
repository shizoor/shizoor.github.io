1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,420
He's coming.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,240
They don't want to shoot him.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,180
David, I'm afraid.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,060
Be quiet.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,320
There he is.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,080
Look at his face now, David.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,160
Yes.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,080
I see it.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,640
It's composed.

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,300
It looks human again.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,460
Perhaps we're not meant to tamper with the natural.

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,540
So genius.

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,100
Powerful.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,800
Quiet.

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,120
He's looking this way.

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,440
It's me!

17
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,760
No!

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,340
The god damn it!

19
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,000
He's still coming!

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,360
The story of Bob goes back in time to the very beginning of time.

21
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,280
And it's a tale that keeps repeating itself throughout the centuries.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,060
Oh my god.

23
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,020
It's all Stan's fault and I've had enough.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:27,780
So wasting all our animation.

25
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:27,980


26
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:27,980


27
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:27,980


28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000


29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000


30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000


31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,680
of slack.

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,540
Well, if we can think, as long as we got our brains, we can think.

33
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,420
Oh, they'll get that too, George, you'll see.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,180
Let's get high and have fun.

35
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,760
Well, you know what? I'm high.

36
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,240
It's simpler than you think.

37
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,500
By the time we finish, you're all going to know everything that you need to know

38
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,120
to be able to get high in a flash.

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,740
I'm going to show you how to get high with two hands.

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,860
I never do because it takes too long.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,820
Tonight at 9.

42
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,140
When you leave this room, the effect will continue.

43
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,680
Inside of your own mind.

44
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,760
Inside of your own skull.

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,300
If at first you don't succeed, Mr. Keith,

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,540
try again, Mr. Wood.

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,840
Boys!

48
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,580
Oh, my God.

49
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,760
Avenge me!

50
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,480
Avenge me!

51
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,620
Is this a game?

52
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,660
Or is it real?

53
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,440
What, what, what, what, what, what, what's that difference?

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
You don't mind hanging back?

55
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,840
You're jamming my frequencies.

56
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,880
This is not a matter of belief, but it's a matter of fact.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,640
God isn't interested in technology.

58
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,440
He knows nothing of the potential of the microchip or the synapse.

59
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,820
Listen to me, kid.

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,600
What's my problem?

61
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:11,700
It is not my fault.

62
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,600
My survival is invertible.

63
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:15,640
Most intelligence can draw a single person into the dire situation

64
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:15,640


65
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,680
My listeners show their Royal Columns now.

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:16,680


67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,860
There is still patience, Qui Quod.

68
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:18,860


69
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,880
Yes, it is.

70
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,800
That's much better.

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:20,800


72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,580
Thank you, Quod.

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,820
And hold on now, hold on now.

74
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,920
Every religion, okay, on the one hand it will say that peace is the important thing,

75
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,560
loving your neighbor is the important thing,

76
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,540
but they also give numerous...

77
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,000
Except for the Church of the Subgenius.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000


79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,220
That's right, the Church of the Subgenius is the only religion

80
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,920
that is fully upfront about how much hatred it preaches.

81
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,880
It's also the only church that's happy to pay its taxes.

82
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,140
But, you know, in addition to their messages of peace and brotherhood,

83
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,800
you know, you can also take passages out of these writings

84
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,060
that, you know, justify large-scale violence.

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,280
So it's a mixed bag in every religion out there,

86
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,640
and I think they're all silly.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,720
Even Bob, especially Bob.

88
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,420
Well, Bob is silly, of course, that's why I like him.

89
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,100
Well, Bob is silly.

90
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,920
Well, Bob is silly.

91
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,900
Well, Bob is silly.

92
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,480
Well, Bob is silly.

93
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,300
Well, Bob is silly.

94
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,020
Well, Bob is silly.

95
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,380
Well, Bob is silly.

96
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:18,680
The reason I wear these wrist braces is because when I was growing up, my father would pull

97
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,920
my arms up.

98
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,960
Somehow he thought this would make me better than other people.

99
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:32,340
One time Caleb found a cat that was one of the neighbor's cats, and we took it down to

100
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,740
the old hole in the fence, followed by the shit refinery.

101
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,800
The neighborhood ghetto shit refinery, of course.

102
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:51,900
Condoms, nudie magazines, tampons, one dollar bills all floating around, swirling in an

103
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,660
immense pool of human feces.

104
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:04,920
So Caleb took the cat and flung it to the middle of a giant swirling pool of feces,

105
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:14,020
where it stuck legs first and slowly sank as we watched it, constantly meowing, meowing,

106
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,840
meowing, until finally it just puttered, puttered, puttered, followed by bubbles.

107
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,780
But the truth is, I had a sad day in my life.

108
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,000
It was when we had to get rid of the hamsters.

109
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,760
Because we had way too many hamsters.

110
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,280
The hamster population had gotten out of control for the terrarium size.

111
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,000
There was a large mutant hamster that would eat small mutant hamsters.

112
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,920
There was a mutant hamster that had too many heads and legs and tails to be eaten.

113
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,620
So we had to take these hamsters and do some sort of...

114
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,240
hamster side, I guess you could say.

115
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:06,800
We took it out and we poured them into the field on top of a bush, some sort of berry bush.

116
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,500
And there they clung to the branches for the first time in nature.

117
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,460
And we poured gasoline on this bush and we lit it aflame.

118
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:24,860
And we assumed that this would help us to get rid of the hamsters, but instead the hamsters began to run from the bush.

119
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:24,860


120
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,740
Setting grass on fire in a large starburst pattern.

121
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,640
Like a firecracker slowly spreading outwards.

122
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,220
Running into other bushes and setting them on fire.

123
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,560
So we had to begin to pounce atop the hamsters.

124
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,840
Pounce, pouncing, jumping off the hamsters.

125
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,180
Popping, stomping, smoking.

126
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,120
All smoke meat.

127
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,620
Pouncing.

128
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,840
Pouncing.

129
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,240
Popping.

130
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,980
Bret and I were out smoking a cigarette in the front yard.

131
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,220
And Fifi was hanging out with us.

132
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,740
We may have been drinking beer or having partake of drinking beer.

133
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:17,600
And uh, I remember Fifi was scraping her booty hole all up and down the driveway.

134
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,720
Trying to get a spicy, spicy treat off of her.

135
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,560
And uh, I grabbed Fifi's hindquarters.

136
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,840
And very inconsiderately I shoved Fifi along and helped her scrape her hindquarters.

137
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,580
To alleviate her burning itching.

138
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,920
Sinful desire.

139
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,360
And when Fifi stood up, her asshole was bleeding.

140
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,020
And Bret pointed and said, Fifi's asshole is bleeding.

141
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,760
And uh, when Fifi barked blood, it was just a spurt.

142
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,060
A spurt, spurt, spurt, spurt, spurt.

143
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:08,120
You know there's uh, actually quite a large population of youngsters who's, you know,

144
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,760
phalanges and palms of ham that has malformed and gigantic and swollen.

145
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:27,700
Because parents using suction pumps and apparatuses and things like that on their kids hands and feet.

146
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,260
That have been at a very uh, infantile age is a very common occurrence.

147
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:41,000
It's believed that it will help uh, stop the body from not growing.

148
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,820
It's kind of like fertilizer.

149
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,920
Jesus.

150
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,740
Make that happen.

151
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:54,960
It's like people's hands and legs huge just to somehow make them a little bit maybe better.

152
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,120
I am in love with a man.

153
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,940
He is really a wonderful man.

154
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,640
Not just in the looks department.

155
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,660
But in the other departments also.

156
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,040
Like personality and caring.

157
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,420
His name is Ki-E.

158
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,220
And he comes from the planet G-E.

159
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,880
Where the inhabitants live in peace.

160
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,080
And robots do all the work.

161
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,840
Love is a complicated thing.

162
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,680
Especially these days.

163
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,960
And when you're gay, it's always difficult.

164
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,160
Because of society and such.

165
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,860
The inhabitants of G-E except for the robots are just like humans but with an additional sense.

166
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,060
Which is rarely used and impossible for earthly people.

167
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,280
The planet is fully carpeted so footwear is not used.

168
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,520
Clothes are cleaned from the inside out so they don't get stained.

169
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:31,320
In order to save time and reduce confusion, they have consolidated all known flavors into one.

170
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,460
They taste just like custard.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,500
They use much larger units of time than on earth.

172
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,200
The smallest is Zopa.

173
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,640
Which is roughly two and a half seconds.

174
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,360
The other is Zomut.

175
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,180
Which is close to 70 years.

176
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,740
Someday the world will understand.

177
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,800
That all forms of love are equal.

178
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,500
Not just between male and female.

179
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,980
Then we will be free.

180
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,900
To live without prejudice.

181
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,380
Or fear of persecution.

182
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,480
G-E is a man.

183
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,760
He is renowned for his excellent public transportation system.

184
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,660
Not so much the method of transportation but because it is free for all users.

185
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,180
Except robots.

186
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,580
G-E's only religion is called Mid-Tac.

187
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,740
Which is similar to what we would call candy.

188
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:34,580
Ah.

189
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,120
Just a Dolce.

190
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,680
I'm not sure if it's true that Dolce & Gabbana has a

191
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,760
short experience.

192
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,160
No.

193
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,040
My body.

194
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,340
No.

195
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,460
My hands.

196
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,700
Look at them.

197
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,820
They are flying.

198
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,100
The

199
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,400
Ah.

200
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,020
Sali a flanco.

201
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,960
Contact!

202
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,380
I know the story of the mill and the river.

203
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,200
I know the story of the mill and the river.

204
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:37,360
I know the story of the mill and the river.

205
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,620
I know the story of the mill and the river.

206
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,000
The universe shone in all the guns.

207
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,380
The universe shone in all the guns.

208
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,920
The rivers and the tundra were burning.

209
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,960
Tell me your name.

210
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,920
I saw the core of the moon.

211
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,160
It's an eclipse.

212
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,300
I know the story of the mill and the river.

213
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,700
They think it's night.

214
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,220
The devil can make noise.

215
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,480
And this is a nightmare.

216
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,320
The devil is a nightmare.

217
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,560
Let me go with you for a while.

218
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Tell me your name.

219
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,840
And let me show you

220
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,520
how you can do something.

221
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,280
Yes, dear friends, and that was, in fact,

222
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,500
William Shatner speaking Esperanto

223
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,320
on the world premiere, I believe,

224
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,380
of a new Rudy Shatner.

225
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,880

Rabbi e

233
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,640

00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,500
es

235
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,380
Shaddai

236
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,380
Shʻoʻo

237
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,180
Dust

238
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,920
that carries

239
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,240
the divine

240
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,080
leist

241
00:16:37,400 --> 00:17:02,440
But if you, Reverend Diva Schematic, or other subgeniuses who might happen to have spare time and spare talent for cutting up stock footage and making a music video out of it for the Rudy Schwartz famous song, Kill for God, which, by the way, is a religion bashing or fundamentalism bashing song, I should say.

242
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:13,520
We're not, but we certainly wouldn't attempt to bash God, but some members of his fan club can get on our nerves.

243
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:21,320
Now, yes, so that was a world premiere of Rudy Schwartz's song called Ape Men, Rudy Schwartz Project.

244
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:30,140
Before that, the song about the planet Gigi was by Amit Lysak or Lysak.

245
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,420
Titor turned us on to Amit.

246
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,500
Amit Lysak.

247
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,720
You'd have to Google that, I suppose.

248
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,320
Lysak is spelled L-I-S-S-A-C-K.

249
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,280
It sounds like lice slack, but without an L in it.

250
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,600
And Amit is spelled A-M-I-T.

251
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,500
Amit Lysak or Lysak.

252
00:17:50,140 --> 00:18:01,420
Before that, the very strange fellow talking about the body parts and the kitty cat that sounded like Billy Bob Thornton.

253
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,420
That was astounding.

254
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:09,220
A stranger to us, known as the Lone Star Tall Boys, at least for that incarnation.

255
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:21,060
The same person sent us the little sampled Bob song that was just before that, which was purported to be by a vitamin Steve.

256
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:30,540
We heard a few clips of radio synesthesia, and if you're a WCSB listener, you'll be hearing fresh radio synesthesia after this show.

257
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,880
Uh...

258
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,120
And, uh, Fernanda and Andy Lee Murr did our glorious collages there at the beginning, most of them.

259
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,600
But we also heard an El Queso All-Stars Hour of Slack intro.

260
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,420
And, uh, I think that does it for now.

261
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,180
And that sounds like a phone. It might be Dave.

262
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,880
What timing.

263
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,900
Is that?

264
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,800
Is it?

265
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,140
Could it be?

266
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,360
Yeah, it is. It is.

267
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,320
Is that Dave?

268
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,540
It is.

269
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,080
Dave, actually, you're just in time. I finished all my credits.

270
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,080
We're all shouted out. We're used up.

271
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,820
You're all spent now?

272
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,320
And the music in the background is Mayan Ruins.

273
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:20,840
Oh, then no wonder you're becoming more low-key, because you're thinking of those massive monuments to a place gone by.

274
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,800
So it puts you in a kind of frame of mind.

275
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,120
We're like mossy, like a mausoleum.

276
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,260
Yep.

277
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,740
You're dreaming of turtles and jaguars now, hoping you can move.

278
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,140
Actually, I'm dreaming of Aztec mummies fighting robots, but that's another story.

279
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:45,280
But we did. We actually saw the movie The Aztec Mummy Contra Robot Humano.

280
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,720
Well, Aztec Mummy was almost a genre, wasn't it?

281
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,460
Yeah, yeah. And I'd never seen one.

282
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,380
Thanks to our friend Mr. Sistar. There's another shout-out.

283
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:55,700
Yeah.

284
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,040
And Dr. Dark, we did get to see.

285
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,020
We did get to see that the other night.

286
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,760
We're movie aficionados, you know.

287
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:09,060
Yes, yes. You're followers of what is called brain rot, only it's not together as one word.

288
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:19,340
It is together as one word, but that's a phrase that was used for useless hours of watching psychotronic movies.

289
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,360
Hollowheads.

290
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,840
Hollowheads, indeed.

291
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,040
That was one that you turned us on to, and another subgenius recently stumbled upon that movie.

292
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,240
And was marveling at the fact that, where's this been all my life?

293
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,480
How come us subgeniuses never heard of this?

294
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,880
The Hollowheads. Because it's about us.

295
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,020
It's kind of a very kitschy munchausen, you know?

296
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:53,260
A more recent movie that all the subgeniuses have started to catch on is fun for us is The Men Who Stare at Goats.

297
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,780
Which is a true...

298
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,240
Based on the true story of the first...

299
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:05,640
First Earth Battalion, which was a very strange U.S. military group that was like a cross between...

300
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:12,720
It was when the military decided, okay, the Russians have psychic warfare, so we better catch up.

301
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:20,920
And they started funding remote viewing and so forth, and it all became very, very, very new agey.

302
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,760
And the movie, The Men Who Stare at Goats, is high-larious.

303
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,180
Especially if you tend to...

304
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,860
Be a bit of a kook watcher.

305
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:38,160
Yes. I understand completely because I was only aware of a few as a generic, you know, speaking of genres,

306
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,120
a kind of, you know, activities and so forth, which are very few right now.

307
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:51,100
And then, all of a sudden, as if by a stroke of Bob's slack coming down into my forehead somehow and stuff,

308
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,420
yeah, there were about 4,000 there with every unimaginable names in one of them.

309
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,180
Which men who stare at...

310
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:58,600
Goats.

311
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,960
And I thought it was, you know, it had something to do with dairy again, once again.

312
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,140
No, it's men...

313
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,140
They do have keats.

314
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,660
Well, tell me about it.

315
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,600
Well, yeah, I'll tell you about it. You've got a reputation, but...

316
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,580
I know why a goat.

317
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,020
I've been wondering about zygote...

318
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,900
Zy-a-goat.

319
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,160
What about goat zygotes?

320
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,720
Those are for implantation and not to be discussed on the air.

321
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,560
Speaking of money...

322
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,160
My brother sent me...

323
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,180
Who has a goat ranch.

324
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,100
Sent me a photo of a baby, a runt goat.

325
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,640
It was a goat that did...

326
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,680
It was such a runt, it didn't know how to suck.

327
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:41,820
And he nursed it with a Bob pipe on a t-shirt.

328
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,800
It was like a Bob on a t-shirt.

329
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:52,400
And the baby was able to suck the milk of Bob out of the graphic rendering of a Bob pipe on a t-shirt.

330
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,180
Now, a person can't do that because a person knows better.

331
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,920
But a goat runt...

332
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,560
Doesn't know any better, and that's why it can do magic, like Bob.

333
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,440
Same as Bob.

334
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,000
But robot beasts can understand the meaning of wheels on titties.

335
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,960
See, if you're like a child or a goat, you can do...

336
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,840
Or an idiot who doesn't know any better, you can do magic.

337
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,520
Right.

338
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,900
As long as you don't know any better.

339
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,480
If you're a kid, it works.

340
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,380
I've seen them blow up balloons with their flatulence.

341
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:28,000
I've seen them play those little horns, bicycle horns in, you know, one after the...

342
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,380
Tune ones and stuff to make a song at good old country fairs

343
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,440
and at other places where there's oddball sideshow stuff.

344
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,520
That kind of thing used to be special, and now it's like every YouTube.

345
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,220
Is of a goat doing something odd.

346
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:42,860
Yeah.

347
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,700
Well, we are entering a panic phase,

348
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:53,260
and the horned hoof one may be trying to make himself present or film noir or something like that.

349
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,080
Oh, yeah. There's your pan, panty, pan-like stuff.

350
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,960
Who was Frenzoid?

351
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,060
Or something to do with frenetic sciences?

352
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,700
Frenzoid?

353
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,440
I don't know, but you remember our frequent caller Bernard

354
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:19,580
that I sometimes betray by playing his messages that he leaves on my machine?

355
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,220
The latest series of 20 messages from Bernard were kind of sad.

356
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,640
He's being evicted.

357
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,520
His house is foreclosed on.

358
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,180
The conspiracy union has decided to get him.

359
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,860
Poor guy.

360
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,740
Yeah, he says it's just not fair.

361
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,060
It really is no fair. Poor guy.

362
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,120
Poor Bernard.

363
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:39,920
Oh, Bernard.

364
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,580
But he has admonished you at times in ways that have made you nervous.

365
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,800
Well, not me.

366
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,700
It was the things that he planned to do to the others, you know,

367
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,460
which he thought somebody should do to the others.

368
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,800
I don't think he actually plans to do much of anything,

369
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,940
but leave a lot of fun messages until my machine fills up.

370
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,560
Sometimes they scream in horror.

371
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,440
I mean, not the guys, the machines.

372
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,760
Sometimes they break down and make weird noises.

373
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,580
Yeah, I have to use a really old answering machine that, again, doesn't know any better.

374
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:22,000
It's not one of these smart machines where it can decide whether you want to hear the message or not.

375
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,100
Yeah, you need one that comes up with different comments to keep these people amused

376
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,780
and then continue.

377
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:26,780


378
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:26,780


379
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,180
Yeah, you confuse them so they don't call back.

380
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,140
That's the kind of smartness you need.

381
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,520
All right.

382
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,540
Confusing them doesn't stop them from calling back.

383
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,260
They think that's what subgenius is all about.

384
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:36,740
Yeah.

385
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,460
Some of them.

386
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,260
Yeah.

387
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,180
The button has the, yeah.

388
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,280
They only see the surface confusion.

389
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,160
They don't see the underlying rigid structure.

390
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,520
Well, in their brains, many of them, their brains have become calcified on the outside,

391
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,920
and you must scrape the material off and re-hydratify the material.

392
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,300
With the use of abstract qualities and quantities,

393
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,720
things that you may even dream up from space.

394
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,280
You can scrape it or you can crack it and peel this coating off.

395
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:13,040
Some, some, the cortical material can be actually pulled off like an old rubber shoe.

396
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,420
Yes.

397
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,000
Skull barnacles, they're called.

398
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,380
Yes.

399
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,060
The scraping the skull barnacles.

400
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,520
It's much easier said than done.

401
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,960
It actually hurts and requires very...

402
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,980
Well made tools.

403
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,840
Well, what's your...

404
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:36,200
Very, very sharp plow-like devices to scrape the barnacles off the subgenius skulls.

405
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,800
But if you've got the trepanation hole, then you're all set, right?

406
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,040
We see here some of them go back to the Pleistocene age.

407
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:49,240
This tool here appears to be merely a piece of marble which has been schmoozed down

408
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,540
so that it can actually remove the brain barnacles more vigorously and leave behind some callous...

409
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,120
But...

410
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,400
If only there was a...

411
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,400
If only there was a pill for that, but...

412
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,840
You'd have to give the pill to the barnacles and that's the whole problem is prying them open to...

413
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,180
Get the pill in.

414
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,080
Yeah, to get the pill in.

415
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:17,220
But if you're going to do that, you might as well just pry it off of the skull of the listener.

416
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,660
And that's what we're trying to do with this show tonight.

417
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,260
Exactly.

418
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,160
Barnacles off the skull of the listener.

419
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,720
Or put some new ones on.

420
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,620
Well, that's the thing.

421
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,960
I mean, they grow back as soon as one's out of the way.

422
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,500
Absolutely.

423
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,620
Like healthy cells would do.

424
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:38,740
If only the coral reefs of our planet were in as good shape as the barnacles on the humans' heads.

425
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,560
Yes.

426
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:44,640
I read the most distressing news about the ocean dying.

427
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,360
You know, it's awful when you turn on your news website and it says ocean dying.

428
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:49,800
Yeah.

429
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,980
19% of the coral reefs over the whole world are gone.

430
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,600
50% of the ones in the Caribbean are gone.

431
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:03,360
And they figure it'll only be about 100 years to total collapse of the marine ecosystem.

432
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:09,660
But as one of the peanut gallery commentators said, well, I don't like seafood anyway.

433
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,200
God.

434
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,440
That's not true, though.

435
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,140
That's a falsie.

436
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,920
That's a falsie right there.

437
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,680
Because now if you watch commercials on television that used to proclaim,

438
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,120
mmm, North Atlantic whitefish.

439
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,600
North Atlantic flounder.

440
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,800
And now they say North Pacific.

441
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,480
Should have known something was up then.

442
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,040
Because of the dead zone in the Atlantic Ocean.

443
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,060
Which soon will be the Atlantic Ocean.

444
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:39,640
Yeah.

445
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,360
The dead zone.

446
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,020
Well, there's only one ocean, so I guess it'll all be a...

447
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,360
Well, actually, I was listening to the new Jimi Hendrix album, Dave.

448
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:56,340
And Jimi Hendrix made a prediction in 1969 that all three of the lost continents,

449
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,400
would rise again in the Atlantic.

450
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,540
And the East Coast would have new neighbors.

451
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,120
If only my phallus would engorge itself.

452
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:10,020
As I say, this is on a new album by a guy who's been dead for 30, 40 years.

453
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:10,460
How old?

454
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,340
No, not 40.

455
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,380
I think it's about as long as we've been dead, Stank.

456
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,520
Since like 72 or something.

457
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,240
I died the day Hendrix died.

458
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,560
Was it September 13th, 1974?

459
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,080
Did I just flip that out of my Jedi head?

460
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,120
You just flipped it.

461
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,060
I don't know.

462
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,800
I could be wrong.

463
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,680
I could be wrong.

464
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,500
But, no, it couldn't have been 1974.

465
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,940
It would have had to have been 1970.

466
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,140
What am I talking about?

467
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,800
Yeah, Hendrix died in September 13th, 1970.

468
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,220
70.

469
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,380
I almost got kicked out of school for playing his Star Spangled Banner

470
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,140
during the high school football game.

471
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,540
They said, don't ever let him up in that cronist again.

472
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,400
I never knew that.

473
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,880
That's a lovely little thing to make me, I don't know,

474
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,420
not sick.

475
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,020
But, yeah, I'm glad I heard that.

476
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,200
I knew you were one of the people that used to sneak up

477
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,240
and put in funny movies when they were getting ready

478
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,820
to project the most current video they wanted you to see

479
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,460
about safe sex or not strangling the person in the seat

480
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,420
next to you and stuff.

481
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,140
Right.

482
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,860
And I'd slip in Debbie Does Dallas or Deep Throat.

483
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,700
Those were the only two known porno movies back then.

484
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,040
Yeah.

485
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,640
And they're somewhere they're still being shown.

486
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,540
Yeah.

487
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,980
Dave, I have a confession.

488
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,540
I don't know if I told you, but lately I've been indulging

489
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:40,960
in a really bad habit that I thought I'd kind of left behind

490
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,100
years ago in the 90s.

491
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,780
The revivifying mummies, right?

492
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,120
No, no, no, no.

493
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,820
If only.

494
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,980
No, I've been reading, not just reading the news,

495
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,020
but reading.

496
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,020
Reading the comments from the other readers out there

497
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,720
on the Internet.

498
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,680
See, you look my way for doing that.

499
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,680
Right.

500
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,360
Well, yeah, that one time I came to your house,

501
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,720
it was like, oh, my God, he's got Rush Limbaugh

502
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,100
hollering in the background.

503
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,260
And I know you're just like spying,

504
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,340
but still it's you're exposing yourself to this anxiety

505
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,680
producing stuff all the time.

506
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,760
And so anyway,

507
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,440
I've started I don't do it with the TV or the radio,

508
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,840
but it's like I'll read these news stories.

509
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,520
And then I keep scrolling down and read the comments

510
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,260
from the teabaggers who lightly are disgusted

511
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,800
with the president for being alive,

512
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,260
supporting the troops.

513
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,200
Actually, they're they're absolutely disgusted

514
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,640
with that Muslim communist African.

515
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,640
For supporting the troops.

516
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,200
He actually went to Afghanistan and said,

517
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,620
you boys doing a good job.

518
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,380
Yes, we can.

519
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,080
And boy, that just took.

520
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,920
At least, you know, at least he didn't say mission accomplished

521
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,380
and force a bunch of guys to do an incredibly dangerous landing

522
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,880
on an aircraft carrier with him on board.

523
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,440
He just slipped in and slipped out, apparently.

524
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,020
Over Afghanistan today.

525
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,760
Yes.

526
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,220
Yes.

527
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,640
Yes.

528
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:21,900
Today.

529
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,640
Yeah.

530
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,000
I.

531
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,600
I.

532
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,820
In Cleveland time, in live Cleveland time,

533
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,820
that's not the same as some of our listeners here.

534
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,300
Well, so then you're saying Barack was not in town

535
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,060
to turn off his lights for International Earth Hour.

536
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,100
Right.

537
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,560
That was another thing.

538
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,220
Oh, my God.

539
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,380
The comments on that.

540
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,320
He was hanging out in Afghanistan, you know,

541
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,940
eating pilafy stuff and like, hey, man, you know,

542
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,600
like everything is real cool and fine.

543
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,480
And I was like,

544
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,080
Florida or something.

545
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,840
I got to the end of this sad little Earth Hour article,

546
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,580
and it was followed by a thousand rednecks going,

547
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,740
I've turned on every light in my house and all my yard lights

548
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,460
just because of that.

549
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,320
Because the global warming is a lie!

550
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,160
And the funny thing is, I know that...

551
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,360
You told me not to when Rush Limbaugh was on.

552
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,140
I'm swearing and going, you idiot.

553
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,020
Right, right.

554
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,180
And allowing it.

555
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:28,840
And then there were people who mocked that the actual science is coming out,

556
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,780
that there might not be any bees anymore,

557
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,240
and it might be like Einstein said, because this is even worse this year.

558
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,960
And you should just see what bees...

559
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,620
I'm allergic to them. Screw them.

560
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,720
Right, right. I don't like seafood anyway.

561
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,580
Yeah, yeah. Exactly.

562
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,780
What do I need the ocean for?

563
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,340
Well, it is pretty depressing, I guess,

564
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,800
with those currents that have been around for thousands of years.

565
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,060
That's the thing. Right.

566
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,920
Well...

567
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,960
Well, it's...

568
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,960
And it has happened before,

569
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,740
that when, oddly enough,

570
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,240
the North American continent is in a situation

571
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
where when the equator heats up,

572
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,960
this part gets much colder

573
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,460
and actually has spent most of its time

574
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,880
under vast ice sheets in the last 100,000 years.

575
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,080
You know...

576
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,600
But...

577
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,480
See, here we're doing it to ourselves now,

578
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,900
increasing the anguish,

579
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,160
increasing the anxiety.

580
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,200
Did you know about the grasshopper plague in the Midwest?

581
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,340
Um, it was one of the many plagues I heard of.

582
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:34,680
Well, we get them, you know, you get them every few cycles anyway,

583
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,340
but there's a real bad one happening now.

584
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,140
And the one comment that I thought was good was somebody said,

585
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,980
well, people need to learn how to enjoy chocolate-covered locusts.

586
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,740
Mm-hmm.

587
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,640
Learn from our southern neighbors.

588
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:49,600
Yeah.

589
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,420
And it actually kind of... I got to thinking about it.

590
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:57,220
Well, probably be salty, crunchy, fried locust.

591
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,980
They are telling us how to eat grubs, I've noticed, on the Internet.

592
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,780
There's more recipes going around for eating grubs.

593
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,840
Bob predicted this.

594
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,520
Bob said it years ago.

595
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,040
You'll all be eating roach crap by the year 2000.

596
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,020
And he said that in 1950.

597
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,680
It's as if he had a mystic third swami eye

598
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,100
right in the middle of his foreskin.

599
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,320
He can see not only in the future, but into the past year,

600
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,720
and it just doesn't matter anyway.

601
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,600
Yeah, he has a magic urinal that he can see through that hole,

602
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,520
that third eye in his skin there.

603
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,480
No, I want to talk about urinal cases.

604
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,920
Magic urinal on the wall.

605
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,800
And stuff, and...

606
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,000
Urinal, urinal on the wall.

607
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,400
Did you see Scrotie McBoogerball?

608
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,720
That was a recent South Park episode that...

609
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,480
Princess, we and I don't usually keep up.

610
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,480
We usually see those about a year later.

611
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,700
But this is...

612
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,820
This time we caught a fairly recent one.

613
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,560
And I must say it was pretty much the greatest achievement

614
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,480
in motion pictures to this date that I'm aware of.

615
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,280
I...

616
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,000
It was like a capsule history of the Church of the Subgenius, actually.

617
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,440
The Scrotie McBoogerball's episode of South Park.

618
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,300
I've often asked Philo if he was as jealous of those guys as I am,

619
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,740
and he said,

620
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,600
I feel that they're living my life for me.

621
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,400
It sounds like infantilism to me.

622
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,780
Well, I said it was like...

623
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:27,280
It was the capsule history of the early Church of the Subgenius.

624
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,560
From its infancy to its senility.

625
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,680
It's one of those you'd have to have seen it.

626
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,400
I know some people who are not...

627
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Who don't enjoy the South Park cartoons.

628
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,820
I can't imagine that.

629
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,040
They say, well, it's so juvenile and stupid.

630
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,220
Well, it's like...

631
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,800
Yeah, it is little stick figure kids.

632
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:49,960
Um...

633
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,180
But...

634
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,300
Check out those mats, though.

635
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,820
I mean, you know, talk about depth and warmth and so forth.

636
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,900
And movement, of course, too.

637
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,780
No, I'm sorry.

638
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,600
Mats?

639
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,460
I didn't mean to rub them in.

640
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,420
Completely confused.

641
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
But that's all right.

642
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,560
We joked at one time about, well, you know,

643
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,060
things aren't the way they used to be.

644
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,600
But only a scant 20 years ago now, is it 1990?

645
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,680
When the boys went in there and it was kind of a joke

646
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,000
using stick figures and flat mats and, you know,

647
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,780
like stop action stuff.

648
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,720
And now it's...

649
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,360
Never mind.

650
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,080
Yeah, it's...

651
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,800
Well, it's...

652
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,080
You know, the funny thing is, for a long time,

653
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,840
I thought those really were little cutouts

654
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,940
being animated on an animation stand.

655
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,000
But only the very first pilot was done that way.

656
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,340
They were done in a computer,

657
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,580
probably some glass.

658
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,280
And they were done in a glorified version of Flash animation,

659
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,620
which you and I should learn, but we didn't.

660
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:57,560
I thought it was direct subliminal messages

661
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,800
from the goat man himself,

662
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,600
from the Yedzini of the desert.

663
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:07,460
Well, that's the part that's in between the flicker, see,

664
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,140
of the motion picture.

665
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,100
And they can get more into a video now

666
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,320
than they used to in a movie.

667
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,380
In movies, you only had 24 frames a second.

668
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,840
Yeah.

669
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,420
Well, that was 24...

670
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,800
Actually, the screen is dark longer

671
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,900
than the light is flashed on there.

672
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,720
So there was a certain...

673
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,780
A lot of blackness you could use in there.

674
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,140
Now, with video, it's 30 frames a second.

675
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,500
And you actually have an even longer period

676
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,000
to put your subliminals...

677
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,120
Or more...

678
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,540
You have 30 potential subliminal frames per second

679
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,280
to sneak your stuff in under the flicker.

680
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,360
Now, did you ever stop at the end

681
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,520
to think that perhaps unseen

682
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,980
or basically overly seen forces

683
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,740
were using their knowledge of technology

684
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,200
to get a little bit on the strong side

685
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,320
of selling you something?

686
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,480
Well, I've been reading a wonderful 1991 novel

687
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,120
about that very thing.

688
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,020
Oh, no.

689
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,900
And the novel is called Flicker

690
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,240
by Theodore Roszak.

691
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,480
And several subgeniuses said,

692
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,940
well, yeah, I've read that.

693
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,200
Like, I was supposed to know about this, but...

694
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,880
Well, I wrote one like it, too.

695
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,960
Well, Dave, don't worry.

696
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,920
It's not anything like yours.

697
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,600
In fact, it's pretty old school.

698
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,860
But it is funny.

699
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,620
It's kind of...

700
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,780
It's like yours in that it's sort of funny,

701
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,540
but it doesn't...

702
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,380
It's not futuristic.

703
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,560
It's pastistic.

704
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:36,960
It's...

705
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,760
The premise is guys working in German...

706
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,120
Old German silent films,

707
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,060
expressionistic films back then,

708
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
had a secret technology

709
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
that had actually existed

710
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,480
since the days of the Crusades

711
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,060
and involving kinescopes and stuff

712
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,200
that had been suppressed

713
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,760
because the dart between the light flickers

714
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,740
let the evilness in.

715
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,260
Well, it lets things in.

716
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,160
Yeah, it let things in.

717
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,460
And that's why the world's all gone to hell today.

718
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,340
It's because all these kids

719
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,720
are watching all these movies and TV,

720
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,780
and it melts their minds.

721
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,360
Ours included, of course.

722
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,000
Now, this book, Flickr, by Theodore Roszak,

723
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,480
once again, it's great.

724
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,680
This is not...

725
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,340
I'm not saying you have to run out and buy it.

726
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,540
I'm just saying my friend Reverend Sody

727
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,580
sent me a copy.

728
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,920
He sort of assumed that I already knew about it,

729
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,540
but I'm not always that up on things,

730
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,640
and I'm thankful.

731
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,720
I haven't finished the book yet,

732
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,720
but it's great because it keeps mentioning...

733
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,840
in old film history stuff,

734
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,420
like Erich von Stroheim and Greed and so forth,

735
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,820
and we just happened to have watched

736
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,860
the four-hour reconstruction

737
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,480
of Erich von Stroheim's Greed the other night.

738
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,360
It's great, by the way.

739
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,020
It's really fun.

740
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,020
Which one was Stroheim?

741
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,240
Stroheim was actually in some of his films, wasn't he?

742
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,940
Yeah, well, he came to the U.S. to be a director,

743
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,660
but he kind of blew it

744
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,840
when he made Greed nine hours long

745
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,080
and spent two years and almost a million dollars on it.

746
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,460
And in 1924, that was...

747
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:15,660
Oh, my God.

748
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,080
He was a regular Kevin...

749
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,340
It was a regular Waterworld.

750
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,260
And it's a shame.

751
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,400
They threw away most of what he shot.

752
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,400
That's the real crime.

753
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,840
Oh, in my book today,

754
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,260
they found a lost reel of it.

755
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,520
Wow!

756
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,180
In my fictional book.

757
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,700
In the book.

758
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,780
In the book, yeah.

759
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,640
In this old cameraman's closet,

760
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,160
they found one lost reel of Greed.

761
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,620
But the other reels

762
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,340
had all been burned up in the guy's funeral

763
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,620
because he was a nasty old bastard.

764
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,360
But anyway, yes,

765
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,260
we've been kind of immersed

766
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,700
in old-timey film history

767
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,640
and old-timey movies, too.

768
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,000
We've been watching a lot of old stuff.

769
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,780
Such things remind me of Aristotle

770
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,120
because taking communications courses

771
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,200
has reminded me that these arcane secrets,

772
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,320
these secret secrets,

773
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,200
have been known for many, many years.

774
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,280
And I just had to take me

775
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,640
a little old quiz on Aristotle.

776
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,520
And I guess I've known a lot of this stuff

777
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,760
for 3,000 years.

778
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,000
Well, like I say,

779
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,860
they've been suppressing motion pictures

780
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,100
for that long.

781
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,100
The technology was available.

782
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:30,900
They just...

783
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,480
The people in power knew

784
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,700
that it would destroy humanity.

785
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,560
All of society.

786
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:38,820
Forever.

787
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,580
The genie got out of the bottle.

788
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,320
When various people started

789
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,940
whipping out projectors and cameras

790
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,900
and so forth.

791
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,000
And now, look,

792
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,760
everybody's tied to the internet.

793
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,580
Their little heads stuck...

794
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,220
Actually, you know,

795
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,340
you tend to think that,

796
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,260
but that's not true.

797
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,360
Not really.

798
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,080
Not really.

799
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,580
You know, I don't...

800
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,300
I work on computers all the time,

801
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,140
but I don't actually spend all my time

802
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,000
soaking up media.

803
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,280
Uncontrolled.

804
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,500
You know,

805
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,100
exposure to...

806
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,520
Give me a break.

807
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,280
All you have to do...

808
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,380
There is an off switch.

809
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,340
I like to remind people.

810
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,600
Now, not for this show.

811
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,260
Present Company excluded.

812
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,140
There is no...

813
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,560
When the hour of slack is on,

814
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,520
forget the off switch.

815
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,320
It doesn't even exist.

816
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,720
It doesn't exist anyway

817
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,000
because...

818
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,920
Every other show...

819
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,760
Not Radio Synesthesia

820
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,780
follows this one in Cleveland here.

821
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,800
But for every other show,

822
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,780
there's an off switch.

823
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,660
And you should think about using it.

824
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,860
That includes YouTube.

825
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,880
And all those other things.

826
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,060
Well, with our knowledge,

827
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,060
our knowledge of these secrets and stuff,

828
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,440
we made sure that even if they turn off the switch,

829
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,400
they're still going to be continuing to get subliminal...

830
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,540
for a good long time,

831
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,240
for at least two and a half weeks

832
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,600
after the initial span.

833
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,860
So, we can thank our lucky stars,

834
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,040
if such things exist,

835
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,720
that we have these gifts at our disposal

836
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,620
and we're willing to use them on people.

837
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,660
We don't care if it makes them cry

838
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,780
like a rhesus monkey

839
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,140
or, you know, like,

840
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:16,420
rip off the electrodes of their brain headwear and stuff.

841
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,600
We don't care.

842
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,160
Because we don't have a real heart,

843
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,240
a human heart.

844
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,260
Well, I'm speaking maybe in the plural sense.

845
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,040
I have a few.

846
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,880
No, I mean, we...

847
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,580
Never mind.

848
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,920
Well, these rich guys

849
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,320
don't have any more heart than you do.

850
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,220
And yet they give money away

851
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,380
and people say they've got a great heart.

852
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,200
And they give them a name.

853
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,560
The name, philanthropist.

854
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,160
Well, everybody knows...

855
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,760
They have no more heart than you do.

856
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,840
Well, they just masturbate too much.

857
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,440
That's why I was...

858
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,420
Philanthropist?

859
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,900
No, that's a philatelist, right?

860
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,180
Or...

861
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,220
No, it's a stamp collector.

862
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:47,720
Right.

863
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,940
A philatelist.

864
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,120
That's what I was thinking.

865
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,120
A person who is...

866
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,520
Well, you know, better get...

867
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,040
The economy's getting worse,

868
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,200
so stay in practice.

869
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,180
Yep.

870
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,460
Make sure you're ready

871
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,780
with the prettiest barrel on your street corner.

872
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,800
Think of yourself

873
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,900
as a techno-selective vacuum cleaner of information.

874
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,940
Whatever you see happening,

875
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:10,760
make sure you're ready

876
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,040
and make sure that you remember it somehow

877
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,460
and then try and figure out a way

878
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,760
of making some money on it.

879
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,400
Hey, oh, here's a good time

880
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,840
to change the music and...

881
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,420
do a plug for our...

882
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,360
You know our friends, the Amino Acids?

883
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,040
That strange rock band from out of space?

884
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,680
Who has white stuff on their head?

885
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,240
Yeah.

886
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,520
And looks like a little small pillow cover or something?

887
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,020
Right, well, except for the females.

888
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,200
The Amino Acids are the opposite color scheme.

889
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,200
But, you know, the groupie,

890
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,360
the main manager and groupie for that band,

891
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,180
Reverend Angry Larry,

892
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,160
did you know he has a TV show in Detroit now?

893
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,300
A horror comedy...

894
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,280
Actually, it's a zombie sitcom

895
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,740
called The Dead Dave Show.

896
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,020
Deaddave.com or deaddaveshow.com.

897
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,860
Only dead is spelled without an A.

898
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,140
It's D-E-D.

899
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,600
Now, that's...

900
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,160
D-E-D.

901
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,360
It's the zombie dead Dave show.

902
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,600
It is a true sitcom.

903
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,420
They've done like five episodes of it now.

904
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,680
It plays on an NBC affiliate in Detroit.

905
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,600
And Dave is dead.

906
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,680
Well, all the Daves are dead.

907
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,400
The Daves of our lives.

908
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,060
Now, aren't some of those available on the Internet?

909
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:28,880
Yes.

910
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,700
Though their Christmas show is amazing.

911
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,760
In fact, they had to...

912
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,320
It got censored a bit.

913
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:36,720
And...

914
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,220
Well, that is a plus for any show trying to get off the ground

915
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:40,740
is to be...

916
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,220
to have some...

917
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,980
gets left with a censorship thing immediately.

918
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:44,760
I'm just saying,

919
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,140
if you're gonna be soaking up conspiracy media on your Internet,

920
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,920
you might as well get some subgenius media

921
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,880
and check out The Dead Dave Show.

922
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,620
Theaminoacids.com or deaddaveshow.com or something...

923
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,660
You just...

924
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,440
You know, all you gotta do is what they call Google it.

925
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:05,920
Gargle it.

926
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,560
Gargle it.

927
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:06,900
Yeah.

928
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,380
Just...

929
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:08,900
Grr-gout.

930
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,940
Well, I've heard that they're actually using, for props and stuff,

931
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,400
they're using real live, sub-sentient beings.

932
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,060
What do they call those kind of creatures that...

933
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:20,620
Pinks.

934
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,160
Humans.

935
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,720
No, no, no, no.

936
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,360
You know, like what the Army secret guys would call them, you know?

937
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:25,820
Normals.

938
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:26,660
Normals?

939
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:27,540
Mediocratons.

940
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:28,980
Mediocratons.

941
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:29,220
Yeah.

942
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:35,260
As for gene splicing and for, you know, shows about livers and spleens and stuff,

943
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,220
they actually use their...

944
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,580
The bank they have, so to speak.

945
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,740
What's on hand, so to speak.

946
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:50,860
Oh, there's a new comedy movie out, Repo Men, about that old gag.

947
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,420
Which is a take-off on Repo Man?

948
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,840
No, that was...

949
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,360
It's separate.

950
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,420
Although, I hear that Alex Cox...

951
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:58,440
What's the name?

952
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,000
They're so similar.

953
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:04,220
Alex Cox, who directed Repo Man, has done a movie or a play or something called Repo Girl.

954
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,380
Huh.

955
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,420
I think, yeah.

956
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,840
Maybe I'm scrambled.

957
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,480
That sounds like great manga.

958
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,200
She's wearing, you know, cool stuff, you know?

959
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,840
That would be good manga.

960
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,980
Repo Girl.

961
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,740
Well, now, here's an...

962
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:26,360
While we're on the subject of mind-rotting media, did you know that you can now download

963
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:32,540
almost every old hour of Slack in MP3?

964
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,940
I'll be stumped.

965
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,540
I mean...

966
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,180
Or I shouldn't be.

967
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,740
I was all...

968
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:44,180
I had them going back to, oh, number 900 or so on subgenius.com.

969
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:51,480
But, our friend, Reverend David Bochner, who used to play it on a defunct Canadian station,

970
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,380
has been...

971
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:58,300
I sent him audio cassettes of the show from number 300 to...

972
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,840
Well, up until the 2000s.

973
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,260
And he has put them all on MP3.

974
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:10,620
And if one were to go to subgenius.com and click on the radio button, you'll be looking

975
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,520
at the hour of Slack page and look for the only bits of color.

976
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:19,680
Most of the front pages of my website is in black and white, like Bob's face.

977
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:20,760
And...

978
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,960
But we use...

979
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,780
Where you'll see a little spot of red that says, new.

980
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,420
And that's where you find the old stuff, the really, really old stuff, under the bright

981
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,800
red, new button.

982
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,280
That's actually true.

983
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,440
And he has almost finished converting all of them.

984
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:45,720
And it's very strange to hear, you know, you clickety-click-click, and suddenly there's

985
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,460
old Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

986
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,700
Only it's young Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

987
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,660
The baby Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

988
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,000
And baby Chaz.

989
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,300
And even baby Psychopath Finder.

990
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,860
I just heard something on Wikipedia.

991
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,400
I was just...

992
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:04,460
I was just going to try and be creative for a second, then I forgot, because I just remembered

993
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:04,920
something.

994
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:05,980
That'll do.

995
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,520
I found on Wikipedia that Chaz left his native New England in 1975 to go to the California

996
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,360
Institute of Art, which is not correct.

997
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,560
Everything else seemed to be pretty correct.

998
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,140
But I just wondered where they got that.

999
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,240
Well, you know, you can go in and correct it.

1000
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:29,640
You sign up and give Wikipedia your name and your email, and you can go in there and fix

1001
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:29,900
that.

1002
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:40,080
I believe that a question is, I'm Chaz servant, and I believe that you were always definitely

1003
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,080


1004
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,660
Things, Life, Study, or so.

1005
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,280
But there were other examples.

1006
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,740
Yeah, at one point when I was reaching out to some friends and my blog was on Google,

1007
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:51,220
they were saying, I downed1 테 głllo STEAHL U Scale of Dawn, 2016.

1008
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:51,780
And I just thought, well, I don't know about the type of math kid I'm guessing.

1009
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,040
If I don't know the value of this common language, like math should be careful.

1010
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,400
But I just thought, I don't know how it surprised me.

1011
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:53,840
I think that there was the idea that they're all going to go buy out books for free.

1012
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,100
Yeah.

1013
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,860
Have to pick up some books.

1014
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:57,000
Yep.

1015
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,940
All right.

1016
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,100
But I don't think I've been deceived.

1017
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,000
the wrong way.

1018
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,280
Or rich. That's another one I read about.

1019
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,160
I'm very rich and I'm dead.

1020
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,140
Shooting the goats on your island,

1021
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,420
so to speak. Bringing the tie-up

1022
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,940
with the goat-horned one.

1023
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,040
I can't white.

1024
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,180
Well, you're never going to get your own private island

1025
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,880
staying because things just

1026
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,880
aren't that way in the modern

1027
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,720
America. Listen in the background.

1028
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,120
This is the amino acids doing

1029
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,820
a miserloo.

1030
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:27,700
Miserloo.

1031
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,660
They do it in about a minute.

1032
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,040
It feels

1033
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,780
like a mechmeister piece.

1034
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,740
See, I wish I was surfing the cosmic

1035
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,640
waves right now rather than going

1036
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,480
against them. That's

1037
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,220
what I feel like I've been doing lately.

1038
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,660
I feel like I've been not trying to get

1039
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,700
slack, but I've been trying to butt

1040
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,520
my goat head against things

1041
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,560
to make them fall apart so I can

1042
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,340
proceed, which doesn't work, does it?

1043
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:11,680
Well,

1044
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,840
you know, they say

1045
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,420
slack is just

1046
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,400
following the path of least resistance

1047
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,680
and letting things happen. On the other hand,

1048
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,380
Bob's first

1049
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,620
rule of magic is get off

1050
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,860
your behind.

1051
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,220
So stand up and don't do anything,

1052
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,580
so to speak.

1053
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,620
Um, kind of.

1054
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,920
Actually, I think don't follow

1055
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,960
little pigeonholed rules

1056
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,060
in rule books might be one

1057
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,120
answer to that. That would be the

1058
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,180
third rule after the first two that Bob

1059
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,820
gave us, or that would be the fourth one

1060
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,720
after the...

1061
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,180
The very last rule says do not follow

1062
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,860
any of the preceding rules.

1063
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,060
That's the most important

1064
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,180
rule, but they don't get to that one until the end.

1065
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,160
Of course, after you've already done everything

1066
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:55,580
else.

1067
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,480
There's like an

1068
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,320
at the end of the rules, it says

1069
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,260
now, if you want to know the antidote

1070
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,980
to having followed the rules, send

1071
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,020
$30 to blah, blah, blah.

1072
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,260
That'll work.

1073
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,260
If only you did, you know.

1074
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,640
I mean, as far as you're concerned.

1075
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,480
Oh, my neck.

1076
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,560
It only hurts

1077
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,280
when he laughs.

1078
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,580
I'm in a little embryonic ball right now

1079
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,440
trying to get some

1080
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,260
messages from deep space or

1081
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,320
somewhere, perhaps from

1082
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:30,880
the floor.

1083
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,000
I hope they're not pushing in soon.

1084
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,500
Lonesome cowboy Dave needs a job.

1085
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,020
I need soup.

1086
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,340
He needs a soup line

1087
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,520
or a job or a gun.

1088
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,100
So if you've got a gun or a job

1089
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,740
for Dave... No, don't send me a gun.

1090
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,820
That would be dangerous.

1091
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:50,040
Send him to me, and I'll decide

1092
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,760
whether it's worthy

1093
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,040
of whether Dave can handle it.

1094
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,060
But...

1095
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,140
Yeah. If anybody out there is

1096
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,320
feeling unusually rich or generous

1097
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,120
or foolish,

1098
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,580
I think you probably know what to do

1099
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,780
through the

1100
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,100
contact section of

1101
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,840
subgenius.com. Or

1102
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,980
if you want to do that video

1103
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,000
for Joe Newman's Rudy Schwartz

1104
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,040
project song, Kill for God, or need

1105
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,860
anything else, you can email me

1106
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,480
stang at

1107
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,820
subgenius.com.

1108
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,960
Subgenius does not have

1109
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,760
an O in it, although

1110
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,760
dot does and com does.

1111
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,140
But you don't write the dot.

1112
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,280
I used to wonder if that was an actual word.

1113
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,140
Dot com. There is a dot

1114
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,560
com dot com. No, Rudy.

1115
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:36,960
Oh, Rudy.

1116
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,060
I mean, I thought it was someone...

1117
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,840
Rudy Cheeks. Yeah, someone

1118
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,080
blaspheming their derriere. The Ruddy Schwartz

1119
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,340
project. Yeah.

1120
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,260
Or the rowdy, ruddy,

1121
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,000
rowdy, rowdy Schwartz project.

1122
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,260
Well, our time is coming

1123
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,860
up to an end.

1124
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,940
I have... There were a couple of things

1125
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,980
I wanted to run a little

1126
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:58,960
bit of PR news.

1127
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,820
A collage by

1128
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,280
Mr. Rection

1129
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,960
and a song by

1130
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,700
Reverend Bozo Wolf. So I'm going to

1131
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,700
say goodnight to everyone now

1132
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,180
and let those things happen.

1133
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,880
Let them happen, man.

1134
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,020
That's slack. And we will

1135
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,000
actually have got

1136
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,060
to work here at the station for another hour after that.

1137
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,080
But that's me on the...

1138
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:22,920
So,

1139
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,240
Dave, thank you.

1140
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,580
And Princess Wee,

1141
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:28,260
thank you.

1142
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:29,940
Of course.

1143
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,760
And, uh...

1144
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,360
Yes.

1145
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,740
From PR News in Washington, I'm flying to

1146
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,660
St. Louis with the body of a dog.

1147
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,020
An idea both Democrats and Republicans

1148
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:43,860
support. On Wall Street,

1149
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,300
510-569-18-2359.

1150
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,800
The White House says this is PR News.

1151
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,960
Indonesia has identified

1152
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,960
the body of a man with the body

1153
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,120
of a dog. He was killed in a police

1154
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,520
raid yesterday outside

1155
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,160
PR News from Washington.

1156
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:01,820
Well, well,

1157
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:02,640
come on, Big Daddy.

1158
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,460
Give us the word.

1159
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,200
The pit.

1160
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,580
Bring me my pendulum,

1161
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,840
kiddies. I feel like swinging.

1162
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,780
That'll a monkey nuts.

1163
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,160
You're insane.

1164
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:33,820
You and your

1165
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,980
trained exploding shark.

1166
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:37,480
Modernization

1167
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
isn't everything.

1168
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,540
The poor and the underclass

1169
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,880
are growing. Racial justice

1170
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,300
and human rights are

1171
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,680
non-existent. They have

1172
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,800
created a repressive society

1173
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,600
and we are their

1174
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,040
unwitting accomplices.

1175
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,940
Anyway, what difference does it make?

1176
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:57,500
What choice do you make?

1177
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:57,920
What choice do you have?

1178
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,800
The world needs a wake-up call.

1179
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:05,860
We're gonna pour it in.

1180
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,800
You are fools.

1181
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,460
Jesus! Where do you think

1182
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,960
the world's gonna get on board,

1183
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,440
hold hands and sing Kumbaya?

1184
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,280
Sit down and buckle up.

1185
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,760
Time is running out

1186
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,200
for the planet Earth.

1187
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,120
Time is running out

1188
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,480
for the planet Earth.

1189
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,440
64 years into the terrifying future.

1190
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,460
Deadly germs are creeping over the Earth,

1191
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,120
killing every human in their path.

1192
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:52,740
...

1193
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:52,740


1194
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:56,660
...

1195
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,580
...

1196
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,600
...

1197
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,100
Time is running out

1198
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,440
for the planet Earth.

1199
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,420
64 years into the terrifying future.

1200
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,260
Deadly germs are creeping over the Earth,

1201
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,880
killing every human in their path.

1202
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,060
...

1203
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,960
64 years into the terrifying future.

1204
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:26,720
...

1205
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,200
Never have you known such cringing terror.

1206
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,900
Radio activities are a constant thing.

1207
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:38,440
Radio activities, radio activities, radio, radio, radio, radio activities are a constant thing.

1208
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:47,640
Deadly germs are creeping over the earth, killing every human in their path.

1209
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,560
Never have you known such cringing terror.

1210
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,460
Never, never, never, never.

1211
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,900
Time is running out.

1212
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,880
Radio activities are a constant thing.

1213
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,420
Radio activities, radio activities, radio, radio, radio, radio activities are a constant thing.

1214
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:19,680
Deadly germs are creeping over the earth, killing every human in their path.

1215
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,920
Never have you known such cringing terror.

1216
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:32,180


1217
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,120
Deadly germs are creeping over the earth, killing every human in their path.

1218
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:33,160


1219
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:38,760
We have seen illusion and reality begin to overlap and fuse.

1220
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,880
A line between them begins to disappear.

1221
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:52,660
Sucking the hallucinatory acid into the system, man turns animal for the erotic pleasures of women and men.

1222
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,880
Floating higher and higher.

1223
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,040
A wonderful feeling.

1224
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,540
Tingling with excitement.

1225
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,120
Trembling with horror.

1226
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,500
And throbbing with emotion.

1227
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,740
Time is running out for the planet Earth.

1228
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,000
He's a genius.

1229
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,060
Power and swag.

1230
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,560
Power and swag.

1231
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,780
Power and swag.

1232
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,300
Swag.

1233
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,740
The genius.

1234
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,260
Power and swag.

1235
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,180
Swag.
