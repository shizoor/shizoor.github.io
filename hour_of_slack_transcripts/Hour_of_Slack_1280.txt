Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the subgenius of Slug.
Funny?
Well, I don't mean funny exactly.
It's kind of hard to explain.
I see.
Sometimes I feel real good.
And then other times, I feel like I was going to get sick right in my stomach.
Well, that doesn't take much doing.
Hello?
The room is probably bugged. Keep talking.
Yes.
I don't have to tell you how important this assignment is.
Yes, just a second, please.
It's for you.
Long distance.
I think it's Bob.
The future of the world may well be in your hands.
Yes, right.
Leave them.
Let them make their futile plans.
Would you put them on, please?
We will deal with them at our leisure.
Hello? Yes, this is Linda.
Would you put them on, please?
Hello, Bob! How are you?

This is a genius radio ministry.
He's a magnificent actor, but his comedy sensibilities were very different than what I had written with Bob.
And he just said, I don't think we're getting the laughs that I was hoping we would get.
And I looked at Bob and I realized that he was absolutely correct.
And I said, Bob, what do you want to do?
So I had to make this horrific decision, which was very heartbreaking for everybody.
But luckily, I was able to convince the studio to let me reshoot Bob.
Hi, it's me.
And I'm a being of pure light.

If you see him you go
blind, if you don't you lose
your mind, and
rip your eyes out so you
cannot see
I was feeling
down and rejected
and everyday
felt more like a curse
Then I thought about
the horror that seems beneath
the waters and remembered
it could get much worse
Oh what a friend
we have in Cthulhu
He cares about
us all equally
If you see him
you go blind, if you don't you
lose your mind, and rip your
eyes out so you cannot see
So just how
big a friend is Cthulhu
He's unlike
any friend you've ever known
Though he's bigger
than a house, he's as quiet
as a mouse, and he comes to
rip the flesh right from your bones
Oh what a friend
we have in Cthulhu
He cares about
us all equally
If you see him
you go blind, if you don't you
lose your mind, and rip your
eyes out so you cannot see
Now deep within
this house at Remedia
Dead Cthulhu dreams
while waiting for the hour of the moon

Dead Cthulhu dreams while waiting for the hour of the moon
When he rises from the bride
and returns to crush your spies
As he shambles forth to show the world his power
Now people, everybody testify before Cthulhu
I just broke up with my chicken slimeball husband
and I'm waiting for Cthulhu to come back
and fix him and his lousy no-good
Well actually I didn't use to be able to walk
you know, but now I can uh
Yeah
He'll fix all of your problems in a heartbeat
Even if your life's a total mess
Both your mortgage and divorce
will be washed away of course
with whatever you stole
the IRS
So if you can, make friends with Cthulhu
He's the antithesis of all lies
If you hear him you go deaf
Rack it before you lose your breath
And cut your ears off with a carbate knife
Oh what a friend we have in Cthulhu
He cares about us all he believes
If you see him you're gonna fly
If you don't you'll lose your mind
And gouge your eyes out so you cannot tear your eyes out so you cannot rip your eyes out so you cannot see

The bubble bucket has carried Alice, Bob, and Stan across the Rainbow Bridge and down the mountainside to the sleepy town of Smyrna today aroused by the Depot Days Festival

What else would I need to say?
From PR News.
In Washington, I'm plotting strikes on vulnerable targets.
But U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff went up 4.3% in August.
But that's still 20% below still limping along.
10, 15%, 90%.
The government reports half a percent in August in the past four months.
Yet no one is going to plunk down huge sums of cash if they're worried about PR News in Washington.

Dear Mr. President, I want you to know I am deeper than you.
Listen and learn, my heart is a chapel, my head is a steeple,
my arms are the people, and the people now yearn.
I stand for the midget, I stand for the negro,
I stand for the engine, all hopped up on booze,
I stand for the Jap, and I stand for the beaner,
I stand, yes I do, for the Christ-killing Jew.
And I stand for the dyke, and I stand for the retard,
I stand for the Chinaman, washing my socks,
I stand for the...
I stand for the bum, and the pimp, and the bugger,
and the cripple that lives on my street in the box.
To conclude, Mr. President, I'm not at all hesitant
to tell you I think the first ladies of Fox,
her husband, the jerk-off,
has ruined my country.
That's all for today.
Sincerely, D. Cox.
