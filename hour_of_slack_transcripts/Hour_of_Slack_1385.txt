From PR News in Washington, I'm an international hacker.
In other news, South Carolina officials have announced that 3.6 million people up and down the East Coast are now in Connecticut.
Mangled trees are slowly coming back on Connecticut's roadways after the governor lay at the side of the roads, a sign of powerful PR news in Connecticut.
Many live wires stay off the roads.
Also, New York Stock Exchange closed for a second straight day because of PR news.
Delaware appears to have escaped the worst.
Despite the widespread damage, Governor Jack Markell says 30 people in Delaware remain without PR news compared to neighboring states.
The Associated Press is now reporting 39 people are now believed to be without PR news in Washington.
It's not too late.
You.
You can back out, tune out, drop out, and turn off.
Or you can stay listening for the Hour of Slack.
I got to thinking about something.
Yes, dear?
A new and wondrous thing.
The finest dignity and elegance.
What is it?
The subgenius.
The power of Slack.
What a wonderful idea.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Uh.
Uh, Bob.
Oh, yes.
Right.
Still so dark because it's still so early and the chipper little girlie at the front desk
doesn't mind at all.
These phony living rooms and fake plants are killing me.
This bad coffee's filling me with equal parts joy and rage.
Put my makeup on and crack in half.
I choke back a laugh.
Find the camera with the red light.
Good morning Tucson.
The lights come on and so I smile wide and say, good morning Tucson.
I throw to you before I throw the rest away.
When I was coming up I got the doughnuts which means I got the doughnuts that I wanted.
There was no young punk, there was no young punk, there was no young punk, there was no

young punk, there was no youngs.
I burst out to the confederacy.


When I know you'll talk to me better than all my friends.
And I hear people say can't you just go see if the gun is real?
And I get theirわかり as if we thought we were men.
For that they put me down since the first time, I think it's there's not a place in it

I chin up and say get awry.
I'm writing something but I'm really far away, really far away. I keep my smile warm in case they turn the camera on cause now I have something to say, I have something to say.
The camera's melting but I just keep going, it's been a pleasure knowing you, I wish you all the best of luck.
When the prompter dies I'm comfortable winging it, I'm practically singing it, the song that tears the world apart.
Through the smoke beyond my part.
I see my giant face on the billboard by the highway.
Good morning Tucson, the lights come on and so I smile wide and say good morning Tucson.
I throw to you before I throw the rest away.
From PR News in Washington, I'm George McGovern today in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
President Obama today said he is a Republican.
Mr. Obama said he is outside of a metal fabrication plant.
The president also said he is coming in from the West.
President Obama was pleased to have picked up the crucial contracts to buy Vice President Joe Biden.
Mitt Romney's been big all day.
He repeatedly said he wants big status quo.
And at his second rally outside of Columbus he continued traveling with the Romney campaign.
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says PR News was over before he and his top commanders knew what had happened.
Secretary Panetta told reporters,
What's going on?
Panetta said he and senior officers decided they did not want to put PR News at risk.
Ford Motor Company thinks it knows how to lose more money now in order to lose more money later.
Ford now says it will lose a billion and a half dollars in Europe this year and that much next year too.
But Bob says PR News will carry it through.
PR News in Washington.
The promise of US ذ

And, uh, that's so now we're moving onward
I, it, it, you know, it's, uh, it's something to, uh, to be thought about

I hope there aren't, in fact, any good-looking boys in the audience,
because something about this outfit just...
I think he was wearing a Pope outfit.
Friends, subgeniuses, countrymen...
Oh, no, I'm going to move this thing around.
All right, here we go.
Throughout the course of this phenomenon that many refer to as life,
most of the people you encounter will be trying to sell you something.
They'll try and sell you goods or services.
They'll try and sell you on ideas.
Drab men in drab suits will come to your door
and sell you fear in the form of life insurance.
Armed thugs will sell you protection in the guise of uniformed public servants.
The television will sell you inadequacy
and the police will sell you a gun.

They'll sell you ads and their sitcoms
where everyone is happier because they drink coke
or they have improbable sex lives
or wear all the best clothes.
Priests or monks or imams or whatever
will sell you guilt you don't need for things you haven't done
and then, miraculously,
the forgiveness or absolution or inner peace
that services as the brief salve for the mental illness
that they have inflicted upon you.
Our society first creates a need in our lives,
either real,
or imagined,
and then sells us a vanishingly temporary stopgap
so that we spend most of the short time we are allowed on this earth
trying to pour an empty bucket of useless shit
into a leaking tub of our existence.
I'm trying to sell you something right now.
Indeed, the same thing J.R. Bob Dobbs
has been trying to sell us since 1953.
And that is an empty box.
Some of you may be snickering out there now
thinking to yourselves,
yeah, Bob is always screwing us over
or something similar.
But if so, then you have greatly misunderstood
the nature, the purpose, and the promise of this organization.
When you go to the store and buy something
or order it off the internet,
whenever you buy a box that is supposed to be full of something,
the very best thing that can happen to you
is when you open that box
with your new blender in it
or your morning cornflakes or whatever,
the best thing that can happen is that you get exactly
what you were expecting.
It could be worse.
The blender could be broken or just a piece of crap
where the cereal could be covered with ants.
But even under the very best of circumstances,
you will be getting exactly what you wanted.
This is what is slowly killing you inside.
After the fleeting rush of exerting your will on the universe
by spending money, thereby validating your miserable job,
wears off, you are left with some unimaginative, unsurprising,

pile of protons, neutrons, and electrons
that, if you're lucky, works exactly like it was supposed to.
This is nowhere near as much fun as what you can do with an empty box.
With an empty box, every day is fucking Christmas.
Slap a little colored paper on there, leave it in the corner for a week,
and then open it one day with your eyes closed.
Suddenly, with only the power of your imagination,
the box has magically been filled with friendly chinchillas and oral sex
and a bottle of vodka.
That's right. Those little bastards are fuzzy.
When you join this church,
you receive just enough nifty shit to satisfy your consumer instinct,
a membership card identifying you to your fellows,
and then something I don't think a lot of us give a lot of time to thinking about.
You received an empty vessel,
the precise size and shape of deep and abiding faith,
but almost completely devoid of solid substance.
The little chinchillas are the only ones who can get it.
The little dogma we have is mutable, contradictory, and blatantly, admittedly ridiculous.
You can watch in awe as it crowds out your previous chauvinisms,
stereotypes, faiths, and iconographies,
and instead of a typical religious conversion,
which would merely substitute one set of mental shackles for another,
leaves an empty, comforting space in their wake.
Afterwards, if you're a true subgenius,
you will never take another holiday,
religious ceremony, or political speech seriously again.
Once you get the joke,
part of you will never, ever stop laughing.
When J.R. Bob Dobbs brainwashes you,
your mind stays clean!
Or at least, you know, converts it into something like a dry erase board,
with only a small permanent Dobbs head imprinted unobtrusively in the corner.
Bob has sold you something you have been giving away to the conspiracy your whole life,
something you didn't even know you were entirely missing.
Your own minds.
Folded, pressed, cleaned of pink claptrap and conspiracy mind control devices
with instructions for further care and maintenance.
Whether or not you stay with Bob's church for just a few years,
the rest of your life,
or whether you give him and the rest of us up in the morning,
and having had your fill,
you will never have to give your mind back to the conspiracy again.
Never again will you entirely swallow the conspiracy's bullshit pills,
because Bob has showed you how to tongue and cheek them
when they check to see if you swallowed.
Never again will your lips have to touch conspiracy ass,
as Bob has showed you how to get just close enough so that they'd think
that you have their submission.
Praise Bob.
Never again will the drama in your life seem like anything more than just that,
a badly scripted play acted out by a bunch of clutter-brained zombie monkeys.
And never again will you buy anything without secretly hoping
that when you open up that box, it is empty.
I'd like to finish with a small quote from a man who does a lovely little comic strip.
I don't know how to pronounce his name.
I think it's Andrew Hussier or something.
It's spelled Hussie.
So maybe I'll just call him Andrew Hussie.
But it seemed particularly poignant when he wrote it.
And the rest of his shit is very silly. It was very strange.
The upper echelons of irony should always include measures of sincerity.
And if the satirical practice is executed faithfully,
it will achieve something bona fide in its own right regardless.
Through an intense commitment bordering on religious devotion
to the absolutely inane, absurd, or plain fucking stupid,
a very different kind of sincerity begins to materialize.
One of reverence to the ridiculous.
You will begin to mean it.
But what that exactly means is never quite what appears on the surface,
and is utterly unacceptable to obtuse and illiteral minds.
That you mean it then becomes inseparable from the joke,
and additional rick strata of humor may be stripped aggressively
from this irreconcilable truth.
Amen.
It is now time to rock and roll.
Yes, friends, and it's a new day and a new dawn in America,
because Bronco Bomney has been elected.
And that was Janice Blackseed at 50 Next Day live.
The song Empty Chair and All the Stupid People
both were done by Reverend Phineas Narco
of NationalCynical.com.
He has a regular show that he podcasts.
It's sort of live on Sunday nights right after the hour of slack.
How about that?
On NationalCynical.com.
And before, oh, this other song, Good Morning Tucson,
is by Jonathan Coulton,
who, by the way, is not a reverend in the subgenius church.
We just like his stuff.
The collages, PR news, and so forth,
were by Fernanda Nandilemer,
and the mini-rants were by G. Gordon Gord.
And...
I'm tired of Bronco Bomney already.
Hey!
Friends, this is one of those time control shows
where we're live in the studio
after the election here on November 4th,
which, oddly enough, is also Halloween in Cleveland.
Back then, back on November 4th.
Halloween here was preempted by the real thing.
Yes, the real thing.
Hurricane Katrina...
Sandy, one of those.
Uh, horrible things.
And instead, they had Trick or Treat here
on Sunday night, November 4th.
Hence, we sit and wait for Dave
to join us in commentary
on America's new fate
here in post-election
United States of the Americas.
As that Nazi said in that movie,
uh, Iron Sky,
we saw a great movie over at Mr. Sister's house
called Iron Sky.
It's about Nazi, secret Nazi bases on the moon
surviving into President Sarah Palin's administration
in 2012 or something.
And, uh, and speaking of things, perhaps,
could it be...
Could it be...
Oh, it is!
Oh, it's our Dave!
It's our Dave!
It's Monarchus Fadunderboyd,
new ex-president of the United Snakes of America.
Oh, you're so beautiful.
Recently elected and recently reflected.
We welcome you, Bronco...bomby.
Hi.
Oh, wait, you're not Bronco Bomby,
you're Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
You're trying to...
I'm tired of Bronco Bomby!
I'm tired of...
Leave Bronco Bomby alone!
Of course I have been for quite some time now.
Keep your hands off my meme!
Dave, I'm worried now that Bronco Bomby is president.
I guess we're all gonna be...
We're all gonna be thralls under the communist
Wee Party regime.
I'm gonna quote that little Halloween child tonight
and say, I'm not afraid of Mitt Romney.
I'm gonna carry around my...
I'm gonna carry around my little red book
with the quotations of Chairman Barranque.
Chairman Barranque.
And I'll wait eagerly for a cultural revolution.
People with accordions in the streets singing strange songs,
beating up old schoolmasters and peeing on their feet.
Yes, it's our new...
It's a new destiny for our great land.
Or it's the same old destiny.
A manifest destiny.
Same old.
As seen here written on the ship's manifest.
Everyone's on board together.
Bored as hell.
With endless television commercials and...
Row.
People showing up at the door.
Row.
Buy.
Buy.
Keep those slaves rowing and buying.
Well thanks to President Rheumatoid,
the United States has returned as...
Excuse me, the United States is and is,
an it.
Not a bunch of its together, although it is.
Thanks to stakes and snates rights.
It happens.
And their existential right to be, if it were.
The corporate snakes, the corporate states of America,
have regained control of the left field.
Yes, and we're all being shipped off to concentration camps.
They have one concentration camp for the libtards
and one for the rich.
And one for the repugnatans.
And another one for the undecided.
I'm going to Chomsky Island.
It's on the Gulag there.
It's where progressive libertarians come to have tea and be beaten.
Chomsky Island.
Oh, that's the pea party we've been hearing so much about.
I want to go to Chomsky Island too.
No, you have to stay here and run the wee party.
Aww.
And I will play this wee game.
A great wee game.
It's small but great.
Man.
Man.
Thanks to the national space and snakes.
Once again, the snakes all come together, don't they?
In a little pile near the rocks, don't they?
Await us.
They come together like rat tails do in a rat king,
where their tails are all tangled up by some carnival,
some carny who's showing off a...
A carnival.
A rat king for 50 cents a view.
That's the Americas of today.
Yes.
You know what a rat king is?
Everyone is Winston Smith and full of ratophobia.
What's...
Now, everybody's either Winston Smith or John Galt.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
John Galt.
Who is that John Galt?
Liberty.
Where is that Joe Buck?
Never heard of him.
Who is that Joe Buck?
Now I see him doing a mashup of Midnight Cowboy and Atlas Got Bored
and Shrugged It All Off.
I see Adam Smith in a pair of panty, ladies' old-fashioned pantyhose.
Oh, mmm, I can see his invisible hand.
And I see Karl Marx playing with his chest hair as they both dance the escadrille.
And Charlie Chaplin bouncing a big balloon globe of the world.
As the little dictator.
The big...
Well, the big one is yet to come, I guess.
What's the difference between Castro and a jockey strap?
I can't tell you on the radio.
But you can hear it on Rudy Ray Moore's classic album, The Return of Dolomite.
It...
It really?
Yeah.
It chafes...
It chafed his underwear?
Yeah.
Well, I can't give the punchline.
Because it would...
It would...
It uses the word dick in an inappropriate way.
Oh!
I hear those...
The lead tarts are coming.
You hear them in the background?
Yeah, I can hear them.
Oh, man.
It makes me nervous.
They're hurting my speech and so forth.
I really have a hard time when they...
Well, first the flashing lights and then, you know, turn around, turn around, turn around.
I turn around, they first skew, they play with your hair, and then later...
Oh, no!
Now it's the puka tarts!
Oh!
It's a Republican monster!
Yeah, the tamp is bad enough.
No, it's the communists!
Oh, it's the communists.
Oh, it's the communists.
Oh, it's the communists.
Yes, it's the communists.
The communists are the ones that are the most, you know, um, that's the most important





ask you to turn around and then, uh, stand up and play some dance, dance the loud thing.
Would you please?
Water?
Hello?
Water?
I think Dave's been listening to the, uh, Cleveland Heights police broadcast a
little bit too much.
Oh.
No, I've just had my ear to the pavement, like any astute follower of the fashion of
mankind and their strange bequestances to themselves, you know?
If you really want to know about the election riots, you listen to the police bands.
I've just been listening to the...
We have two friends who do that, Puzzling Evidence and Mr. Sister.
You can also go outside and see which way the red sky is moving.
It's a lot warmer listening to the radio than putting your ear down to the ground.
You don't need a wind man to know which way the wind blows.
Well, you do need a lot of socks and pants because we're camping out again tonight, kids,
after the fifth consecutive hurricane in a row.
Good morning, Tucson.
Wake up from your new hurricane.
The hurricanes have reached all the way to Arizona.
What? Is that?
Is it?
You hear that?
Is that her?
It's him.
It's the brain police coming.
Man, look out.
Oh, man, ever since Bronco Bomby was elected,
I knew the brain police were going to come after us and try to force brains into our skulls.
Oh, no, they're going to turn it.
We wanted to be so geniuses.
There's nothing left up there that I can remember.
I mean, whatever they want me to remember or don't want me to remember.
We don't want to be normal.
We don't want to have brains.
I don't want to know.
Like, there's so much I don't want to know.
Please put your hands on your brain and move towards the window where I can get a better glimpse of the outline of your brain.
Please.
Oh, they're smiling.
The police are really, really rude this year.
I mean, well, since the last time, anybody?
No.
You remember?
Yes.
History repeats itself.
Over and over.
Yep.
Every day, I end up having to go into that little room and let fluids run out of me.
Every day.
Sometimes more than once a day.
I tried to quit.
And now they're going to make us do it.
Now it's compulsory.
It's socialistic, more Muslimic Taliban Nazism.
Not to mention all the gauges that are on every receptacle.
You're not allowed to see what's in your fluids.
That's right.
Yeah, every time.
And then arrest you for whatever's coming out of you.
Instant analysis everywhere you go.
Yep.
They got a video camera and a pee tester outside the toilet and inside the toilet.
And somebody has to sit and watch all those videos from inside the toilet.
Again, the pee party has...
Reared its ugly behind.
Yes, and has regained control of...
The country after four years of the more Muslimic Taliban under...
Who was that previous president?
Oh, Mitt Robomabot.
Yes.
I'm happy that a lot of that social fabric moved its way into my neighborhood.
Because I've got 14 wives right now.
All I got to do is pray five times a day and be uncertain about what certain aspects of my existence really point to.
I mean, the direct...
I mean, well...
I mean, it was hard enough having one wife.
And now every man under Bronco Bomney is going to have to have multiple wives.
As many as you can possibly be expected to afford and fit into your cardboard box.
And that means multiplication two times because the more multiplications that you arrive at,
the more sinister forces disengage.
But that means there's plenty more people.
From one...
Or two particular guys.
It sounds like some sort of oriental mythology or something.
Well, we'll only be overpopulated for a short time longer because...
Thank you, Dobson.
Zeus, too.
Yeah.
The end of the world is a-coming.
Fast and hard.
It's coming yesterday.
November 6th, Election Day.
The day the Earth stood still.
At least...
There will be in all these families with all these many wives and one husband,
at least there will be one chicken in every pot.
And one pair of fuzzy mittens.
And a rat king to boot.
If only...
If only...
And this snake with no eyes.
If only Mitt Robomobot had been elected, there'd be some pot in every pot.
But instead, the fascist communists have taken over.
Well, once you vote for the plutocrat party...
From Utah.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.





It's a really weird statement, and it's a statement that's gonna linger with you for
the rest of your life like that bad tooth in the back of your head.
Oh, don't remind me.
Oh, you need to be reminded, sonny boy.
Now, get back in that booth and make the right choice.
We're recounting today, remember?
It's the third Sunday from last week.
Man, it's getting awful stinky in there.
And that boat...
They won't let me out of this voting booth.
It's been weeks.
There's no place to go.
I mean, you know.
I keep marking the ballot, and it keeps coming up.
Reverend Ivan Spang.
I've got to get out of here.
I'm going stir-crazy.
That's what you call a write-in candidate,
written in by the news media,
who really control all the voting.
They'll never actually...
They don't count anybody's votes.
They just make up these poll numbers,
and then you're polled.
And then they get you write-in.
I keep seeing this commentary.
Nobody ever polled me.
Oh, buddy, you don't know.
You're getting polled every day.
Yep, long and hard.
And don't think the old fixed network,
as they used to call it,
is going to call the election the way they want to
before everybody is cleared out of them election...
I mean, not them election booths.
I mean them exit polls.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, wait, there aren't as many as there were before.
So that will make fixed network
incredibly...
even more free to jump in
and say whoever they want to win
five hours early.
Is that how it works?
Well, that's...
I thought it was the communist MSNBP
that makes the news.
We don't make the news.
We write it.
No, we don't write the news.
We make it.
Something like that.
William S. Burroughs,
author of Tarzan.
Oh, wait.
No, that's the wrong...
That was Fred Burroughs.
You want the one with the apple?
The apple on his wife's head.
Yeah, yeah.
William Tell Burroughs.
You want to talk about naked lunches
and other things
and speak in this tone of voice
that's somewhat monotonous,
but yet the literature is truly there.
It's intact.
You just sit there and read and read.
Take a big bite off of that naked frog
on the end of your fork.
America is a country of fakes.
The buzz!
Who's doing that?
How did that...
They're trying to overpower us again
with that strange noise from out of space.
You know, I don't think it's fair
that Dave gets to have a buzz and we don't.
I didn't move there very much,
so I think something is strange somewhere else.
It's just a conspiracy.
Interference.
We get it.
You know, you'll have that.
Mm-hmm.
Along with all those compulsory babies
you'll have to have now.
Hey, man, why is this buzzing so loud now?
You have to get out.
Rape is compulsory.
Pregnancy is compulsory.
For everybody, man, woman, and child.
Children getting pregnant.
What is this country coming to?
High-tech buzz is...
Children becoming pregnant
before they're even born.
Impregnated within the womb
by the buzz.
By the buzz of the gods of Aldrin.
The Aldrin buzz and the moon Nazis.
Oh, mixed up and mashed together.
It will be under your seat
while you least expect it.
It will be outside of the window,
glimmering in the distance.
It'll be everywhere.
It'll be in your ears, in your head.
I already said head, didn't I?
Did I say head?
It'll be in your, you know...
It'll be everywhere.
Everywhere?

And you just wipe it out?
With a Q-tip?
Mucus.
The kind of mucus this country needs
to blow away some of the incendiary devices
implanted in your head since November 8th and 6th by 4th.
Dial once more and remember...
The buzz is everywhere.
The buzz is everywhere.
And the Robama bots are coming.
And they do.
Whether you're...
Whether you're conservative,
taved,
or liberal,
liberal,
you will cave in.
You will be made into one of us.
Obsolete.
Bob.
Bobsolete.
Ob.
Ob.
Bob.
Abrobomny.
Our new leader.
He's half black, half white, and half robot.
A gigantic 900-foot-tall robot.
A gigantic 900-foot-tall robot.

but sporting a 90-foot pipe
into which he has crammed and lit the souls
of all voters and all undecideds
who are still twiddling their thumbs and flipping coins.
But Washington's head keeps coming up.
They're waiting for Lincoln's head,
but it just keeps being Washington's head.
You know, the Washington coin?
The one-dollar Washington coin?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I like the one with the design of April Knox Tours
in the front in a full buxom position
showing her hog manis,
just as if the bunnies were out in the backyard
waiting for, you know, Christmas or whatever
kind of holiday they're going to have.
Oh, God, Christmas is coming.
Look, it's, look, it's, my God, it's gigantic.
Gigantic.
It's a huge Jesus Santa.
A gigantic Jesus Santa.
Hey, boy, look, he's knocking down Big Ben
and the Tower of London
and now the World Trade Center.
The Empire, he's climbing the Empire State Building.
God, he's got the Virgin Mary in his hand.
He's fighting off, he's beating off the airplanes.
He's beating off the tanks.
He's...
He's...
He's beating off the Empire State Building.
That's insane.
He's beating on the children.
Oh, my God.
He's beating off...
And it's not even Thanksgiving yet.
I've never seen anything like this before in my whole life.
This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my whole life.
Not even Thanksgiving yet.
Halloween is not even over
and already the Santa Jesus trudges through the snow.
The turkeys are frightened
and in the distance,
they look around as if expecting something,
not knowing what.
It is a harsh time of the winter.
Usually, the ground is covered in ice
and a half feet of frozen muck.
Often, the children take their strange religious artifacts
to the center of town
and burn them
and then try to resurrect them with magic power.
It is interesting insight,
but we come back every year to those mountains.
It's...
It's...
Oh, my God, Dave.
Dave.
I just...
The ticker tape is coming in on the radio station news feed.
They've done a recount on the election.
Bronco Bomney's not the president.
It turns out that Mitt Romano bought one after all
and the more Muslim Taliban regime is going to be...
Oh, no.
Well, at least we can blame GD for that.
I guess we better get used to it.
Man, I was just...
I was getting...
I hated...
Bronco Bomney,
and now I have to hate a new Robomobot.
It's one after another.
I'm dizzy.
And they never oil them on their guest appearances
or sometimes when they're in the backyard.
That makes my Gary Johnson...
It makes my Gary Johnson wilt.
It's limp.
It's a limp little soggy Johnson now.
Yeah, a little.
And Jill Frank N. Stein
is still waiting for her vote to be counted.
Do you mean there's only...
It's the Green Party.
She and her husband Frank N.
were running for the Green Party.
Frank N. Jill Stein.
Yeah, they're still running.
They're running now.
They and the Libertarians are running.
Running, my friends.
But escape is impossible
because our cameras are everywhere.
Our pee testers are everywhere.
The Tang Silly Party was hiding somewhere.
Everywhere the guerrillas do their dirty work if they can.
The hunters are coming.
Last week they blew up the bridge to Astabula.
And the other week Chagrin Falls was covered in chicken fur.
It is becoming quite a day-to-day thing.
Many of them live in the mountains wearing cans of pigs and huge cigars
and call themselves Raincoat Philosophers
as they enjoy themselves before they pass the postal.
This is Merrill Priswake with Seizuring News Corporation Incorporated
bringing you all the corporate state news down here
and up here in the United States.
We're in the Sierra Bozoto Mountains
where the forces of Jumbo...
I can't read his name.
Baloney Bobomabot.
Baloney Bobomabot.
Malarkey Bobomany.
I mean, these headphones aren't working.
Am I on right?
Yeah, yeah.
You're on.
Good morning, Tucson.
Good morning, Tucson.
Good morning, Vietnam!
It was a goat, man.
It was a huge goat.
And he said his name was Haramunamanum.
Well, he was the new...
You know, he said he was the guy, you know?
So I had to...
What was I supposed to do?
I believed him, you know?
I didn't know what else to believe.
Hey, man.
I know we're wreaking cop-a-buzz.
All I have to do is turn the background stuff down.
Listen.
Oh, man!
It's a great buzz.
It's enormous.
That's what I was telling everybody,
that...
Yeah, that guy.
That one guy.
The presidential guy.
The guy who's presidential.
Not that other guy.
That white sideburns guy.
The cool-looking corporate state guy,
not the really, like, goofy-looking corporate state guy.
Hey, let me have five seconds of just the buzz.
Okay?
Okay.
Ready?
Okay.
I can use a thing called sound soap,
which will make the buzz lesser,
but...
But our voices will become kind of a soapy, weird sound.
That's why it's called sound soap.
He'll be like Dave's talking to a cup.
It makes me...
Now it makes me weep because it was not there,
and now it is as if to...
Just to torment me.
What, did I get up and start jumping around
and clicking my heels because President Rosenfeld
was connected in a new direction
for his third substantial time?
I mean, come on, man.
Just think about it.
You know everybody's out there.
Get everybody at all times.
I mean, I'm not paranoid.
I wouldn't consider myself actually
a paranoid person, per se.
Hey, I'm paranoid.
Huh.
But, uh...
If they had it their way,
the president of the U.S. would be named Schicklgruber.
Well, it already is.
Eucharist v. Schicklgruber.
Oh, my God, that's right.
It has...
The president of the United States
is named Schicklgruber
and has been since 1945
when they secretly switched...
Earth with Mars
in their orbits around the sun.
I love this theory.
We were born on Mars, friends.
And yet, we were forced to this slave planet, Earth.
Earth Farm One, the space aliens call it.
And here we are trapped.
Trapped in this sinkhole, this gravity well.
Oh, oh, the gravity.
So...
So densely thick.
This air.
Too hard to breathe.
Doesn't everything seem to take longer than it should?
Isn't everything getting a little heavier all the time?
I rest my case!
This is Mars!
Earth was left behind in the distant orbit.
A ruined planet.
Dried out.
All the atmosphere and water drained away
by the conspiracy of the industrialists,
of the more Muslimics,
and the communist we-party of the Taliban Nazis
from the moon!
The moon, I tell you!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
I stand back from that window,
shopping cakes, Mr. Hamstrung.
There's nothing to die about.
Everything's fine here back on planet Earth.
We've taken care of it, don't you see?
We've got our fingers where they should be.
And not just holding back the dykes anymore.
Not until Tuesday. Ha ha ha ha!
That's not where that finger goes now.
No, there's no goat.
There's no goat there.
There's no goat anywhere anymore.
No goat. Just chevron.
You mean, pres red rumma?
Pres red rumma.
He's not, he's not real.
He's a picture.
He's like a three-dimensional, he's a hologram, man.
It's a hologram!
There is a real...
There is a real...
There is a real...
There is a real...

We feel like in a hologram, man.
I don't...
I don't...
Who's, who's, who's missing with my hair?
Ah, can't you tell?
Those are the right electrodes, not the wrong ones.
The kind we need for today's and tomorrow's future as well.
And all of our children.
Don't you think Bill Dinkins knows that?
And as I, Bill Dinkins, ignore this message...
Er, I...
My name is Bob Dobbs, and I ignore this message.
What were you saying, Princess Wade?
I'm just ignoring it as hard as I can.
That's not always easy to do.
I'm not a friend.
Goodbye, Jimmy.
I'm tired of Bronco Bombay!
It's okay, dear.
It'll be over soon.
Oh, they think it will be over soon.
But the fools, the blind fools, how little they know.
For soon, I shall rule the very world!
I shall create a race of supermen!
Ubermenschen!
And, uh, soon, the moon itself will go.
Grovel at my feet!
Merry Christmas, little boys and girls.
Soon you'll be praising Bob night and day.
No more sleep for the bad little girls and boys or the good little girls and boys.
Mm-hmm.
From now on, we'll all be out in the mines, mining coal for our stockings...
Oh!
...and fighting monsters for our dinner.
Ho ho ho ho.
Oh, no!
Oh, look, there's a baby monster.
Completely arranged.
What?
So you can see everything.
That's a baby monster?
If there is none of you, it's so beautiful.
If that's the baby, then, my God, the mother would be over 400 feet tall.
What is that sound?
Wait a minute.
What is it?
That's meters, not feet.
It's three times bigger.
Quick, turn on the oxygen displace-ar.
Wait a minute.
That's the wrong button, you fool.
That was the oxygen overdose button!
Turn it off!
Turn it down!
M-m-m-m-must...
Too much oxygen!
M-m-must...
Reach...
Oxygen switch!
Blacking out!
Getting high!
If only it was this easy!
Bleh!
Bleh!
Bleh!
Bleh!
Let me in!
The buzz!
Stand back!
Hey, the bu-
Stand back!
Is the buzz...
Oh, the buzz is there.
The buzz is never-
Oh, my God, I thought the buzz was gone for a minute there.
I don't know what I would do if I couldn't cop a buzz.
I was gone for a brief moment again, now I don't know.
It's-it's recurrent.
This music I've been playing in-
... the political state of our great land is-
...

Ha ha ha ha ha.
Do you fear the buzziness or do you fear the Romney boy?
I fear nothing.
I'm not afraid of Mitt Romney, as that little girl said.
What was the first little girl?
See, Dave, we had trick-or-treaters tonight, and I wore a rubber Mitt Romney.
I'll go ahead and say the name.
Rubber Mitt Romney mask that Princess Wee bought for the WCSB Masquerade Ball,
which you can see pictures of, including the masks.
If you go to subgenius.com, friends, and this is a good—
Uh-oh, those cat—those me lines are after—they're going to steal our wallets and our show.
If we're not—
Throw some Felvine at them.
They'll grab that instead.
Oh, God.
That's what that smells.
Anyway, we—OK, last week was the WCSB Masquerade Ball.
At the Cleveland Public Theater, and it was a great success, and we took pictures,
and you can see them on subgenius.com, because, friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack
from the Church of the Subgenius, heard in the background, creeping up on us.
And if you go to subgenius.com and click on the Events button—
Yes, Events.
You'll come to a page that—
Right at the top, it has links to the photos of the Masquerade Ball, and you can see some—
It's interesting.
Princess, we and I spent a lot of the time at that party with Mitt Romney, Abraham Lincoln, J.R. Bob Dobbs, and Cthulhu.
Hello.
The monster from the H.P. Lovecraft novels, and you can see—I'm not lying, and you can see the photographic evidence.
Photos can't be—actually, the WCSB—
The WCSB.
The WCSB radio Facebook page has much better pictures than ours.
Dave, I'm going to get rid of the buzz.
It's still there.
Does it mean you're going to dump me, or does it mean you're going to put that special—
I'm going to dump you because I have a song to play.
Don't dump Dave!
I'm going to dump Dave because we have about seven minutes of PR news, G. Gordon Gordon rant, and Devo Dan.
Devo Dan.
Devo Dan is a very—
Devo Dan is a very obscure musical act.
Robin Mountain Boy turned us on to that, and Robin Renee in New York turned us on to Robin Mountain Boy.
But she is, like, obsessed with this weird act called Devo Dan, and we'll be playing that in a minute.
This is the Hour of Slack, broadcasting live from WCSB Studios in Cleveland, Ohio, a swing state.
And, boy, have you ever been to the Ohio Swing?
The Ohio Swingers website?
Mm-hmm.
Anyway, Dave, yeah, we're going to have to dump the buzz and go back to—
Yeah, the buzz is fading now.
I think you're right.
I think it does know what you're doing.
Well, it seemed to pick a peculiar point to suddenly go on again that loud, even.
It's a cognizant buzz.
It was totally—perhaps.
The thing on my forehead is growing again.
No!
Yep.
Well, I'm glad.
It's about to happen.




I'm glad it's not growing on me anymore.
I implanted and re-implanted.
No, actually, we have to go now.
Come on, Rat King.
From PR News in Washington, I'm briefly weakening, which is now projected for early Tuesday.
President Obama and Republican Mitt Romney are urging Westerners to kidnap 12,000 minors in Egypt.
Offering $230 per person as an incentive.
This is PR.
PR News.
Ga-ga-ga.
Major League Baseball's.
World Series.
Are two to nothing in the best of seven series.
Despite his team's lead, his players don't have it wrapped up yet.
We don't.
Believe me.
Midnight.
Midnight.
Ga-ga-ga.
That includes 14, 15, and four for PR News.
Hello, friends.
Dr. Gordon here.
You know, I'm just thinking.
There's a lot of people who could be, like, really cool, but they aren't.
But they should be.
And, you know, I got to thinking about that and worrying about that and wondering why, you know.
And then I realized what it was.
They take themselves seriously.
They think that everything they do is very, very serious.
And that's what's wrong with them.
Because you can't take anything seriously.
I mean, seriously, folks.
How can you be serious about anything?
Life is a short struggle out of one darkness into the other.
It's a one-go-around.
It's all you've got.
The only thing that separates you from the monkeys is slack.
And they've probably got more than you right now.
Because if you take yourself seriously, then everything around you is to be taken seriously.
And that means there's just too much seriosity going around.
Ah, well.
One of these days, people will find out that only Bob can make you realize that it's not
just the under things of life that are important and nothing, dear friends, is to be taken
seriously.
Seriously.
The End.
Thank you for watching.

She sits at the top, the top of the greenest tree
She stands up and I roll my head up
Under my love
It drips on down
And I miss from above
You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
She calls everywhere you turn
Headed for the pleasure bird
So call me a fool
That fool
I'll never be through being cool
Learn to work the minimum
I play just where it fits
Drink scotch whiskey all night long
And eliminate the twits
They got a name for the ninnies in the world
Stuff, stuff on the tip of your tongue
The real thing you do all alone
She's just the girl you want
Girl you want
Now look at you
With your mouth watering
Now look at you
With your mind spinning
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
An afternoon class
I got off my ass
Learn to work the minimum
You call everywhere you turn






Headed for the pleasure bird




And I miss from above


I play just where it fits
Drink scotch whiskey all night long
And eliminate the twits
They got a name for the ninnies in the world
Stuff, stuff on the tip of your tongue
The real thing you do all alone
She's just the girl you want
Girl you want
you are
She sings from somewhere
you can't see
She sits at the top
the top of the greenest tree
She cries undefined love
drips down from a mist above
It's a beautiful world
You know that she's just the girl
I learn to work the minimum
I play just where it fits
Drink scotch whiskey
Oh
all night long
and eliminate the twists
I got an ape on the knees in the world
Stuck, stuck on the tip of her tongue
Why don't you admit it's over?
She's just the girl you want
Oh God, can't sleep

Oh God, can't sleep
She has to work
on the good
aur HERE
So sharp
that there is no more money
we're going to summarize
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,
you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page,
or the catalog store pages, and help out financially as best you can.
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.
But some of you still have jobs.
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.
We also take checks and money orders to subgeniusfoundation.
P.O. Box 181417.
Cleveland, Ohio.
Heights, Ohio.
44118.
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
We'll see you next time.
Bye.
