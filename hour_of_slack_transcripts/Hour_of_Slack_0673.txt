Good evening, and welcome to the radio ministry outreach of Tranquility Base, where we believers
carry the firm conviction that we were placed here to build the rocket ships, the space-faring
pleasure vessels prescribed in Dobsian scripture, to voyage out into the cosmos to venture where
no billion-year-old carbon has ventured before.
Wanna go for a ride?
Earth, we must get on.
Earth.
We must get on.
Earth.
Earth.
We must get on.
They'd say, you know, that crazy neighbor dreamed houses up the street.
We kept talking about this.
That religious nut.
He must have been wild.
Get it and follow it.
Kill, kill, kill zombies.
If you don't like the people or the way that they talk.
If you don't like their manners or the way that they walk.
Kill, kill, kill zombies.
Kill, kill, kill zombies.
If you don't kill them, then the Chinese will.
If you don't want America to play second fiddle.
Kill, kill, kill zombies.
Kill, kill, kill zombies.
If you let them live, they may subvert the Russians.
If you let them live, they might love the Russians.
Kill, kill, kill.
Kill them, kill them, scrape them, gook creeps.
Only gook an American can trust.
Is a gook that's got his yellow head bust.
Kill, kill, kill zombies.
Kill, kill, kill.
Kill, kill, kill zombies.
Kill, kill, kill.
It'll feel so good.
Like my captain said it should.
Kill, kill, kill zombies.
Kill, kill, kill zombies.
Kill, it will give you the mental ease.
Kill, it will give you a big release.
Kill, kill, kill zombies.
Kill, kill, kill zombies.
Kill, kill, kill zombies.
Kill, kill, kill.
Kill, kill, kill.
How would we explain all this to a dispassionate extraterrestrial observer?
What account would we give of our stewardship of the planet Earth?
We have heard the rationales offered by the superpowers.
We know who speaks for the nations.
who speaks for the human species who speaks for earth
but they were laughing at it do you remember the one guy who we were here yeah what you call it a
one-way mirror and he was uh i don't know it was like he was trying to get the people to roll all
of us to roll the one stone back up and down the hill and the one-way mirror we we gave it a name
or something like that yeah that's where all those metaphors started it was the that was when we first
created metaphors don't you remember that yeah archie and the swingers all the old language you
know with the with the cataclysm through sonic and we had to reinvent language of course through
sonic imitation that was hard to make a metaphor when you were trying to say this was like a big
music you know making something you know the metaphors that the dolphins used when they were
trying to teach us didn't make any sense because they were all based on echo's sonic location right
you know what which by then we we were that make probably so far away from
that evolution right they get out of the water and go yeah and we're supposed to you know see a
shark uh you know with this cool little shark movie in our heads it's just you know all we see is this
ugly fish so we should harpoon it drag it out and eat it well it took us a long time to figure that
out didn't it well it didn't really take that long after you've been harpooned and eaten a few times
yes and that is why i don't play my golf masters for having no mercy on us
you
overlord
reincarnated memories
makes fun of him
yeah
overlord
contains all the
typical reincarnation memories each one of you guys have all had since he was a little bit of heart
you didn't even know it see so you're just making fun of him but he carries all the vast memories of everybody in the ocean of his big fat brain
but how do you weird
from
ç
far
sh
is
unspeake
ch
そして
Who speaks further?
We can just kind of walk lackadaisical through life.
Well, I hope I'm going to make it.
You sense an oppression, an evil presence there, don't you?
If there's no meat, no fruit in any of their works.
I have seen works from Vienna to Rome and I look everywhere I look, each opening I go to, it looks like these people have just eaten dirt.
They live on dirt and filth.
They have no real feeling for art.
They eat their own fishes.
They eat their own sweets.
They are running pokies and things.
And it is no importance to their work.
And they are not.
I think if I only look in retrospect at these people, I think I will know them.
Not one of them will survive into the next century.
Help is on the way.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
The Toraleaf and Magnified Mummy's hand, that's a very powerful component.
They used to do that in the Swamp Lands.
Remember when you guys were down in New Orleans and that weird old Greek lady was trying to put a hexagram on you?
Yeah.
And I don't know.
I don't really remember it though.
It was some kind of an abstruse dog figurine or something like that.
They were selling it on the street and they said it was full of cloy leaf and anchovies and different stuff.
And it would make you go sterile and blind and run and bite the bark off the trees and everything.
So that's what happened to me.
I tried some of it.
Yeah.
And that's what happened afterwards.
It's over, I guess.
Well, do you write songs about you?
勝기의 말이
starts all over again every single week the same old week you know i hate that every seven days
man it's terrible every and then it never it never changes i know it ever monday easy wednesday
thursday friday monday jesus ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
and ever and ever and ever it never changes come find me congressman let's get over the game i
wonder what day i'll pass away on you know and all this time they haven't been able to figure
out how to attack until one day they thought of children well that was bright of them and
they thought of how grown-ups are so busy they never look under rose bushes or on lawns oh that's
where drill is now uh under the rose bush uh-huh with all his friends too and there's something
about kids under 11 with imagination it's real funny to hear drill talk well it must be
you better run along out if you want to have your invasion before dark
oh and bath tonight school tomorrow you know drill says i won't have to take any more bath
oh he does does he and we can stay up till 10 o'clock well your friend mr drill would better
mind his p's and q's or i'm gonna call up his mother that's just it drill says you're dangerous
because you don't believe in martians just like you think drill's a kid well he's not and they're
gonna let us run the world when they get in all of us kids and i might even be queen well that's nice
dear now run along beings from another world
is that some kind of a flying machine no no it's parted from the ground by rays probably some form
of magnetic flux like invisible legs this is amazing they take the egg boxes that you in a
common department store any other place you might leave your clothing and stuff and they just plaster
it up on the walls and there you got yourself in a synchronized compartment you know the world is
changing so fast that the only way you can get out of it is by putting it in a box and you can't get
out of the box and you can't get out of it so you have to put it in a box and you can't get out of it

predict things is with retroactive prophecy but if you can get the top of your head up outside that
20 mile zone above the steroid you can look down where there ain't no time seat and you can check
out the different compartments the lonesome cowboy dave the human periscope well that's what i do
imagine you with your head neck stretched out like that and your head swiveling and wobbling
wobbling
why
all right not listening i wanna tell you one more thing before you pass out
stop listening to the radio stop drinking nyquil by the courts stop drinking whole bottles of vo
Supreme and listening to the radio and complaining about what you don't understand, okay?
Can I say it right?
Try to communicate with them first and shoot later if you have to.
Shut off the pump and let that poor thing in there die.
You have gone over the line.
This is too far.
This is too far and you are not really dealing with this.
That's why you're calling because you know you're in trouble.
Man, they're predicting a lot of stuff.
The seven seals will be broken.
The eighth seal will bark and juggle.
That's always...
They taught how to juggle, you know, balance the ball on top of its nose.
Yes, and when it drops the ball, that's when all the computers will crash.
When the seal drops the ball from its nose.
And when all the computers crash, that's really it.
That's the end of everything.
Oh, yeah.
I mean, we can't exist.
I mean, everyone's heart will stop.
Flowers will go to sleep.
The cows will run away.
January 9th will become another ska-punk holiday.
It just will go wacky for some reason.
All food will disappear because it's made by computing.
I'm opening a canvas and twine store to take advantage of the rush that will be going on.
Yeah, I need to stockpile some torches.
You should be building ships willy-nilly.
Light might break.
Right, canvas, torches, twine.
Yeah, is the sun liable under the Y2K?
You know it might go out.
Yeah, the sun might go out.
Yeah.
It's conceivable.
It is, well, it's rather inconceivable, really.
Might have to reboot the sun.
Yeah, because...
It's going to think the sun will think it's 1900.
That's right.
And it'll say, all those passenger pigeons are blotting me out.
I'll have to go out.
Yeah.
Actually, they're going to solve this whole problem.
The next year after this will be year 1999.1.
I think it would be really cool if...
99A, I think they were going to run an adherence.
At the stroke of midnight, all of a sudden, everything,
everyone, everything is transported back to the year 1900.
Yeah.
Well, it's just this endless cycle.
I think they rightfully should be because we really never learned anything.
Until they fix the problem.
We can import, you know, thousands of slaves from China.
It'll be great.
Yeah.
We can build our own railroad and our own train.
Yeah.
And as fast as we want.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we'll come up with a radio.
Or somebody come up with a radio.
No, we gotta have a telegraph first.
Yeah, just say all the radios will be gone.
Instant.
Instant radio.
We'll be back to horse and buggies.
And, uh...
We'll brush on blankets for smokes and telegraph.
Hey, don't file hey.
You need to feed those horses something.
And then we'll have to have a lot of sacrifices.
It didn't work out last time.
I think it's not enough bloodletting.
I think we need to take a few more.
How important were the computers to the telegraph system at the turn of the century?
Well, I know the Vikings needed them real bad.
Yeah.
They couldn't get anywhere without them computers and MOLOTs.
Like, it doesn't...
You know those wires they stretched all over the country?
You had a chip on it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, sometimes they had those curly fries.
What if the Y2K problem is retroactive and the shock wave goes back in time?
Wow.
It's destroying all computers in the past as well.
So that means we'll have to go back even...
Wipes out all...
We'll all be in America that has never been discovered by Columbus.
And instantly...
Because we don't have a computer to make his math.
Yeah, it instantly wipes out all artificial intelligence in the universe.
All he does is work on canned computers andutes like a Pastel, and then he cuts out all the underground movimento to get software that gets players running a illustrate data daddy.
And that proves how important płp is.
But the only way we can teensys Mr. developer could be if we just left the game in the first place.

picture-في...
andougin...
If you gave up all your powers asanga hid the game, then Lord will have to kill you.

will be blasted amidst all of our ancestors, so all of them will have this vague memory
of a strange time when everyone had magical machines that did everything for them, but
it will all end in 1999. And then they'll all live forward and eventually produce us,
and in us, the memory will be concentrated, the terrible thing will happen in 1999, and
then it will happen again, and our conscience will be blasted back to 1900 again.
Again, it'll just be an endless loop.
Endless loop, yeah.
That's an ill prescription for mankind to constantly keep taking really short of themselves.
Now, maybe we can, this time around, maybe we can plant something that will clue us in as we're living our lives, you know, as kids and stuff like that.
We won't know it's coming, but maybe we can leave something behind that will send us a message to start working on...
We need an artifact that's completely computer untouched, so it won't be destroyed.
Right.
And we need to immediately impregnate the first person we see in that world, so that our seed, like a tiny little oak, can grow out of them and impregnate the rest of the seeds of mankind's depleted accordion.
Maybe we could just bring along business cards instead.
Or sub-accordion.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a different pitch place that you're going to go in there.
We want to get people to dance into the new century.
Right?
Or just kill themselves again, or what?
I think they should dance until they die.
All time ends, as far as I know, from listening to, like, a lot of radio.
Talk radio and stuff.
Whatever you are doing at the moment of the turnover, you will do for all eternity.
That's right.
You're frozen in that one moment.
So, obviously, you should be having sex.
Kind of like X-Day.
Yeah.
Kind of like at 7 a.m.
So, if you can just reach orgasm at midnight...
You'll be scrubbing it forever?
That's right.
Well, that's...
What about Pat Boone?
Is that guy going to be on a heavy metal stage saying the world's going to end in six minutes
for the rest of time?
He's going to be singing a heavy...
For all of eternity.
Pat Boone singing a heavy metal version of We Are the World.
Forever.
With Metallica, you know, special guest.
The real despotically bone-chilling Christian undertones there, just kind of like putting
you in the mausoleum in the Inquisition at the same time you're getting rocked out.
Yeah.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.








You'll be eternally reaching for that terrible itch and you'll never be able to scratch it.
You'll just be spinning around forever and ever reaching.
Reaching for that spot in your back you can't quite reach.
Yeah.
But you'll be eternally ungrateful.
Forever and ever.
If you got it.
Yeah.
Well, at each moment, I suppose there'd be a plethora of delights that would last or
kill you forever.
Maybe we should just start killing all the computers now.
We'll become...
We'll get used to it.
If you can't...
If you can't fix the problem in a year, I'm sure...
I'm sure we could kill every computer within a year.
How about we all become Buddhists?
Nah.
Nah, there'd be a few computers left over.
It's kind of like, you know, the...
Someone would hide there.
Yeah.
They'd have to underground shelter with the rank of batteries.
We gotta kill...
It'd be like the killer, you know, that movie Killer Bees, you know?
Don't you think...
That one bee left up on the seat at the top of the...
Bill Gates.
Superdome.
Superdome.
Superdome.
Superdome.
Superdome.

Superdome.
Superdome.
Superdome.
Vampires.

Vampires.
Rhino.


Heil.
Haier.

Hell.
As if.

What's going on.
I hope you find it nice.

I don't like dancing, but it's just pure fucking hell.




Uh...
Uh...
What do you even want?
Who's more spiritual?
Who's more spiritual?
Who's more spiritual?
The man who put the thousand dollars in.
Slavery.
Slavery.
Slavery.
Slavery.
For you, that was a sacrifice.
Slavery.
Slavery.
Slavery.
Slavery.
It doesn't matter the amount, my friends.
Slavery.
Slavery.
Slavery.
Slavery.
Slavery.
What matters, as it says, you give generously and with a cheerful heart.
Slavery.
Slavery.
Slavery.
Slavery.
You are excited about the fact that God has given you something that you can give away.
Slavery.
Slavery.
To see the work of God.
Slavery.
Slavery.
Slavery.
It takes money for that to happen.
Slavery.
Slavery.

Slavery.
Slavery.
Put a little bit of money in the stock market.
Add a little bit of money in gold.
Add a little bit of money in real estate.
And be sure to buy those beanie babies and those sports cars,
because we know that's what the kingdom of God needs.
Slavery.
Slavery.
Slavery.
You know, if it weren't for the spirit of God, I'd buy a handgun.
Kill somebody.
Yeah.
Slavery.
Slavery.
Slavery.
As soon as everything's cool, then I'm on board.
Well, nothing's going to be cool until you're on board.
And then you're going to ruin it.
Well, yeah, then we got you, and you're dead weight.
We're going to drag you down the road.

you around. I've got a Bible question though for you. Oh, that'll be easy. I'm very smart.
I'm wondering if you could answer it. It was, um, you know, the miracle of Jesus trying to
wander. Well, there's this, uh, modern day scholar who was saying that, that you couldn't
actually turn it into wine at that point in time in the new Testament had to be, maybe it was a
California cooler or a microwave, but not wine. If you understand the Lord, our God and his power,
his power, he can turn it into anything he wants. It doesn't have to be just wine. It doesn't have
to be a week of wine. It could have been a moonshine. It could have been ice water. It could
have been a slurpee. It could have been a smoothie or a frappy. What is a frappy dog? What is a
frappy dog? What is a frappy dog? I think you need to study a little bit more. What a blessing it is
to, uh, to give.
There was something spiritual in there that even though we didn't have anything, we still had
something. When you are a slave to God, you are in bondage to it and it will control you and
manipulate you and rule you. But when you offer yourself as a slave to God,
slavery,
that if you want to be free,
you must become a slave.
slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money.
So you get an extra job to ease the pressure.
slavery, money, slavery, money,
This is the way God works, folks.
slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money.
One of the best things that could happen to a church is for people to show up on a Sunday
one door, one morning, and the doors to be locked.
slavery, money, slavery, money,
Well, God, make me a cheerful giver, will you please?
I can't do this.
slavery, money, slavery, money
Wow,
it doesn't cost anything because it just flows through you know i mean, I
I'm happier to be this way than other way.
The other way I was just miserable.
slavery, money
slavery,
New, slavery,
and I want you
Mister and Mrs Christian to grow
in your relationship with Christ,
and you will never go back and your new Christ, you have been in the past, you're in life, you know, specialty, but you hit me on the knee man, use and you immediately go back to you and you're, and you know, you put yourself versus me whenever people say we're breaking

beyond a certain point until your pocketbook is free. God, you are welcome to take control of my
checkbook, my account, my bank account, everything that I have. You are welcome to have it and to do
with it whatever you want to, God. Until you do that, you will be a slave
to yourself and to your greed. And what I want, folks, is I want you to be free.
Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage.
Everything you have is God's. Right. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage.
There's a lot of guys that wouldn't really make it in a lot of other venues,
but they can get a small church, be nice to some people, and serve.
Squeak out a living.
Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage. Leverage.
Folks, they're finally here.
Bible Stalge. A new cigar that contains a rich, smooth taste and a good Bible story.
Bible Stalge. Cuban tobacco leaf finally rolled in pure biblical text.
Bible Stalge. Just listen to the reports from postmodern cigar smokers.
As an agnostic cigar connoisseur, I was extremely skeptical of the Bible.
Bible Stalge. The next thing I knew, I'd smoked the entire Old Testament.
Even non-smokers are happy with Bible Stalges because...
You can get good dosages from other sources.
For instance, I practically smoked all of 2 Chronicles before discovering I had lung cancer.
I was bummed at first. Then I realized, hey, I can read the rest of the story in a regular Bible.
Bible Stalge. Orthodox biblical teaching and fantastic tobacco taste all rolled up in one practical cigar.
Bible Stalge.
It's a stogie that tells a story.
Bible Stalge is now available on NIV and ASB.
I heard about a lady that was out working very hard one day and she decided to sort of reward herself a little bit.
So she went down to the local mall and walked by one of those cookie stores, Mrs. Fields, you know.
And she bought herself a whole bag of cookies.
And one of those specialized coffee lattes, you know.
Half-calf, you know, all that.
And so she took her gourmet coffee, drinking her cookies, and she pulled her newspaper out of her purse and she sat down at a table to read it.
And as she was reading along, she'd reach in, grab a cookie and eat it and take a sip of her coffee.
And she was flipping the pages of her paper and she heard a rustle in her little cookie bag.
And she sort of pulled it down the top of the paper.
And there was a guy sitting.
She didn't know him.
And she thought she had seen his hand pull a cookie out of her bag.
But she thought, surely I'm seeing things.
No way would this guy swipe one of my cookies.
Well, then she took another cookie and she heard a rustle.
And this time she looked and sure enough, his hand was in the bag of the cookies.
He took a cookie out right in front of her, ate it.
Didn't seem to have any remorse or concern about it.
She grew very indignant.
She'd reach in, grab a cookie and eat it.
He'd reach in with a smile on his face.
He'd eat a cookie too.
This went on and on till the bag of cookies was almost gone and there was only one left.
And he reached in and grabbed it first before she could get it.
He broke it in half.
He smiled.
He gave her half of it.
She ate it.
She was so mad.
How dare that man steal my cookies?
I bought those for myself.
And she got up in a huff and grabbed her newspaper and was on her way out and was going to put her newspaper back in her purse.
And when she opened her purse up, lo and behold,
there was her bag of cookies.
What about the poor astrocephalic children, the people that have star material in their own brains and next thing you know they're trying to pooter pooter like I'm sick of coughs.
The problem nowadays, you've got the technology you can take advantage of.
But back in the day, we had to just sit and watch them, watch all that retardation just go way, way away.
It became the norm.



All of you including Robert, you're chỉ about to get rid of 알�iumene Breeze on a cap.
And you are not blood as strong as I was, just like a farad.


Your little doctor.
Oh, he knew.
This is the guy I'm curious about first.
You helped him first?


I helped him first.
that and you cut it into steaks and then the bottom half which is still planted in the desert
ground you kind of bowl it out with your bowie knife and you can make a bowl out of the bottom
half of the cactus you know and in about a few hours that bowl that you've cut out of there will
fill with cactus water delicious and you drink that or you can marinate yeah you can marinate
the steaks in that or just drink it it's very bitter but uh that's life yeah you drink it like
the navajo people do like life it's bitter drink it up that's it yeah hey i heard they use them
them barrel things on the bottom also to make them extraterrestrial saxophones for some of the
the beds well yeah you you eat the little flowers at the bottom of the barrel and you'll be seeing
the extra extra trust real saxophone you'll be playing them and everything you'll be jamming
right along
you know creating them making them how many of us all here tonight have wanted to jam with the
aliens more than anybody on earth hey i like a jam with woody smuts you know or some famous guy
depends on the venue like if it's here somewhere on earth i might be okay with it but i'm not going
to like you know jupiter or spanky you know it's like that the the atmospheric pressure is like 30
times that of earth it'll be crushed in a second and it'll be hard to play the saxophone yeah
you'll just go as all the air is crushed out of you and then you yourself will all your internal
organs will be crushed out of you into the saxophone yeah what about a planet like mercury
though you know they want you to go to mercury for a hot jam session you know they tell you it's a
hot session i wouldn't want to have no steel string instruments on mercury buddy or venus you
know it was to hang out with the venusians another hot session but they don't tell you you know in the
contract that venus has an atmosphere of sulfuric acid and you go there you get off the plane and
you're immediately fried and there go your drum heads too man
all your keyboards toasted all your midi equipment doesn't work
you know so it'll work for about three seconds see them guys and promoters they try and get you in on
this stuff and they think look we're gonna book about 20 souls from you know various parts of the
universe just to keep them in some kind of a weird kind of game but they're there because
it is we well born beyond nurture without suffering themselves for whole ζ

You've been staring at a blank screen and your mind has been humming and screaming.
Well, they come in and out of the window, but only when I'm sleeping and only when I don't look.
Jupiter's child is shaped like a burning thing.
Jupiter, no, no, get off my head.
Can you explain to the listeners what's going on now, Friday, please?
Well, the wind...
We're just waiting. We're waiting to stop waiting.
Buildings, buildings, buildings.
But instead of going back to Chicago, this woman, Connie, decided to go to Maui instead.
She just wanted to have an adventure.
Strangers offered her a place to stay.
She moved in with them and she was quoted in this article as saying,
You know what the word free spirit means?
Well, that's what I am now.
Now, what she was saying, Bleepo, is just correct.
She just had a misdirection at the vanishing house where the twelve apostles were...
She was cruising with the twelve apostles at the house of wax.
So then you don't want to turn the heat on too hard, then.
Because it'll start to melt.
Bob, Bob, Bob.
I'll buy you a start on your rocket jet.
Rocket jet, rocket jet, rocket jet, rocket jet, rocket jet, rocket jet, rocket jet, rocket jet.
How can you say something like that, you know?
Especially with your hands on it.
Hey, what is that giant domino floating in the air?
Over the studio.
It's Ludwig and Wolfie.
Look at it now.
It makes me...
It's giving me ideas.
It's getting into my brain.
It makes me want to throw bones in the air and invent faster than light travel.
And go out with girls I never met before.
That's all, lady?
We don't have to shave anymore.
She has a machine that does it.
This marked the first manned attempt to reach this distant planet.
Pro蓮m JR.: Just do some stuff.





Your nee поро kid did her best to require giving.
I enjoy working with people.
Well you know what?
Connie has a plan different for you than you had for yourself.
Rocket Jet.
I like rocket jets.
Rocket jet.
If you want to be a happy-
Happy bag of cookies,
I like rocket jets.
I like rocket jets.
I like rocket jets.
I like rocket jets.
Rocket jets.
What is your secret?
What is your secret?
What is your secret?
He was just another young soldier from your town.
And as he lay dying three hours out of a post-op situation,
they administered the vast dumps of cyanide directly into his brain.
He stared skyward underneath the mesh.
He could see the stars burning bright.
In his mind, the world was forming.
An island in his own mind.
And if I will call you
any night
again,
any day,
in your mind,
he'll hear it for you.
Come away,
come away.
I'm going to check,
stay with me.
Got the wounds in my head,
the wounds in my heart.
And they're scarcely breathing.
But he can see the swarming, the whispering,
pulling him upward with his finger,
his spirited guide to leave his body.
Far across that land,
over the coral of the news,
across the sea,
and the red and the blood.
And in the background,
the island of the moon.
And in the background, the island of the moon.
And in the background, the island of the moon.
And if I will call you,
come away, come away.
In your mind,
you'll hear it for you.
Come away, come away.
Come away, come away.
Come away, come away.
Come away, come away.
Come away, come away.
If I remain your friend,

20 minutes in the oven at 350.
And he's here.
That's your mom right there.
That's everybody's mom.
No, that's you, Dave.
So you're saying you're not the product of some experiment a long time ago?
No, we're the product of you, Dave.
We're the product of your imagination.
Oh, yeah, look, I dreamed of the anyone and all that stuff.
And all that propaganda been sucking up for 12 years.
Oh, yeah, they dreamed that whole Earth planet thing.
Oh, yeah.
They're happy.
You have never actually set foot on Earth.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
These guys are a little more perceptive in this second run here.
You have to let go of all the stuff around you
before you can see.
Clearly.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
And it's all in your mind.
Yeah.
Within you and without you.
Soul of Chisholm.
Yeah, I'll buy that doctor on any day.
Yeah.
It's 100 monkeys, 100 cowboy Dave.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Oh, man, that's not the life for me.
I don't want to be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen.
But that is not necessarily, not necessarily,
not necessarily,
not necessarily,
not necessarily God's plan for you.
Who knows what he has in store?
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
We'd love to lead you through little fantasies of memories and things.
But Dave, you know, face it.
Still a long way to Alpha Centauri.
It's a long way to Alpha Centauri.
There you go.
That might help.
That might help pass the time.
That's why I dreamed up cash.
To be my thought meister.
We gave, well, we gave, see, we took care of your needs.
I dreamed up for you to confuse me even more than I need to be in my life.
Every time you take a hit of the bong,
you have to open up the little, the little tiny little one inch big hatch to blow the hit out into space.
And when you do, it increases your velocity a little bit more.
I just thought I was going to have to blow wind through my head out of the turtle.
The more you smoke that thing, the faster you get there.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
You've got to keep sucking to keep going.
Yeah.
It's just like life.
Yeah.
But, you know, like in music, if you play too many notes, like they say, the more you suck,
I mean, the more you blow, the more you suck.
Tell me not to, tell me not to, tell me not to, tell me not to.
I'm listening to you hard now.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
The devil appeared, and he said to me, man, that outfit looks good on you.
A new planet will pass so close to the earth, it will cause vast destruction.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
You open up the suitcase thinking, oh, boy, maybe it's full of money because it seems
sort of squishy and heavy.
And you open it up, and it's just full of, like, you know, salamanders and newts and things.
And do you know people that there are people out there who are growing alien life forms
in their heads?
Yeah, you should.
In their brain cavities and stuff like that?
Yeah.
You mean because of the implant?
No.
No, they're doing it for money.
And then you try and get rid of it, and then somebody comes by, and they offer your contract
by email, which you email back.
Oh, yeah, the thing where you sign it, and they say they put coins inside your head,
and then after a certain number of months, they double the number of coins in your head.
Yeah.
After that nine-month gestation period, your head just instantly turns into a little spaceship
and leaves your body behind.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
We love you, man.
We're interested in everything you do.
You don't really exist.
You're figuring my imagination.
You're non-Pixation's radio character.
I just, you can't say stuff like that.
I wish.
What happens to all of us when Dave starts dreaming?
Well, that's the fun part.
What are you talking about?
We're waiting for that.
What do you mean, when?
Dave, when are you going to bed?
When's he going to wake up?
Dave, when are you going to stop dreaming?
This has been a long dream.
I hope it never happens.
Or was.
I mean, I might be down near the Dallas River, smoking an enchilada,
dreaming about the Shagawin Empire and the bloody empire of all the
Playing the Masonic funeral music over and over again.
Dreaming about Wolfgang and Ludwig having fights and snowball fights with each other
up in the car, and this music in heaven.
And we put the tin can to the hole with the rest of the corpses and poor lion.
But even then, Hal won't open the goddamn pod bay door.
25 or 624.
Hal opened the pod bay door.
I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
I'm a little overwhelmed with dealing with life here.
I own my own mobile home, separated.
There's a lot of responsibilities I have a hard time dealing with, and I'm trying to get over it.
But.
I probably better stop there.
And now I have to support myself.
I think I'm a little resentful.
Everybody in the world, you have to inhale to exhale.
I mean, I understand these principles.
I know this isn't real, you know, this is just the way it is.
I'm finding out that I really don't want to be responsible, I think.
Oh, I think it'll pass.
I'm sure that I'll come out on top eventually.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
Hang in there.
30 seconds.
Coming down at two.
He's got it made.
Come on in there.
24 feet.
Contact light.
Roger.
Copy contact.
Probe.
Yes, probe.
OK.
Interceptor off.
OK.
I'll cycle these valves.
You got your command over right off.
Yep.
Buildings.
Buildings.
Buildings.
Buildings.

Buildings.

Buildings.
Buildings.
Buildings.
Buildings.
There's no love.
No hate.
No hate.



But if you can get it another 20 miles up, man, then you're there.
You're where it's at.
That is.
You're free, man.
You're float.
40 miles, yeah.
You've escaped the pool, the gravity pool.
You're out there.
You're just licking the surface of the blood plant.
About 160,000 miles.
miles out, you lose the Earth's gravity altogether.
Is that where it is, 160? Yeah, and then the moon starts tugging you towards it.
So you start accelerating after you pass that point. Well, you know, if you can find that
perfect spot right in between the Earth and the moon, that L5.
That's it. That's called the L5 spot. You build your space colony
there, man, you are in free floating.
Yeah, it sounds good on paper, but remember, Doppler's Helm of Grange was
supposed to be there, and now it's wandering somewhere in the solar system.
Well, actually, Pete, it's out there
in the asteroid belt, and we know where it is.
It's not completely ruined yet. It's kind of bouncing off asteroids
here and there. I think it may need
a little work there. Roger. All dressed up and no place
to go. Don't work on it someplace. We can see it
getting bigger and bigger all the time.
Let me go to space. Let me go to space. Let me go to space.
Let me go to space.
There it is. Oh, my God. Right down the middle of the road.
Outstanding. 42 degrees, Pete.
I can't believe it. Amazing. Fantastic.
42 degrees, Pete.
Coming down in about 99 feet a second. You're looking good.
Okay. I'm going for landing.
Let me go to space.
Only one law. Rise above it all or drown in your own shit.
Build your own rocket ship.
Build your own rocket ship.
Build your own rocket ship.
Build your own rocket ship.
Man, that one got a little out of control.
But that's the way it goes in the rocket business.
I had to push the self-destruct button. Sorry about that, kiddies.
Build your own rocket ship.
The mission and roll program in this baby has really gone.
Fuel cell lights and AC bus light.
Fuel cell disconnect.
AC bus overload.
One and two.
Main bus A and C out.
I don't know what happened here.
We had everything in the world drop out.
I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.
I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.


I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.
I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.


I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.
I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.
I'm not sure if I can get hit by lightning.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
