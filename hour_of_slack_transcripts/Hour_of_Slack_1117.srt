1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
Up and away!

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,720
They'll go on. I'll give you five minutes to talk.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,260
All right. Here it is.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,500
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,520
I'm sure they don't need hospitalization, Doctor.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,760
They're just suffering.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,280
Good. That's fine.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,020
Oh, he's got a nasty haircut.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,560
Oh, I'm glad to hear that.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,580
Bob?

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,220
Who among ye?

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,860
Which manjack among ye doesn't like monsters?

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,980
The correct answer is, who cares?

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,520
I love monsters, and so does Doctor Howl.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,420
And many of us subgeniuses are monsters.

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,140
In fact, Bob is the coolest monster of them all.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,540
And friends, while chopping up the live stage radio recordings

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:00:59,980
from the live show,

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,560
and also from Starwood Festival,

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,680
and the devotional and old puzzling evidence shows

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,220
from the San Francisco subs,

22
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,720
thanks to Phineas Narco,

23
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,060
I kept coming to material that didn't fall into our usual categories.

24
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,360
That is, the conspiracy, war, sex, Bob, or drugs.

25
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,420
But into the category of monsters.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,360
Also, it's real easy to do a search in my computer

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,060
that pulls up every audio file with the word monster in the name.

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,300
And that's this show.

29
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,280
Hour of Slack number 1117.

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,580
You'll be hearing Doctor Howl,

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,040
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, together in fact,

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,760
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,120
puzzling evidence, collages by Nora Preff,

34
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,940
more collegiastices by Fernanda Nandeli-Mur,

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,480
and even a few monster movie clips in the forms of their title songs.

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,640
And so...

37
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,040
Wait, wait, what's that thing coming out of my microphone?

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,780
It's... it's... no!

39
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,500
No! No!

40
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:00,840
No!

41
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,060
No!

42
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,520
No!

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:01,700
No!

44
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,360
Now, gentlemen, do you see these file folders?

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,140
The ones with your names on them?

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,900
Can you guess what's in these file folders?

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,060
I'll give you a hint.

48
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,640
Discipline reports.

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,040
Lots of them.

50
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,740
And some wonderful artwork as well.

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,940
This is...

52
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,440
Spider with human head?

53
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm sorry, spider?

54
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,200
With human head.

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,360
Yeah, he eats dogs and cats and rabbits.

56
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,080
You see, sir, we kind of have this monster club, okay?

57
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,100
And we draw those pictures to put on our clubhouse walls.

58
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,880
Correction, Mr. Crenshaw.

59
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,320
You draw pictures during Mrs. Carlson's science class

60
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,280
when you're supposed to be paying attention.

61
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,840
Wait, I just want to say one thing.

62
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,300
I mean, Mrs. Carlson's a nice teacher and all,

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,380
but she's boring and has an odd-shaped head.

64
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,680
That's why some of the guys call her Meow Mix,

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,200
because her head's shaped like a cat head.

66
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,760
But I don't, sir, because...

67
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,280
How rude.

68
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,560
I hear you!

69
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,440
Hmm.

70
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,680
I was a kid once.

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,620
I thought...

72
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,520
Monsters were cool.

73
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,020
And maybe, well, gosh,

74
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,360
maybe I'm just a big kid because Sean, Patrick,

75
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,660
I think science is cool.

76
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,520
I dig it, man.

77
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,780
Now, I'm sure both of you know a great deal about monsters,

78
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,200
but that's not the issue here.

79
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,300
The issue is science is real.

80
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,900
Monsters are not.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,120
We don't know that, sir.

82
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,140
If you're bored because you feel like there aren't enough weird alien monsters on the planet,

83
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,220
it's just because you haven't looked yet.

84
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,760
There are many strange, hideous monsters yet to be discovered

85
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,720
and turned into subjects of monster movies.

86
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,300
Probably most of the things that live in the deep ocean

87
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,480
haven't really been identified yet.

88
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,840
Many haven't.

89
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,720
And as long as that's true, that means Bob has customers.

90
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,460
No matter how bad it gets,

91
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,020
on the surface of the earth,

92
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,100
there will be something that can evolve.

93
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,040
Say all life on earth was wiped out on the surface

94
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,220
by a terrible cataclysm or an economic depression

95
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,940
and everybody suddenly died.

96
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,480
And all the animals died.

97
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,000
Who would Bob sell to?

98
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,600
Well, he might have to wait around for a billion years,

99
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,120
but there would be creatures that live around those heat vents

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,440
at the bottom of the ocean that would be unaffected.

101
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,980
by anything on the surface.

102
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,700
They take their nutrition from the volcanoes and the heat down there

103
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,020
and have nothing to do with the sun.

104
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,020
But if you were to weigh all the life forms on the surface,

105
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,300
the complete biomass,

106
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,480
and as an aggregate of weight, come up with a figure,

107
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,260
this would be outweighed by the biomass of creatures that live below the surface

108
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,100
and are never seen.

109
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,960
Underground life,

110
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,120
life exceeds in vastness

111
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,100
all the life that exists on the surface layer.

112
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,860
So you could, in a way, you could say there is a hell.

113
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,340
And it's bigger than the surface, or world.

114
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,940
Another paradox, something inside that's bigger than outside.

115
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,900
But the point of all this is that eventually those simple creatures at the bottom of the ocean,

116
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,980
if there's nothing else around, they will eventually evolve into new customers for Bob

117
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,940
because that is the pattern.

118
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,660
That is the path of evolution.

119
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,720
Assuming they're challenged.

120
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,820
Right. Well, by Bob showing up and trying to sell them stuff for several million years,

121
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,360
they would eventually evolve into things that would buy the crap from Bob.

122
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,920
And as long as that happens, we can rest assured that life will go on and there will be slack.

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
It's wonderful how the...

124
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,380
Maybe not for humans or yetis.

125
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,040
Pure faith of Ivan Stang.

126
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,620
Uh...

127
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,260
Takes him through the direst imaginations and speculations.

128
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,340
Well, I'm an optimist.

129
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,860
I feel that, uh...

130
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,540
I feel that we...

131
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,280
The human race has a bright future.

132
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,360
Someday...

133
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,760
Well, even if X-Day doesn't come until 8661,

134
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,160
uh...

135
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,200
We'll eventually figure out how to live in peace.

136
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,120
I'm sure it won't take more than another one million years

137
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,520
before something like a human is able to get along with another human.

138
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,920
And not start a war.

139
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,680
Well, of course, future humans will not completely resemble the humans of today.

140
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:43,540
Evolution will create changes and create a type which would look most strange to us.

141
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,600
Well, it depends on whether the conspiracy wins or Bob wins.

142
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:55,260
If the conspiracy wins, the people of the future will just be heads with long fingers that sort of float around.

143
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,500
Whereas, if Bob wins,

144
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,120
the people of the future will be heads with long fingers and dicks.

145
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,200
Or, uh...

146
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,060
Vaginas.

147
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,860
Some kind of sex organ.

148
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,220
That's the difference.

149
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,340
These are the stakes, friends.

150
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,940
Do you want to end up as Carter LeBlanc posed it last year?

151
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,700
Do we want to go the direction of the greys?

152
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,040
Those smooth aliens who have no real feelings?

153
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,380
Or do we want to follow the ape path of our yeti ancestors?

154
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,380
And I say keep scratching them fleas.

155
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,340
You know?

156
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,560
And if we're going to be big chimps,

157
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,600
wouldn't it be better to be bonobo chimps rather than pantroglodytes?

158
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,800
Yes, let's be chimps, not chumps.

159
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,180
And spend our time in a play that advances our development.

160
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,940
It's a little late for George Bush.

161
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,420
His path is already chosen.

162
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,480
Well, I think that's a good point.

163
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,920
Well, actually, it's kind of late in that sense for everyone.

164
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,740
Since no individual evolves.

165
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,680
It's only shown in the path of the development of the genotype.

166
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,960
Oh well.

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,900
But one can try at any rate.

168
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,040
Try to live up to what might be potentially,

169
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,760
kinetically available within the subgenius plasm.

170
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,380
But we've hashed all this out before many times

171
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,000
in many intricately worded, hard to read pamphlets.

172
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,600
By failing, sputtering, fluorescent light.

173
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,440
And if people aren't approaching a gestalt of understanding of all this stuff by now,

174
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,160
well, one might well ask, what are they doing at X Day?

175
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,240
Waiting for the coloring book to come out.

176
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,920
Well, yeah, we will have that, of course.

177
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
And many other things.

178
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,440
There are those who believe that something mysterious lives in the south of England.

179
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,460
Wherever there are lake monsters, there are other lake monsters.

180
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:57,460


181
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,280
There are people just like this.

182
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,020
Locals, visitors, scientists and investigators yearning to become lake monsters.

183
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,020
There's one man who supports a lake monster.

184
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,180
I feel blessed.

185
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,680
So long.

186
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,120
Yes, folks, we're having new messages coming in all the time to our message center.

187
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,600
I'm here to take a picture.

188
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,080
Take a picture?

189
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,340
Yeah, I took a picture of the sacred that radio audience doesn't know that the miracle of 10X Day

190
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:34,660
was a pancake splatter that miraculously took the shape of a Dobbshead silhouette.

191
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,940
Reverend V and Reverend N. were doing their annual pancake breakfast.

192
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:48,560
And we got the miraculous Dobbshead pancake, which we're going to shellack and display.

193
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,400
Take that, Jesus-faced tortilla.

194
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,940
Yeah.

195
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,600
There was a...

196
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,320
In order for our miracle to happen, a second...

197
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,660
A second pancake for the pipe attached by a stalk has to form.

198
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,980
Now, surely this is a singular proof of divine interference, if not favor.

199
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,780
Right.

200
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:15,360
If we see that pancake divide like an amoeba and become two Dobbshead-shaped pancakes,

201
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,380
then we know that we've succeeded in creating life.

202
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,640
Or at least Reverend V and Reverend N. have succeeded in creating some new form of life.

203
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,980
Or in striving so hard to create a pattern.

204
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,640
That many simple, humble, unpretentious and homely objects

205
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,400
naturally flow into the shape of that pattern.

206
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,640
And that's why you see Dobbsheads that form spontaneously everywhere.

207
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:50,060
Like I said, nature is trying to form more customers for Bob and more Dobbsheads that can be sold.

208
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,180
Comet or a meteor, comet or a meteor.

209
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:53,980
No, horn.

210
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,400
That makes me realize how desperately lonely it is.

211
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,300
Hanging in silence.

212
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,940
Spaced like a speck of food floating in the ocean.

213
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,560
Sooner or later to be swallowed up by some creature floating by.

214
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,640
Oh, come now.

215
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,420
Report, report.

216
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,820
42-96, found content.

217
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,500
Wait, Captain.

218
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,740
I have found evidence of intelligent beings on this planet.

219
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,440
Of what concern are foreign beings?

220
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,800
Of none to you, Thor.

221
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,380
How do you know that?

222
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,820
Need no partners, Nick.

223
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,240
No luck.

224
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Your endless hunger for killing.

225
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,660
Silence, both of you.

226
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,680
Prepare for takeoff.

227
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,040
Takeoff.

228
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,220
We don't know our fathers or mothers.

229
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,060
We're raised in cubicles.

230
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,000
There was love.

231
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,960
Torture, torture.

232
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,560
We are the supreme race.

233
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,960
We have the supreme weapons.

234
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,440
It thrives, Captain.

235
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,980
Already I can feel it has grown heavier.

236
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,440
Captain, Captain, something has gone wrong.

237
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:37,880
Look here.

238
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,180
What?

239
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,700
What has happened?

240
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,460
I do not know.

241
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,500
It's suddenly so limp.

242
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,320
Now does not move.

243
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,560
I will get the straps.

244
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,740
Captain, look at this.

245
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,780
It is not dead.

246
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,780
It has revived.

247
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,780
It flourishes.

248
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,000
Out of sight, out of sight.

249
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,560
Here, us and exact growth rate.

250
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,940
Millions of times enlarged.

251
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,780
Let us be quick.

252
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,020
I do not like to look upon it.

253
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:56,980
Sparkey.

254
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,280
Sparkey.

255
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,280


256
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,280


257
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,280


258
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,160
Where have you been all your life?

259
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,800
Are you kidding?

260
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,420
My uniform is all I have.

261
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,080
Gosh, you've got to have more than that.

262
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,380
Answer me or I destroy you.

263
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,280
Hard and so hard.

264
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,640
Oh, much better.

265
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,220
I'm glad you came.

266
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,400
So is Grandpa.

267
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,100
Hey, I like that.

268
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,320
You are not familiar with the focusing disintegrator ray?

269
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:14,900
The what?

270
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,300
I don't care where you're from.

271
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,180
I don't know what you're talking about.

272
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,760
He's a murderer.

273
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,880
He killed Professor Simpson.

274
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,240
What?

275
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,380
Let's take a look in the old cave.

276
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,640
I could hear the thing tearing him apart.

277
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,140
Mystery still surrounds the disappearance of a man-eating beast.

278
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,620
Meanwhile.

279
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,620
How big would it be now?

280
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,460
There is no killing.

281
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,480
Turn the power back on.

282
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:31,840
Okay.

283
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,780
Try anything.

284
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,600
It's our only chance.

285
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,880
We have the supreme weapons.

286
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,580
Very stupid.

287
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,860
I'm ready to take my punishment.

288
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,640
Will not the government structure collapse it?

289
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,160
Let me be the one to direct them in for landing.

290
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,000
Increase speed.

291
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,900
Increase speed.

292
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,220
Speed.

293
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,580
Crash.

294
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,100
Get down.

295
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:43,500
Get down.

296
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:43,840
Down.

297
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,180
Down.

298
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,380
Down.

299
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:44,660
Down.

300
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,720
Well, you know, the funny thing is Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave was going to be here.

301
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,840
Could that be him pulling up over there?

302
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,860
Well, I suppose.

303
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,180
If it is, then I'm going to get up.

304
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,380
And let him sit here.

305
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,760
Well, that would be a refreshing.

306
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,460
If he slams into the back of my car, we'll know it's him.

307
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
But he didn't.

308
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,220
Yeah, it is.

309
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,180
It is Dave.

310
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,060
The lonesomeness of the cowboy has ended for a little while.

311
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,300
Dave?

312
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,120
Yes?

313
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,040
Why don't you come up here?

314
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,580
There's like an hours worth of recording time.

315
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,820
And you just sit right there.

316
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,900
And we are back with our Bobcast.

317
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,920
We just had the final hours of X Day 10X at Rushwood.

318
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,820
There have actually been 12, haven't there?

319
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,000
Or is it 13 now?

320
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,700
Well, you get into the...

321
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,660
There have been 12 drills altogether.

322
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:48,240
Well, the first one had the strong eugenics overtone where a lot of the audience was culled,

323
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,080
as they call it.

324
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,520
Where they had either their shackles removed or replaced or had parts of their bodies removed.

325
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,320
But they tried.

326
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,620
They tried the best they could.

327
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,900
They died in harness.

328
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,220
In harmony.

329
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,740
Look, here's a nice cold beer that you've just made.

330
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,060
Thank you.

331
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,560
That took a little doing, but cold is better than warm, where beer is concerned.

332
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,740
Let's consider the appropriateness of appropriateness.

333
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:21,040
Did three very, very large people with huge macrocephalic looking heads appear behind us?

334
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,520
No, that was...

335
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,280
Well, macrocephalism isn't...

336
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,360
Funny, but it sure isn't that sad.

337
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,320
Unless you're a pinhead.

338
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,960
Right.

339
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,980
Contrast creates more contrast, creates harmony slash beauty equals truth slash...

340
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,400
But water on the brain is an unpleasant thing to have.

341
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,120
To slosh when you move your cranium is distracting and dispiriting.

342
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,860
It's better to have water on the knee if you must have it anywhere.

343
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,980
Well, for swimmers, water on the brain is definitely a drawback.

344
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,960
It confuses them, disorients them.

345
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,360
They may swim with the other teams, as they say in outer space talk.

346
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,100
Like the exes, perhaps.

347
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,040
Well, I suppose it's disability which gives you certain professional standing,

348
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:17,120
like the writer's bump, except of course, writers don't get those bumps because they use computers

349
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,880
these days.

350
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:25,940
But the shoemaker's calloused thimble finger, and that's what they're doing.

351
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:25,940


352
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:25,940


353
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:25,940


354
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:25,940


355
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:25,940


356
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:32,340
These are honest deformities of labor and possession.

357
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,540
Remember, Buddha was against butchery, and that's why he did away with all the butchers

358
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:45,280
in northern Nepal, and the eaters of meat, the lookers out of meat, and that's why he

359
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,760
was deformed in such a way.

360
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,680
He had the old butcher's handle.

361
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,620
Mmm.

362
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,440
Mmm.

363
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,180
There's nothing like it.

364
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,940
A bag of fresh fat hanging on the...

365
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,080
...over each ear, and long horns awaiting the wind.

366
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,160
Oh, we're waiting for the wind, aren't we?

367
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,580
Even a large smock can't disguise that one.

368
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,100
Now let's go over that again.

369
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,740
You say you saw some sort of monster.

370
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,900
You know cryomorphology is the park of...

371
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,360
Oh, monsieur.

372
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,480
...deormorphology pertaining to the various processes and products of cold climates.

373
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,100
Captain.

374
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,000
There's one now.

375
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,520
Captain.

376
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,820
We are in the air canal.

377
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,080
Everybody be quiet.

378
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,840
You can hear us.

379
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,440
There's a funny little itching thing in the ear, Captain.

380
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:25,900
I...

381
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,060
What about the other ear?

382
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:27,540
Ah!

383
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:27,880


384
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,300


385
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:28,460


386
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:28,520
Ah!

387
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,580
It shrivels with antennas.

388
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,420
We put creatures in our bodies.

389
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,380
Well, you know, it was just a show.

390
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,000
They're show creatures, yes.

391
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,800
Captain, it was Stag.

392
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,360
He put the creatures in our ears to make us ruin this show.

393
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,580
Oh, no.

394
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,300
Really?

395
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,100
Well...

396
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,800
That's kind of neat.

397
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,500
Let's see what we can do.

398
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:52,740
Let's...

399
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,100
Okay, I'm gonna pull the head of one of these little creatures out here, and it'll talk

400
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,440
to us.

401
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,760
Okay, talk to us, little creature.

402
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,940
Okay, little creature's shy.

403
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,360
There's one.

404
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,500
Get it.

405
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:05,880
Squash it.

406
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,180
I was just supposed to say, help me, help me.

407
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,340
Kill it.

408
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,400
Look, it's...

409
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,120
It's back in Tokyo!

410
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:09,760
Ah!

411
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,740
Now, uh, what was this about a monster?

412
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,820
Come on, you can't expect us to believe that.

413
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,260
Let's go over that again.

414
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,420
I believe you probably think you saw something.

415
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,640
You know, the human mind's a funny thing.

416
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,300
It plays strange tricks.

417
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:33,360
Are you guys trying to tell us that aliens, space monsters are bringing on some kind of

418
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,900
brave new world?

419
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,300
Yeah.

420
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,800
And they're gonna whip your butt real good.

421
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,280
But they're really pretty, so you won't mind.

422
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,680
Yeah, and they got big tentacles and flowers on their hats and everything.

423
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,120
Now let's go over that again.

424
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,460
So you heard some kind of show or monster?

425
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:50,680
Oh, no.

426
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,440
Mom, you've gotta believe me.

427
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:52,780
What?

428
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,860
Don't you think I know how crazy this sounds?

429
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,300
Don't you think you're...

430
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,500
I know you're thinking, well, this guy has to be locked up.

431
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,920
This guy has to be locked up.

432
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,460
Well, I didn't say that, mister, but you've got the general idea.

433
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,140
Don't you know there aren't any monsters in this day and age?

434
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,160
This whole town is lost, I tell you.

435
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,840
We put a man on the moon.

436
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,340
Uh, time for monsters is come and gone.

437
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,860
I know it sounds crazy, but it's the truth.

438
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,920
You've gotta believe me.

439
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,040
Well, now, this thing you say you thought you saw...

440
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,800
It was ten feet tall and dripping slime and had tentacles and wings all over it.

441
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,140
Oh, that was Mobius Rex.

442
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,800
He's not here, though.

443
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,560
It is curious, speaking of horns growing on humans, how many times this has happened in

444
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,440
human history.

445
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:39,960
Some of the horns are on display in L.A. in the Museum of Jurassic Technology.

446
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Anyone's ever been there?

447
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,540
I have one.

448
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,860
Only it was...

449
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,120
I have to get it removed.

450
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,820
It's starting.

451
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,060
It's a startup.

452
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:53,700
Well, there are, you know, ultimately it can grow out and then sort of curve back, you

453
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:53,840
know.

454
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,180
Unfortunately, not being a very symmetrical thing like the horns of Amon.

455
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,280
It always looks like an addition which doesn't belong there.

456
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,200
However, most of us don't grow actual horns.

457
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,720
However, we might have one.

458
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:15,140
I do actually have one, which is why I wear this stupid hat, which has nothing to do with

459
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,520
a fashion statement or anything.

460
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,960
There is, if you will notice, this protrusion here.

461
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,040
I believe you.

462
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,140
Actually, I had mine surgically removed.

463
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:23,820
Oh, really?

464
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,980
I've got a scar.

465
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,220
But I decided not to grow the horn myself.

466
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:35,740
But it is a form of enlightenment, like a witch's thumb or something like that.

467
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,480
But difficult to...

468
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,280
You don't want to keep telling people what it is and why it's there and so on.

469
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,400
Or wait for them to, you know, you know that when you're talking to them and you're trying

470
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,900
to explain something, they're just looking at your horn.

471
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,020
I'm thinking about what they're going to say.

472
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,160
I'm tired of people looking right there.

473
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,760
Yeah, you'll get tired of it.

474
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,760
Bishop Joey of the First Church of the Last Laugh, he's got one right at the top of his

475
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,840
gradium, which is ultimately going to give him a head with a point on it, as he always

476
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,200
wanted.

477
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,620
Well, sometimes if you've been dob-slapped, you can grow an alien vertebrae, which is...

478
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,840
How many vertebrae are we supposed to have?

479
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,600
29, 73, something like that?

480
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,060
33.

481
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:19,920
33.

482
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,520
My dear fellow, 33.

483
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,620
So each one...

484
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,420
That's sacred and important.

485
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:23,900
That's an important number.

486
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:30,380
Well, so like if you're a 34th degree subgenius, there's a protrusion out of your ass.

487
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,880
Oh, that's entirely one vertebrae too many.

488
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,640
One vertebrae too many, yes.

489
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,740
What they call an ascended master in the Church of the Subgenius is really a de-beast,

490
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,120
I mean, a de-beast.

491
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,140
Well, there you said it.

492
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,720
De-beast, by a de-base.

493
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,740
A de-beast maestro by...

494
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,140
No, that's not the...

495
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,120
Is the room getting fuzzier now or...

496
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,340
Are we growing more hair?

497
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,860
Both of those things are happening, but I'm drinking a healthful, refreshing beer because

498
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,320
of a remark that Stang made earlier.

499
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:12,940
And we will experience other potations and medicaments while we continue to broadcast

500
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,520
as a reward for our diligence in the service of the Epoch Bob Dobbs.

501
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,440
Well, this show is just a dried-up collection of

502
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:52,440


503
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:52,860
Yes, remember they love their music.

504
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:52,880
Yeah, it is.

505
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:52,900


506
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:52,900


507
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:52,920
Yeah.

508
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:52,960
Yeah.

509
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah.

510
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,040
Yeah.

511
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,080
Yeah.

512
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,120
Yeah.

513
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,840
One big guy in the middle of my head

514
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,660
When he looked at you, you never knew

515
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,680
Are they red or are they blue?

516
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,640
My balls, that is bubbling crude

517
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,980
Am I happy, am I sad?

518
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,940
Am I insane, if not mad?

519
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,800
Sorry, I'm living in the city

520
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,780
One man, oh

521
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,760
My pain isn't pretty

522
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,520
I'm all alone

523
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,720
Living in the city

524
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,880
You're in my home

525
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,880
My pain isn't pretty

526
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,640
I'm all alone

527
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,180
Guitar

528
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,640
When they looked at you, you never knew

529
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,700
Are they red or are they blue?

530
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,620
My balls, that is bubbling crude

531
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,840
Am I happy, am I sad?

532
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,860
Am I insane, if not mad?

533
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,760
Am I sad?

534
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,780
Sorry, I'm living in the city

535
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,000
You're in my home

536
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,780
My pain isn't pretty

537
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,560
I'm all alone

538
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,840
I'm living in the city

539
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,000
You're in my home

540
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,700
My pain isn't pretty

541
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,600
I'm all alone

542
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,980
I'm all alone, ladies

543
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:15,280
Yes, friends, and that was the song Cyclops, popularized by D.V. 2.0, done by Magic Cyclops, and you can find Magic Cyclops at myspace.com slash thequadcitymadman.

544
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,700
How about Pantagruel?

545
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,780
You remember the story of Pantagruel the Tasty and the one who said he was disgusting?

546
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,340
Yes, these were two huge, grotesque giants of the past.

547
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:38,560
Now, of course, it says in the Bible that in the days of the Israelite spies, they went out and they saw the giant sons of Anak, the Anakim.

548
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,620
How large were these giants?

549
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,520
Well, they were pretty big.

550
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:48,640
The giants that Dante found in hell, some of them were 15 feet tall, and that's pretty big for a giant.

551
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,660
You know, they can't really get enormous, so it is said.

552
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,540
Because of the simple rules of physics that can't be transgressed.

553
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:04,980
But the Anakim were so large that the Israelites were as grasshoppers in their sight.

554
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:12,720
That's not as quite as bad as it sounds if you've ever seen the huge horse-lubber grasshoppers they have out in that part of the world.

555
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,300
Still, that's a mighty big giant.

556
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:22,180
And Gargantua and Pantagruel were two huge, lusty, brawling, farting, shitting, vomiting giants.

557
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,600
In the beloved book by François Rabelais.

558
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:37,840
A book that may not be too known over here, but the Euros like it so much that they created a huge amusement park of Gargantua and Pantagruel land.

559
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:46,320
Their version of Disneyland celebrates a huge, gluttonous giant, which was right in the middle of the amusement park.

560
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,460
And you know what?

561
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,180
The whole thing tanked.

562
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,780
Nobody went to Gargantua and Pantagruel.

563
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,440
They went to nearby Euro Disneyland instead.

564
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:11,640
Because there's something about these little, rubbery, American cartoon characters that are far more appealing to the secret, deviant desires of humans than a mythological, groaning, farting, eating giant.

565
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,260
As enjoyable as those books are.

566
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:22,700
Mr. Crunchbender, I would like to remind you that the Fizzrelites responded in kind by creating...

567
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,100
...tiny, tiny, anti-magnetic subgenia.

568
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,360
...that were capable of offsetting the huge weight of Pantagruel and fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh...

569
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,420
Those were called Onanobots.

570
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,420
The Onanobots, of course.

571
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:49,840
That is an ingenious and appropriate response to these outsized giants to attack them with the very small, in this case, chains of juddering nanobots operating in unison.

572
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,760
They say in the future all they'll have to do is inject...

573
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,280
those and they will march to the site of your disease and annihilate it. But my only question

574
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,120
is, then what will they march to and annihilate?

575
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,320
Was masturbation the reason the giants shrank down to nothing?

576
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,920
These nanobots will cost nothing for the first injection, but removing them, that's going

577
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:19,720
to be a pricey procedure. Do you remember in Gargantua and Pantagruel where an exploration

578
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,300
party wandered down the throat of one of these giants and was lost for some days?

579
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:31,080
And then when it was finally withdrawn, they asked them questions and the last question

580
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:38,620
was, but where did you shit? And the answer was, why, down your throat, my lord.

581
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,860
This is a hilarious medieval humor in these books.

582
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,780
Well, once you've gone there, you'll never go anywhere else.

583
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,680
As long as it's past the Tate.

584
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:56,740
It doesn't matter. It's simply more protein being absorbed by the giant body.

585
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,920
Has anybody seen a dog-dyed dark green?

586
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,360
About two inches tall.

587
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:12,220
So genius. Power of the sun.

588
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,380
Go shut your face!

589
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,220
But speaking of being back in Minas Sidus, a few weeks from now,

590
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,700
I will know.

591
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,280
I will no longer be living.

592
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,340
And so, you know, you can't help thinking of the last few years of my life.

593
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,300
And I don't know, maybe I'm overly mental.

594
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,240
Stan, what are we going to do to solve the ever-perplexing, itchy conundrum of these

595
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,520
unbestowed Bobby Awards?

596
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,620
I love me.

597
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,980
We should give them out to whoever still remains while they're still trickling away.

598
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,860
You know, we'll end up with a table of awards.

599
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,640
You say that, but we've gained quite a few more people.

600
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,800
We've gained a lot more people from the last time.

601
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,500
All right, well let's continue then doing that hoodoo that we do so well.

602
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,800
And maybe we'll achieve a quorum and be able to give away our awards.

603
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:06,720
Because it would be a cryin' shame if after all the labor that has been expended on creating these things,

604
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,820
they were not to go to their intended receptors.

605
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,780
We don't know who they actually are intended for.

606
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,200
We know they are somehow...

607
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,060
Oh, yes we do.

608
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,480
Oh, yes we do.

609
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:19,540
Oh, yes we do.

610
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:19,760
We do?

611
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,260
It tells each and every subgenius who's going to receive one of these god-awful things.

612
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:33,700
So, you know, we are able to bestow them once the bestowal process starts.

613
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,880
Don't worry, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, we will have no hemming and hawing.

614
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,020
The administration of justice will be precise and sure when the moment comes.

615
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:49,340
Are you saying that there is a moment of justice after the bestowal of these ridiculous awards?

616
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,440
Which have poo-poo on the bottom of them?

617
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,760
That is the justice.

618
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,900
That is the retribution there.

619
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,040
The equalization, you know.

620
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:08,180
One wonders, if life is unfair, if the universe is unfair, if nature is unfair, if your chance is unfair,

621
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,740
your life is unfair, your job is unfair, what is fair?

622
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,160
Where is fair?

623
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,320
Fair is where you take your pig and hope you get a prize.

624
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,660
Yes, but of course you might not even be there.

625
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:31,680
Some already well-fed, wealthy person might swagger up and lead that pig away by the ring in the end of his nose,

626
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,380
which more and more people have these days.

627
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,680
So, you have to look for fairness somewhere else, and that is outside this universe,

628
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,860
in the realm that Plato originally envisaged, or whoever he got it from,

629
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,700
the world of perfection.

630
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,560
In the world of perfection, there is such a thing as fair and unfair.

631
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,300
That means that there is a potential somewhere, perhaps not in our universe,

632
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,600
for inequities to be justified.

633
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,280
Otherwise, we wouldn't think that fairness was the norm, and departure from it the abnormality.

634
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:15,500
Even the worst asshole in the world, if he feels himself cheated, will complain that it's not fair.

635
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,840
This is one indication that, in fact, the world is not fair.

636
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,280
This is one indication that things aren't quite the way they're cooked up to be

637
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,820
in this world of molecules and mud puppies, of cancers and undersea worms.

638
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:37,280
You know, this is all simply a show, a projection of magic shadow shapes that come and go.

639
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:42,680
And we're only hoping that all the body parts complain at the right time.

640
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,940
At about the time stupefaction comes,

641
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:51,080
just before reintegration, the body starts breaking down.

642
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,860
That's necessary.

643
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,080
That's necessary so you don't...

644
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,920
You're not supposed to remember your earlier life.

645
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,680
The stupefaction wipes you clean, so you...

646
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,520
Just like those robots in Star Wars that get a complete memory wipe

647
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,860
so the script won't be all pinkier than it is.

648
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,700
We will be handing out memory wipes with these ridiculous prizes,

649
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,240
so you'll never have the stain of what happened to you.

650
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,280
Being honored by the church.

651
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,180
Yes, there will be no stigma, or perhaps in this case, smegma,

652
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,640
when these awards are given out.

653
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,580
And unlike the condoms, there will be no disappointment.

654
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,860
Unlike the pyramid sales plan, which didn't work,

655
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,140
there will be perfect agreement.

656
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,640
Unlike the pro...

657
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,600
Well, I suppose I shouldn't continue in this vein.

658
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,720
Naturally, a man's reach must...

659
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,240
Look for another vein, you junky.

660
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,320
Exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for, eh?

661
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,300
Smack it up. Go ahead. Look for another vein, if you can find one, you foolish junky.

662
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,180
Oh, you have hard veins to find.

663
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,820
Let me try again.

664
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,040
And again.

665
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,040
One more time. One more. One more.

666
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,700
Oh, we're losing him. We're losing him.

667
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,060
Maybe we can bring him back with a little slap on the face.

668
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,080
Bob's coming. Gonna take us off this...

669
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,180
No, it's not working.

670
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,000
Go for the heart punch. Stick up.

671
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,280
The last view before you completely check out is of Bob's grinning face,

672
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,000
instead of children playing on the beach like in that movie.

673
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:30,800
It glows.

674
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,320
The pipe glows, too.

675
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,300
Yeah, it glows.

676
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,880
Pent-up hatreds, petty jealousies, an air of ineffable doom.

677
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,520
The atmosphere of a place accursed.

678
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,800
Please, please, kill father.

679
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,000
I'll be over right away.

680
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,660
I went to the barn to get a piece of thick.

681
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,940
What's it to hear about your father?

682
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,520
Oh, doctor. Oh, doctor. Doctor, in the living room.

683
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,200
Stand back. Stand back. How long's he been dead, doc? Still warm. Lizzie.

684
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,800
Yes, doctor.

685
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,940
That's it. Turn around.

686
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:57,880
Me?

687
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,660
Yes, you.

688
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,300
Oh. Doctor. Yes. Yes.

689
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,020
What? Why?

690
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:02,740
Yes, doctor.

691
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,980
And he's been dead only a few minutes.

692
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,880
Yes. Not a clue. Where were you, Lizzie Borden, when this happened?

693
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,820
Where were you, Lizzie Borden, when this happened?

694
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,620
Where were you, Lizzie Borden, when this happened?

695
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,940
Where were you, Lizzie Borden, when this happened?

696
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,460
Where were you, Lizzie Borden, when this happened?

697
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,140
Where were you, Lizzie Borden, when this happened?

698
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,840
Where were you, Lizzie Borden, when this happened?

699
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,940
I repeat. I repeat. Again. Impossible, gentlemen of the jury. Impossible.

700
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,300
It is not easy to remove blood stains.

701
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,660
It is the morning of the murder. Food will be forthcoming.

702
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,620
I'm going out of the barn for a piece of thick.

703
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,600
Puzzling and weird practices found in voodooism.

704
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,180
Zombies within the cult of voodooism in Haiti.

705
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,000
Zombies do exist.

706
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,020
I'm going down.

707
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:45,700
You must.

708
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,220
Yes. I need it.

709
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,120
I have been watching you.

710
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,400
You've been watching me?

711
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,640
You and the woman.

712
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,340
What's the matter with you? What's come over you?

713
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,640
Helen was dead. Many times before a white man, he say rubbish.

714
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,200
Many zombies work.

715
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,540
All come strong.

716
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,640
All come strong.

717
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,480
Come? Where?

718
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,820
Come along and I'll show you.

719
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,160
Now stand back while I dig.

720
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,260
Oh, let me talk. Let me talk.

721
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:05,500
No.

722
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,420
Helen. Helen. Helen.

723
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,640
She was a zombie.

724
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,160
Have you ever heard of inanimate objects being moved by the power of mind?

725
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,800
Yes, I have.

726
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:20,760
And isn't it possible that the same worker in black magic or voodooism that killed a person by power of mind could take that inanimate object to the corpse and make it move?

727
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,460
Do you believe that?

728
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:21,660
Yes.

729
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,180
Made a zombie.

730
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,240
Made a zombie.

731
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,120
Made a zombie.

732
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,100
The pipe is not just a decoration.

733
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,280
The pipe is really, the pipe is really part of Bob's face.

734
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,200
Walt Disney Productions recently went through all their cartoons and desecrated them and censored them.

735
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,220
For example, the story of Pecos Bill.

736
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,080
He used to smoke a cigarette.

737
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,420
Well, we can't show cigarettes in a Walt Disney cartoon.

738
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,060
So they went through and painted it out digitally in every frame.

739
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:57,600
But now he looks awful because the cigarette was part of his face.

740
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,500
That was part of the design.

741
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,660
So they went looking for Pecos Bill's Bob.

742
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,620
And Bill's veins.

743
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,340
And we've enjoyed from time to time.

744
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,400
Smack him up.

745
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,260
Smack him up.

746
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,040
Look at my veins.

747
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,300
Drawing Bob's without pipes.

748
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,140
But we understand this is only a trick.

749
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,400
A misanthrope.

750
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,940
Not anything like any representation of any level of reality.

751
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,320
A misanthrope.

752
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,820
Well, we know the pipe really belongs there.

753
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:28,080
We're allowed to play, to frisk and gamble in the fields of Bob.

754
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,980
Someday there are actual brain cells located deep in the mungress of the pipe.

755
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,980
So that when Hubsaphrompsipilus is lit or smoked nearby,

756
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,040
the actual brain cells come alive.

757
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,580
And they even create the magic.

758
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,700
The sundry sounds and strange delights which are known to be his monograms.

759
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,580
Isn't that a lovely legend?

760
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,800
What a wonderful legend that was.

761
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,060
Yeah, the ancient brain cells coming to life.

762
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,600
Can you imagine that?

763
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:05,260
Like that A.E. van Vogt story where aliens come down to a destroyed earth

764
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:10,180
and they go into a museum and with some god awful advanced alien technology,

765
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,080
these are totally inhuman.

766
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,600
Bug-like aliens resuscitate an ancient mummy.

767
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:20,580
They've reestablished those ancient cells and he comes out of his sarcophagus

768
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,360
and what does he see?

769
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,940
Horrible aliens in spacesuits.

770
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,160
He starts to bow down to them and says,

771
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Wait a minute, I don't bow down to strange gods.

772
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,320
That fixes his historical period.

773
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,180
All right for you.

774
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,840
And they destroy him.

775
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,080
But pretty soon they get a guy who gives them a ring.

776
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,820
A thing, a run for their money.

777
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,640
Mummy.

778
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,260
Regeneration.

779
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:51,920
Yeah, the mummy was brought back and as Ivan Stang was saying the other night,

780
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,700
he's a sort of pathetic character shuffling along with one arm tied up in bandages.

781
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:01,240
But just like George Romero's zombies, he ultimately gets you.

782
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,080
However palsied and slow his movements because he persists.

783
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,220
And even though he bumbles and bumps into doors and knocks into things

784
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,560
and moves slower than your 80 year old grandfather with a walker,

785
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:19,320
he eventually gets to where he's going, which is where you are.

786
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,520
And pretty soon you are no more.

787
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,600
But he continues to shuffle along.

788
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,840
Shuffling and shuffling.

789
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,860
Baby stamp.

790
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,320
But there's a moment of truth to us.

791
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,760
I'm just scared it begins with one little baby stamp.

792
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:39,200
In even the crummiest mummy movie where they spill the tanner leaf tea on the floor.

793
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,380
And then all of a sudden it's not shuffle anymore, is it Mr. Mummy?

794
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:48,640
It's down on the floor trying to lick up the tanner juice with his disintegrating non-existent tongue.

795
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,640
And pretty soon it's just another bundle of old rags and cloth and bones

796
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,600
while the bovine hero and heroine embrace and the music comes up.

797
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,400
It's a terrible fate.

798
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,900
I'm sure it's only subgeniuses who are keenly aware of that moment

799
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,060
greater than any tragedy.

800
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,580
In Greek plays or in Shakespeare where the monster meets his doom

801
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,460
just as the normals embrace and find sexual satisfaction.

802
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,740
Like, say, one example, the beast from 20,000 Fathoms

803
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:29,820
has been horribly wounded already by a GI with a bazooka.

804
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,240
Now they make it worse by firing a radioactive isotope into his bloody wound.

805
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,180
And he shrieks and he bolts out of the burning coniochlea.

806
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,880
He's on the island roller coaster and trots around and around on the sand

807
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,840
like a dog chasing his own tail.

808
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:49,400
And finally he rears up on his hind leg and gives one horrible shriek

809
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,540
just as the moment that the romance music comes up

810
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,240
and the girl and the studly young scientist embrace

811
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,020
while the stern Air Force guy, Kenneth Tobey, looks on approvingly.

812
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,100
Why does this have to happen at the moment of the death of the Rhetosaurus?

813
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,720
And so stark and alone,

814
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,900
and a monad with no hope of reproduction or survival,

815
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,480
he nonetheless shrieks out his final rattling barbaric yawp

816
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,200
before collapsing to the sand and over his huge humped dead carcass

817
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,280
the words THE END appear in giant letters.

818
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,140
Also the Warner Brothers shield.

819
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:36,280
Yes, this is a moment to make every subgenius react in awe and pity

820
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,180
which Aristotle said was the appropriate year

821
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,320
to produce of the drama.

822
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,900
Now you can take that and put that in your pipe

823
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,980
and smoke it, Eugene O'Neil

824
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,960
or whoever is supposed to be a really trenchant observer.

825
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,540
Well, all I can say is that damn Plato was a caveman and a liar.

826
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,400
He believed in a republic where people didn't vote

827
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,060
and animals like that were shot on sight.

828
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,800
Well, they were taken off the lot actually and shot there.

829
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,260
And used.

830
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:07,840
For?

831
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,380
For leather and Chinese aphrodisiacs and other things.

832
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:12,740
Ah, yes.

833
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,840
Nogatucks.

834
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,120
And french fry, amongst other things,

835
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,420
for use in the baby bread.

836
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,840
We're the Monster Squad.

837
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,620
Monster Squad.

838
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,560
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta work a year, work a year

839
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,820
Every hundred years in the darkest night

840
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,120
The forces of evil come out to fight

841
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,360
The amulets they must destroy

842
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,880
Are spent forever in the darkest void

843
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,020
Who can stop that deadly might?

844
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,260
Who will stand up for the right?

845
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,840
From the mouth of babes comes dynamite

846
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,720
The Monster Squad's gonna goon tonight

847
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,260
First came Dracula, now the Wolfman too

848
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,380
The mummy and the gil was living in the pool

849
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,700
We need silver bullets, we need wooden sticks

850
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,980
Normal stuff won't stop them cause they live on hate

851
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,220
Speak some magic words from a virgin's lips

852
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,540
Baby that'll shake them, make them slip and drip

853
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,840
There's no turning back, gotta fight the fight

854
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,080
Yeah, the Monster Squad's gonna jam tonight

855
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,960
Monster Squad

856
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,780
We're the Monster Squad

857
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,060
And the forces of evil

858
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,700
That are running hot

859
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,080
Monster Squad

860
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,880
We're the Monster Squad

861
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,260
And the forces of evil

862
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:31,020
Best beware of the Monster Squad

863
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,100
Monster Squad

864
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,780
Monster Squad

865
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,100
Monster Squad

866
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,980
Monster Squad

867
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,100
Awesome.

868
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:48,140
Great Bull Dada movies of the past have provided us with so much food for thought.

869
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,660
I remember I was a Sackwheel Mountain vesicle for the Harpoon of Bob.

870
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,680
Remember, that one was 1958, I think was about the same period.

871
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,420
Wow.

872
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:06,080
Well, if you didn't have the imprint of a Major Studio, you'd often be reduced to the last billing at the Grindhouse

873
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,520
or at some hideously little house.

874
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:14,100
rural drive-in. And even cool monster movies that we revere as classics often appeared

875
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:21,860
as the last bill at the Apache drive-in out in Tucson, Arizona's suburbs.

876
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,920
Really, really. Obstrusive.

877
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,500
With other movies ahead of it like Satan's Slaves, Hell's Angels 69.

878
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,760
The Vestigial Epiglottas.

879
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,860
The Bubble.

880
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:37,260
The Bubble and a Halfer. There were so many strangely named. And yet

881
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:41,060
appropriately named B or Psychotronic films at the time.

882
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:51,020
But a truly subgenius monster movie. Of course, that is a tautology. All subgenius

883
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:59,440
movies, I mean all monster movies must partake of the subgenius essence in order to be successful.

884
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,100
But they're all totalitarian films, my friend.

885
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:03,940
Some of them are.

886
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,200
Some of them...

887
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,640
Some...

888
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,960
...yearn for somebody.

889
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,240
...to take control.

890
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:08,600
Yes.

891
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,020
And stop this out of control horror that threatens to go on and on.

892
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,520
Some bootlicking.

893
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:13,800
Some boot snapping.

894
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,280
And so you have fascist figures like Marshall Thompson in Fiend Without a Face.

895
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:18,700
Of course.

896
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,080
Running through the woods to blow up the atomic reactor. A typical muddle-headed

897
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:32,120
solution to stop the invasion of hopping, flopping brains and spinal cords. That was

898
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,860
actually a more unusual monster than others.

899
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:41,840
But I was thinking of the old film Mad Love. Not anything having to do with Drew Barrymore,

900
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,200
but the Peter Lorre version.

901
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,620
The hand. I remembered the hand.

902
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,780
That's what you were talking about.

903
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,000
That was a damn good one. That's where another one of these severed hand movies.

904
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:59,440
I'm not talking about Mad Love, but I think that's called The Beast with Five Fingers.

905
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,560
Someone who was...

906
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,840
Something was done wrong to his hand.

907
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:04,840


908
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:09,320
The hand was severed and wouldn't you know it, it's running around the house bedeviling

909
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,680
Popeye Peter Lorre. It's even getting on the piano and playing a movement for the left

910
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,900
hand, which is rather skillful of it.

911
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:23,760
What was odd was the couscous dish was portrayed by Barely Mandrill, who was barely

912
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,100
a human at the time and had been regrown. And they had to fire him. That's one of the

913
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,800
little inside things that happened.

914
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,000
There.

915
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,820
Then later on...

916
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:34,820


917
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,440
Then later on in the severed hand genre, closer to our own time, there was Michael

918
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,740
Kane's recent film.

919
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,240
Uh-oh.

920
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:40,960
What?

921
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:41,700


922
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,180
Michael Kane's recent film, My Bloody Hand.

923
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,560
My Bloody Hand.

924
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,540
Hello. Hello. Hello.

925
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,760
He's so a monster, hell.

926
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,700
Bad times rolling around.

927
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,340
It's a prehistoric thing.

928
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:00,060
It's a prehistoric monster. It came from outer space. Created by the Marshalls to destroy

929
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:00,740
the human race.

930
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,660
The FBI is helpless. It's 20 stories tall. What can they do?

931
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:04,820
It's a monster.

932
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:04,820


933
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:04,820


934
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:04,820


935
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:04,820


936
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:04,820


937
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:04,820


938
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:04,820


939
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:04,820


940
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:04,820


941
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:04,820


942
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,620
Whom can they call?

943
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:10,500
If we can rent that thing that drills to the center of the earth, I would rather do that.

944
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,940
Well, everyone like to go down there because big monster.

945
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,240
Big monster in earth.

946
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,440
Well, I understand there's some large Dimetrodons and some big mushrooms.

947
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,820
We need rocks. Eat to fire.

948
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,800
Yeah, I know. I know.

949
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,260
Oh, thanks, Kenny.

950
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,460
Well, they live in the magma of underground.

951
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:30,680
They do swim unharmed through the magma of the underground. An astonishing thing for

952
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,340
any being. But these large Pelicasauras can do it.

953
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:38,620
And I understand the thing as viewport so you can take pictures if you bring your camera.

954
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:45,340
A pipe of more than titanic size, furlongs in length, jotted from the rictus of the terrifyingly

955
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:52,200
huge mouth, whose lips were skinned back from the form of white teeth, set too close together

956
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:59,100
to be fastened upon the pipe in any comprehensible way. Under the nightmare of that mindless

957
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:03,520
but all-encompassing gaze, the two quaked in cosmic fear.

958
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:11,340
Clutching each other and begging each other to kill each other. Soon their knees smote

959
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:19,100
together in fear. But the hideous face swelled and seemed to fill the entire sky. Then the

960
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:23,280
whole field of vision saw that nothing else could be seen.

961
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,560
Come, you heavy laden, to the feast of the sauropods.

962
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,740
Everybody thinks brontosaurus was such a patsy.

963
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,600
Why that thing was as vicious as can be.

964
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,960
Didn't anyone ever see King Kong?

965
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,880
People say because it was a vegetarian it was peaceful.

966
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:48,540
Ha! A rhinoceros is a vegetarian. The Cape buffalo, the most dangerous animal on earth.

967
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,160
Look at what it's doing!

968
00:47:53,060 --> 00:48:01,540
The brontosaurus was good. But the tyranosaurus lex was bad.

969
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,180
Because it ate meat.

970
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:03,900
Get out of the way!

971
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,440
Watch out!

972
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:14,800
The stegosaurus was bad because it ate meat.

973
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:23,480
No, you're wrong, Timmy. The stegosaurus did not eat meat. And not only that, it was not bad.

974
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,720
It was a creature of radiant angelic goodness.

975
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:31,500
Such as we evil fallen beings in the post-adamant world.

976
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,120
The cosmic world cannot possibly comprehend or understand.

977
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,880
I was talking about the bonfire.

978
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:44,460
Now friends, if you possibly can, not only attend when the bonfire gets lit and everybody starts dancing around it, that's all amazing.

979
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,880
But for me, what Starwood's really all about is the next morning when the sun rises.

980
00:48:51,280 --> 00:49:01,140
And the few, the strong, the brave, the brain damaged are out there shuffling around that bonfire.

981
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:07,540
The pile of ash and the fitful last string drummers are banging away.

982
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:13,860
That's really, that's, I missed it last year because I wore the wrong shoes.

983
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,960
My feet hurt so much I had to go to bed.

984
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,200
Don't be like me!

985
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,120
Throw those shoes off!

986
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,320
And, well, no, actually, whatever.

987
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,420
Do whatever you need to.

988
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,060
But I had an idea about that bonfire.

989
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,120
What if next year, instead of the woodbusters building it in the fire,

990
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,920
in the magnificent pyramid style that they've done, the ones here and at Sirius,

991
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:42,020
what if it looked like one of those old castles in a Frankenstein movie?

992
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,660
And we'd get to be the villagers with the torches!

993
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,660
Haven't you ever wanted to do that?

994
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:57,580
Actually, I always wanted to be the monster on top of the thing throwing boulders onto the villagers with the torches

995
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,920
or, you know, the hunchback pouring the lava down on them and stuff.

996
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,140
But only the woodbusters get to do that.

997
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,200
These are not wax dummies, incidentally, ladies and gentlemen.

998
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:15,120
These are real suffering souls who paid the full price for refusal to understand the true meaning of female.

999
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,200
You may now open your eyes.

1000
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,580
The UFOs are there.

1001
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,680
This is a recording.

1002
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:24,120
Bob was there to watch each dropping of each coprolite from each dinosaur sphincter.

1003
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:24,980
Bob saw.

1004
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,660
Bob sees now.

1005
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,440
Bob always will see.

1006
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,100
And if it is not superfluous to do that, then I'm going to do it.

1007
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:57,640
Even more guys will try to do it.

1008
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:58,440
Ehhh....

1009
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:58,700
We're wouldn't say scary.

1010
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:58,720
But I don't see how partnered with a такое, which I wouldn't call sexual harassment at all,

1011
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:58,720


1012
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,340
I mean, our MetaTrad McKay did

1013
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,060
not direct us to sex on that head of a dinosaur.

1014
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,140
Well, first we have to build a pure neutronium.

1015
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,440
And now the neutronium is rolled down to the street level,

1016
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:13,060
where the peasants will begin to eat it and then kiss the queen, giving her the power of the neutronium.

1017
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,700
Yes, this neutronium, the densest substance known in the physical universe,

1018
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,620
is going to be the basis of an entire new review,

1019
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,500
which all of our foreign digitaries, as well as the president and his charming wife,

1020
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,480
will ascend in just 25 short minutes,

1021
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:30,500
as the subgenius floats continue in this parade of parades on the year of surprises.

1022
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,020
Or to a jazz band.

1023
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,340
And here, moving at best in sound,

1024
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,100
What's happening to them?

1025
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,900
a giant transports in a transport of excellence.

1026
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,580
Leave them on.

1027
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,540
Friends, you are listening to Subgenius Radio Ministry,

1028
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,880
the hour of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1029
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,980
For more information about the Church of the Subgenius and all of its monsters,

1030
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:56,140
you can check out subgenius.com on the intranets,

1031
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:00,820
or write to Post Office Box 181-4.

1032
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:08,500
417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1033
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,140
The monster, it sees us. Look, its eyes beginning to open.

1034
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:20,280
Why, this was not in the script. The monster was supposed to stay asleep.

1035
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,780
Oh, Doctor, the monster. How must we get the monster back to sleep?

1036
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,340
I cannot do anything about this. It is too big.

1037
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,040
Oh, look, behind us. It is behind us.

1038
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,660
It must be electronically stimulated.

1039
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,300
Yes.

1040
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,980
Well, and this is the friend of all good boys and girls.

1041
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,640
Well, let's get on the plane to Monster Island.

1042
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,580
Okay, you check the baggage.

1043
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,420
Yes, of course.

1044
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,360
Just stay down.

1045
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,160
Remember the antediluvian markings in China were on theme works.

1046
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:44,740
All right, General.

1047
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,340
In the country of the mind, in the galaxy of the faces,

1048
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:52,320
I would tell you, but the monster, it twisted my arm behind my back

1049
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,520
until I had to give away the secret of theme world.

1050
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,520
Theme world.

1051
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,760
Theme world.

1052
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,380
So that's what it was.

1053
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,220
I was dwelling far off on a planet in space.

1054
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,640
My computer brain reviewed the information that I had up to that time.

1055
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,500
Against the icky blackness.

1056
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,720
And then, you know, I got to go to my dog's house.

1057
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,220
Why am I speaking with Hal's voice?

1058
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:09,880
Theme world.

1059
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,660
Well, put your mouth on the radio.

1060
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,860
I can tell by your voice you don't mean it, boy.

1061
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:19,040
It was said that to have enough um would enable the soul to retain its potent ka.

1062
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,400
And its ka, of course, was what we call ectoplasm.

1063
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,240
They would collect them in the jars of...

1064
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,640
Collectiplasm, we used to call it as kids.

1065
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,960
Yes, this collectiplasm in the canoptic jars.

1066
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,240
We were able to collect it.

1067
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,400
Yeah, we put it in jars and made it live again.

1068
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,860
...for cave lions.

1069
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,260
Pushed it around and stopped it.

1070
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:36,600
Give it to me.

1071
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,460
Now, really, I must go.

1072
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:38,980
Oh, no.

1073
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,260
No, I've taken a liking to you.

1074
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,220
But you promised.

1075
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,180
Oh, no, no, no.

1076
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,760
I'm going to put you up for membership.

1077
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,340
But I'm not a monster.

1078
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,680
Don't say it.

1079
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,100
You're the greatest monster of them all.

1080
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,760
Oh, Mr. Club Secretary.

1081
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:57,960
I want to propose my friend here as a member of this August assembly.

1082
00:53:59,140 --> 00:53:59,580
What?

1083
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:00,840
He's a...

1084
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,380
He's a...

1085
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:03,080
He's a...

1086
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:03,460
Hume!

1087
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:04,980
Yes.

1088
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,640
But can we truly call this a monster club?

1089
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,400
If we do not boast amongst our membership a single member of the human race?

1090
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:13,860
Nonsense!

1091
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,380
What can he do?

1092
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,580
What can he do?

1093
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:28,140
In the past 60 years, Humes have exterminated over 150 million of their own kind.

1094
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,720
No effort has been spared to reach this astronomical figure.

1095
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,160
And the methods that they have used must demand our unstinted admiration.

1096
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,480
You know, Humes began with certain very serious disadvantages.

1097
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,000
But these they overcame with wonderful ingenuity.

1098
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:51,220
Not having a fang or a claw or even a whistle worth talking about.

1099
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:58,020
They invented guns and tanks and bombs and airplanes and extermination camps.

1100
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:05,720
And poison gas and daggers and swords and bayonets and booby traps and atomic bombs and flying missiles.

1101
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,980
Submarines, warships, aircraft carriers and motor cars.

1102
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:20,200
They have even perfected a process whereby they can spread a lethal disease on any part of this planet.

1103
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,280
Not to say anything about nuclear power.

1104
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,380
Oh, during their short history, you know.

1105
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,560
Humes have subjected...

1106
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:42,060
They have subjected other Humes to death by burning, hanging, decapitation, strangulation, electrocution, shooting, drowning, crushing, wracking, disemboweling.

1107
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:49,880
And other methods far, far too revolting for the delicate stomachs of this August Ascendant.

1108
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:54,860
I never realized he was so talented.

1109
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,960
We don't like to boast.

1110
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,120
I swear.

1111
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,160
I'm not going to sit on the proposal.

1112
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:09,020
A member of such a talented race can only be a credit to any monster club.

1113
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:21,180
Maestro, to celebrate the installation of a new member, may we hear our song.

1114
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:26,100
And those of you who are not prepared or aware must take the golden vow now.

1115
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:30,720
You will fight for something holy, whatever that might be.

1116
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,580
Well, I kind of agree with Reverend Stang that the world is a monster club.

1117
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,080
The World is a Monster Club

1118
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,380
Baby, I thought I saw a vampire

1119
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,140
Climbing through my window last night.

1120
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,740
Crazy, I thought I saw a werewolf

1121
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,260
Drinking from my toilet last night.

1122
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,620
Baby, I know I'm medicated

1123
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,200
But I know things are gonna be alright.

1124
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,420
Crazy, I called 911

1125
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:26,320
Had some cereal and I cried.

1126
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,740
This world is a monster club

1127
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,820
And you must beware

1128
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,140
There's plenty of crazy things

1129
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,020
Terror and love are still.

1130
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,420
They're all monsters.

1131
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,100
Baby, I thought I saw a mummy

1132
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,920
Crawling on my tummy and inside.

1133
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,040
You're crazy.

1134
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,940
It might be in my head but baby

1135
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,700
I don't wanna wind up dead.

1136
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:15,000
Baby, I swear I saw a werewolf

1137
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,480
Drinking from my toilet last night.

1138
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:22,060
Crazy, I know I saw a baby.

1139
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,960
Hold my head, I'm gonna be alright.

1140
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,000
This world is a monster club

1141
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,920
And you must beware

1142
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,520
There's plenty of crazy things

1143
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,320
Terror and love are still.

1144
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:04,260
Baby, I know I saw a mummy

1145
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:04,280
Crawling on my tummy and inside.

1146
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:04,280


1147
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,240
This world is a monster club

1148
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,340
And you must beware

1149
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:11,760
There's plenty of crazy things

1150
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,760
Terror and love are still.

1151
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,240
Baby, I saw a mummy

1152
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,800
Crawling on my tummy and inside.

1153
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,240
You're crazy.

1154
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:19,240


1155
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:19,880
And you must beware

1156
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,040
There's plenty of crazy things

1157
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:23,720
Terror and love are still.

1158
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,640
There's no tomorrow, no safe out the bell

1159
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,720
There's no place to run

1160
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,760
Nowhere to hide

1161
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,940
Now it's time to see what you got inside

1162
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,460
Though evil will escape by sight

1163
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,500
Yeah, the monster squad's got a gamble now

1164
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,760
This ain't Halloween or some phony deal

1165
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,920
They be playing for keeps

1166
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,120
They be playing for real

1167
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,380
There's darkness spread all across the land

1168
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,640
We're the only ones left to make a stand

1169
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,900
We don't wanna hide with the walking dead

1170
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,060
So we gotta kick some monster butt instead

1171
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,540
And you'll never see such a ghastly sight

1172
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,020
When the monster squad's in peace.

1173
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:52,720
It's a war tonight.

1174
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,720
March to the fight.

1175
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,120
We're the monster.

1176
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,840
And the force of the people.

1177
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:01,060
Better run or be late.

1178
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,480
Mob.
