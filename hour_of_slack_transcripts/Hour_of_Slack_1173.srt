1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,600
What? What?

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,180
It's dear.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,100
I'd say you were going mad.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:10,700
Yes.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,240
The door was open in the vestibule.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,680
I closed it, leaving the stairs beyond in darkness.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,100
Then they know it's time to sleep.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,160
And they sleep.

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,920
The Self-Genius Power of Life.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,400
Oh, isn't that terrible?

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,580
Why?

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,820
You see, we found dress to drool in the book.

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,340
Huh?

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,260
What was funny about it is that the bitch made 12 glam books.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,880
That is funny.

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,500
Doesn't make any sense.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,660
Unless you've seen the end of the Atlantic, I guess.

18
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,640
All right.

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,080
That's right.

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,080


21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,720
Please don't go away from me.

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,880
Get out of my way.

23
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,040
I've got to go to the bathroom.

24
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,060
Oh, no.

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,780
Yes.

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Hey, Rob.

27
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,540
Be sexy.

28
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,900
I'm sober.

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,000
Sleep change.

30
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,920
Get dizzy.

31
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,100
Hey, Rob.

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,220
Hey, Rob.

33
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,400
Get dizzy.

34
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,420
Be sexy.

35
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,740
I'm sober.

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,900
Sleep change.

37
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,940
I'll give a rub.

38
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,040
Be sexy.

39
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,180
Friends, as Michael Pilmer has said over and over again,

40
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:35,140
what happens at Devotional 2008 stays at Devotional 2008.

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,800
And then another funny thing happened followed by two things that were pretty amusing.

42
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,740
And the whole thing ended with something that was just hysterical.

43
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,060
I'm gonna show you something.

44
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,060
I'm gonna show you something.

45
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,060


46
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,060


47
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,080
I'm gonna show you something.

48
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,760
My name is Rob.

49
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,260
If I'm gonna get one more extra exec, are you willing?

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,100
I'm gonna get another one already.

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,120


52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,220
Oh, that's out of my mind.

53
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,100
Exciting.

54
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,100


55
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,920
Go, go, go, go.

56
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,740
We'll see what I do.

57
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,020
Faster, faster.

58
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,040
Oh, really stepped on my foot.

59
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,040


60
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:24,500
When repeated over and over and over, nobody can catch up.

61
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,440
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

62
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,400
Whoop-dee-doop-dee-doo

63
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,580
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

64
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,220
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid

65
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,360
Whoop-dee-doop-dee-doo

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
Only three feet tall

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
Those aren't the words, that's something else

68
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,460
Anyway, so Bo's a Mongoloid

69
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,240
And he had a regular job

70
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,860
Went to work every goddamn day

71
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,600
And he brought him the bacon

72
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,100
And he worked hard for a living

73
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,720
His head was horribly disfigured

74
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,040
People would say, he don't look right

75
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,200
But I don't want to get sued or nothing

76
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,940
So I'm not gonna

77
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,560
I was gonna, you know, bushy him

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,540
I was gonna throw him in the bush

79
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,280
We got stick-a-bushies at work, you know

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,940
And I like to push people around

81
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,000
I like to beat up people that I think

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,060
You know, I could beat up

83
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,240
You know, I'm only, you know, five foot three

84
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,140
But, you know, once in a while

85
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,840
I see a guy, I can kick his ass

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,900
Anyway, there was this Mongoloid

87
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,300
And I thought, well, actually, you know, beat my ass

88
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,580
But I took a swing

89
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,380
I did, I tried to take his lunch

90
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,000
I got arrested, but

91
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,720
Yeah, he was a total Mongoloid

92
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,440
You could just tell

93
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,200
Because, you know, his head was great big, you know

94
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,700
And anyway, he worked there at the place

95
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,180
And, yeah, I mean, you know

96
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,320
I got fired

97
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,140
But I kept showing up for work

98
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,200
Because, you know, I work for a living

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,400
Not really, but, you know, I tell people that

100
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,740
And it's great, you know, I go there

101
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,000
And if I see somebody that's, you know, like a kid or something

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,980
You know, I can push him down

103
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,120
I try to take his lunch money or something

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,860
You know, like that

105
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,220
I got beat up by an 11-year-old

106
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,500
One time

107
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,120
I try to stay under 11 years of age

108
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,000
When I assault people these days

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,840
You know, you never know

110
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,400
I got beat up by

111
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,220
I was trying to rob an old lady of the crutches

112
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,560
I was very severely injured after that

113
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,340
You gotta be careful

114
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,100
You don't know

115
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,300
You don't know whose background these people are

116
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,080
But anyway, this Mongoloid

117
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,780
He was a Mongoloid

118
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,800
Yeah, he, you know, he showed up early

119
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,700
Went to home late

120
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,600
He was a great guy

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,960
But look at his big head

122
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,660
He's a Mongoloid, man

123
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,560
Anyway, I was gonna kill him

124
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,000
He could dance

125
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,200
But anyway, that's pretty much what happened

126
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,520
What else happened?

127
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,280
He was a Mongoloid

128
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Did I mention that earlier?

129
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,160
He was a total Mongoloid

130
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,700
Oh, he looked kind of

131
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,720
I went there with him

132
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,780
It's like, supposed to look Chinese looking or something

133
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,580
I don't know what that's supposed to be

134
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,920
And it was weird

135
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,600
Like, he didn't look

136
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,200
No, he wasn't

137
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,360
He wasn't normal like me

138
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,020
You know, I'm a regular guy

139
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,720
And he's got a big head

140
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,560
So I'm like, I'm gonna kill him

141
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:53,560


142
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:53,560


143
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:53,560


144
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
I took a swing at him

145
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,560
And he grabs my fist

146
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,200
And wrenches it behind my back

147
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,160
And jacks my arm up

148
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,600
And I'm screaming in pain back there

149
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,440
And he says, why'd you take a swing at me?

150
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,620
I said, because you got a big head

151
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,540
And he jacks my arm up

152
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,420
And damn, just snaps it off at the elbow

153
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,840
And I'm at the crying

154
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
And he pushes me down behind the bush

155
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,120
And goes to work

156
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,180
And then I start planning, you know

157
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,300
To do bad things to him at his home

158
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,320
So I go to his house

159
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,700
You know, and I break in

160
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,540
I see his wife there

161
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,440
And she beats me over the head with a broom handle

162
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,980
And I'm bleeding, they're bleeding

163
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,480
That they dragged me off into the driveway

164
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:23,560
And I'm like, what?

165
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,560


166
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,560


167
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,060
And I crawl back

168
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,900
I crawl back to the Motel 6

169
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,560
Because that's where I got a room

170
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,340
And, oh man, I swear if I got it

171
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,360
If I see another mongoloid

172
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,580
I don't know

173
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,740
I'd probably leave him alone this time, frankly

174
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,200
I've seen, I've had enough of that

175
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,960
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid

176
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

177
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

178
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,860
Oh!

179
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,580
He was a mongoloid

180
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,360
He was a mongoloid

181
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,980
He was a mongoloid

182
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,160
He was a mongoloid

183
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,660
Angeloid

184
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,800
He's a mongoloid

185
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,400
ad��를

186
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,400


187
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,320
He's a mongoloid

188
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

189
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,300
He was a mongoloid

190
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,560
And I say he was a mongoloid

191
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,000
What do you mean?

192
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,940
I knew that.

193
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,400
Shut up.

194
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,960
Shut up.

195
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,060
That's not funny and don't do it again.

196
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,620
He's a mongoloid.

197
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,360
Mongoloid.

198
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,720
Mongoloid.

199
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,860
Damn, that was turned on, was it?

200
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,100
A New Mexico woman was named final arbiter of taste and justice today,

201
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,780
ending God's lengthy search for someone to straighten this country out.

202
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,220
Eileen Harriet Paul Glace will have final say on every known subject,

203
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,100
including who should be put to death, what clothes everyone should wear,

204
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,340
what movies suck, and whether bald men who grow ponytails should still,

205
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:53,900
get laid.

206
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,180
I vote yes to that one, friends.

207
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,480
Clips from the 1996 movie Schizopolis,

208
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,660
the sandwiched version of Devo's Mongoloid by Johnny Future

209
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,160
at myspace.com slash future7.

210
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,000
We murdered the intros and this is our Slack number 1173,

211
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,180
our annual devotional report.

212
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,300
The 2008 devotional was held last August and on,

213
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,020
uh, John Hell's show.

214
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,060
Last December, we held fourth with Reverend Mongoloid

215
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,920
and puzzling evidence about the Mongoloid-a-palooza in San Francisco.

216
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,960
I ranted at both places, uh, both years,

217
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,680
and, uh, all the music in this show,

218
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,000
save one piece, is from this year's Devo cover compilation album,

219
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,220
not necessarily beautiful, but mutated.

220
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,720
Uh, stay tuned for the address for that.

221
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,260
But now, back to the devotional of Zero,

222
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,200
Zero 8 in Cleveland, Ohio.

223
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,940
The point is, friends, Devo is, well, they're not ageless.

224
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,840
Only Bob 3 is ageless.

225
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,300
But they are immortal!

226
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,460
Devo cannot die!

227
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,000
Because it's not just a band, it is, in fact, a philosophy.

228
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,660
And for some people here, it's probably a religion.

229
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,900
I, I, it certainly is for me.

230
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,860
It's one of my religions.

231
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,760
I certainly worship at the Temple of Devo, as they call it.

232
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:28,360
.

233
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:28,880


234
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,400
.

235
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,400


236
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,400


237
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,660

238
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,240

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,460

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:07,660

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:07,660

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:07,720

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:07,720


292
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:10,980
.

293
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,800
Thank you.

294
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,180
Thank you.

295
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,760
Thank you.

296
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,660
Thank you.

297
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,400
Thank you.

298
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,780
Thank you.

299
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,280
Thank you.

300
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,060
Thank you.

301
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,840
Thank you.

302
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,000
missed their calling being

303
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,980
television comedy, doing

304
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,500
a television comedy show.

305
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,120
I honestly have always thought that

306
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,200
the personalities in that

307
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,900
band should be doing improvised

308
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,820
TV comedy.

309
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,020
But they wanted to be rock stars.

310
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,400
I guess there's more girls that way.

311
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,640
Televangelism maybe?

312
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,800
Another interesting

313
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,940
story was my friend

314
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,920
should I say who?

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,980
No, I think not. But someone we know in

316
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,920
Madison, Wisconsin, when she was

317
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,740
a young lady, was

318
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,860
on the front row of the Devo concert

319
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,900
and Mark jumped

320
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,660
down off the stage while singing

321
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,140
Girl You Want

322
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,720
and started doing some

323
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,060
heavy petting with my friend

324
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,580
on the front row.

325
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,120
Such heavy petting

326
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,160
that he was actually

327
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,860
inserting body parts

328
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,480
into body parts

329
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,940
sort of underhandedly, shall we

330
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,840
say. You know, I'm just not

331
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,880
fully recreating

332
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,600
the Devo concert. I gotta work harder.

333
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,200
Well, I'm letting you know this.

334
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,900
Next time when you run through the audience, you stop

335
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,800
and do this part.

336
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,060
The prankster

337
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,640
aspect of that band

338
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,840
has always been a really big

339
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,620
part of it.

340
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,420
The whole thing is

341
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,420
a gigantic prank, really.

342
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,380
It is.

343
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,260
That's why I worship at the Temple of Devo.

344
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,140
I'm an unabashed

345
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,360
absolute old

346
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,880
school Devo fan.

347
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,480
And even though I've

348
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,960
seen them at their worst in the middle

349
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,660
of music video productions when

350
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,700
everybody had been awake too long

351
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,780
and cold, wasn't getting paid

352
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,480
enough, there was terrible pressure

353
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,820
and still I remain

354
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,720
the same ardent fan

355
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,660
that I was the first time I saw.

356
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,880
Got a message from

357
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,940
my honey

358
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,000
Got a message from my girl

359
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,740
Wants you to

360
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,300
help me

361
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,900
and roll me a

362
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,300
scribble

363
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,860
I know

364
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,500
I said you'd be coming back

365
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:08,820
And I said you'd be coming back

366
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,500
To see me, that she would give me some to be also

367
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,960
Gonna get up from the low, I did you know

368
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,100
And leave this cold wild world

369
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:36,080
Oh, I ain't got a love that's free

370
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,100
Just like the old accident

371
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,880
Now baby, look at me

372
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,660
It's all here to be

373
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,300
Let's try to open her up a little

374
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,440
I'm coming with the trouble

375
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,080
Let the sound of the horn on her head to be

376
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,420
Give me a little supper

377
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,840
Oh, oh, oh

378
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,100
Oh, oh, oh

379
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,060
Oh, oh, oh

380
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,140
Oh, oh, oh

381
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,020
Oh, oh, oh

382
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,300
Oh, come on now

383
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,340
Got a surprise from my honey

384
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,920
I got a message from my girl

385
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,260
Let's just pick up a pen

386
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,060
From the old accident

387
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,060


388
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:42,100
beside her bed, and she wrote me a scribbled note, said she'd be coming back to see me,

389
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:51,340
and she'd be visiting me real soon. She was gonna get up from the low, white bed, and

390
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:59,880
leave this cold, white room. I saw her sweet face trembling, as she tried to open her eyes.

391
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,440
I jumped with the joy of a grateful thought, this game of baby gave me a surprise today.

392
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:55,180
My baby gave me a surprise, covered by PuffTube, and you can find them at myspace.com

393
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,860
slash puff tube, taken from Reverend Toth Whitehouse.

394
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,180
While there's not necessarily beautiful, but mutated CD.

395
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:10,460
Meanwhile, puzzling evidence, reminisces about live Devo concerts of your and today.

396
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,060
And I kept thinking, man, those guys must lose five pounds a show.

397
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,220
When they did, they came out and did the yellow, yellow, uh, Devo's?

398
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,940
They came out at the break and did that thing.

399
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,660
It's a great effect, but you pay for it.

400
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,740
Yeah, exactly, because I knew how much work, and they were sweating like monkeys.

401
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,400
Those guys all weighed 90 pounds.

402
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,980
And we know why.

403
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,580
In those days, yeah.

404
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,800
Well, yeah, in those days, they were moving fast.

405
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,240
Well, I've noticed when they perform now, they play it just as fast as they used to,

406
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,680
but they only bounce up and down every other beat.

407
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,420
They're all pushing 60.

408
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:45,800
Yep.

409
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,260
And look like prosperous businessmen, most of them.

410
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,840
Those were, those were the days.

411
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,240
And then we went to see them in Dallas, and they, see them when they had the, uh,

412
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,820
it was the Gates of Steel Tour, I think, where they had the big, um,

413
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,480
big set.

414
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,540
They had that booth.

415
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,720
It would break.

416
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,240
That was the big, really impressive.

417
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,300
Bob Mothers Bar is still wiring.

418
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,480
The rest of those guys look like they've been eating at Spago's frequently,

419
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,520
in between movies, store, and jobs.

420
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,580
The password is, Bob and I are the same age.

421
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,920
If any of you feel the pressure down there.

422
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,340
Uh, no.

423
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,440
They don't, they don't need to, but they still need to call.

424
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,380
The devotionals in Dallas.

425
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,500
And Ohio are a kind of a holiday for the, the Ohio.

426
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,820
So Jesus and the devotees and so forth.

427
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,500
Every August?

428
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,000
Uh, yeah, it's not the same weekend every, but it's been almost every August.

429
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,300
Right after, uh, X day and Starwood for the pagans.

430
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,200
Then you go to the devotional.

431
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:55,200
It's a string of insane holidays there in beautiful Ohio.

432
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,620
The Rust Belt friends.

433
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,640
Very true.

434
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,880
I'm going to go down.

435
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,340
Down, down, down.

436
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,820
Nobody's in the street.

437
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,360
I'm going to go down.

438
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,460
Down, down.

439
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,280
Nobody's in the street.

440
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,740
I'm going to go down.

441
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,980
Down, down, down.

442
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,820
Nobody's got to be loose.

443
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,200
I'm going to go down.

444
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,360
Down, down.

445
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,960
Nobody's in the street.

446
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,700
That's a hit moon in a 55-dollar moon.

447
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,280
It didn't mean to do that.

448
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,220
But a sidewalk wanted to do this.

449
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,260
Such a good one.

450
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,640
He had to lose it.

451
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,460
Yeah.

452
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,960
Yeah.

453
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,460
Yeah.

454
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,740
Yeah.

455
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,060
Yeah.

456
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:58,860
Yeah.

457
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,260
Yeah.

458
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,280
Yeah.

459
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,280


460
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,720
Yeah.

461
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:09,720


462
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,280
Yeah.

463
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah.

464
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,020
Yeah.

465
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,500
Yeah.

466
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:21,680
Yeah.

467
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:21,680


468
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:21,680


469
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,060
Hmmm..

470
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,500
Yeah.

471
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:22,500


472
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:22,520
Yeah.

473
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,080
Yeah, yeah.

474
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,080


475
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,080


476
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,080


477
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,080


478
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,080


479
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,080


480
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,780
Yeah it's here!

481
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:23,780


482
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:23,800
Hmm..

483
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,360
And that's a hit moon in a 55 car.

484
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:28,900
Yeah, that's a hit moon in a 55 car.

485
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:28,940
Yeah, yeah.

486
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:28,960
Yeah, that's a hit moon in a 55 car.

487
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,260
The heavy haul.

488
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,880
Thank you.

489
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,620
Thank you.

490
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,940
World War Room did Auto-Modown

491
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,300
with the great Saint Byron Werner on vocals.

492
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,880
Just amazing there, friends.

493
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,220
You know, we love Rural War Room,

494
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,100
and you can too via myspace.com

495
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,920
slash Rural War Room Records.

496
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,860
And now, back to a season in hell

497
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,120
on Pirate Cat Radio with Dr. Howell.

498
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,760
But Bob also said...

499
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,340
That music in the background is by Mark Mothersbaugh.

500
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,740
Believe me out of it.

501
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,860
That's a little...

502
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,460
He's called the Babacato.

503
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,740
It's done on his Fairlight scene part, I think, one time.

504
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,060
Yes, it's an old one.

505
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,240
A venerable one.

506
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,300
I made a little music video of it.

507
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,120
Well, just some animation to go with it.

508
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,680
All right.

509
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,640
Can you make it full screen?

510
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,060
Be seen?

511
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,940
Yeah, actually, the shot that we're looking at in the studio

512
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,900
now has...

513
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,860
Untold billions of Dobbs heads in it.

514
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,120
It's a psychedelic pattern that is composed of

515
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,760
nothing but Dobbs heads

516
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,380
worked by the computer.

517
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,500
That took a little while.

518
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,940
Well, the rendering takes a long time.

519
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,240
The actual animation is surprisingly fast.

520
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,480
We used telepathy.

521
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,400
Really, too.

522
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,260
Manipulate the images, but then you...

523
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,940
Saves time.

524
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,700
Yeah.

525
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,560
But like I say, the rendering takes a while.

526
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,920
That's the expensive part.

527
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,560
Damn, Premiere.

528
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,720
I use a program called Artmatic.

529
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm not kidding.

530
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,880
It's really...

531
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,160
Artmatic?

532
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,100
It's Macintosh only, though.

533
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,660
Anyway, friends, now it is up to us,

534
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,560
or rather you,

535
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,280
to carry on that tradition of making up

536
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,880
new replacement traditions.

537
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,360
New improved traditions.

538
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,640
I can't tell you what those might be

539
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,840
because I'm old and I've already done

540
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,280
my new improved tradition.

541
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,120
But the young must replace the old, my friends.

542
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,700
And that would be true even if science and medicine

543
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,420
somehow manage to defeat the aging process.

544
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,100
And here's why.

545
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,220
Even if you could live forever, you really wouldn't want to

546
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:40,300
because the old can't bear to see the increasing stupidity

547
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,320
of humanity.

548
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,080
And that's another reason that Devo cannot die

549
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,780
because they are predicated on the fact of the world

550
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,920
getting dumber.

551
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,280
And that ain't gonna stop, judging by the newspaper.

552
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,400
I'm not kidding.

553
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,820
And the TV and the radio and everything else.

554
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,600
A de-evolutionist is certainly real.

555
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,440
Nobody reads books anymore.

556
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,860
Internet thoughts are only one sentence long.

557
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,520
And that sentence is always missed better.

558
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,240
I don't mean to be a junior high English teacher about it,

559
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,780
but as friends, as you age, you get both dumber and smarter.

560
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,560
Your brain works slower, but you've seen

561
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,720
a lot.

562
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,900
You've seen the same...

563
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,680
It's painful.

564
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,580
It's painful to see the same mistakes being repeated and worsened.

565
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,720
Most people, as the great sage Nemzlow said,

566
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,640
most people don't make the same mistake twice.

567
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,680
They make the same mistake thousands of times!

568
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,340
And I have this younger friend of mine,

569
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,900
Reverend Nicky Deathchair.

570
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,580
She had...

571
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,540
Actually, her name is...

572
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,440
She got married.

573
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,400
She's Reverend Nicky Deathchair Wild.

574
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,120
She had a power dome in the art show last night.

575
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,500
It was the death metal power dome.

576
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,720
It was black.

577
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,700
It had studs and skulls and spikes all over it.

578
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,480
Anyway, Nicky is 20 years younger than me.

579
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:21,000
And she's gonna live to see 20 years worth more dumbness.

580
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,600
And she can have it, my friends!

581
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
I don't want to...

582
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:35,380
I honestly really don't want to see the world that my grandkids' kid is going to have to

583
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:35,960
deal with.

584
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,520
It'll seem normal to them!

585
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,420
And that's where it all gets kind of weird.

586
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:50,600
When I was very young, in the late 60s, there was a science fiction book by John Bruner.

587
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,580
It was a big award winner called Science Fiction.

588
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:53,580


589
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,800
It was called Stand on Zanzibar.

590
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:04,140
Now, by chance, that book happened to be the sci-fi book that turned out to be hideously accurate.

591
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,240
It was set more or less in these times.

592
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:15,180
And what seemed like a horrible, nightmarish science fiction thing in the 60s just seems like the news now.

593
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,120
I mean, it really is.

594
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,460
If you run through the news, it's about like that horrible...

595
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,580
And that book seems so horrible.

596
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,700
It was horrible in the 60s, and now it seems normal.

597
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,280
We got used to it.

598
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,140
And I don't want to have to see what my great grandkids consider normal.

599
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,380
I don't want to have to hear about the last mountain gorilla dying in some zoo.

600
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:19,160
I don't want to go back kind of into an old cloves-of-the-mill sales minds Claudio,

601
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,620
suddenly trying so hard to get out publicij it's on one.

602
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,840
I'm a two plus two equals four man.

603
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,380
I'm a mechanical man.

604
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,960
I'm a mechanical man.

605
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,540
I'm a mechanical man.

606
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm a mechanical man.

607
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,880
I'm a mechanical man.

608
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,340
I'm a mechanical man.

609
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,980
Two mechanical arms.

610
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,160
Two mechanical legs.

611
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,820
I'm a two plus two equals four man.

612
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,580
Me feel swell.

613
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,580
Me work well.

614
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,020
Me want what you want.

615
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,180
Me feel swell.

616
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,240
Me work well.

617
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,760
Me want what you got.

618
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,880
Me feel swell.

619
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,120
Me work well.

620
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,360
Me want what you want.

621
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,960
Me feel swell.

622
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,020
Me work well.

623
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,140
Me want what you got.

624
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,600
He feels well.

625
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,520
He feel feeling well, me feel arrive.

626
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,240
I love me feel swell.

627
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,240


628
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,240


629
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,400
Me want what you want.

630
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,520
He feels well.

631
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,120
I will feel swell.

632
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,820
I work well.

633
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,900
Be one...

634
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,980
He want what you want.

635
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,360
What you want.

636
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,360
He feel swell.

637
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,100
I work well.

638
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,880
Mechanical Man was created there by Rural War Room,

639
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,680
also found at myspace.com slash ruralwarroomrecords

640
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,620
with Byron Warner and Donovan Soot.

641
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,660
And now, back to the devotional.

642
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,260
Obviously, the fact that you're here,

643
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,520
you know, you can handle new things.

644
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,540
Look at the band that just played.

645
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,600
They took those old Devo tunes and twisted them,

646
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,540
changed them and made different,

647
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,280
completely new things out of them.

648
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,880
Same tune, but yet it's a completely different tune.

649
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,360
Weird covers and new styles.

650
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,140
And friends, you know, sure,

651
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,300
we're here for an 80s band.

652
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,000
But look how damned weird it continues to be.

653
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,180
That is...

654
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,180
why Devo cannot and must not die,

655
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,120
because it truly is, friends,

656
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,580
duty now for the future.

657
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,780
Praise Bob and praise the Devos.

658
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,120


659
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:58,920


660
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,240
Yeah!

661
00:34:59,500 --> 00:34:59,600
Yeah!

662
00:34:59,600 --> 00:34:59,840
Yeah!

663
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,260
Yeah!

664
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,100
Yeah!

665
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,200
Yeah!

666
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:03,700


667
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,500
Yeah!

668
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,540
Celebrate the golden age

669
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,760
in which we're living

670
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,340
Your opinion counts

671
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,300
and freedom is key

672
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,000
Sadly, this has led to art

673
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
and sport and politics

674
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,700
Being led by people illiquid to breathe

675
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,880
There was a group who could have saved us from this ignominy

676
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,840
There was a group whom they were roundly ignored

677
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,900
They saw the future and they pointed out the problems

678
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,500
If the people took the point we'd now be reaping the rewards

679
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,500
Devo was right about everything

680
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,880
Devo were telling the truth

681
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,920
Devo was right about everything

682
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,880
Devo showed us love

683
00:35:50,880 --> 00:36:02,660
If you have ever raged against conformity

684
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,080
Or hate the way our leaders treat us with scorn

685
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,380
You see society refreshed before your very eyes

686
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,440
Devo was on your side before you were born

687
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,860
Devo was on your side before you were born

688
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,400
Devo was right about everything

689
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,840
Devo had proved the world wrong

690
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,900
Devo was right about everything

691
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,660
Come and see it with us everyone

692
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,240
Devo was right about everything

693
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,480
Devo called it correct

694
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,620
Devo was right about everything

695
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,800
And the such deserve some respect

696
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,740
How many people here tonight believe that De-Evolution is real?

697
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,600
And we just came to remind you

698
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,440
Are we not men?

699
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,000
We are not people

700
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,240
Are we not men?

701
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,060
We are not people

702
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,780
Are we not men?

703
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,800
We are not people

704
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,720
Right then

705
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,520
Devo was right about everything

706
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,960
Devo was never in the wrong

707
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,920
Devo was right about everything

708
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,300
Devo don't care for this song

709
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Because it says we were right about everything

710
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,600
And if that's true then we really all do

711
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,920
So in 30 seconds turn this music up

712
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,040
And go around and do what Devo would do

713
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,100
We're gonna do it for Devo

714
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:54,380
Devo Devo Devo Devo Devo Devo Devo Devo

715
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,740
I know you don't have to look very far for the evidence

716
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,240
Devo was right

717
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,760
Back in the previous century

718
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,000
Back in the 80s

719
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,640
I was in my 20s

720
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,340
I heard that band, the D-Fox.

721
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:21,560
They were talking about how, well, about de-evolution.

722
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:29,200
That humanity was no longer evolving forward, but was actually sliding backwards.

723
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,460
I thought that was real funny, because I was a snide 20-something.

724
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:45,600
Well, now I'm a snide 50-something, and it's not so funny anymore, because it was really true!

725
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,960
People were getting literally dumber!

726
00:38:53,320 --> 00:39:03,680
And the ape side was taking over, but unfortunately it was the pantroglodyte instead of the bonobo side of the ape family that was taking over.

727
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,460
Sampson's

728
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:21,460


729
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:21,460


730
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:21,460


731
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,940
Pretty much everything in the film is more than워서ll is on ASMR now.

732
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:25,940


733
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:25,940


734
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:25,940


735
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:25,940


736
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,700
There's no calculate

737
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:26,700


738
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,800
Everburn

739
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,560
behind these 25 minutes of dependsresense, but they're pretty fucking annoying, but i'm not once more adding this time.

740
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,340
Thank you.

741
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,180
Thank you.

742
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,200
Thank you.

743
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,400
Thank you.

744
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,860
Thank you.

745
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,340
Thank you.

746
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,660
Thank you.

747
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,020
Thank you.

748
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,480
Thank you.

749
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,080
Thank you.

750
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:46,980
Thank you.

751
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,800
Thank you.

752
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,140

Thank you.

770
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:42,080
they even get into Appalachian folk music of the 1920s or in this case of

771
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:49,360
the 2020s and friends I am talking about none other than the Mutant Mountain Boys

772
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,420
and boy are they some boys.

773
00:51:52,940 --> 00:52:01,360
This is an old 1930s era Church of the

774
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:20,000
Subgenius gospel tune from the hills really dedicated to staying and all the

775
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,360
other subgenii out here.

776
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:56,300
Look away from the pigs to that mellowing time,

777
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,480
your life would work and time.

778
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,480
Look away.

779
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,340
There is no time to waste.

780
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,280
There is a hole in your soul that's burning you alive.

781
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,580
Slack will never decay.

782
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:18,060
Look away, look away from the pigs to that mellowing time.

783
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:26,940
Look away, look away from the pigs to that mellowing time.

784
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:45,940
Look away, look away from the pigs to that mellowing time.

785
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:45,940


786
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:45,940


787
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:50,420
The wrongs of abilities get heavy too fast.

788
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,700
You're blind to walk through life so scared.

789
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:59,580
There's a hypnotic man who has begotten a promise.

790
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:00,360
Disembodied.

791
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,830
Somebody had always there.

792
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:11,890
Look away, look away from the pigs to that mellowing time.

793
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:20,890
Look away, look away from the pigs to that mellowing time.

794
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,250
There's a

795
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:44,610
If your conflicts with normals bring struggle and strife,

796
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,130
then onward your

797
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:19,230
good luck.

798
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,810
There's a

799
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:30,810


800
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:30,810


801
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,170
damn Bobbitt

802
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,330
there is hope

803
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,730
and as long as you can feel

804
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:39,390
that

805
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:41,750
I don't know what it is

806
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,430
you say you want a revolution

807
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:44,830
well you know

808
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:48,770
the revolution was televised

809
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:49,910
it did happen

810
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:52,190
it was sponsored by Nike

811
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,970
but that was their revolution

812
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,170
you have your own

813
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:58,790
revolution inside your own

814
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,550
little noggin my friend

815
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,990

816
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:04,850
get up and go to work on

817
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:05,370
Monday

818
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:09,030
I have to go to work on Monday for J.R. Bob

819
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:10,070
Dobbs

820
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,970
I can't quit my job repenting slack off

821
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:13,470
anyway

822
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,950
but you have that freedom

823
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:17,870
you have the freedom my friend

824
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:20,530
to repent of your sinlessness

825
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:22,430
to grab

826
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:24,450
slack by the collar

827
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:26,130
and scream in it's face

828
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,570
and say this is my life

829
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:30,250
and

830
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:34,050
and I will you may make me take that pee test

831
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:38,450
you may make me clock in at 8 30 in the morning

832
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:43,670
but you can never have what's inside my perverted

833
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:44,630
sick

834
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,010
demented head

835
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:51,490
your perversions are your own my friends

836
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:53,030
and praise you for it

837
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,530
hang on to your sickness

838
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,410
hang on to your weirdness

839
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:59,190
hang on to what they call your perversions

840
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,230
because that's all I got to say about that

841
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,390
all that counts

842
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,590
they don't have any of that

843
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,370
they can't have it

844
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:05,870
they can't understand slack

845
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,890
they'd love to take yours away

846
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,810
even though they don't know what it is

847
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:12,150
but you can hang on to it

848
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:13,550
just you know

849
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:18,710

850
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:19,710

01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:02,850
To suck it

949
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,190
Suck it good

950
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:18,890
Grab my dick

951
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:21,850
Give my balls a twist

952
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,930
Tickle my quack

953
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:27,430
Let my hair rest

954
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:28,570
My cock is hot and long

955
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,150
You per second

956
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:34,850
I got a hairy strong

957
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:36,110
You per second

958
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,050
I fuck you like a dog

959
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,210
If you suck it

960
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:41,030
So stick it

961
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,790
In your mouth

962
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,230
Use your tongue

963
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:45,710
Knock your teeth

964
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,230
Pull forward

965
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:48,650
Give me head

966
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,230
Try to ignore it

967
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,590
It's not too late

968
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:52,930
To suck it

969
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,230
Suck it good

970
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,390
I said suck it

971
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:57,930
Suck it good

972
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:00,150
Suck it good

973
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:03,290
And I say suck it

974
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,390
I said suck it

975
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:06,010
Suck it good

976
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,870
I'll suck it

977
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:09,870


978
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,410
Suck it good

979
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:13,630
Suck it good

980
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:14,510
Suck it

981
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:21,590
Suck it good

982
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:25,590
Suck it good

983
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:25,590


984
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:25,710
Suck it good

985
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:25,730
Suck it good

986
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:25,730


987
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:25,730


988
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:25,730


989
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:25,730


990
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:25,730


991
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:26,570
It tastes really good

992
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:27,630
Suck it good

993
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:28,170
Suck it good

994
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:35,390
Suck it

995
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:36,770
Do you like it like that, Daddy?

996
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:37,670
Suck it

997
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:39,330
Yeah, I know you do

998
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:39,890
Suck it

999
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:40,990
Do you want me to suck it?

1000
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:41,470
Suck it

1001
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:43,130
Do you want me to suck it good?

1002
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:43,610
Suck it

1003
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:44,370
Suck it

1004
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:45,790
Oh

1005
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:11,610
The Great Blowfly does whip it

1006
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:13,530
Or actually suck it in this case

1007
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,610
And now, Space Junk

1008
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:18,350
As deformed by Johnny Future

1009
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:23,510
So, Space Junk

1010
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,270
When do you want to start recording the Space Junk song?

1011
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,390
Right now? Okay, we'll do it right now

1012
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:26,730
Yeah

1013
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,070
Space Junk

1014
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:30,530
Space Junk

1015
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:31,310
Space Junk

1016
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:34,570
Space Junk

1017
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:42,090
Space Junk

1018
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:45,230
I got some Space Junk

1019
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:46,190
Hey, check this out

I got some Space Junk

1021
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,230
You like it, don't you?

1022
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:48,730
Yeah

1023
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:49,610
Yeah

1024
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:51,130
I like it

1025
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,810
That's a pretty nice Space Junk

1026
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,630
Yeah, I know I got this

1027
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:54,530
Get off it

1028
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:55,450
Get your hands off it

1029
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:57,070
I got Space Junk

1030
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:57,950
Hey, man

1031
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:58,990
You got some Space Junk

1032
01:02:58,990 --> 01:02:59,950
You damn right I got some

1033
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,110
Space Junk

1034
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:02,410
Hey, man

1035
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:04,150
Watch that shit in my fuckin' yard

1036
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:05,670
That's my Space Junk

1037
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:08,610
Get it the fuck outta my yard, asshole

1038
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:12,110
Specifically don't count the dice

1039
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:12,110


1040
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:12,190
grainy

1041
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:12,810
It is

1042
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:16,070
it is

1043
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:17,090
I'm in the game

1044
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:17,690
it is

1045
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:19,590
me

1046
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:20,950
Space Junk

1047
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,430
Who keeps on감

1048
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:23,210
Would change it

1049
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:24,630
Look back

1050
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:26,770
Space Junk

1051
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:27,250
a odd business

1052
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,830
It's a lot of data to do.

1053
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,590
Bad junk in my yard.

1054
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:35,970
Got some bad junk up in my yard.

1055
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:37,050
You know, actually, somebody thought,

1056
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:38,970
don't want to take on this, so I'll tell you the truth.

1057
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:40,230
I'll make it to you.

1058
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:42,590
It's too true to talk about.

1059
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:48,330
It happened in my yard and in space.

1060
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:51,770
I collect spacesuits for real.

1061
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:54,010
Anyway, some old boy from the news things,

1062
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:56,810
they came over, hey, man, can we look at your spacesuits

1063
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:58,790
and put them on TV and interview you?

1064
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:00,850
And out of context and stuff,

1065
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,770
and just make you look like a fucking lunatic.

1066
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:05,210
Yeah, that sounds great. Come on over.

1067
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:08,050
So anyway, I mentioned it was back when the mirror was crashing,

1068
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,050
and I said, yeah.

1069
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:11,630
Somebody said, are you worried about the mirror crashing

1070
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:12,790
and hitting your house?

1071
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:15,330
Why would anybody be worried about that?

1072
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:16,490
Chances aren't very likely.

1073
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:19,850
So anyway, yeah, I wish it hit my house.

1074
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:20,850
It'd be worth a lot of money.

1075
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:22,910
And they do the news.

1076
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:23,630
Hello.

1077
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:27,130
Oh, man, the hopes this mirror will crash into his yard.

1078
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:30,070
Oh, that's going to look good on the news.

1079
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:34,990
Space junk.

1080
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,690
Space junk.

1081
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:39,970
Space junk.

1082
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,690
Hey, man, you're kissing space junk.

1083
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,590
Oh, it'd be gay.

1084
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:46,050
Fuck off.

1085
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:50,650
Oh, yes, your friends.

1086
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:52,730
Praise the Spud Boy.

1087
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:53,990
Praise.

1088
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:55,370
Praise the devotional.
