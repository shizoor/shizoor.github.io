00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,260
Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again.

19
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:28,240
But you'll be glad to know that we're not going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:35,600
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:53,740
No, except that actually it's not the whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays and holy days and the hole in head days, as it is for some people.

22
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,140
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of selling.

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Selling, yes.

24
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,980
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalog.

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,420
But anyway, happy whatever you do.

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,380
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

27
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,380
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmas and Guitar Axmas.

28
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,820
It's cool, man, cool.

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,380
And praise Bob and her.

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,040
Oh, oh, oh.

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:58,620
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree.

32
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,940
Yeah.

33
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Yeah.

34
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,200
Yeah.

35
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,580
Yeah.

36
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:05,580


37
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:05,580


38
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:05,580


39
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:05,580


40
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:05,580


41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
Oh, no!

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,600
Who put the slump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp?

43
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,240
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?

44
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,160
Who stubbed the wood where I poop-she-poop-she-poop?

45
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,940
Who put the stick up my hip-day-dip-day-dip?

46
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,680
Who was that man?

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,380
He shoved it up my can

48
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,740
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree

49
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,500
When this angel heard

50
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,980
Chop-a-pop-a-pop-a-chop-a-pop-a-pop

51
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,100
A dreadful fear went right into my heart

52
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,140
Those pine tree needles sting me

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,400
Ram-a-jam-a-ram-a-jam-a-nam-a-ding-dong

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,680
You'll never know how much that smarts

55
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
You're so...

56
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,800
Who put the slump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp?

57
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,460
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?

58
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,360
Who stubbed the wood where I poop-she-poop-she-poop?

59
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,180
Who put the stick up my hip-day-dip-day-dip?

60
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,900
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush?

61
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,620
He made this angel beg for mercy, please

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,000
I might squeeze him too tight

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,660
It's that psychedelic time of the year

64
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,720
Do you know where your brain...

65
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,460
Brain cells are?

66
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,620
It's already 9 p.m.

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,720
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him.

68
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,740
Don't go walking down to the bar

69
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,660
because old Frankie died last night in the backyard.

70
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,320
I mean, I'm not parking this car.

71
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,560
And to the right.

72
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,720
Paul, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

73
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,260
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw.

74
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Yeah, and I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells

75
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,500
till I get the damn chainsaw fixed

76
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,940
and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday.

77
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:00,660
Hey.

78
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,020
You boys be good,

79
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,420
and I'll give you some of this here apple mango pie.

80
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,680
He ain't no good of a child.

81
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,540
That dog's running off with them brain cells.

82
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,100
Can you do something about that boy?

83
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,960
I'm gonna have to...

84
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,720
I'm gonna have to...

85
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,720
I'm gonna have to...

86
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm gonna have to...

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,660
I'm gonna have to...

88
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:17,660


89
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:17,660


90
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,740
I'm gonna have to...

91
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm gonna have to...

92
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:20,960
I'm gonna have to...

93
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,500
I'm gonna have to...

94
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,720
I'm gonna have to...

95
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
Was he screwed on just right?

96
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,720
What we as manufacturers sell you is fun.

97
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,780
The fate of a child.

98
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,780
Spend all the money you've got.

99
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,940
Spend all the money you've got.

100
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,620
The Christmas trough.

101
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,020
I've lost my freaking mind.

102
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,680
Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

103
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,880
He's like a cowboy Santa.

104
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,520
How jolly.

105
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,440
Oh, Jazz is giving Dave the show pills.

106
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,860
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit?

107
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,380
I need the show bath.

108
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,560
The show de-lousing.

109
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,900
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.

110
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
That's enough of that.

111
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,760
Oh, he's got headphones.

112
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,380
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.

113
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,680
It's been increased in size to...

114
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,060
Oh, your pancreas looks...

115
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,440
Lovely, Dave.

116
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,480
Look, it's swelling.

117
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,580
I have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.

118
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,040
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

119
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,020
Oh, those pills.

120
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,740
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

121
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,900
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied crystals.

122
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,280
I'm shocked by...

123
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,320
The red pills are really good.

124
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,660
I like to take the red one and the blue.

125
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,240
The red one and the blue one.

126
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,620
At the same time.

127
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,720
That way you go in and out.

128
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,880
The warp makes it easy.

129
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,880
It's so high, you can't go over it.

130
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,200
Angels we have heard on high

131
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,900
Singing about mountain dew

132
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,620
And those mountains in reply

133
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,540
Saying we wish we had some too

134
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

135
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

137
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,040


138
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,040


139
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,940
In Excelsis Deo

140
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:17,360
In Excelsis Deo

141
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,680
Barbie Dolls

142
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,120
Women rape and memorialize their lives by role-playing with Barbie

143
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,460
Barbie Dolls

144
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,160
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys

145
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,000
They will empower us to resist us

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,420
You will use your church

147
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,040
You will use your church

148
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,040


149
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,820
as a vehicle to bring these toys before the public

150
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,660
It will be a

151
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,620
BOMBER

152
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,620
FOR KIDS

153
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:18,060
But how will the battle of good against evil

154
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,780
be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

155
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,240
Good have lots of muscles

156
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,280
Good

157
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,340
Good

158
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,340
The primitive earth society

159
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,040
is a good

160
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,040


161
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,400
Good should accept this value judgment

162
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,280
Good will have

163
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,540
great physical attributes

164
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,220
according to human desires

165
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,740
sexual desires

166
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,660
latent in children

167
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,800
brought out

168
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,960
through the vehicle of this

169
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,620
so-called

170
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,760
So Farmer told these boys at church

171
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,920
Better is not good

172
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,500
She's new from Kenner

173
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,040
Where illusion is the only way to be a good person

174
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,640
Ultimate weapon

175
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,740
We must buy our toys

176
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,680
We must buy our toys

177
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,640
Yes

178
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,020
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme

179
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,820
Recorded there at Dockstock 1984

180
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,900
Me and Palmer Freedies

181
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,520
Angels we have heard on high

182
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,720
It was by the Philistines

183
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,960
The collage called All the Money You've Got

184
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,980
Is from the great obtuse Christian

185
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,200
Christmas Collage album

186
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,580

191
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,420
The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley

192
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,260
Once upon a time

193
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,880
There was the baby

194
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:10,140
baby Jesus, and he had two eyes made out of coal, and he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree,

195
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,960
and he wanted his two front teeth, and he got McDonald's gift certificates,

196
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:23,840
and he had a dog named Santa's little helper, and he took all the presents from Whoville,

197
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,620
and his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys,

198
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:36,520
and he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy, but he couldn't.

199
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:44,520
He wanted 10s and 20s, 10s and 20s, and he got McDonald's gift certificates,

200
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,860
and he got Zuzu's pedals, and that's the real story of Christmas.

201
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,800
We'll be right back.

202
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,060
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.

203
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,220
He wanted an electric train.

204
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,340
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up.

205
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,580
He had a picture of the whole thing, and he would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes.

206
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,560
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.

207
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,420
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy looking train set with locomotives and freight cars,

208
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,460
the station and the gateman,

209
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,340
the mortar tower, and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.

210
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,300
So grand that you might think Tommy was wishing for something that just didn't exist.

211
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,340
And he was right.

212
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:04,340


213
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:04,340


214
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,400
And Tommy knew exactly what he was wishing for.

215
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,280
So separately, so separately, so separately, you from Tolga.

216
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,860
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob.

217
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,380
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

218
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,640
Shut up, pink boy!

219
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,180
No way. I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

220
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,740
Taste a little of my rock.

221
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,240
Rocket Pipe Alien Tool.

222
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,300
Bob Dodds comes with Rocket Pipe, Head Launcher, Janger Device,

223
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,580
All-Yakitism, Fighting Jesus, and other action figures sold separately.

224
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,240
Some assembly required, batteries not included.

225
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,420
This toy falls apart in three days.

226
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,100
He-Bob and the Bastards of the Universe.

227
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,440
Too much is always better than not enough.

228
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,620
From Bob Dodds.

229
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,680
Gorgeous.

230
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,620
Eaglets can blow from head to toe.

231
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,360
Drawing everything you see here.

232
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,380
Ken Dowd sold separately.

233
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,280
He-Bob and the Bastards of the Universe will be back after this message.

234
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,080
Santa Claus.

235
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,760
It is turnover.

236
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,280
The time of the year when all things sell.

237
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,820
The end of the year sale.

238
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,400
So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.

239
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,240
Now, are we, is Christmas, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

240
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,620
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

241
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,940
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

242
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,180
But the present subgenie.

243
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:26,580
We're trying to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now and sell everything to the pigs.

244
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,780
Oh, yes.

245
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,600
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

246
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,880
And it was something else in between there.

247
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:41,700
But before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season, it was something else.

248
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,500
But I think they started to war over it.

249
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:43,820
Yeah.

250
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,060


251
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,200


252
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,180
I think it was the."

253
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,360
Were you just a ho?

254
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,360
Merry Christmas.

255
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,980
Merry Christmas!

256
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,080


257
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,180
Merry Christmas!

258
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,660
Thank you.

259
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,560
Thank you.

260
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,980
Thank you.

261
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,000
Friends, try to imagine

262
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,460
somewhere in the snowy north

263
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,980
the Santee

264
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,440
Bob trudging mindlessly

265
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,540
through the Himalayan snows

266
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,220
driven by strange

267
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,060
forces to complete

268
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,940
his nameless errand

269
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,100
and he may show up

270
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,660
at your house, my friend.

271
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,920
If you've been a bad subgenius

272
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,760
or a halfway subgenius

273
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,140
or if we keep getting

274
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,080
tangled up in these other shows

275
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,540
and having strange microphones.

276
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,640
How did that

277
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,660
paternity suit ever turn out

278
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,760
between Dobbs and

279
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:26,960
Santa?

280
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,380
And who?

281
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,480
His dad.

282
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,560
Santa dog.

283
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,320
I don't know.

284
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,920
You know, and I don't think

285
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,960
it was a single result.

286
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,160
Yes, but St. Nicholas,

287
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,160
this is fact,

288
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,920
St. Nicholas punched

289
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,560
another bishop

290
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,740
in the nose

291
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,300
and bloodied his nose.

292
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:41,920
And sucked him.

293
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,440
Really?

294
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,020
The historical site

295
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,660
of a dispute

296
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,040
over the trinity

297
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,660
of God.

298
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,560
The original site

299
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,160
of God.

300
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,120
I swear to God.

301
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,960
I swear upon Bob

302
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,800
and his three hearts.

303
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,880
Who the hell is God?

304
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,460
Yeah.

305
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:55,900
His heart.

306
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,340
Part of the country.

307
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,180
I can tell him

308
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,880
he said God.

309
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,480
Who the hell is God?

310
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,160
Who the hell is God?

311
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,180
Ask Dobbs one day.

312
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,080
That's the question

313
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,880
we should be asking.

314
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,380
Suddenly,

315
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,940
a lightning bolt

316
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,080
struck from nowhere

317
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,720
on that bright sunny day.

318
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,660
Bob did a backflip

319
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,100
and from that day on,

320
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,480
he too was a believer.

321
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,280
And from the snow

322
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,000
and the sun,

323
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,380
a little child

324
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,620
bearing flowers emerged.

325
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,220
Chip, Chip,

326
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,000
what else was on the table?

327
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,060
Each one a dirty flower.

328
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,960
St. Nicholas.

329
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,180
Holy.

330
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,360
Sip, Sip,

331
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,860
The historical Santa Claus

332
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,700
is originally lived

333
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,620
as the caller knows

334
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,460
as a bishop in,

335
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,280
was it Constantinople?

336
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,120
Yeah, like one of those.

337
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,500
It was an ancient Byzantium.

338
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,660
Yeah, Asia Minor in general.

339
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Yes, he was known

340
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,860
for sneaking into the rooms

341
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,760
of young women

342
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,240
and leaving.

343
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,800
Hmm, hmm, gifts.

344
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,500
Light-sized lumps of coal

345
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,820
complete with a fake beard

346
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,000
and a CIA Wall Street credit card.

347
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,940
A saint he was,

348
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,360
the girl said.

349
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,140
St. Nicholas invented the CIA.

350
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,240
That's good.

351
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,740
You got it, brother.

352
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,920
Stuck into people's houses

353
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,700
through the chimney.

354
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
You got it, brother.

355
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,320
They knew when they were sleeping.

356
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,180
They knew when they were awake.

357
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,040
You got it, brother.

358
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,080
But like the CIA,

359
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,180
he was protecting them.

360
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
St. Nicholas was a creeping,

361
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,680
stinking spy.

362
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,200
What?

363
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,760
He knows when you've been sleeping,

364
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,300
he knows what you've been eating.

365
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,120
Hey, man, my kids still believe

366
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,160
in St. Nicholas.

367
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,220
And who keeps that belief alive

368
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
in their fevered, sick little brain?

369
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,420
Madison Avenue, of course.

370
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,560
No, the surveillance community

371
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,960
is under your direction.

372
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,900
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.

373
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,800
Miller Beer, you know.

374
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,600
If you're bad, he punishes you.

375
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,360
If you're good, he rewards you.

376
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,920
He's probably the closest thing

377
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,880
to Jesus walking the earth.

378
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,840
He's the closest thing

379
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,780
to Big Brother there is.

380
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,200
He rewards those who knows

381
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,880
when they are smiling

382
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,540
when they're awake.

383
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,120
I think, I think really

384
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,400
if you want to make a deal,

385
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,220
you have to do it with, you know.

386
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,800
Could Dr. Claus in fact be

387
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,360
the wandering, quote, milkman

388
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,300
rumored to have fathered

389
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,920
our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

390
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,700
Well, we find it a very likely possibility

391
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,600
from the falsified documents

392
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,440
we have here.

393
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,360
And also the fluffy beard

394
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,200
that often grew on Bob's feet.

395
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,020
You better watch out.

396
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,400
You better not.

397
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,300
You better not.

398
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,480
And I'm telling you why.

399
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,200
Santa Claus is coming to town.

400
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,940
He's making a list.

401
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,660
Checking it twice.

402
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,280
Gonna find out who's no good enough.

403
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,140
Santa Claus is coming to town.

404
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,940
He knows when you're away.

405
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,940
He knows when you're in bad or good.

406
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,800
So be goodness, goodness sake.

407
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,620
Oh, you better watch out.

408
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,360
You better not cry.

409
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,080
You're gonna pay him anyway.

410
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,320
Santa Claus is coming today.

411
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,860
Do you think I'm psycho mama?

412
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,580
I've seen my ex last night.

413
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

414
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,680
Mama?

415
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,520
We all saw Ex-Max last night.

416
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,980
A vision of Christmas that was dancing in stank's head.

417
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,780
It would not live for a little chic or plums.

418
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,920
and berries drop in toxic things.

419
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,600
This little show, Mom,

420
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,280
saw there was a reason that

421
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,080
the poison in the plants.

422
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,000
Material plants?

423
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,260
Biological agents

424
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,500
who only take 15%?

425
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,520
It came with our

426
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,560
plastic boxes of bags.

427
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,580
And now,

428
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,320
hold on,

429
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,340
here we go.

430
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,820
And now,

431
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,540
hold on,

432
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,560
here we go.

433
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,440
Oh, it's a great day,

434
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:48,900
all right.

435
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,720
A salute to Mr. and Mrs. American.

436
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,780
Shop as usual.

437
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
Shop as usual.

438
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,380
Shop as usual.

439
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,660
And avoid panic buying.

440
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,820
It's two days old Christmas,

441
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,140
a million things to do.

442
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,760
Clean the house, put on tea,

443
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,740
company is due.

444
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,920
Where are my relatives?

445
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,420
Why haven't they showed up?

446
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,740
I bet they're at the airport,

447
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,340
I forgot to pick them up.

448
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,400
The

449
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,120
наш

450
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,320
home

451
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,340
is

452
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:54,360
not

453
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,440
Mr.

454
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:54,480
American.

455
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,540
Sometimes I think all that Santa crap's just bull.

456
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,360
Santa Claus is real.

457
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,660
Santa Claus is real.

458
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,020
Santa Claus is real.

459
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,360
Santa Claus is real.

460
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,620
Santa Claus is real.

461
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,860
Santa Claus is real.

462
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,660
You're the cause for the child.

463
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,140
Who's the head man?

464
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,560
Santa Claus.

465
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,460
Santa Claus.

466
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,040
He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

467
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,020
He was so real, how come we didn't get squat last year?

468
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,800
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan on July 4th.

469
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,720
And now you can have it all, all pure 100% vinyl chloride CID.

470
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,560
The birth of our baby Satan as told by various authors.

471
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,740
Authors and eclectic scholars from around the globular unit.

472
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,440
Including that announcer.

473
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,980
This announcement has not been a perfunctory announcement.

474
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,220
An announcement of the blessed anointing and birthday of our Lord.

475
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:38,980
Jesus.

476
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,300
Praise.

477
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,140
Lord.

478
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,980
For one bright Christmas morning.

479
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,080
Christmas morning.

480
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,460
Was born.

481
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:53,800
Can you imagine?

482
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,380
In a grave.

483
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,360
The rave Jesus.

484
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,580
To a rich man's family.

485
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,140
The rave Jesus.

486
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,820
Oh, I know the rave Jesus.

487
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,700
I'm part with the rave Jesus.

488
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,840
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

489
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:15,360
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

490
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,280
Let your side be light.

491
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,560
From the light.

492
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:30,020
The water triples with the outer sky.

493
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:38,000
And have yourself a merry little Christmas.

494
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,560
From now on, we're miles away.

495
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,800
Once again.

496
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,460
Once again.

497
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:54,680
Is思い You see in these juntos?

498

醬

505
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,720
So Merry Christmas and a gloomy, gloomy day.

506
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,760
From Mutated Christmas, friends,

507
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,180
the Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas by No-L.

508
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,880
No-L.

509
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:42,340
Before that, some year-old ESO and Michael Shelley did that real story of Christmas

510
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:48,060
from the Tarkin Records All-Star Holiday Extravaganza.

511
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm playing a lot from that.

512
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,180
So check out www.triage.com for that one also.

513
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,500
The Tarkin Records is also on www.triage.com.

514
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,960
And now, the Jethro's.

515
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,800
The Tarkin Records.

516
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,400
The Tarkin Records.

517
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,240
Oh, yeah.

518
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,040
Wow.

519
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,500
Wow.

520
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,300
Coming on Red Room Stang.

521
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:42,000
The Weirbobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.

522
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,860
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

523
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,380
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous...

524
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,160
errands.

525
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:57,560
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

526
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,760
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.

527
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,280
Oh, friends, it's tough.

528
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:09,160
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.

529
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,620
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.

530
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:18,980
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that Santa

531
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,800
Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

532
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,740
Can you believe that?

533
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,700
They asked...

534
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,900
The kids were asking if their parents...

535
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,180
If...

536
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,580
Maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

537
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,280
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.

538
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,280
We can't afford that.

539
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,300
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

540
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,000
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

541
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,280

by their editing work, and that's on

Now you're blaming Jesus, you're blaming our Lord.

597
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,140
I sort of understand, because

598
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,380
I understood

599
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,100
the way any old fool

600
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,140
would understand. There was

601
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,100
no Jesus,

602
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,080
no flatulent old woman waving her

603
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,140
panties on the hill. It's not that

604
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,420
you don't want to,

605
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,260
it's that they won't let you. No,

606
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,980
there's just a crying

607
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,580
wilderness and the hot pursuit

608
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,080
of wolves everywhere

609
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,280
in the background. I'm ashamed of

610
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:24,560
them.

611
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,860
It's cold.

612
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,200
I'm leaving that

613
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,500
city life behind and radio

614
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,160
people are crazy.

615
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,240
I can't get my noodle

616
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,340
back in the pan, Jeth.

617
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,220
Come on, cowboy.

618
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,160
No, man, I was trying to hear you again. Let's go.

619
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:42,520
I'm going to go to the tree.

620
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,720
It's starting to whisper into me, man.

621
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,180
You've been drinking.

622
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,280
There's the face of the Madonna right up there.

623
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,760
There's the face of the Virgin Mary.

624
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,860
I swear to God, look at it.

625
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,040
What?

626
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,320
It's your Christmas witch coming true.

627
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,940
A Christmas witch?

628
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,480
I'll be horny, Uncle.

629
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,580
She's beautiful.

630
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,120
Her breasts are so cold.

631
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
I know she must be a true witch.

632
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,380
I guess you could call her that

633
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,500
if that's what she's packing out of these for real.

634
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,940
She's surrounded by hovering Christmas ornaments.

635
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
It looks like a radar device.

636
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,800
What? Yo.

637
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,200
It's her. What up?

638
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,060
What's up?

639
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,880
What a deep voice.

640
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,500
What's up?

641
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,580
Witch.

642
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,540
What's up?

643
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,980
What's up?

644
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,500
She's a witch.

645
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,040
What?

646
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,080
What's up?

647
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,600
What's up?

648
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,900
I'm going to go to the tree.

649
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:57,920
You're going to the tree.

650
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:57,920


651
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,160
Where?

652
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,820
Where?

653
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,180
Where?

654
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,320
I'm going to go to the tree.

655
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,760
Where?

656
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,340
Where?

657
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,520
Thank you.

658
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,540
Bye.

659
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,900
Right on, right on, right on, right on.

660
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,760
Right on.

661
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:18,440
I am yours truly, Rudy Ray Moore, bold and still beautiful.

662
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:24,840
Baby, I want to talk to you for this Christmas because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.

663
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,800
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmas time.

664
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,420
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.

665
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,360
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece.

666
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,460
And the health department made us take them down.

667
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,320
I remember my father well, you know.

668
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,140
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.

669
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,380
He used to have, you know what caused it, Ben?

670
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:55,380
He used to put a stocking cap on his head and put a knot right in front of it.

671
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,860
Daddy wake up with that stomping headache.

672
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,800
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.

673
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,040
He said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas, but he's going to bring you something.

674
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,060
So, Daddy.

675
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:12,280
Took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air and come back inside and told us the biggest lie I ever heard.

676
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,500
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

677
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,320
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?

678
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:28,100
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan Claus?

679
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,360
Whose father, Paul Bunyan, and whose mother, Big Sister?

680
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,580
Who created the conspiracy?

681
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,740
Before there were malls, there was no such thing as Christmas.

682
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,140
Yes.

683
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,960
The pilgrims forbade it.

684
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,780
There was a down-home Norman Rockwell style, it's a wonderful life type of Christmas.

685
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:58,600
It was a kite-flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas, not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.

686
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,060
It was a...

687
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,460
When your little brother...

688
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,600
Fell through a hole in the ice sling.

689
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,420
And you went and saved him.

690
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,260
You didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.

691
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,520
It was a wonderful life back then.

692
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,720
I heard little jokes about him waking up.

693
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,200
And then we'd put candles.

694
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,900
Like most people have.

695
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,320
He would have that smile on his face.

696
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,560
But today, Christmas is lost.

697
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,100
It's me.

698
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,340
He just beat the crap out of Santa Claus.

699
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,240
Scott.

700
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,240
You made your choice.

701
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,700
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

702
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,320
And to your eternal soul.

703
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:48,640
You have found that only could you afford to give to God that which was his.

704
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,560
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

705
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,760
The Senate still stands.

706
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:02,280
In the outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

707
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,600
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.

708
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,820
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

709
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,100
Sir, no.

710
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,160
I don't want to go to hell.

711
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:14,660
No.

712
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,640
No.

713
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,780
No.

714
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,060


715
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,620
As alive as he could be.

716
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,160
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same.

717
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,540
New and mean.

718
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,760
The tale bearer will be at the judgment.

719
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,160
We want to love and the class begins.

720
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,160


721
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,660
The call of Catalina.

722
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:58,660


723
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:58,720
I was learning that the soul was in trouble with the princess.

724
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,120
Little裝 while laughing in the wind.

725
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,560
ня

726
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:04,960
即

727
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:04,960


728
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:04,960


729
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,120
place of decoration without long hair is not enough to create kingdom of the entire element.

730
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,620
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.

731
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,400
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,

732
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,540
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

733
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,460
Dare I ask it?

734
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,320
Yes.

735
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,020
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,

736
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,620
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?

737
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,980
The answer?

738
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,600
Yes, definitely.

739
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,160
Take that and shove it up the tube, mark certainty,

740
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,320
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

741
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,560
Merry Christmas to all!

742
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,580
Now you're all gonna die!

743
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,020
The night Santa went crazy

744
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,580
The night Saint Nick went insane

745
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,160
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal

746
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,480
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

747
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,660
Well the workshop is gone now

748
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,660
He decided to bomb it

749
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,580
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet

750
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,800
And he tied up his helpers

751
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,520
And he held the elves hostage

752
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,340
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage

753
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,560
He got dancer in Prancer

754
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,560
With an old German Luger

755
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,600
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger

756
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,660
And he picked up a flamethrower

757
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,280
And he barbecued Blitzen

758
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,460
And he took a bite of his pizza

759
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,140
And he got a big bite

760
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,320
And said it tastes just like chicken

761
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,620
The night Santa went crazy

762
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,280
The night Kris Kringle went nuts

763
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,500
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole

764
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,960
Without stepping in reindeer guts

765
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,440
There's a National Guard and the FBI

766
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,600
There's a van from the Eyewitness News

767
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,440
And the FBI's on the run

768
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,500
Helicopters circling round in the sky

769
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,400
And the bullets are flying

770
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,640
The bodyguards rising

771
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,220
And everyone's dying to know

772
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,100
Who's Santa why

773
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,260
My, my, my, my, my, my

774
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,200
You used to be such a jolly guy

775
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:40,120
We wonder where you've gone

776
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,120


777
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,440
And when you look back

778
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,600
Deep to the desert

779
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:53,040
You know Santa's got a Grigori

780
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,200
Yeah, he asked the

781
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,300
What the hell can he be?

782
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:54,360
Gonna put that wonky guy

783
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:54,980
In a cruel child's lap

784
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:01,040
Santa Claus is coming to town

785
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,440
Santa Claus is home

786
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,440


787
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,440


788
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,440


789
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,440


790
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,440


791
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,440


792
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,440


793
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,660
is coming to town.

794
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,840
Have yourself an advanced Dogmatic Christmas

795
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,720
song thing called

796
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,140
Santa is Coming by F. Gillespie

797
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,560
or Gillespie and F. J. Coot.

798
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,680
ElectricElf at loop.com

799
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,940
can tell you more about that.

800
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,580
But now...

801
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,220
Who gave the Lord the claptrap?

802
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,380
Who made him talk in funny riddles

803
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,720
so that we cannot understand?

804
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,280
And who made him so succinct and blind

805
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,640
that he is actually blind?

806
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,440
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.

807
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,700
The time of the Lord,

808
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,900
of the fact that...

809
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,760
How many before you reach your limit?

810
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,700
How many do you get?

811
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:48,700
Jesuses?

812
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,020
Yeah, how many can you bag?

813
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,900
How many Messiahs can you bag?

814
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,080
Hail Jesuses.

815
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,440
If you're doing it in season,

816
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,500
if you're doing it out of season,

817
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,740
you need a special permit.

818
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,380
Oh, you never do.

819
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,220
And you can only take one.

820
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,860
You never bag the Lord in C.

821
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,200
You bag the Lord in B flat

822
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,620
so you get that kind of rough sound.

823
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,860
But when they're in season,

824
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,180
it's every God for himself.

825
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,340
This is the season for the fighting Jesus.

826
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,460
Obviously.

827
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,280
We are between a rock and a hard place.

828
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,700
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea

829
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,460
in the old age

830
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,220
and he got a very, very hard foot

831
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,500
and he got elfin tashes of the rectum?

832
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,040
You know, it's not something well-known

833
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,720
by many Christian scholars.

834
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,140
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was

835
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,540
chlam chashash chaman chashash.

836
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,760
I kind of like those stories

837
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,120
where the Lord dies

838
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:33,700
and the Lord dies.

839
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,820
And then comes here to America

840
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,880
and settles, you know,

841
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,940
tames the West.

842
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,400
I like when he moves into a trailer park

843
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,400
and the cowboys walk with his dog.

844
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,800
Jesus fought for the Confederate Army.

845
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,020
The Ranger.

846
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,500
I like the Texas Ranger.

847
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,100
Jesus, Texas Ranger.

848
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,380
Johnny Rebel was a Jesus.

849
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,100
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police,

850
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,640
for maybe the Hopi police force.

851
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,080
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.

852
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,020
He was the white brother

853
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,660
who came to instruct the Indians

854
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,580
how to be liberal.

855
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,940
Well, what about old Peacemaker,

856
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,020
the Jesus of the Iroquois

857
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,320
who was actually Huron?

858
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,000
A Huron.

859
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,440
You didn't know that, did you?

860
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,020
See, I got you.

861
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,380
Thin Ron.

862
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:12,860
Jesus.

863
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,020
El Ron.

864
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,820
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus

865
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,160
you've ever seen.

866
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,120
Oh, it tastes like butter.

867
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:19,920
A new Jesus.

868
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,080
A different Jesus.

869
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,400
It tastes like crappin' pie, children.

870
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,320
It melts in your mind.

871
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,340
Smokin' Jesus.

872
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,780
Hey, Dave, you know where it is.

873
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,140
Go kick that window open.

874
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,420
I already kicked it.

875
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,520
I'll kick it again, though.

876
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,020
Kick it good this time.

877
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,100
We don't mean nothing

878
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,260
by this Jesus and God.

879
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,000
We thank you for all the nice things

880
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,140
that you've done for us

881
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,040
this Thanksgiving.

882
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,060
We appreciate all that.

883
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,940
We're just trying to insult your fan club.

884
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,720
That's why we do this blasphemous stuff.

885
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,360
But we knew that you knew that

886
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,180
because you're in all things

887
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,700
and everything, right, Jesus?

888
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,440
Right, I could hear him say that.

889
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,680
Praise God and Bob

890
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,080
and Jesus.

891
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:03,600
And God.

892
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,160
Next topic.

893
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,180
Next topic.

894
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,380
Terrorist insurance.

895
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,420
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?

896
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,440
And science.

897
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,160
That's the life of Brian, isn't it?

898
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,780
And Greek mythology

899
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,580
and Norse mythology.

900
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,900
Listen to the sounds of hell.

901
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,580
Jingle, jangle, jingle

902
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,160
We're on a sleigh ride to heck

903
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,860
Santa and his reindeer

904
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,300
Are really wicked

905
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,400
Wrapped in wrapping paper

906
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,100
We're gonna break our necks

907
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,800
Got a rocket in my pocket

908
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,840
On a sleigh ride to heck

909
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,580
Sleigh ride to heck

910
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:51,160
Sleigh ride to heck

911
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,800
Sleigh ride to heck

912
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:01,200
The elves are full of cheer

913
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,580
The kids are going to bed

914
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,740
We're tucked in bed

915
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,200
Santa ain't coming

916
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,620
We're on a sleigh ride to heck

917
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,140
Their dreams are filled with toys

918
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:18,760
But they're out of luck

919
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,080
Cause Satan's taking Santa

920
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,500
On a sleigh ride to f-

921
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,360
Sleigh ride to heck

922
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,560
Sleigh ride to heck

923
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,560
Sleigh ride to heck

924
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:33,560


925
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,740
Sleigh ride to heck

926
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,740
Sleigh ride to heck

927
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:50,300
The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends, from his new album, Don't Trust Whitey, James Kochalka, Superstar.

928
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,540
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith

929
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:03,540
that he not only can accept somebody's love,

930
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,260
but he can also be making fun of Bob, stomping on a picture of Bob.

931
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,280
He'll do it himself.

932
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,680
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

933
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,400
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

934
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,040
Now, we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,

935
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,520
but we subgeni may be bad,

936
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:27,280
but our way of bad is holy, is holy compared to the evil of so-

937
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,280
not all, by any means, but so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals, etc. in general,

938
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:33,520
all of them, are evil.

939
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:40,960
Of course, they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, etc.,

940
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,940
if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.

941
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,020
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about.

942
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,680
We're, Jesus and Bob, like we say, are old drinking buddies.

943
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,980
Got nothing against Jesus.

944
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,920
It's just his fan club.

945
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,180
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.

946
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,640
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief, just like you or me.

947
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,680
But the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief.

948
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,820
Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect.

949
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,580
He doesn't even sneeze.

950
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,600
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us,

951
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:25,240
and we have to go in the secret room, the bathroom, to do awful things.

952
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,680
But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.

953
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,540
Oh, and he's male.

954
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,160
But he doesn't exclude us.

955
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,240
We don't scrape juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do,

956
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,360
because we sinned.

957
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,680
Oh, yeah, we all sinned.

958
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,420
We're bad.

959
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,220
We're worthless.

960
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:43,100
We're no good to God unless we sign a contract with his agent.

961
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,240
We interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.

962
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:47,920
We turn.

963
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,900
E-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

964
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,420
This wasn't meant to be.

965
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:25,580
Jim and Isabel will be visiting California State University tomorrow at 1 a.m.

966
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,680
on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Friday.

967
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:30,680


968
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:30,780
just because he had a bad life.

A book of ancient gods penned

972
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:55,220
Just like the ones I used to know

973
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:04,540
Where the trees are small

974
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:11,320
And the children are safe

975
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:20,040
And I dance in the snow

976
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:37,640
I'm dreaming of a book of ancient gods penned

977
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:44,480
Where everyone can come back right

978
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:52,740
And your days will be

979
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,860

981
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:09,080
And may all your gods

Oh holy night

The stars are brightly shining

985
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:35,380
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth

986
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,300
Long lay, long lay the world

987
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,540
In different finding

988
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,940
The pit and the stone found its rest

989
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,160
A thrill of hope

990
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,660
The weary world rejoices

991
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,600
The young are praised

992
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,780
A new and glorious morn

993
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,700
Fall on your knees

994
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,060
Oh hear the angel voices

995
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:06,460
Oh night divine

996
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:11,140
Oh night when Christ was born

997
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:19,320
Oh night, oh night divine

Mithras won his fight

Alright guys, we're just about to solve this one.

I'm a chocolate space cadet.

1012
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:57,670
Life support system down to zero cocoa.

1013
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:58,790
Feeling space.

1014
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:01,310
I need to have some of my new cocoa pebbles.

1015
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,130
Now so chocolatey.

1016
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:04,890
Smells coconut.

1017
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,630
This cocoa liquid.

1018
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:10,550
Blue.

1019
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:13,870
Well, friends, what do you think?

1020
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,710
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus

1021
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:19,250
that we're trying to celebrate here?

1022
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:23,310
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob,

1023
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:24,630
the Santai Bob,

1024
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:28,290
as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?

1025
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:04,530
The Jethro's, friends.

1026
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,810
You need to know where to write to the Jethro's.

1027
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:07,670
They're at...

1028
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,130
They did that Wreck the Halls

1029
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,330
and so many other versions we've been playing.

1030
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:18,710
The Jethro's are at 212 and a half Miller,

1031
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,070
Avenue.

1032
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,050
That's 212 and a half Miller Avenue,

1033
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,910
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

1034

And friends, as always,

1047
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,650
the Hour of Slack is brought to you

1048
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:13,630
by the Church of the Subgenius.

www.subgenius.com

1050
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:21,710
It's all Christmassy right now.

1051
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,730
There's a bright green bob in the window

1052
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,630
and Christmassy lights.

1053
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:25,990
Is there a light out there?

1054
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:28,030
A DJA? Is a DJA out there?

1055
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:31,650
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.

1056
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,870
No, that's something just left for a DJA.

1057
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:34,890
It's all Christmassy.

1058
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:41,330
It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present

1059
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:42,850
under the tree.

1060
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:43,850
Smell that cinnamon.

1061
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,530
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.

1062
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,530
And those sugar plums.

1063
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:49,070
Something's up the chimney hole in sight.

1064
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:49,910
Mrs. Mack.

1065
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:51,470
Yeah.

1066
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:52,890
A Santa, I mean.

1067
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,390
Otherwise, gosh.

1068
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,390
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

1069
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:00,050
Oh, beloved Santa.

1070
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,110
I have wanted to...

1071
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:03,430
Put your bag down for a minute.

1072
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,390
This side is always so ready to learn.

1073
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:06,810
Big red sack.

1074
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:07,330
What?

1075
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:08,490
For so long.

1076
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:12,110
Hi, Bob and Mary X-Men!

1077
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:33,250
You know that?

1078
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,110
A little.

1079
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:38,390
Like that.

1080
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:41,410
I will, tomorrow.

1081
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:43,670
OK.

1082
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:45,650


1083
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:46,570
Lone Cow Dave.

1084
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:49,070
Don't you know what they're doing to you?

1085
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:49,610
yourself?

1086
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:50,790
Don't go there,

1087
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:51,050
Uncle,

1088
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:51,550
dear.

1089
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:52,710
No,

1090
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:53,270
no,

1091
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:53,750
no,

1092
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:53,990
no.

1093
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,310
It was the night

1094
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:03,390
before Christmas

1095
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:04,270
and all through

1096
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:04,890
the house

1097
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:05,870
not a creature

1098
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:06,490
was stirring

1099
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,050
not even a mouse

1100
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,130
the stockings

1101
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:09,610
were hung

1102
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:10,230
by the tree

1103
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:10,850
