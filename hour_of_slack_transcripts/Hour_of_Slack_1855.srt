1
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,440
The Hour of Slack.

2
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,480
The Hour of Slack.

3
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,360
This is all a copy.

4
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,200
It's a copy.

5
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,380
It's a copy.

6
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,520
Now follow me carefully here because here's where we're going to depart from ordinary church.

7
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,940
God's not dead.

8
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,660
He's still alive.

9
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,440
God's not dead.

10
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,300
He's still alive.

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,800
God's not dead.

12
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,540
He's still alive.

13
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,340
I feel him in my hands.

14
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,960
I feel him in my feet.

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,540
I feel him all over me.

16
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,980
No, no, no, no.

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,740
No, no, no, no.

18
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,780
Heaven help us all.

19
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,080
God's not dead.

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,860
He's still alive.

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,680
God's not dead.

22
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,540
He's still alive.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,980
God's not dead.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,640
He's still alive.

25
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,480
I feel him in my hands.

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,100
I feel him in my feet.

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,640
I feel him all over me.

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,980
No.

29
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,060
I feel him all over me.

30
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,080
I feel him all over me.

31
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,860
I feel him all over me.

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,140
God's not dead.

33
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,920
I feel him all over me.

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,780
I feel him all over me.

35
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:10,840
I feel him all over me.

36
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,360
God's not dead.

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,380
I feel him all over me.

38
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,380


39
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,380


40
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,380


41
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,380


42
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,380


43
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,700
God's not dead.

44
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,600
Laugh sack there, laugh sack there.

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,060
Come along you little no-와-es.

46
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,320
Laugh sack there, laugh sack there.

47
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,200


48
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,740
Laugh sack there, laugh sack there.

49
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,700
Laugh sack there, laugh sack there.

50
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,000
Laugh sack there, laugh sack there.

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,000
Laugh sack there, laugh sack there.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:45,420
Friends, this was going to be a love show, but we're all paranoid still, so I changed my mind, and it's a war show with Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave at ESO Swamp Radio WCSB Cleveland.

53
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,200
The war drums are certainly...

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,400
President Bush certainly is looking presidential and busy lately, huh?

55
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,700
Now, what happened? They opened the satchel and we're still busy with the sexes? Is that what happened?

56
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:10,200
I don't know. I haven't turned on the news in six months since they knocked those buildings down.

57
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,280
It's pretty much George Bush and Dick Cheney against everybody in the world.

58
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,800
Dave, we all turned down, tuned in, and we dropped out, man.

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,180
Oh, man, you guys have gone the hippie way?

60
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,540
Yeah, we quit voting.

61
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,800
That's our protest against voting.

62
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,020
Forget about everything.

63
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,820
I'm going to become a nihilistic type dude.

64
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,160
You know what I'm saying?

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,420
Forget this dog stuff.

66
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,660
How about a neopaleonistic?

67
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,140
You're a silly tumor and yucking it up, you know, when the world's burning down around our knees.

68
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,500
Right. Right.

69
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,480
No, your world is burning down around your knees.

70
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,640
The world will simply do what it does.

71
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,000
Burn around its knees?

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,760
Long after your world has burned to its knees.

73
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,320
Every game after ours, someone lost its connection.

74
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,000
And every battle must continue to carry on without attacking our newbels.

75
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,860
We can move across that closer civil war that was created in the First World War experience.

76
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:17,860


77
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,600
Kill the planes.

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:21,600


79
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,220
The לא guess.

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:23,600


81
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:24,380


82
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,540
It's blinded, deafened up

83
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,260
But nothing can change the shape of things to come

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,240
There are changes

85
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,660
Lying ahead in every row

86
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,700
And there are new thoughts

87
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,620
Ready and waiting to explode

88
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,320
When tomorrow is today

89
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,640
The bells may toll for some

90
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,780
But nothing can change the shape

91
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,660
Of things to come

92
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,120
The future's coming in and out

93
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Sweet and strong

94
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,560
And now I'm gonna hold it back for long

95
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,400
There are new dreams

96
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,460
Crowding out old realities

97
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,800
There's revolution

98
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,380
Sweeping like a fresh new breeze

99
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,360
Let the old world

100
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,760
Be the new world

101
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,760
Make believe

102
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,340
It's blinded, deafened up

103
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,300
But nothing can change the shape of things

104
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,320
Nothing can change the shape of things

105
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,380
Nothing can change the shape of things

106
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,960
Nothing can change the shape of things to come

107
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,120
In the future all will be happy

108
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,360
In the future all will sing with glee

109
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,380
In the future there will be much rejoicing

110
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,340
In the future all will bow to leave

111
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,620
Piano solo

112
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:22,600
The last of the ez probably

113
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,340
Music Everyone's heading to an elixir

114
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:23,340


115
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:23,340


116
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,120
In the future all will be happy

117
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,180
In the future all will sing with glee

118
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,700
In the future there will be much rejoicing

119
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,460
In the future all will bow to me

120
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,240
There never will be any problems

121
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,740
There never will be any choice

122
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,340
No dissent or discontent

123
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,880
And there will only be one voice

124
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,320
So bow to the cog

125
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,680
Bow to the cog

126
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,380
Bow to me

Bow to me

129
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,360
I'm bowing right now for the C.O.G.

130
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,980

131
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,300
Bow to the cog

On your knees if you please for the C.O.G.

136
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,040
I've got a plan in mind for you

137
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,780
Quit your job, don't go to school

138
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,360
Break your bones, build my dream

139
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,940
You're a tiny gear in a big machine

140
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh!

141
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,580
I know what you want

142
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,260
I know what you need

143
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,140
I've got ideas between my ears

144
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,160
That would make your brain bleed

145
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,340
So bow to the cog

146
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,640

C.O.G.

I will give you a higher purpose

159
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,040
I'll control your very soul

160
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,340
My will is yours to do so

161
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,760
Now do your chores

162
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,840
Won't be beaten by a mole

163
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,060
How will your lives have any meaning

164
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,800
After I'm buried, dead and gone

165
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,520
I'll build an army of giant robots

166
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,040
My evil plans will carry on

167
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,680
So bow to the cog

168
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,020

And before that, Shape of Things to Come

182
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:19,660
Let's go!

183
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,840
By Max Frost and the Troopers

184
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,400
Friends, there have been some really strange subgeniuses

185
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,760
And also some mal-aligned normals

186
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,040
Pestering me lately

187
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,100
And man, you know what? I've about had enough

188
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,060
I've had enough of that

189
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,080
I think people are going nuts

190
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,900
Is there still... have there been sunspots?

191
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,800
Did the Russian CIA guys turn on some ray?

192
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,240
Oh yeah, they did, that's happening too

193
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
But they're...

194
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,440
The kook meter at Subgenius Central is spiking

195
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,280
I have never seen anything like it

196
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,220
Well, war fever

197
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,280
There is war madness going on

198
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,720
And sometimes when they use the big subliminal generators

199
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,180
Lots of people start spazzing out in their everyday lives

200
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:09,140
I think that it's like teachers, loony bin custodians

201
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,880
And cops and so forth all know this around full moons

202
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,220
That there's a real palpable increase in just general crap

203
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,700
And it seems like...

204
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,680
I mean, we're between full moons right now, man

205
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,160
What is going on?

206
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,820
What do you think is happening?

207
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,120
What do you think is happening, Dr. Fratch?

208
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,820
People in those cars next to me

209
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,540
Why are they looking at you like that?

210
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,760
Are they following you?

211
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,720
Do they know your name?

212
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,920
What is he writing down? Your license number?

213
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,240
Have you been checking out the white SUVs?

214
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,980
Do you know about Alex Jones?

215
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,160
Have you heard of Alex Jones?

216
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,280
The internet so-called kook from Texas?

217
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:44,800
Yeah

218
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,200
Who believes that George Bush is the anti-kook?

219
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,320
The anti-Christ?

220
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,180
Or at least one of his friends?

221
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,640
Yes

222
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,080
Well, who is the real guy?

223
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,100
Isn't every president the anti-Christ?

224
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,360
Yes

225
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,900
I think so

226
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,440
I mean, you know, after all these years

227
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,980
I think that's what they're essentially running for

228
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,800
Is anti-Christ

229
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,760
Reagan was best

230
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,800
Because he had the six letters in each of his tags

231
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,780
See, Clinton was on David Letterman last night

232
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,060
Yeah

233
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,940
Yeah, I heard that

234
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,960
I wish I'd seen that

235
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,120
What I would have done, Chaz and Stang

236
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,020
I would have dropped a bomb on Ethiopia

237
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,240
And made up some excuse about something else

238
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,720
I don't know, man

239
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,340
I just, the war fever

240
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,420
I was trying to break the war fever with a cold compress

241
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,060
And maybe put an ice cube in my butt

242
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,860
And it's not working, man

243
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,740
I still got it

244
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,160
I know what you mean, man

245
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,500
It's a hard fever to break

246
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,840
It's a, I've been trying to avoid all of that

247
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,500
Didn't turn on the TV during the day

248
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,060
Me neither, actually

249
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,620
Or anything

250
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,700
But I could still kind of sense the psychic echoes reverberating through the force

251
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,740
You could hear all the madmen in Washington

252
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,040
Huzzing at one time

253
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,240
Also, they all showed up on alt.slack and on the internet very interactively

254
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,300
Senator Proxied

255
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,460
I'm afraid I have some bad news

256
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,380
Yes?

257
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,200
There's been an accident

258
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
No

259
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,660
I love the night, I love the night

260
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,020
I love the night, I love the night

261
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,100
I don't even care about any of it

262
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,260
If I went away from it

263
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,020
How unhappy I would be

264
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,980
Me and I oh my

265
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,620
Senor

266
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,780
Are you happy, now?

267
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,220
Now? Oh, I'm so unhappy!

268
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,660
I'll tickle you!

269
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,300
There were summer barbecues in the backyard.

270
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,660
I've got a beautiful roast for supper tonight.

271
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,040
Roast?

272
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:15,900
Oh, nice!

273
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,420
We will give you

274
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,760
a beautiful surprise

275
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,200
with a seven and three quarter inch fry pan, free of charge.

276
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,700
Are you really so brave?

277
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Or are you the one who is afraid?

278
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,320
What do you think?

279
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,740
The sudden silence tells you that your little boy is gone.

280
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,900
Are you afraid I have some bad news?

281
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:23,980
No.

282
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,080
There's been an accident.

283
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,100
We cannot foresee when, where or how death will come.

284
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:39,380
I'm lonely when I'm me and I do the rest

285
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,480
If I went away from you

286
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,220
How unhappy I would be

287
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,020
Me and I owe my

288
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,440
self

289
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,800
For the life of me!

290
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,600
For the life of me!

291
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,180
The brand flakes in the final hours

292
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,780
from their new album, Bounces.

293
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,300
And friends, you can get more brand flakes

294
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,360
from the www.thebrandflakes.com

295
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,960
or from box 21104

296
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,060
Seattle, Washington

297
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,760
98111

298
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,400
And now, The Lord's Buffet by Lemur.

299
00:15:52,760 --> 00:16:07,360
Stork, the hoopoe, any kind of great lizard, and any kind of grasshopper, which have legs above their feet, with which to hop on the skink and the chameleon, even of these you may eat, and you shall detest their carcasses, for I am defiled thereby.

300
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:22,020
Any kind of raven, any kind of locust, the pig, and the gull, that you may eat, because he choose the wall lizard, but doesn't have parted hair, defile yourselves therefore and be holy, for I am defiled.

301
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:34,440
Any kind of heron, any kind of cricket, the coney, the gecko, and the red kite, if any kind of cricket, of which you may eat, dies, he who eats its clothes shall not be eaten.

302
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,760
He also who carries its clothes shall be broken into pieces, until the evening.

303
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,920
These you shall detest, and you may eat them, they are an abomination.

304
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:52,660
The weasel, the rat, any kind of black kite, the screech owl, the camel, the eagle, and the vulture, and the black vulture.

305
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,780
That you may eat.

306
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:06,840
The cormorant, any kind of hawk, the skink, and the chameleon, any kind of katydid, the hare, the horned owl, the great owl, the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey, the little owl, the wall lizard, and the bat.

307
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,480
Make yourselves unclean with them.

308
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,600
Make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps, for I am the lord that creeps.

309
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,980
Defile yourselves therefore and be holy, for I am creepy.

310
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,500
And the monitor lizard.

311
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:30,240
Whoever touches the monitor lizard shall be broken into wing creeping things which have four feet, but doesn't have fins and scales in the waters.

312
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,180
For I am the monitor lizard.

313
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,640
Your god.

314
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:48,940
Executive Order 13013 strengthens the federal government through waste and federal acquisition of products.

315
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,340
The western players live under the immunitary minimum- небольш-

316
00:17:59,340 --> 00:17:59,340


317
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,360
Pq Recuax

318
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,360


319
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,360


320
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,660
minha

321
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,580
All I know is I unearthed my draft card with the 4F stamped on it not long ago.

322
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,460
That 4F is still good.

323
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,520
I doubt if my feet have gotten...

324
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:31,880
What's a 4F?

325
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,340
4F is your flat foot, flat feet.

326
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,780
Anything else you could have?

327
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,020
Well, that's psychosis, homosexuality.

328
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,760
Well, they didn't have AIDS back then.

329
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,640
Sarcomas from Greece.

330
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,300
Believe it or not.

331
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:45,800
Bulimia.

332
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
Expandable buttocks.

333
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,380
I was number 30 in the lottery.

334
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,840
They were going to ship my ass off to Hamburger Hill and turn me into hamburger.

335
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,900
But instead they shipped off the rest of your body and left your ass back in dear old Tejas.

336
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,400
And was it a wonderful thing for the population of Vietnam?

337
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,380
I don't know.

338
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,400
I have friends who had the best time of their lives serving in the armed forces during the Vietnam War.

339
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,600
Then I have other friends who have to take Valium three times a day because they had the worst time of their lives.

340
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,140
Most people don't like it.

341
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,280
But the ones who do, it's not the war.

342
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,720
It's just the idea that maybe they might die but maybe they won't.

343
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,400
You know, they just get goosed up on it.

344
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,740
Then the rest go, oh, what did I get into here?

345
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,120
This really sucks, you know.

346
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:36,340
Well, the marijuana on Guam had a lot to do with the good times that I've heard about.

347
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:43,780
Well, on Iwo Jima in World War II, the pot was so good that they had to keep raising the flag and lowering it and razor it and get the right.

348
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,540
And they could never get the right angles or anything.

349
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,640
That's why that was a four-day shoot.

350
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,360
But most of the opportunities were lost.

351
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,680
The other two opportunities took place on the US of rattlesnake.

352
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:58,660
Those guys had to pose there holding that flag in place while the guy sculpted them and carved that big rock to match their...

353
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,300
Instead of glorifying it though.

354
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,520
Yeah, I mean that was...

355
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,340
And then they have a ship with the big rock.

356
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,260
Many people will die.

357
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,260
Think about that.

358
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,500
How many people will be dead?

359
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,140
Don't think about it.

360
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,100
Oh hell, we don't care about that.

361
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,840
Geez, death.

362
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,100
We'll be mutilated by the smart bomb.

363
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,060
Death is something that happens to other people in America unless it happens to you.

364
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,700
You know what I mean?

365
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,640
Especially violent death when the sky's red and the water tastes like poison.

366
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,400
And it's poison.

367
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,640
And you can't...

368
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,480
Well, let's not get into it because...

369
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,980
Why can't we just all get a bong?

370
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,400
I've believed that for so long.

371
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,500
That's my credo.

372
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,480
My deepest feeling.

373
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,820
In Vietnam, the media didn't know any better and they went ahead and showed the dead stuff,

374
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,800
the dead things and people on the television.

375
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,900
But you see, nowadays, during that Gulf War mini-series, you didn't see anything too unpleasant.

376
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:44,440
No.

377
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,800
It was kind of like Star Wars.

378
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,480
Right.

379
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,860
Flying over the Death Star.

380
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,200
Yeah.

381
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,580
You'd see the men with their ray guns.

382
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,560
You'd see these pretty explosions.

383
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,300
The guys with the night vision, you know, the kind of looking scary.

384
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:53,980
Down there and...

385
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,640
Well, it was all just...

386
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,080
Computer game.

387
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:55,840
Yeah.

388
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,320
Yeah.

389
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,240
Psychedelic.

390
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:07,180
And the media people have learned that you keep your blood in your guts with the scary

391
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,220
monster movies and the babysitter murder movies.

392
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,260
Rollercoaster style.

393
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,540
And you keep your romance with those and with the news.

394
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,740
You just keep it...

395
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,080
Yeah.

396
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,720
Just slack for a minute.

397
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,100
Don't they know it's the end of the world?

398
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,640
Well, I've gotten so tired of carrying around that placard that says the world is...

399
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,440
The end is nigh.

400
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,780
That at this point it's like, well, how many times have I drilled for the end of the world

401
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,060
now?

402
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,960
Ever since I was a teenager, really.

403
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,060
Since I was a little kid.

404
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,720
When they had us hide under...

405
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,220
Puffer dome.

406
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,120
Might as well hide under your school desk with the newspaper over your head.

407
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,580
Get a big puff cone.

408
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,620
What a thing to work up to.

409
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,020
Duck and cover.

410
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,200
Duck and cover.

411
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,080
That's all you guys are doing.

412
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,280
It's still just a bunch of duck and cover.

413
00:21:59,400 --> 00:21:59,720
Duck and cover.

414
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,100
Duck and cover.

415
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,060
Whenever an atomic bomb drops, duck and cover and you'll feel just freaking fine.

416
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,200
Hey, man, I think you've got the wrong attitude about this war thing.

417
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,700
I mean, like, I don't know.

418
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,700


419
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,700


420
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,700


421
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,700


422
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,700


423
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,700


424
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,700


425
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,700


426
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,700


427
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,700


428
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,700


429
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:28,300
How do I Virtually

430
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,000
Know's

431
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,560
whether

432
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,220
it's

433
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,680
gonna

434
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:47,680


435
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:47,680


436
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,540
is men cannot know

437
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,560
But boys

438
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,980
learn true secrecy

439
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,760
How to

440
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,940
hide lies

441
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,520
And cracks

442
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,440
in their souls and behind

443
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,800
shaded eyes

444
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,740
That filter all light

445
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,920
through the sins of their fathers

446
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,780
Shining on down

447
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,960
on good sons and daughters

448
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,200
We were true

449
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,100
believers

450
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,460
And this song

451
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,560
of gold

452
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,040
Was a high

453
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,340
holy fever that purified

454
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,160
the soul

455
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,400
But base turned to piss off

456
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,000
All equality of love

457
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,360
As girls dance the go-go

458
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,020
To our golden cow

459
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,200
We borrowed the tune

460
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,440
from the hymns of our fathers

461
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,300
We are not rebels

462
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,460
Just good sons and daughters

463
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,320
Good sons

464
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,380
Good sons and daughters

465
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,480
Good sons

466
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,020
Good sons, yeah

467
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,460
The revolution came

468
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,520
All the revolution went

469
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,420
And I'd never all

470
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,000
just be a fool

471
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,380
That fifty percent

472
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,520
Oh, the truth

473
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,640
that comes from penance

474
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,800
From porno

475
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,780
to rape

476
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,420
And bought

477
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,840
into Hollywood

478
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,220
Hefty slight

479
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,320
Millions of

480
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,780
Maryland's who died for their lovers

481
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,800
Seducing the culture

482
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,940
of good sons and daughters

483
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,740
Good sons

484
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,080
It's time

485
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,320
It's time

486
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,320


487
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,320


488
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,700
Good sons and daughters

489
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,380
Kingdom's

490
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:54,800
Catchingocol

491
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,000
menti

492
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,800
Have you ever heard

493
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,000
a tea?

494
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,660
I was reading through the paper

495
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,060
And I happened to see

496
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,100
All police are disguised

497
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
To look a whole lot like me

498
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,080
And so I started dodging questions

499
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,300
A-line on top of lies

500
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,000
And I thought what I thought

501
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,620
Was a good alibi

502
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,160
I never knew your mother

503
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,260
Your sister or daughter

504
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,120
I ain't no killer

505
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,840
I'm a good son

506
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,060
Yeah, I'm a good son

507
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,280
Yeah, I'm a good son

508
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,480
Yeah, I'm a good son

509
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,120
Yeah, I'm a good son

510
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,580
Yeah, I'm a good son

511
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,680
Yeah, I'm a good son

512
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,480
Yeah, I'm a good son

513
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,900
Yeah, I'm a good son

514
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,300
Yeah, I'm a good son

515
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,980
Yeah, I'm a good son

516
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,080
Yeah, I'm a good son

517
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,860
Yeah, I'm a good son

518
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:01,960
Yeah, I'm a good son

519
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,680
Yeah, I'm a good son

520
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,160
Yeah, I'm a good son

521
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,600
Yeah, I'm a good son

522
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:05,980
Yeah, I'm a good son

523
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:05,980


524
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:05,980


525
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:05,980


526
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,780
The Rainmakers, and now, Lemur.

527
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,660
This weekend on BookBand TV.

528
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,140
BookBand starting at noon eastern.

529
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,080
Democrats in the corner.

530
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,720
Look at a BookBanding with Lemur, author of Let's Cry War, Let's Cry Peace, Let's Cry Cry Cry.

531
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,720
Live coverage begins at 3.

532
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,660
Starting at noon.

533
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,640
Only on BookBand TV.

534
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,460
We're talking about space aliens.

535
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,840
If you'd like to join our conversation, numbers are on the screen.

536
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:53,020
2-0-0 for Republicans, and 2-0-1 for Democrats, and 2-0-2 for space aliens.

537
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,700
I noticed in your article there are a lot of companies that are working on aliens.

538
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:04,620
If you want to fall in love with an alien, that's basically impractical.

539
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,140
What about worldwide space aliens?

540
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,860
They're based on reality, but they're imaginary.

541
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,220
What other countries besides the U.S. and Russia are in the space aliens?

542
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,320
Brazil is certainly one that might surprise an alien.

543
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,560
India is another, but they're imaginary.

544
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,680
Are there regulations regarding private aliens?

545
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,460
Can anyone shoot up space aliens?

546
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,200
We'll be covering that in some future issues, but there are some folks who are deep in the moon.

547
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,080
Do the space aliens have to pay their full way themselves?

548
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,260
Yes, they do.

549
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,700
Are these just imaginary, or are these actual aliens?

550
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,040
It was a propaganda effort, certainly.

551
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,820
But that's not true.

552
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,600
But the Russians...

553
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,820
Da-da-da-da.

554
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,680
Da-da-da-da.

555
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,420
So there'll be some corporate sponsors.

556
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,520
And where are they finding the aliens?

557
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,560
That's hard.

558
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,700
They're not finding it.

559
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,080
Is NASA funding any of this?

560
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Well, that's the conclusion they came to based on a market study.

561
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,660
One of them asked me where my flag was, and I said it was home in a box where it should be.

562
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,340
Well, but of course it was at home. Where else would it be?

563
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,660
It's the same place we go everywhere.

564
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:32,840
It's a cold, windy, rainy day.

565
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,660
Of course, of course.

566
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,740
To our own little rooms in Winkyland.

567
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,500
Yes.

568
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,340
Where no one ever goes home.

569
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,540
And there's never any war.

570
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,400
Never.

571
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,240
Ever.

572
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,960
It's all soft and fuzzy and pink.

573
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,540
War is good.

574
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,280
War is good.

575
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,060
War is good.

576
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,040
War is good.

577
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,840
War is good.

578
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,380
Makes Jesus laugh.

579
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,140
Makes the virgin cry.

580
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,060
Makes the children sing.

581
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:02,660
I love it.

582
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:02,660


583
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,700
He can blow the sky.

584
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,660
War is good.

585
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,520
War is good.

586
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,420
War is good.

587
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,200
War is good.

588
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,340
And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying,

589
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,780
O Lord, blessed is thy hand grenade,

590
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,460
that with it thou mayst blow thy enemies to tiny bits in thy mercy.

591
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,040
And the Lord did grin,

592
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,640
and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and calves

593
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,580
and elderbears and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large bits.

594
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,100
Give up your bits, brother.

595
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,300
I communicate without wires or strings.

596
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,060
I have the evil eye.

597
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,460
I carry the module bag.

598
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,460
I swam the Bermuda Triangle and didn't get wet.

599
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,380
I circumcise dinosaurs with my teeth and make them leave a tip.

600
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,880
I change tires with my tongue and my tool.

601
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,440
Every night I hock up a lunger and extinguish the sun.

602
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,940
I'm the big fitted devil of level 14,

603
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,780
who'll try to blow me down.

604
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,080
I've packed the brownies of the gods.

605
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,380
I am a mole radio.

606
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,960
I am a tomato dragon.

607
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,340
I am the killer whale bereft of its pup.

608
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,140
I have a triple backbone.

609
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,060
I was sired by the wolf man.

610
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,400
Give me all your slack.

611
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,400
I told Jesus I wouldn't go to church and he shook my hand.

612
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,720
I have my own personal saviors.

613
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,240
I change them every hour.

614
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,920
I don't give a have sex with.

615
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,480
If there's life after death,

616
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,380
I want to know if there's even any frigging slack after death.

617
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:43,840
House wants to know what makes you happy.

618
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,300
What are they stupid?

619
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,580
We allow you to show,

620
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,460
but this man stays a Eig STEP-U Guillem.

621
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,780
H sost extended his sentence from保护罘

622
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,360
and adds on an incredibly touching poem

623
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,360


624
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,360


625
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,360


626
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,720
All this warnin' you brutally.

627
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,520
I've made one my own,

628
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:53,880
a struggle of love for you all

629
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,180
and one I haven't backuped.

630
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,680
To set you back on the track.

631
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,780
To get home.

632
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:05,180
Death, death, death Death to the angel of death

633
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:11,300
Death, death, death Death, death to the angel of

634
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:17,000
Opposers say death cannot be killed Like the proper defensive skill

635
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,620
Yell it out with an angry sound Saying death, you're going down

636
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:30,760
Death, death, death Death to the angel of death

637
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,820
Death, death, death Death to the angel of

638

Death is coming, the end is near Grab a gun, put away the fear

639
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:49,040
Pull the trigger and blow him away Death, this is your dying day

640
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,280
Death, death, death

641
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:59,140
Death to the angel of death Death, death, death

642
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,260
Death, death, death Death to the angel of death

643
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,360
I've arrived from the other side To take you away

644
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,140
But can't you see I'm doing my hair?

645
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,800

Death to the angel of death You've succeeded where others failed

650
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:37,000
Your own life you have availed Then you draw your final breath

651
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,400
Death, death, death Death to the angel of death

00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,260
Death, death, death Death to the angel of death

656
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:52,260


657
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,380
Death, death, death Death to the angel of death

658
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:53,380


659
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:53,380


660
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:00,240
Death to the Angel of Death Death to the Angel of Death

661
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,060
Death to the Angel of Death

662
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:51,400
Death to the Angel of Death

663
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,800
Death to the Angel of Death

664
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,720
Death to the Angel of Death

665
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:20,400
Death to the Angel of Death

666
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
Death to the Angel of Death

667
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,040
Death to the Angel of Death

668
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,160
Death to the Angel of Death

669
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,680
Death to the Angel of Death

670
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,820
Death to the Angel of Death

671
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,280
Thank you.

672
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,440
The Brand Flakes once again in Trash Can Fun.

673
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:28,220
Before that, friends, Death to the Angel of Death from Consortium of Genius,

674
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:36,600
which is at www.consortiumofgenius.com, whereas Brand Flakes are at thebrandflakes.com.

675
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:42,240
Before that, friends, The Brag of the Subgenius, tweaked up by Dr. Philo Drummond.

676
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:51,000
I am now going to edit out Chaz and Dave besmirching the reputation of Elvis,

677
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,460
but you won't hear that, only this.

678
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,020
You got the king walking around.

679
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,760
Who would dare shoot the king?

680
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,900
No, I'm not going to listen to this.

681
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,340
I'm not going to listen to you talk about Elvis this way.

682
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,040
Hey, I used to work on the DAE, buddy.

683
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,580
I was a...

684
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,480
All the services were dying to get Elvis to join them.

685
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,360
They wanted, everybody wanted Elvis.

686
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:13,900
Yeah.

687
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,400
He went for the good old army.

688
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,640
He was...

689
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,380
The old army, regular army.

690
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,400
They tried to recruit him in the Secret Service.

691
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,680
Because he was a regular guy.

692
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,540
He was one of the people.

693
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,140
Yep.

694
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,500
Twice a day, he took a mean one.

695
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,940
He was regular as all get out, or as much as he could get out.

696
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,360
You see, the thing with Elvis...

697
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,140
And then I played Freebird and told them all to run to Canada.

698
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,100
Quickly, get out of the country.

699
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,820
You know, Chance, when I drove over here tonight...

700
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,400
As soon as you can.

701
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,220
I wore this little hat with my hair tucked up in it.

702
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,780
It's a blue hat that says...

703
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,080
Because I was feeling generally paranoid,

704
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,480
and I figured that my long hair and the...

705
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,660
Does it say, I love fishing on it, or what does it say now?

706
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,260
We're an attention getter, you know, of the wrong kind.

707
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,260
Although I then realized that to the cops,

708
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,540
a guy in a Hendrix shirt is probably going to be really harmless.

709
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,460
It's the ones...

710
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,560
It's the ones in the Skinner shirts...

711
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,060
Yeah.

712
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,620
...that they have to worry about.

713
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,120
Yeah, the stars and bars.

714
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,340
I've got it in my mouth.

715
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,440
I've got it in my mouth.

716
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,840
Bye-bye, Fernanda Nde, Limor.

717
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,020
What if the guys who brought over the slaves,

718
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,400
they'll just, like, let the slaves have their drums

719
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,780
and turn it into a big party?

720
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,300
Well, they didn't let them do that.

721
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,900
If you had a drum, they kind of killed you, I think.

722
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,040
And opened up the big...

723
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
Instead of opening up a big cotton factory,

724
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,100
opened up the biggest tourist attraction on planet Earth.

725
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,980
Well, guess what I heard?

726
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,680
Well, that's kind of what the U.S. is eventually going to turn into.

727
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,220
Yeah.

728
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,300
A tourist attraction that no one attends

729
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,540
because of threats of terrorism by the government itself

730
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,900
and because of rampant schizophrenia in the streets.

731
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,000
Well, now, that's your problem, Dave.

732
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,360
Yeah.

733
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,380
No, I think 60% of the children in a certain level of school

734
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,640
are on some sort of, like,

735
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,740
turn-in, drop-out, baby.

736
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,840
That's what I'd do if I had a chance.

737
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,340
But I don't know where...

738
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,200
I'm not talking about out in Ashtabula.

739
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,700
Just drop it there?

740
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,120
God, it might not come back.

741
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,680
I mean, we just, like, sink into the slush.

742
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,720
Living in Ashtabula is not dropping out.

743
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,440
Wow, man.

744
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,180
Well, you can drop out while still living in Ashtabula, can't you?

745
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,760
Of course you can even drop out from dropping out

746
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,500
because you didn't end the cycle.

747
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,580
Yeah, yeah.

748
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,880
When you repent and quit your job and slack off,

749
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,340
well, sooner or later, that becomes a job.

750
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,880
Take it from me, kids.

751
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,500
Right.

752
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,220
I mean, if you were to walk down the street naked every day,

753
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,820
wouldn't that soon become a job

754
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,560
and have no slack whatsoever?

755
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,620
The first day, think how much slack there'd be

756
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,340
just to be walking down the street bare naked

757
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,100
to have people going,

758
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,700
get the hell out of here, you know?

759
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,240
Well, the point is, when you're in a bag,

760
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,360
you've got to get out.

761
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,820
A bag?

762
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,760
Yeah, if you find yourself caught up in a bag,

763
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,620
then move.

764
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,180
Cut your way out of the bag.

765
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,120
So now we're thinking out of a box,

766
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,340
but we're being born again into different shapes in a bag.

767
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,560
No, you might just end up in another bag,

768
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,820
but at least it's a change.

769
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,360
Well, it's a change.

770
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,720
You might still end up in yet a bigger bag.

771
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,940
You get out of one trap and you're in a bigger trap.

772
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,040
You pull the wool, their wool, off of your eyes,

773
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,700
but your own wool over your eyes.

774
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,040
What's the difference, you know?

775
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,280
Finally, when you begin pulling the pubic hair over your own eyes,

776
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,180
is the truth finally revealed?

777
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,060
A falsified fact fried in deep fat

778
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:32,140
and kissed gingerly with three or four maraschino...

779
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,080
Ginger?

780
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,480
...that came back in your head and wiped your broken

781
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,180
OK, that hasien aoken angry.

782
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:40,560
A few weeks later...

783
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,720
resonate with you again.

784
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:42,720


785
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:42,740
Yeah, right...

786
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,260
Oh yeah.

787
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:43,260


788
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:43,680
Not the crown

789
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,620
Men will be there

790
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:02,660
Coming out

791
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:19,310
No more free will

792
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:27,170
No more free will

793
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:33,950
No more free will

794
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:44,190
No more free will

795
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,930
Would you like to learn to polka?

796
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,810
Yes, we'd like to learn to polka

797
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,950
First you put your arms around her

798
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,870
First you put our arms around her

799
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,730
Then you whirl away like this

800
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,690
Then we whirl away like this

801
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,630
That's the way to polka

802
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:13,090
B-B-B-B-feld

803
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:13,090


804
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:13,090


805
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,450
B-B-B-F-L

806
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,650
It's good if you just want to slap it

807
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:16,830
It's good if you just want to smack it

808
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:18,470
B-B-B-F-L

809
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:19,370
You're doing it the other way

810
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:19,370


811
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:24,830
A- nuovo

812
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:29,950
You're doing it!

813
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:30,130
Oh, say, интер Rap을

814
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:30,130


815
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:41,030
No more free will

816
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:48,850
No more free will

817
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:56,790
No more free will

818
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,010
The Brand Flakes

819
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:04,790
And now, more questions

820
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,770
So are we officially at war now, or what?

821
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,070
All three of us? Yeah, we're having a...

822
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,930
Are we there yet?

823
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:17,250
I don't think we were officially at war during Vietnam, Chaz.

824
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,670
Right.

825
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,690
No, I don't think we declare wars officially anymore.

826
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,970
We just send a whole lot of guys and they die and then

827
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:29,570
some politicians wave the flag and get some money suppository.

828
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:29,970
Security.

829
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,090
I've got some speeches for you to read.

830
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:36,810
The first one is by Julius Caesar, and the second one is from Hermann Goering.

831
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:41,330
Because the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip

832
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:44,950
the citizenry into a patriotic fervor,

833
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,950
for patriotism is indeed a double-edged sword.

834
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,750
It both emboldens the blood, emboils the blood,

835
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,570
just as it narrows the mind.

836
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,890
And when the churns of war...

837
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:56,530
Drums, I'm sorry.

838
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,050
When the dorms of war have reached a fever pitch

839
00:45:59,050 --> 00:45:59,930
and the blood...

840
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:02,790
Boils with hate and the mind is closed,

841
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,190
the leader will have to need...

842
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,970
Wait.

843
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,850
Will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry.

844
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:15,230
Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded by patriotism,

845
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:20,170
will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and gladly so.

846
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:21,210
How do I know?

847
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,350
Well, this is what I have done.

848
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,710
And I am Caesar.

849
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:27,070
And that was Julius Caesar.

850
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,050
Well, supposedly.

851
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:29,390
Oh, Julius Maximus.

852
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,930
I think he too was involved in that one.

853
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,850
Yes, the Lemur posted found that wonderful quote.

854
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,890
See, it goes back a long ways, doesn't it, Stang?

855
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,530
The idea of the consummate Maximus,

856
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:45,370
the dictator, as you were, as it was, as it is.

857
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,790
Oh, here's a good one.

858
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,990
From Hermann Goering at the Nuremberg trials.

859
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,810
For of course the people don't want war,

860
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:56,830
but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy,

861
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,030
and it is always a simple matter to drag the...

862
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:00,550
people along.

863
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:04,090
Whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship,

864
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:06,970
or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship.

865
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:11,170
Voice or no voice, the people can always be bought

866
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,390
to the bidding of their leaders.

867
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:14,690
That is easy.

868
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,030
All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked

869
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,810
and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism

870
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,390
and expose the country to danger.

871
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,190
I care for a lozenge here, Goering.

872
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:27,250
Or as John Ashcroft said,

873
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,110
to those who scare peace-loving people,

874
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,030
with phantoms of lost liberty,

875
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,750
my message is this,

876
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,010
your tactics only aid terrorists,

877
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,170
for they erode our national unity

878
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,230
and diminish our resolve.

879
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:42,750
That's right, Stang.

880
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,870
Any form of discarnate speech,

881
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:47,450
or any kind of enveloping, or anything like that,

882
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,570
causes a friction, or a fractility,

883
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,590
in the nation's body politic.

884
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:55,350
We lose our unity as a mass.

885
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,630
Much the way our bowels lose their expression of will

886
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:00,110
when the leaders cry.

887
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:04,090
His voice to us is like the voice of a huge proboscis,

888
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,850
ding-danging his quacking sound and his crying in the rain.

889
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:12,250
And you know what the horrible, horrible, horrible thing about all this

890
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,750
is at the same time that I get so, you know,

891
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:20,430
like ticked off of the blatant power,

892
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,870
blatant abuse of our powerlessness

893
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:26,170
that we all kind of have to sit and watch,

894
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,410
at the same time I find myself going,

895
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:32,090
gosh, I hope that our young soldiers can kill those soldiers

896
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,290
before they kill our young soldiers.

897
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:36,310
I hope the sleepy orgasm guns

898
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,770
put them all to sleep in a wanky humor.

899
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:39,330
Can you believe the weird, you know,

900
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:41,570
thoughts that you find yourself having?

901
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:42,730
Because I know a bunch of soldiers

902
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,730
that, you know, they're not being sent out now,

903
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,770
but they're being trained to be sent out.

904
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,190
Young subgenius!

905
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:52,370
I know a bunch of rebels.

906
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:52,690
American soldiers!

907
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,250
I know rebel soldiers hiding in the mountains,

908
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,690
waiting for the day when they can pour out like ants

909
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:58,490
onto your forehead.

910
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,550
And that's worrisome to me, you know.

911
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,170
I know, it is worrisome.

912
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:03,650
That's the kind of thing that makes me think,

913
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:07,350
gosh, I hope we really do have super death star bombs

914
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:11,590
that we haven't, that our wise leaders haven't revealed yet

915
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,690
that we can suddenly just unsheathe

916
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:15,210
and clobber everybody with.

917
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,150
I would like our...

918
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,930
Strike terror into the hearts of everybody

919
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,250
until terrorists, even in our own country,

920
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,910
destroy everything completely,

921
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,690
and then it's like Planet Games,

922
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,570
Road Warrior, and it'd be cool, man!

923
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,190
It'd be totally cool!

924
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:28,310
Zero.

925
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:29,390
You wouldn't have to work.

926
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:30,390
The sum total of all the sum totalists.

927
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,290
You'd just get up and either rape or pillage,

928
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,690
or be raped or pillaged.

929
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:34,670
You know, it'd be simple.

930
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:35,930
You wouldn't have these...

931
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,570
Stang, have you ever been raped and pillaged?

932
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,210
Worksheets you'd have to fill out.

933
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,590
No, they have workshops you have to attend,

934
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:43,290
and then you fill the worksheets out, either.

935
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:46,090
It's got a data blank on it, it's got a keep up date...

936
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,730
You would be like in the movies, man!

937
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:48,850
...thing on the bottom of the margin.

938
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:51,110
They're trying to prepare us for it.

939
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,490
We are in the movie, Stang.

940
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:54,990
We are in the worst damn movie ever made.

941
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:57,670
A movie made by big oil patrols.

942
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:59,130
By big oil consortiums.

943
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:01,270
And strange people with lizard eyes.

944
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:03,090
Yes? Oh, yes.

945
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,190
You look so...

946
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,950
As if it's far-fetched.

947
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:06,330
No!

948
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:06,910
How far?

949
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,210
No, I was just thinking how...

950
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:17,430
Dick Gregory used to say that Hollywood was always preparing you for what's next.

951
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:21,970
Now, I don't think that Hollywood necessarily does this in cahoots with other them.

952
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:23,870
Oh, they do. Yes, they do.

953
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:26,590
I don't know if they mean to, because, you know,

954
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:30,570
they all have the same pollsters and marketing experts.

955
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:31,810
Um, Stang...

956
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:32,850
And they all share the same databases.

957
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,690
Since I was an old guy...

958
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:35,730
Well, it's not an old guy.

959
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:36,870
I remember reading it, actually.

960
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:37,550
I don't know if you've seen it.

961
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,010
That was thousands of years ago.

962
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,630
Remember Jack Valenti, the motion picture industry guy?

963
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:46,550
I've met Jack Valenti, actually, and shook his hand when I was only 15 years old.

964
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,490
Did you shake his...

965
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:51,530
I was part of a CIA-sponsored propaganda thing.

966
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,070
As a young filmmaker, that's no baloney, but as you were saying...

967
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:56,530
You just proved me your point right here.

968
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:00,890
Jack Valenti, who is in fact, yes, one of what we would term them.

969
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:01,610
The mole.

970
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:02,530
Yeah, well, yeah.

971
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:02,970
The mole in the...

972
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:06,130
Well, I don't know who's the mole, whether the CIA or Hollywood is the mole.

973
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,330
The American motion picture...

974
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:10,930
The American information agents.

975
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,070
Oh, wow, what a wonderful title.

976
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:14,270
Information.

977
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:20,750
Would take my old stupid claymation film I did when I was really young

978
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,650
and submitted it to film festivals around the world.

979
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:25,590
I don't know.

980
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,630
I guess as...

981
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:29,270
The film is about communism and the evil it represents to mankind.

982
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,590
It was only much later that I realized...

983
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,190
...in your collective claymations.

984
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:40,490
There was something completely else going on that didn't have anything to do with some

985
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,950
stupid kid's claymation movies.

986
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:43,450
True.

987
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,070
Trueer than you ever could imagine.

988
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:45,890
Yeah, yeah.

989
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,450
It was really funny.

990
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,610
And of course, that was far, far years, thousands of years later.

991
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:52,750
Did you hear the new one?

992
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:54,270
Layers of geological time.

993
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:55,490
Unimaginable.

994
00:51:55,490 --> 00:52:01,490
Did you hear the new, in this geological era, this Pleistocene magma, the new paranoia

995
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:06,230
about, say, Burning Man, where you saw the quote-unquote film crew come in there?

996
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:09,570
Remember the very upscale film crew?

997
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:10,850
Yeah, yeah.

998
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,870
The scary, the one that scared me.

999
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:13,130
The scary one.

1000
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,210
I saw the devil, yes.

1001
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,510
I saw the devil.

1002
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:15,850
Okay.

1003
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:20,730
I have heard other people who have been to festivals and have seen the same, well, they

1004
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:25,410
described them as much the same and said they scared the bejesus out of them.

1005
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:29,490
And they said they had the strong feeling that they were some kind of government goons.

1006
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:30,170
Really?

1007
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:31,390
Well, that's what I heard.

1008
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:36,370
I just got the impression that these were some kind of rich, decadent aristos from some

1009
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:44,750
London disco video world that's beyond my realm of showbiz.

1010
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,270
Yeah, that's what they wanted you to think.

1011
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:52,610
The idea was when they point that camera at you, you're being irradiated at about 100

1012
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,090
millisquads per squack.

1013
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,310
I thought it was just the ass.

1014
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:59,450
Well, the acid was squacking at you too, but that's from a different gene pool.

1015
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:03,170
That's why I don't, you know, when some rich guy looks like the devil to me, I don't take

1016
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:04,170
it real seriously.

1017
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:06,310
I don't do anything about it, you know.

1018
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,330
It might creep me out for a minute.

1019
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:09,770
What have you done to his eyes?

1020
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,510
There's people that think I'm the rich devil guy.

1021
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:15,270
When the bullet has pierced your helmet.

1022
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:16,830
You know, it's like, whoa.

1023
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:19,090
This is the song you hear.

1024
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,850
La, la, la, la, la.

1025
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:23,870
Now, that depends on what movie you're in.

1026
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,290
Can you see Laura Bush in it?

1027
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:25,290


1028
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:25,430
Yeah.

1029
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:30,490
Laura Bush with the devil copulating and George sitting by waiting for the new spawn

1030
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:30,990
to come out.

1031
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:33,770
And Laura Bush walks up to you in an angelic little outfit.

1032
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:36,610
Two little slutty daughters.

1033
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:38,150
Dressed.

1034
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:40,790
Each one of them is sucking on one of those heart popsicles.

1035
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,070
Come on, play with us.

1036
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:47,010
And they have those weird devil eyes.

1037
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:53,010
Oh, Texas is the spawning ground of spate and in fact, spate and in the head.

1038
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,150
Come sleep safe and warm with us.

1039
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:57,290
Yes, Texas is heaven.

1040
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:02,490
Crawl into the baby crib with Grandma Bush for a real treat.

1041
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:04,290
Or a tweet.

1042
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,550
Hi, how are you?

1043
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:12,130
Your heart may belong to Jesus, but your ass belongs to the core.

1044
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:14,930
Your ass belongs to W.

1045
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:23,110
I just heard somebody on a Nostradamus program say that either Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin

1046
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:28,010
Laden, or somebody named W. Bus was the antichrist.

1047
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,750
They couldn't figure out the last one.

1048
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:34,090
The other ones, it was so easy to get to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, but the one that

1049
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:37,090
said W. Bus, they were like going, who could that be?

1050
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,810
What happened to that guy?

1051
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:43,030
Yeah, what happened to that Bin Laden guy and what was his name?

1052
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:45,510
Goldstein, that other dude we were supposed to hate.

1053
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:49,390
It seems like they changed the hate hour every month or so now.

1054
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:53,090
Well, Goldstein started another department store and I guess Osama Bin Laden was the one.

1055
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:53,090


1056
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:56,590
Goldstein has a huge number of car lots throughout the Midwest now.

1057
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:57,310
Oh, really?

1058
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,730
Oh, yeah.

1059
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:02,150
Starting in Detroit, he started with his empire and worked his way through central Michigan

1060
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,230
and now he's everywhere.

1061
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,370
Is he in competition with the Noriega car lots?

1062
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:10,290
The Noriega car lots have not been panning out too well over the last three or four years.

1063
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:11,270
Oh, those come out of Bogota.

1064
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:12,530
Yeah, they're going under.

1065
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:18,470
Now, a lot of the worried subgeniuses have been saying, what country should I move to?

1066
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,950
Right.

1067
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:19,970
That's a good question.

1068
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,210
Belize and Costa Rica come up a lot.

1069
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:22,950
Costa Rica's up.

1070
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,430
I've been suggesting Russia.

1071
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,830
I've heard since...

1072
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,270
It's silly over there now.

1073
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:28,130
It's nuts over there.

1074
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:29,470
It's a complete free-for-all.

1075
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,090
If you've got any money...

1076
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:32,570
You can get anything you want.

1077
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:33,250
You can get anything.

1078
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:36,510
You can live like Roman Polanski and Jack Nicholson.

1079
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:36,930
That's really decadent and weird now there.

1080
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:37,690
Yes.

1081
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:43,670
There's a great book called Exile about American expatriates in Russia.

1082
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:49,530
Making their own little communities along the river Don, the river Dnieper and the river

1083
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:49,970
Volga.

1084
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:53,070
Resting quietly in the fading sun.

1085
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,070


1086
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,070


1087
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,070


1088
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,070


1089
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,070


1090
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,070


1091
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,070


1092
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,070


1093
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:53,070


1094
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:57,290
Before the winter comes and they freeze their American poles to the world.

1095
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:59,390
That's what you get to think about for another...

1096
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,010
Happy Americans in Russia?

1097
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:02,750
Weak.

1098
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:03,990
Depatriated?

1099
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:04,150
Yeah.

1100
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:05,830
I thought...

1101
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:09,390
See, I first thought depatriation was something you had to do at a doctor's office.

1102
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:11,110
Like they remove the folds from your butt.

1103
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:11,230
Right.

1104
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:13,330
And then you would never get the folds again.

1105
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:13,770
Right.

1106
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:19,110
So like if your ass was too big, you just go get depatriated and you're like a GQ guy.

1107
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:19,490
You know?

1108
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:23,050
Next thing you know, the women in the Beechwood Mall are like, oh, I'm going to be depatriated.

1109
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:23,050


1110
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:23,990
And then they start like sneering at you and stuff.

1111
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,230
The ones that have lips.

1112
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,730
That's for the others, Dave.

1113
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,130
That's not for those like us who wear the bracelet.

1114
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:31,770
The secret bracelet.

1115
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:34,590
Oh, I saw those advertised on TV late at night.

1116
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:35,410
The secret bracelet?

1117
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:35,910
Yeah.

1118
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:39,590
I noticed Bush was wearing one the other night along with a decoder ring.

1119
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,710
And we don't even get one of those special decoder rings.

1120
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:43,870
He could just like whip it up there and go, General Franks.

1121
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:46,430
No, they're like some kind of healing thing or something, I guess.

1122
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:50,650
They say Kennedy was so horny, he would run off and leave the football.

1123
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:52,550
You know, the briefcase with the go codes.

1124
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,350
Yeah.

1125
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:57,330
And be, you know, Mr. President, we've got to get you out of here.

1126
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,970
I'll be with you in just a moment, boys.

1127
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:04,730
Till next week.

1128
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:08,290
I just want to make sure my bank is perfectly clear.

1129
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:10,210
I don't give a rat to ask what you do.

1130
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:12,470
Keep your sack in the saddle if you want to.

1131
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,790
Keep your hat on tight if you want to.

1132
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:15,870
Throw it away.

1133
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:16,710
I don't give a damn.

1134
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,190
Keep your hat on tight.

1135
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,490
You're back to the window.

1136
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:21,310
Yeah, that was wonderful.

1137
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,030
Yeah, it's important.

1138
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:22,530
Yeah.

1139
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:22,530


1140
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:23,490
I don't care.

1141
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:24,070
What do I care?

1142
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,790
Was, was watch your ass one of those?

1143
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:27,110
Invert.

1144
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:27,970
Wash your ass.

1145
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:29,510
Invert.

1146
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:30,390
Invert.

1147
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:30,890
In the saddle.

1148
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:32,110
Wash your ass.

1149
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,450
Wash your, and oil your saddle.

1150
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:35,430
Oil your saddle well.

1151
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:39,030
And make sure those feet are oiled too, the way Jesus liked to oil his ass.

1152
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,250
Keep your back to the wind.

1153
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:43,050
Spit.

1154
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:50,470
And so the Christ would swath it for many of his own testicles in the sad form of

1155
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:50,690
blood.

1156
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:52,890
That he could heal in battle.

1157
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:53,730
You'll feed my child.

1158
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:53,890
Go for it buddy.

1159
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,130
Whatever logic that man gives if I can have that much.

1160
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:11,350
Take me home you silly boy, cause I'm still in love with you.

1161
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:32,790
Friends, you are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack

1162
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,390
with Doctors for Bob in the background.

1163
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:40,570
You must write for free information if you don't already have that.

1164
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:45,430
Or you can check www.subgenius.com.

1165
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:51,990
But, but, you can still write to Bob and request that information from

1166
00:58:54,090 --> 00:59:03,810
Post Office Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1167
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:10,830
If, however, you have had a body in the house for more than five days,

1168
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,050
and if it is safe to go outside,

1169
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:15,410
then you should write to Bob.

1170
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:19,150
You should bury the body for the time being in a trench or cover it with earth

1171
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:21,310
and mark the spot of the burial.
