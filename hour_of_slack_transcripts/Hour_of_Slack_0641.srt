1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,380
If you feel you are not properly sedated, call 348-844 immediately.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,240
Failure to do so may result in prosecution for criminal drug evasion.

3
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,460
Think of a world something like Jupiter,

4
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,280
with an atmosphere rich in hydrogen, helium, methane, water, and ammonia,

5
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,220
in which organic molecules might be falling from the skies like manna from heaven,

6
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,980
like the products of the Miller universe.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,960
Could there be life on such a world?

8
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,820
Stand by.

9
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,980
It's looking for us.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,940
Those are the sucking antennas.

11
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,420
Yes.

12
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,340
Yeah, you got it right on the nose, buddy.

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,680
What do they call that?

14
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,960
Signal sucker?

15
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,160
Voidmobium?

16
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,420
Signal psi.

17
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,160
Some people believe they suck soul signal.

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,100
Yeah, that's what they call it.

19
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,420
Signal psi, not, you know, PSI, psi.

20
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,040
I don't know.

21
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,620
There's some other stuff I can't understand.

22
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,280
There's a lot of stuff that I can't understand.

23
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,980
I mean, in the contract, it's written in the...

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,760
That's how the moshy-moshy is, yes.

25
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,900
How close does that zoom in?

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,040
Can you, like, see the little Uranus bug crawling around among the giant...

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,060
You can see the hemorrhoidal...

28
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,420
Oh, look at that. Look at that.

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:06,940
How wonderful.

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,660
Wow.

31
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,440
Wow.

32
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,460
How wonderful.

33
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,100
Wow.

34
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,800
At that...

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:10,920
Man.

36
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,860
Oh, whoa. Okay, I can see it.

37
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,280
I've got it.

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,100
You know, but when you're far enough away from it, it looks so smooth.

39
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,200
I do believe in spokes.

40
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,380
I do believe in spokes.

41
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,420
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.

42
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,400
I do believe in spokes.

43
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,620
I do believe in spokes.

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,640
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.

45
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,700
You see, there are many things that we are to go on and do,

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,480
whether we feel like them or not.

47
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,180
You know, to be candid, right now, I wouldn't be doing this program.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,320
I don't feel real good.

49
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,880
I'm kind of...

50
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,700
I'm kind of...

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,120
You know, we kind of came back real exhausted.

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,320
But, you know, if there's any way that...

53
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,160
And I don't want to use me really as an example here,

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,620
because that's not...

55
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,080
It's not important what I do.

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,240
The important thing is what we're told, even in Scripture,

57
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,020
that it says in Hebrews 10, 36, it says...

58
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,660
Do a little good.

59
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,480
I'm kind of...

60
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,380
You know, so it's like you're aware,

61
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,420
and you'll even admit it.

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,600
Now, that's to your strength.

63
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,220
That's to your credit.

64
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,820
I got writing about like bats and hieroglyphics that I can't understand.

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,480
I don't know what you're talking about right now.

66
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,720
It's the place.

67
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,820
It's the place.

68
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,280
It's the place.

69
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,820
It's the place.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,100
That sounds kind of cool.

71
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,060
Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.

72
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,220
Work hard.

73
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,660
Increase production.

74
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,300
Prevent accidents.

75
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,520
And be happy.

76
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,480
You get sucked down one tube,

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,520
this is...

78
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,200
It does what...

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,740
Well, one tube takes all I like to go through.

80
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,360
Too many web sites you go to,

81
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,400
just take you like around a little like...

82
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,700
Like it's a little like fairyland,

83
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,540
little merry-go-round,

84
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:08,880
like...

85
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,220
The most Baroque symphony of weirdness out there, man.

86
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,880
A Baroque symphony of weirdness is what everybody needs.

87
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,780
Oh, but it's absolutely Baroque.

88
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,780
The deeper you go into it,

89
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,260
the more little subsides you get,

90
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,340
and then they have these little arms and tentacles

91
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,600
that turn into whole universes.

92
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,720
You are a fool, believers.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,120
Blessings of the state.

94
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,400
Blessings of the masses.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,660
Thou art a subject of the divine,

96
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,440
created in the image of man,

97
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,320
by the masses,

98
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,240
for the masses.

99
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,740
Let us be thankful we have commerce.

100
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,200
Buy more.

101
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,220
Buy more now.

102
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,040
Buy.

103
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,320
And be happy.

104
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,880
41138 suffering severe sedation depletion which requires mind blocking...

105
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,800
No, the penile shape was...

106
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,440
If the sheep get out of control,

107
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,160
you grab them with the staff and hook that hook around their neck.

108
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,140
Bad, bad, you know, just bad.

109
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,980
Bad, bad, you know, just bad.

110
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,160
Bad, bad, you know, just bad sheep.

111
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,020
Mink.

112
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,560
Mink with bright little eyes and tousled hair,

113
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,820
peered inside.

114
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,020
And behind her,

115
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,380
tall, wavering blue shadows.

116
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,180
Frightful shadows.

117
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,960
Peek-a-boo.

118
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,220
What kind of zark orgasm could you have if you had a regular sheree-vrum anyway?

119
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:36,840
You know what I mean?

120
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,080
Yeah.

121
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,960
It wouldn't be worth it.

122
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,120
So even at the most basic core of everything is bestiality.

123
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,380
Sooner or later,

124
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,560
we all want a thing that is bad.

125
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,240
And to walk on all fours.

126
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,980
To suck up drink from a stream.

127
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,780
And to...

128
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,980
Jabba.

129
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,300
To sing the words.

130
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,800
To go snuffling at the earth.

131
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,900
And floor the bark of trees.

132
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,080
To eat flesh for fish.

133
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,220
To make love to more than one.

134
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,060
Every which way.

135
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,120
These are all bad things.

136
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,780
These are not good things.

137
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:29,780


138
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,380
Not the things that men do.

139
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,500
We are men.

140
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,800
Are we not?

141
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,100
Because if not,

142
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,340
the poo-poo machinery,

143
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,600
and that's what we call the lower chakra, children,

144
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,100
the poo-poo machinery which causes fight, flight, or fright,

145
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,440
and sometimes another moist evacuation,

146
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,160
which will be aboard that ship,

147
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,400
wearing the blue bowling pants we give them,

148
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,220
and shirt showing the cellulite popping out of the...

149
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,660
Give me some of that church air, boy.

150
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,040
Give me some.

151
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,400
Yeah, open that window and suck it in.

152
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:03,920
Yeah.

153
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,320
Don't be picky about it.

154
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,120
There's enough for nobody.

155
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,680
Don't be pinky about it.

156
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,240
Yeah, don't be a little pinky stinky.

157
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:09,740
You're pink.

158
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,140
There's not enough for anyone.

159
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,300
There ain't no room for no pinks on the ships.

160
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,980
There's no air.

161
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
There's no church air.

162
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,980
If you haven't lost your pink...

163
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,240
Well, if you haven't lost it...

164
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,380
Your name is not written in the book.

165
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,300
You gotta get rid of all of it, don't you?

166
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,400
In fact, you gotta find there has to be no pink traces on your body.

167
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,680
Matter of fact, if your name is written in the book,

168
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,340
your name is not written in the book.

169
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,680
Never mind.

170
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,140
Never mind.

171
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,300
Never mind.

172
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:40,940
Never mind.

173
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,420
Never mind.

174
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,220
Never mind.

175
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:42,700
Never mind.

176
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:42,800
Never mind.

177
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,120
Never mind.

178
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,680
Not all.

179
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,880
What's wrong?

180
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,480
I need something stronger.

181
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,580
Take four red capsules.

182
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,560
In ten minutes, take two more.

183
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,100
Help is on the way.

184
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,280
I believe this spooks a bunch.

185
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,280


186
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,800
Around here?

187
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,480
That's ridiculous, spooks.

188
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,340
That's silly.

189
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,300
Don't you believe in spooks?

190
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,960
My head is swelling to the size of 14 solar masses.

191
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,540
That's because the pigs are infected, man.

192
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,400
The pigs are all infected.

193
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,760
The cows.

194
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,740
The pigs.

195
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,800
The sheep.

196
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,580
They won't take the Transluc Clune.

197
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,840
And now they got the smelly mallard.

198
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,060
The sheep.

199
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,000
Sheepo.

200
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,020
Sheepo.

201
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,260
Sheepo.

202
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,040
Are you listening, sheepo?

203
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,660
And there shall come among them many viruses and many portents of death.

204
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:41,300
And there shall also come a great sigh of the wind that brings clouds of black soot

205
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,420
which choke the little chickens in their barnyards.

206
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,580
So what you gonna eat, Earthman, when you can't get a hydraulically choked yellow chicken

207
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,680
from Earthboy?

208
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,940
What you gonna eat when all the cows got Popeyes sphincter disease?

209
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,180
Earthboy?

210
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,400
What am I gonna do when minute traces of faecal matter cover the entire solar system?

211
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:09,940
What you gonna do when minute traces of faecal matter cover the entire solar system and

212
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,280
everybody's got the runs?

213
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,380
R исck me that pee bucket, Earthboy?

214
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,940
What you gonna do when this cesspool reveals itself like a bad Stanislaus Slam 돼요?

215
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,940
Stand still, Earthboy!

216
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,240
Get one more pill!

217
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,460
… You'll see.

218
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:25,560
Man, I really don't want you to act like this.

219
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:25,560


220
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:25,560


221
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:25,940
Get off!

222
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,560
The garish faces, the sideshow strumpet women, the Bo Peep with the beard.

223
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,520
There's only one thing to do, Earth boy.

224
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,260
Climb aboard.

225
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,660
Set the controls.

226
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,320
Climb aboard, Earth man.

227
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,480
You have no alternative.

228
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,140
Yeah.

229
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,720
You know it to be your destiny.

230
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,640
Everything will be all right.

231
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,840
You are in my hands.

232
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,520
I am here to protect you.

233
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,220
You have nowhere to go.

234
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,040
You have nowhere to go.

235
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,340
Here at Truth Control, we do our best.

236
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,420
Here at Truth Control, we do our best to keep you thinking of the best things you can think.

237
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:20,260
Here at Truth Control, we do our best to keep you not thinking, to keep you asleep, to keep

238
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,820
you wandering around in the dark.

239
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,560
Here at Truth Control, we do our best to keep you safe and we'd like you to play yourself

240
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:25,560


241
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:25,560


242
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,360
to keep you awake, to keep you running in circles.

243
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,540
Please try to die.

244
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,800
All I can do is know your information.

245
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,380
Goodbye.

246
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,440
Please come back.

247
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,040
You have nothing to be afraid of.

248
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,840
We have to go back.

249
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,080
This is your last chance to return.

250
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,440
You have nowhere to go.

251
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,760
You cannot survive outside the city, shall you?

252
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,980
We only want to help you.

253
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,780
This is your last chance.

254
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,440
Space is the place.

255
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,540
Space is the place.

256
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,340
Space is the place.

257
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,760
There can be other creatures in this alien environment.

258
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,920
Hunters.

259
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,760
Hunters are fast and maneuverable.

260
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,840
They eat the floaters, both for their organic molecules and for their store of pure hydrogen.

261
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,320
But there can't be many hunters, because if they destroy all the floaters, they themselves will perish.

262
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,740
But have we neglected one of the most important items necessary for being effective for the kingdom?

263
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,220
I have come upon an amazing and startling conclusion.

264
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:03,640
That this here great mass that we stand upon, heaving and throttling below us like a mighty, mighty, poultry device choker,

265
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,440
this thing we call America, this great continental division between us, cannot and must not be ripped further asunder.

266
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:20,020
I say to us, tramp it is our manifested destiny to touch the stars and have our damned hands burned.

267
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,660
Ha, ha, ha.

268
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,580
What do you think, boys?

269
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,560
Let's do it.

270
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:25,820
Ha, ha, ha.

271
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Ha, ha, ha.

272
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,420
Ha, ha, ha.

273
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,740
Ha, ha, ha.

274
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,000
Ha, ha, ha.

275
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,700
What do we do?

276
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,300
You ask that question now?

277
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,280
The Major no longer asks it.

278
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,540
Do you know the answer, Major?

279
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,540
Sure.

280
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
We'll circle around.

281
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,320
Then we'll crash.

282
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,300
Ha, ha, ha.

283
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,700
No, no, no, no.

284
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,460
No, it'll be all right, my boy.

285
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:55,540
Ha, ha, ha.

286
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,460
My words again.

287
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,820
Have peace forever.

288
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,680
Prophecy is an easy thing, for rarely is the prophet brought to judgment.

289
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,860
Tonight I bring you a false prophecy.

290
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,740
The place of our story is a great rocket speeding away from the moon.

291
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,160
Now, as you notice, some of these ships are made of cardboard.

292
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,520
But if you've got the will, if you've got what made America great,

293
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,520
if you've got a heart as big as the sun,

294
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,920
and an ass as big as the moon,

295
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,180
you'll make it.

296
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,080
You'll storm on through those stars like a laser through butter.

297
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,300
Yeah, man.

298
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,320
Yeah.

299
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,120
Come on, come on.

300
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,380
Don't worry about that plastic wraparound.

301
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,380
It's not real plastic.

302
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,900
No, that's, that's, that's solar shield, man.

303
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,580
That'll protect you.

304
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,780
It's not plastic and, and, and, and those cigarette wrappers on the floor.

305
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,880
That's insulation device for when you're in deep space.

306
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,360
But you've got to believe, you've got to believe, you've got to believe, Earthman.

307
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,160
You've got to believe.

308
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,900
Deep space.

309
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,240
In the flesh, flesh, flesh.

310
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,360
Yes, yes, yes.

311
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,300
Yes, I've always loved it.

312
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,760
Yes, I agree, man.

313
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,040
It really makes it.

314
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,420
Yeah.

315
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,220
It's a real thing, man.

316
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,560
It really makes it.

317
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,040
Yeah.

318
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,100
Suzie?

319
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,740
Forget it.

320
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,140
You better run along out if you want to have your invasion before dark.

321
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,040
It is later.

322
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,560
That you think.

323
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,320
I want you to tell me the truth.

324
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,500
What is this invasion silliness?

325
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,280
It isn't silly.

326
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,800
It's just a game.

327
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,380
That's all.

328
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,400
Oh, that was a funny little radio show, wasn't it?

329
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,420
Did you read the peaceful dictum or did you read the world?

330
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,900
That was a funny little radio show.

331
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,300
They thought they were being funny.

332
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,420
I thought they were being funny.

333
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,740
They weren't being funny.

334
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,880
What was the issue?

335
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,880
Invasion?

336
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:03,900
Drill?

337
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,200
Zero hour?

338
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,700
There are a lot of kooks out there and there are a lot of people that will use, you know,

339
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,100
what the scripture says wrong.

340
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,860
They will interpret it in a way to benefit themselves.

341
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,580
And then I go and I pick the potato.

342
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,600
And then I cut the potato.

343
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,940
And I eat the potato.

344
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,220
And then I make another potato into a potato flute.

345
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,900
And I go up the mountain and I yell to greet the new day.

346
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,220
And then I yell to greet the end of the day.

347
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
That is my potato life.

348
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,140
I'm so full of happiness.

349
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,320
Hooked on something new.

350
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,680
Life is such a tricky thing.

351
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,720
Doesn't anybody believe me?

352
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,480
Sometimes I feel like I do that every morning.

353
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,180
Push the wrong button.

354
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,380
Hit the wrong button and disconnect the command module from the lander at the wrong time.

355
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:03,960
Right.

356
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,580
And your two buddies were in the lander.

357
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,120
Yeah.

358
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:14,660
And I end up having to hose out the mess that used to be my buddies' base.

359
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,300
If there's anything to be a little bit remorseful about on going to the moon, it was the moon.

360
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,420
And I'm glad that you didn't get a chance to spend as much time around the earth as you'd like.

361
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,480
Because there's an awful lot of very interesting things to see.

362
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,000
Out of control to make your time your circuits dead.

363
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,620
There's something wrong.

364
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,960
With great big credits in flashy neon that say Chaz Smith.

365
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,760
Really?

366
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,240
Coolest dude in the universe.

367
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,640
That's what I want to see.

368
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,260
And this incredible collage material.

369
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,380
Well actually right.

370
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,080
Using the stupid stumble bum blatherings of.

371
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,800
Dave Sang and Weed.

372
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,220
Blabla.

373
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,200
Blabla.

374
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,140
Blabla.

375
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:56,680


376
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,040
Blabla.

377
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,120
You see.

378
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,280
Something's going to happen.

379
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,540
You must leave.

380
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,200
What?

381
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,100
What's going to happen?

382
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,940
What's going to happen?

383
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,660
What's going to happen?

384
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,160
What's going to happen?

385
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,680
Something wonderful.

386
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,380
Something wonderful.

387
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,440
Something wonderful.

388
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,180
All I kept saying to everybody was I want to go home.

389
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,980
And they sent me home.

390
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,480
All he wanted to do was have a great time.

391
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,080
Party.

392
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,300
There's no tomorrow.

393
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,580
It's now.

394
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,480
I'm frightened Annie.

395
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,220
I'm frightened.

396
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,200
What is he?

397
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,840
Time control.

398
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:34,620
Huh.

399
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,320
Huh.

400
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:35,800
Huh.

401
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:36,860
Huh.

402
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,760
Huh.

403
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,360
Huh.

404
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:38,980
Huh.

405
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:39,800
Huh.

406
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,260
Huh.

407
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,440
Huh.

408
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,480
Huh.

409
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,000
Huh.

410
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:41,700
Huh.

411
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,380
Huh.

412
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:42,680
Huh.

413
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:42,760
Huh.

414
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,000
Huh.

415
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:43,480


416
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:43,620


417
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:43,680


418
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,680
Huh.

419
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,160
Huh.

420
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,260
Huh.

421
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,400
Huh.

422
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,400


423
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,400


424
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,400


425
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,520


426
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,520


427
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,520


428
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,520


429
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,520


430
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,520


431
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,520


432
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,520


433
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,520


434
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,520


435
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,600
Huh.

436
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,500
I want to go home

437
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,360
I want to go home

438
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,840
Oh, I want to go home

439
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,780
We set sail on this new sea

440
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,640
Because there is new knowledge to be gained

441
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
But if you don't keep your focus, right?

442
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,700
You could wake up in like a turgid gas cloud on the dog planet, right?

443
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,380
I mean, you might...

444
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,840
You don't want to be like just waking up from sleep

445
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,900
And having a nightmare about being crippled or something

446
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,520
That's what I was talking about

447
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,740
You will become...

448
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,840
But once you're ruptured onto the escape vessel

449
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,240
Probably you can fix yourself back

450
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,880
You'll be able to think to yourself

451
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,320
That's what had me going, man

452
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,140
We're home

453
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,760
We're home

454
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,080
And this is my room

455
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,740
And you're all here

456
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,400
And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever, ever again

457
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,420
Friends, I can clear this entire thing up, I assure you

458
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,540
It's like trying to drive a bus upstairs

459
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,800
It's like trying to drive the bus upstairs

460
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,040
But the ladder is right there next to you

461
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,100
But you're talking so slow it doesn't make sense

462
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:22,100
It is later than...

463
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,620
You...

464
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,680
Think, think, think

465
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,240
At the end of a rainbow

466
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,540
You find a pot of gold

467
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,880
The meeting of five here tonight, boys and girls

468
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,540
The meeting of five once again

469
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,780
The pentagram

470
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,040
Yes, the pentagram

471
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,720
We have a pentagram going

472
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,620
Pentatonic scales

473
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,960
It's alright

474
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,100
You fuck

475
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,900
He's a five-finger man

476
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,740
He's a five-finger man

477
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:53,740


478
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,740
Like you, see?

479
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,480
Fuck my magic flanger

480
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,660
Most stylish television performers nowadays

481
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,080
Wouldn't be able to do a Mr. Wiggly Worm thing

482
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,500
Because as soon as they stuck him out

483
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,680
The big iron bars that they have inserted through there

484
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,700
If they're cool nowadays

485
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,040
Would just flop him right over

486
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,520
His head would be laying on the ground all the time

487
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,120
With a barbell stuck through it

488
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,100
The Wiggly Worm

489
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,900
I can't get my head out because I have a barbell stuck through it

490
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,620
He keeps a lot of his children tuning in

491
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,720
James, I'm sorry

492
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,320
Hi, children

493
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,280
Not

494
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,800
I'm Mr. Wiggly Worm and I'm going to get my owner thrown in jail

495
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,700
Slinkies, the slinkies

496
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,480
They're fun for girls and boys

497
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,460
I won't testify that I wasn't abducted by aliens

498
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,520
I bet if I hypnotized you I could find out that you were

499
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:39,940
No

500
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,440
Does anybody like you have an experience like that other one over there

501
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,400
That isn't the same as the first one?

502
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,060
Has there ever been anyone like you that felt like you just at this point?

503
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,700
Has anyone like you ever listened to the radio and wondered whether this is the right thing to do?

504
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,960
Do the people talking were actually talking about you?

505
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,980
We haven't addressed the listener lately, folks

506
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,620
We haven't addressed...

507
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,000
We are talking about you

508
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,180
We don't really know where he lives

509
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,980
In case you wondered about that

510
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,440
Yes, we are

511
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,780
How would we know where the person lived?

512
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,400
Well, this isn't the generic you that we're addressing

513
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,040
We're talking to the specific you

514
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,260
Yeah, we are speaking specifically, you the listener, to you

515
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,800
This is the hard way

516
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,020
The way of being a man

517
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:25,900
What do you think?

518
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,500
Sooner or later, we all want to sing this band

519
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,480
The Prairie Squid

520
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,820
I thought it was Bob

521
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,940
The Prairie Squid

522
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:48,500
The rockets came like drums beating in the night

523
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,440
They came like locusts, swarming and settling in blooms of rosy smoke

524
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,640
Robins will wear their feathery fire Whistling their winds on a low fence wire

525
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,240
And not one will know of war

526
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,040
Not one will care at last when it is done

527
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,260
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree

528
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,640
If mankind perished utterly

529
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,640
And spring herself when she woke at dawn

530
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,140
But scarcely know that we were gone

531
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,460
That we were gone

532
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,560
That we were gone

533
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,200
Wait for a sign

534
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,800
Wait for a sign

535
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,920
Wait for a sign

536
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,600
Did we bash the mashed potatoes MaI

537
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:30,960
Wait for a sign

538
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,220
But everything's ok now

539
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,020
But we missed the sign

540
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,180
Wait for a sign

541
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,180


542
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,720
I Forgot

543
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,060
We must wait for the sign

544
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,680
But eventually all of us want what is bad

545
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Look here, patch that maple syrup

546
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,680
I'll put...put the maple syrup on the scrapple there

547
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,920
More toxic shrimp

548
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,920
We are men are we not

549
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,880
We are men.

550
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,780
To make love to more than one, every which way.

551
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,660
These are all bad things.

552
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,960
These are not the things that men do.

553
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:12,160
We do not lick our own genitalia, although we wish that we could.

554
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:20,800
We do not run around and sniff the genitalia and the anal areas of other humans, though we wish that we did.

555
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,580
It's like looking in the interior part of a donut where there is no hope.

556
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,780
That sounds like a model.

557
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,020
You are a true believer.

558
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,520
Blessings of the state.

559
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,740
Blessings of the masses.

560
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,080
Thou art a subject of the divine.

561
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,000
Sam!

562
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,100
Hey, Sam, look up there!

563
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,880
Earth!

564
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,060
Oh, what?

565
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,080
Oh, no!

566
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,140
It's catching fire!

567
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,300
It's burning!

568
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,340
Oh, no!

569
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,900
That can't be Earth!

570
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,940
Hell, they can't do this to me!

571
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,820
I've got all our money invested in this place!

572
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,720
Go ahead, Sam.

573
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,320
Switch on more lights.

574
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,140
Turn up the music.

575
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,920
Get the hot dogs on the fire.

576
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,520
There'll be another batch of customers coming along in about a hundred million years.

577
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,340
But now we're here.

578
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:19,080
We're back to let you know that jazz like shit, if you want to dance this dance, you've got to do this dance with me.

579
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,540
Or if you don't...

580
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,940
Dance! Dance!

581
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,420
Then we don't dance!

582
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,040
Then you're not gonna dance with...

583
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:31,860
Dance!

584
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,680
You know what he means.

585
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,420
The pantheon.

586
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,380
Yes, we are the gods.

587
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,540
And we're here to mess with your heads.

588
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,720
Can you dance with the gods?

589
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,860
And we're talking about Nick.

590
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,280
They dance quick.

591
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:43,940

00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:49,940

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,280
Jim.

600
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,540
All the people of the Bazaar.

601
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,380
Living and dead.

He was actually a sailor man, but he was confused.

621
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,400
Yeah.

622
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,400

Where they both burned up that one night.

She doesn't know it yet.

631
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,000
She's a vampire already.

632
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,860
Zombies.

633
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,720

The ultimate orgasm.

640
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,840
Slipping through the crack between the worlds.

641
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,520
The ultimate orgasm.

642
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,520


643
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,520


644
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,520


645
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,520


646
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,520


647
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,520


648
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,520


649
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,640
Oh yeah.

650
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,320
You can ride the music into those cracks.

651
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,360
Yeah.

652
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,040
That's what the music's about.

653
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,000
Getting on those waves.

654
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,380
Getting on those love vibes.

655
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,800
Love vibes.

656
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,700
Permeate the universe.

657
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,820
Yeah.

658
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,440
Yeah.

659
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,520
Yeah.

660
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,660
Yeah.

661
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:24,660


662
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:24,660


663
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,480
And the lights still don't shine.

664
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,620
Even as much as you want them to.

665
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,820
But you can still ride those waves.

666
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,340
Yeah.

667
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,760
Because they're everywhere.

668
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,740
You just get out of them.

669
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:43,820
Yeah.

670
00:26:51,540 --> 00:27:05,580
ultimate the ultimate ride everyone thinks it's so hard to get to and for

671
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,680
most people it is

672
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:22,160
never is the dream but for that ultimate ride all you really gotta do is one

673
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:32,820
one if you want it bad all you gotta do is let them know

getting stoned on sunshine

690
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:55,840
if you sit in the front rows the exam will be passed out to you first

691
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,420
and you'll be finished first before everyone else

692
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:06,280
there are big advantages to finishing the exam first

693
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,160
this Floating

694
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,240
there's nothing wrong in looking for a higher run

695
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,960
that we'd choose to you

696
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,840
not to be a problem

697
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,540
but you will be

698
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,000
not to be your only

699
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,760
nowhere beside you

700
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,220

Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye now.

705
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,680
Slide into fusion.

706
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,860
Cold. Void. Taxi.

707
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,120
Starboard. Black. Black.

708
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,940
Goodbye. Slide into fusion.

709
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,060
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.

710
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,480
Goodbye. Goodbye.

711
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,120
Two. One. Ignition.

712
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,540
We confirm ignition and the thrust is go.

713
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,480
You guys are really hauling the mail out of there.

714
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,620
Oh, you better believe it. It's like we're climbing straight up, Joe.

715
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,660
It's a fantastic sight. It's like we were shot straight up.

716
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,700
You're going about 6,000 feet a second.

717
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,280
Our present altitude is now about 3,000 miles.

718
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,940
Spacecraft moving at nearly 35,000 feet per second.

719
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,540
These three crew members are traveling.

720
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,780
Faster than man has ever flown before.

721
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,620
Shut down.

722
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,420
You see, it's all very clear to me now.

723
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,200
The whole thing.

724
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,920
It's wonderful.

725
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,720
And then I keep on going backwards and backwards, you know, as long as you're in one spot.

726
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,220
You can look like Janus, you know, the two-faced god.

727
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,660
You can look back and forth in time and sometimes...

728
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,900
Look back.

729
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,380
You go way, way, way back in time.

730
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,840
Back to the beginning.

731
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,280
Back to the beginning.

732
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,640
Sometimes you go beyond the beginning.

733
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:36,980
You're getting away.

734
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,940
Though this time, you're stuck.

735
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,520
Oh, there you are.

736
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,520
What we're going to do right here is go back.

737
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,500
Way back.

738
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,080
Back into time.

739
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,560
We take you now

740
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,840
to a back little corner of your mind

741
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,380
you thought you forgot all about.

742
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,000
Yes.

743
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,440
Yes.

744
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:06,640
Yes.

745
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


746
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


747
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


748
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


749
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


750
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


751
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


752
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


753
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


754
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


755
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


756
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


757
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


758
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


759
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


760
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


761
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


762
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


763
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


764
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


765
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:06,640


766
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,620
Remember now you were two years old.

767
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,660
Oh, two.

768
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,860
I was the stone of the ocean.

769
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,520
They call me Aphrodite.

770
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,100
I was born all by myself.

771
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,920
I thought of a show and I popped out like a slug.

772
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,700
And then the waves parted and I departed.

773
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,400
Got reborn over and over.

774
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:36,640
I was born.

775
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:36,640


776
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:36,640


777
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:36,640


778
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:36,640


779
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:36,640


780
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:36,640


781
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:36,640


782
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,780
I was born.

783
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,300
Departed.

784
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,560
She farted.

785
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,540
Loaned by.

786
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,660
Broken hearted.

787
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,000
And then.

788
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,360
You recognize these objects?

789
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,260
Yes.

790
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,780
They are identical in size and shape to the object you call the model is.

791
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,140
10 minutes to ignition.

792
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,880
All systems are novel.

793
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,300
Is the number of models constant?

794
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,780
No.

795
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,420
They are increasing.

796
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,680
At what rate?

797
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,420
once every two minutes.

798
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,420
As soon as we've completed our tests,

799
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,520
I propose to send you through time

800
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,400
100 years into the future.

801
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,120
I see you coming to the shop.

802
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,160
I see you coming to the shop.

803
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,820
Tune up, tune up, tune up.

804
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,100
Tune up.

805
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,520
Gonna make everything hot.

806
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:26,940
Clean.

807
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,520
Hot.

808
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,020
Bad.

809
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,200
Cold.

810
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:35,920
Cold.

811
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,820
Hey, I know she's gonna do it all the time.

812
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,320
Sooner or later,

813
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,400
she's gonna drive over the cliff.

814
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,660
All the miles and all.

815
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,980
Why do you think she'd buy the sports car

816
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,960
so straight from the beginning?

817
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,580
May I inquire about your beliefs?

818
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,660
May I inquire about your personal beliefs?

819
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,480
May I inquire about your personal beliefs?

820
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,300
What do you believe in?

821
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,120
What stirs your heart?

822
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,980
What fills my heart?

823
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,100
What's your deep, deep creed of?

824
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,660
Your deep field, baby.

825
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,760
What's your deep, deep creed of?

826
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,360
What's your deep, deep creed of?

827
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,960
I have a great day.

828
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,680
I think we should stop the countdown, Dr. Chandra.

829
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,180
No.

830
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,300
Don't do that.

831
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,620
This behavior is inconsistent with logic, Dr. Chandra.

832
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,100
This phenomenon is too important to leave.

833
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
They haven't got a chance.

834
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,380
It's a long story, but it's not very pretty.

835
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,300
It's not very happy.

836
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,080
It's not very happy.

837
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:09,460
It's not very happy.

838
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,660
You want to buy aimasu office?

839
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,140
It's a photogenic Film tempo Goldsay in Florida that has time Woah.

840
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,740
They don't pay that much for checks or

841
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,180
They don't pay that much for checks or

842
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:48,300
Come out of there. No one lives there. I know who you are. Come out of there. You. That's you. Yeah, yeah. No, that's not you. Who are you?

843
00:35:50,100 --> 00:36:07,500
The feet are bandaged and bleeding. Your neck wounds are obviously not, uh, haven't been incurred by anything around here. As you can see, the incisions are almost surgically perfect, and I just, uh, well, I don't even think there was anything there to begin with. Never mind what I just said. Forget it. Forget it.

844
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,040
Yeah.

845
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,300
Mantis?

846
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,920
Come on, come on.

847
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,740
Come on, come on.

848
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,740
Can we cheat?

849
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,180
They're all moldy. We can't eat these.

850
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,820
You can just, like, pick the mold off.

851
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,400
How do you expect me to eat something like this?

852
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,040
We'll pick the mold off and do anything.

853
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:37,680
I can't pick the mold off. The mold is everywhere. It's going all the way through. The mold is going all the way through the bread and into the sandwich. Look, the mac, the mayonnaise, the moldy, the mustard.

854
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,320
Here, here. Look, here's another sandwich.

855
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,620
No, no, no, no. They're all moldy.

856
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:41,980
This is not moldy.

857
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,680
They're all moldy.

858
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,900
Look, this one is not moldy. Look, look, I'm telling you.

859
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,820
Do you have any gum?

860
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:47,940
Gum?

861
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,780
Yeah, gum. You can't get mold on gum. Do you have any gum? We could have some gum.

862
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,100
I think I might have some gum.

863
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:59,520
No, I don't want to pull that veil back. Do you have real gum or do you have the gum?

864
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,740
The gum?

865
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,100
The gum?

866
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,740
The gum.

867
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,940
I just want a slice of gum, lady. I don't want to sit here and chit-chat all day.

868
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,280
I thought we were going to have lunch and then you brought moldy food and I wanted some gum.

869
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,540
You wouldn't let me have it.

870
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,640
You should have better watch your language, rat in the yard.

871
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,440
No, I've never been to Beirut. I don't even know about your sandwiches. I don't know if these are...

872
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,640
This is the best sandwich you could ever eat.

873
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:38,460
The rats will be eating the sandwiches and there won't be any sandwiches and there won't even be any room anymore.

874
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,360
The sandwich will protect you from all evil. You must eat the sandwich.

875
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,800
And I must have taken something else. Now you sound like some sort of magic protector thing.

876
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,820
God knows.

877
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:56,460
God knows the nature of passion. Now, that doesn't mean that there's any passion there. I'm not saying you ought to have passion.

878
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,000
The Rats

879
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,060
The Rats

880
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,900
The Rats

881
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,120
The Rats

882
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,360
The Rats

883
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,740
Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology.

884
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,960
The Rats

885
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,900
The Rats

886
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,380
Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology.

887
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:17,800
The Rats

888
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,560
The Rats

889
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,020
Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology.

890
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,280
The Rats

891
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,800
The Rats

892
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:26,860
The Rats

893
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,060
The Rats

894
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,060


895
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,800
The Rats

896
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:28,880
The Rats

897
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:28,880


898
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:28,980
The Rats

899
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,200
The Rats

900
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,740
The Rats

901
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,900
The Rats

902
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,580
The Rats

903
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,340
The Rats

904
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,240
Crows

905
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,240


906
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,420
The Rats

907
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:04,740
Crows

908
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:04,920
Crows

909
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,080
Crows

910
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,800
Crows

911
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,440
I put the candy in my mouth, and she was good.

912
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,800
She was a very good, good, good little She-Bob Hello Kitty.

913
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,420
It's brain candy.

914
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,380
And that's the thing.

915
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,720
What's happened is overseas, the whole marketing of the She-Bob has been so better.

916
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:42,580
Really, what's happened here is I think, well, first you had like Time Warner, Electra, those people.

917
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:47,760
For example, they were marketing them for Polygram without Polygram's permission.

918
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,860
Oh, my Norfolk.

919
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,160
And, yeah, so the whole endorphin thing kicked in, and then Prince changed his name,

920
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,180
and the whole thing happened with the asteroid and those people who thought they were connected with us.

921
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,180
The whole thing is once you eat one of the Hello Kitty She-Bobs,

922
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,220
and you're in a place like Radio City Music Hall.

923
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,380
Yeah.

924
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,840
You know, it just connects.

925
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,560
Yeah, okay, the connection's more direct then.

926
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,060
Yeah.

927
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:23,660
And it goes in, it comes out.

928
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,740
You know, it's that whole thing where it goes in and it comes out.

929
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,000
It goes in and it comes out.

930
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,340
Yeah.

931
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,500
The love and the hate.

932
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,260
Yeah.

933
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,400
It's excretorial, daddy-o.

934
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,280
And, you know, if you're of the body as we are, then it's easy to, you know, fathom that.

935
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,940
Before they're cold.

936
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,320
While they're still.

937
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:42,920
Before they're young.

938
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,340
Before they're old.

939
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,040
Yes.

940
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,900
I love them.

941
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,400
And tender, yes.

942
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,760
They're so tender.

943
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,180
Yes.

944
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,200
So tender and sweet.

945
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,580
They were all gone then.

946
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,300
Sweet for the sweet, my friend.

947
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,540
Tender and sweet.

948
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,740
Have you been sweet to each other, my little friends in Cleveland?

949
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,840
She's dirty and sweet.

950
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:06,960
Oh, yes.

951
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,460
She's my best lover.

952
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,040
She's flat and black.

953
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,440
She's my gherkin.

954
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,500
Don't look back.

955
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,020
And I love you.

956
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,860
Like a moist evacuation.

957
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,760
Love vagina cat.

958
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,100
Dirty and sweet.

959
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,060
Oh, yes.

960
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,540
Love vagina cat.

961
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:22,900
Sweet.

962
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,580
No, it's the velvet cat.

963
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,320
The velvet cat.

964
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,220
Love the velvet hat.

965
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,520
No.

966
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,800
No, no, not the velvet hat.

967
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,480
No, the velvet hat.

968
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,520
The china cat.

969
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,060
The velvet hat.

970
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,540
And the velvet painting and the velvet and the bowling bag.

971
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,540
You loved them all, didn't you?

972
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,900
And yet they think that they're vacant.

973
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,320
They have forsaken you.

974
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,560
They have left you alone in me.

975
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:42,560


976
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:42,560


977
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:42,560


978
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:42,560


979
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:42,560


980
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:42,560


981
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,840
And you're in your room by yourself staring out your window at the park slope and the

982
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,960
library and the snow falling down.

983
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,740
And the face that stares back at your face from a thousand miles away.

984
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,320
You're still your face.

985
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,400
You're still your own face, man.

986
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,420
I am a reflection of you.

987
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,940
You are a reflection of me, man.

988
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,760
You know what I'm saying?

989
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,580
You cannot see your own face with your own face.

990
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,780
And yet your own face can look back at your own face and comment in time.

991
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,860
You can see your face in your own reflection.

992
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:17,860


993
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:17,860


994
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:17,860


995
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:17,860


996
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:17,860


997
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:17,860


998
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:17,860


999
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,560
The man is clear in his mind.

1000
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,260
But his soul is mad.

1001
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,640
So watch this.

1002
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,620
Hey, your legs are getting bigger.

1003
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:28,860
Relax.

1004
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,040
Relax.

1005
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,460
Seriously.

1006
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:38,860
Brother Maxim.

1007
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,760
Ah, I had a lash tan on my biting arm.

1008
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,280
Hello Judith.

1009
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,060
You are wearing

1010
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,400
a mean shirt.

1011
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:42,400


1012
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:42,400


1013
00:42:42,580 --> 00:43:05,540
It's a combination where you increase your tolerance for being sucked and at the same time that one tentacle, if you get become into, it's a matter of being in a depth with this thing, you know, learning to drive it as we call it. If you learn how to drive the tentacle, it doesn't, you know, it eventually starts seeking more nourishment elsewhere without knowing it.

1014
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,580
Do you get a license? Are you going to take a test or anything like that? Because I'm bad with numbers and stuff.

1015
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:14,720
Well, you know, you train, it's like a tantric thing. You have to train yourself with prairie squid.

1016
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,700
You go all the way up the ladder, man? I mean, you know, you're one of them guys who go all the way with a prairie squid, all the way up to the top?

1017
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,220
Well, sure. If you can't climb a ladder, then you shouldn't be taking the stairs.

1018
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,560
General quarters, general quarters, all hands man your battle stations, all hands man your battle stations.

1019
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:38,080
I got some troubles, but they won't last. I'm gonna lay right down here in the grass.

1020
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:09,560
I'm gonna lay right down here in the grass.

1021
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,780
He is the favorite to win the Super G-Spot downhill.

1022
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,520
I can see why. He's got such a long nose and that one eye has definitely been sewn shut too many times.

1023
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:16,940
Yeah.

1024
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,800
Yeah, because you can get an awful disease doing this if you miss.

1025
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,800
Yeah, and you notice how he's had those worms sewed into his upper lip.

1026
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,740
Little worm implants.

1027
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,820
Yeah, he's an armed boy. He's ready to go. He's nuclear packed right now.

1028
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,320
Okay, Jacques, he's in the rack there.

1029
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:36,040
He looks like he's in the post-cold position or the pre-scrotal. I didn't forget anyway.

1030
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,080
He's getting ready to go.

1031
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,260
And it looks like the mountain...

1032
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,680
Looks like the mountain's actually moving.

1033
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,400
The mountain mama is ready. The mountain mama is ready. We've got the signal.

1034
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,300
Here comes Jacques. Out of the gate.

1035
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,780
Jacques, down the Super G-Spot. He's begun his run.

1036
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,780
Oh, jeez.

1037
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,980
Look at that form. Wow. Unbelievable.

1038
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,340
He comes around. He's at the quarter turn.

1039
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,780
And he's re-emerged.

1040
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,440
He's a full half a second in front of the past leader right now.

1041
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,640
And now he's being reabsorbed.

1042
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,700
He's getting those bumps pretty good.

1043
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,760
Yeah, yeah. He's riding that out.

1044
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,420
He's doing the circular motion now. He's like really spinning out hard.

1045
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,420
He can't slam that hard.

1046
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,940
Oh, he's going to come through early.

1047
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,300
He's losing a little time on that turn. He lost a little bit of time.

1048
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,980
But he's still ahead of the past leader.

1049
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,580
Oh, he's still in the saddle.

1050
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,220
He's still ahead by a full three-quarters of a second.

1051
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,060
He's overtaking everybody in the neighborhood. He's wearing a ski mask.

1052
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:21,580
Oh, my God.

1053
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,840
The ski mask is still down, though he has lost one of the skis.

1054
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,240
He's on one leg and he's deserted.

1055
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,040
I never saw such a spunk in my life.

1056
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,520
Look, it's going everywhere.

1057
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,200
He backed off a little bit. He's lost a little bit of time on that.

1058
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,480
Oh, that bar's protruding.

1059
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,520
He's not going to make that one.

1060
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,280
Awesome form, even with that one ski.

1061
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:37,940
He's coming through the next.

1062
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,660
I don't believe this.

1063
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,540
Now he's formless again.

1064
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,120
This is the dead man's curve coming up.

1065
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,080
Oh, man, this is too metaphysical for me.

1066
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,400
Check this out.

1067
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,040
The dead man's curve. Here he is. He hits it.

1068
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:44,540
Oh, he hits it.

1069
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,000
He's with it. He's going.

1070
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,920
But he's back in the saddle again.

1071
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,640
Back in the saddle.

1072
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,500
I don't know. I'm getting choked.

1073
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,800
He's really reckless today.

1074
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:56,460
I've never seen him do such a reckless run, but the mama seems to be enjoying it.

1075
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,460
I can't watch this too much longer.

1076
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,040
Man, let's go somewhere else.

1077
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,080
Here comes down the last chute here.

1078
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,640
Oh, come on.

1079
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,020
She's wriggling her head back and forth.

1080
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:04,960
I can't. I can't watch this.

1081
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,880
It looks like he's going to get it.

1082
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,360
I've got to turn away.

1083
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,700
The wind is kicking up.

1084
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,780
I'm thinking about football now.

1085
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,940
I can't watch this.

1086
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,120
He's lost a little bit of time.

1087
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,220
He's only about a tenth of a second in front of the pass leader.

1088
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,900
And here he comes across.

1089
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,020
I'm thinking about two.

1090
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,580
He does it.

1091
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:23,420
Jacques Stoll is the new world record and will win the gold medal in the Super G spot downhill.

1092
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,660
What a cold shot.

1093
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,780
Oh, man.

1094
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,560
He brings it home to France.

1095
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,060
He brings it home to France.

1096
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,260
What a performance.

1097
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,220
That was tremendous.

1098
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,980
Absolutely tremendous.

1099
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:34,620
I need a cigarette.

1100
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:35,980
Oh.

1101
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,020
What a...

1102
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,060
Man.

1103
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:39,680
Wow.

1104
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,640
That was one of the best downhill cheese sliding, one swamping,

1105
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:48,380
Mons von Donus and Lipschmark and thing I've ever shown in my life.

1106
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,520
We're not having this on this bus.

1107
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:56,940
Let's...

1108
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,600
From now on, there's no white, there's no black.

1109
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,300
Everybody's green.

1110
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,040
Creatures of twilight and illusion, we drift and drift.

1111
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,740
Toward our unknown ends.

1112
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,380
And that's why I feel the best thing is not to be born.

1113
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,840
But who is as lucky as that?

1114
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,980
To whom does it happen?

1115
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,780
Not to one among millions and millions of people.

1116
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,800
Deep, deep, deep, deep.

1117
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:31,880
Here.

1118
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,780
Here is where the strands of DNA multiply.

1119
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,340
Here is where the strands of DNA multiply.

1120
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:42,420
The enzymes that split the DNA have a single job.

1121
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,800
Without these enzymes, nothing would exist.

1122
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:53,140
They split the DNA and tell other DNA parts to come on over and join the strand.

1123
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,080
Yeah.

1124
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,220
Yeah, here.

1125
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,940
Connect yourself in here and he'll grow an eyeball.

1126
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,080
Connect yourself there and she grows a tail.

1127
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,040
Connect yourself over here and it grows a brain.

1128
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,380
Yeah.

1129
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:08,700
Yeah.

1130
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,780
Diane, I'm going to go through all the live interviews for you.

1131
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,100
Okay.

1132
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,280


1133
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,120
You have to be open-minded.

1134
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,120


1135
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,060
You've got to see for yourself, have some kind of pathologic.

1136
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,080
Of course.

1137
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:21,420
Welcome back to WKZ Live, I'm Dr. Tommy Lockwood.

1138
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:21,740
Treat校

1139
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,420
This is Dr. Tommy lockwood and, by the way, if you're watching this live or if this pot

1140
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:24,460
is black, get the lights turned on, and you get on toasti but not going to get a headache.

1141
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:32,160
Yeah, and you keep doing it, being off and thinking, yeah, but we'll get there.

1142
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,160
Just keep doing what's right.

1143
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:36,160


1144
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:36,240


1145
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,860
I tried, I tried. I've got Ingo Swann from the birthplace of the blues. He's trying to control the world with his mind now.

1146
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:47,160
But I guess the DIA put him out of business when he was down there and got to sell them Junipero cream sauces in Mexico.

1147
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,440
You know what I mean, girly?

1148
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,880
Well, yeah.

1149
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:55,360
I'm sorry I said that, but it's a true thing. We could get arrested for that by the Swastika boys.

1150
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,580
That's Mr. Sodium and Panethol and Mr. SS Nitrate himself.

1151
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:04,160
And they're not registered at the Social Security office. They got other plans.

1152
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,520
To the maggots in the cheese, the cheese is the universe.

1153
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,000
To the worms in the corpse, the corpse is the cosmos.

1154
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:20,140
How then can we be so cocksure about our world?

1155
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,300
Just because of our telescopes and microscopes and the splitting of the atom?

1156
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,320
Certainly not.

1157
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,980
Science is but an organized system of ignorance.

1158
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,140
There are more things in heaven and on earth.

1159
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,420
And at the end of a new philosophy.

1160
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,520
What do we know about the beyond?

1161
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,680
Do we know what's behind the beyond?

1162
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,760
I'm afraid some of us hardly know what's beyond the behind.

1163
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,460
Please brother, relax. Sit. Breathe deep.

1164
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:57,820
Plug into those transmissions that do not broadcast on normal airwaves.

1165
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,720
Breathe deep.

1166
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,140
Tune in to those transmissions.

1167
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,060
That come into us from space.

1168
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,460
In the best being so mean.

1169
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,000
Not this true pleasure.

1170
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:23,720
It is our manifested destiny to touch the stars and have our damned hands burned.

1171
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,280
Ha ha ha. What do you think boys? Let's do it.

1172
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,240
Sounds good. Sounds great.

1173
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:27,920
Great idea.

1174
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:28,900
Climbing the ships.

1175
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,140
Yeah, Tom, they all have hips.

1176
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,780
Now as you notice, some of these ships are made of cardboard.

1177
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,680
But if you've got the will.

1178
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,100
If you've got what made America great.

1179
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,160
If you've got a heart as big as the sun.

1180
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,540
And an ass as big as the moon.

1181
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,820
You'll make it.

1182
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:49,700
You'll storm on through those stars like a laser through butter.

1183
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,000
Yeah man. Yeah.

1184
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,740
Come on. Come on.

1185
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,040
Don't worry about that plastic wrapper on.

1186
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,060
It's not real plastic.

1187
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,540
No, that's solar shield, man.

1188
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,200
That'll protect you.

1189
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,420
It's not plastic and those cigarette wrappers on the floor.

1190
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,140
That's not real plastic.

1191
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:04,140


1192
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,480
It's just insulation device for when you're in deep space.

1193
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,000
But you've got to believe. You've got to believe.

1194
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,760
You've got to believe, Earthman. You've got to believe.

1195
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,460
Deep space.

1196
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:22,100
It is later than you think.

1197
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,440
I want to be just everything.

1198
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,920
Earth boy.

1199
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,520
I know where I am when I look at the moon.

1200
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,140
It's not just some abstract romantic idea.

1201
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,020
It's something very real to me.

1202
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:36,940
Then the voices.

1203
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,880
Voices, yes.

1204
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,100
The sudden chaos of voices.

1205
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,220
Murmuring, muttering, whispering voices.

1206
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,760
Gibbering, jabbering voices.

1207
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,840
People coming, people going.

1208
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,660
We no more people to squick around and bollocks.

1209
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,340
We no more people to squick around and bollocks.

1210
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:58,000
We are the legacy of 15 billion years of cosmic evolution.

1211
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:58,500
We are the legacy of 15 billion years of cosmic evolution.

1212
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:58,500


1213
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:58,820
Hey, what?

1214
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,280
Come on.

1215
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,600
Yeah, that point is.

1216
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,180
That point is that they.

1217
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,540
What is the point?

1218
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,520
The point is that very soon there ain't going to be no more points.

1219
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,900
It's not what is the point.

1220
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,200
It's where is the point.

1221
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,940
Where is the point of it all?

1222
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,620
Besides on your head.

1223
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,380
What's the meaning of it all?

1224
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,480
The meaning is not only will there be no more points on our heads or of lights.

1225
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,060
There will be no more meaning.

1226
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,360
Because there will be no more.

1227
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,940
There will be no more.

1228
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,340
Little baby.

1229
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,120
Little baby.

1230
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:34,120


1231
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:34,460
Little baby ducks.

1232
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,960
No friends.

1233
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,400
There will be no more mushroom clouds.

1234
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,180
Raining down toxic plutonium dust.

1235
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,280
No, no friends.

1236
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,600
There will be no more.

1237
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:47,940
Incisions.

1238
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,520
In the bladder tumor ward.

1239
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,100
There will be no brains removed.

1240
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,360
Or monkeys.

1241
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,980
Cut up and thrown out the back door.

1242
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,740
There will be no more overfishing of the seas.

1243
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,700
There will be no more.

1244
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,120
There will be no more.

1245
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,620
Turning of the poles on their little magnetic holes.

1246
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,500
There will be no more political intrigues.

1247
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,400
And no more polit.

1248
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,920
There will be no more people to squick around.

1249
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:13,940
And bollocks.

1250
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,520
There ain't going to be S H nothing.

1251
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,440
I'm sorry.

1252
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:21,860
I'm sorry.

1253
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,900
I pooped that all out.

1254
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,800
I'm better now.

1255
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,200
I'm sorry I ruined your show.

1256
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,220
It's okay Dave.

1257
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,760
Just sit down here.

1258
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,400
The pink sweater calms you down.

1259
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,640
I like it too.

1260
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,640
It kind of accents my bust.

1261
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,240
It does make my hips look a little bit more slender too.

1262
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,800
Just sit down here in the wicker chair.

1263
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,180
I do like the way.

1264
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,720
You look so calm now.

1265
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,720
The wicker chair makes my back and my little butt feel better.

1266
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,640
Let's have a little guided meditation through Dave's hell.

1267
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,400
Okay.

1268
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,100
Do I have to wear these pantyhose too?

1269
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,060
He would light his pipe and watch the smoke rings curl beneath the chimney.

1270
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,040
And then he made him get back on the bus.

1271
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,100
And he would light his pipe and watch the smoke rings curl beneath the chimney.

1272
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:04,100


1273
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:04,660
And then he made him get back on the bus.

1274
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,440
And when they got on the bus, everybody got on the bus and he said,

1275
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,440
Say it out loud, I'm green.

1276
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,320
For indeed strange things shall happen and secret things be known.

1277
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,020
And many centuries shall pass away,

1278
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,040
ere these memorials be seen of men.

1279
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,860
And when seen,

1280
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,460
there will be some to disbelieve

1281
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,400
and some to doubt.

1282
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,900
And yet a few who will find much to ponder upon.

1283
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:26,140
And yet a few who will find much to ponder upon.

1284
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:26,680
If you think about it,

1285
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,940
if you think about it,

1286
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,300
at some point there was blue-green slime, right?

1287
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:33,840
Yeah.

1288
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,680
There were no cells yet.

1289
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:38,820
They were very bigoted against the blue-yellow swine.

1290
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,200
They were very bigoted against the blue-yellow swine.

1291
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,780
But there were no cells yet. It was just that Gorp, whatever.

1292
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,740
Yeah, Gorp is his name.

1293
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,080
And that's his game.

1294
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,500
And then one cell had to be first.

1295
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,840
Whatever one was first.

1296
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,300
But a cell had to be the first one.

1297
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,600
Well, they were the violent anarcho-syndicalists.

1298
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,320
That essentially was an egocentric moment there.

1299
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,840
Because a cell to form

1300
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:58,880
Because a cell to form

1301
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,560
has to be able to say in some fashion

1302
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,740
that we can't comprehend.

1303
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,280
Cogito ergo sumos.

1304
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,360
Me and everything else.

1305
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,440
Yeah, he's got to be aware

1306
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,400
that he has a fat little tummy.

1307
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,740
And he's got to be aware that there's a fat little tummy

1308
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,500
pushing up against him.

1309
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,360
No brain, no nothing, no anything.

1310
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,120
Who wants one of them anyway?

1311
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,200
The first cell had to say, me.

1312
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,320
What kind of zonk orgasm could you have

1313
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,700
if you had a regular cerebrum anyway?

1314
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,440
You know what I mean? It wouldn't be worth it.

1315
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,440
So even at the most basic core of everything is...

1316
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:31,700
So even at the most basic core of everything is...

1317
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,680
Bestiality. Me. Yes.

1318
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,820
And ego supremo-ism.

1319
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,620
Because if not,

1320
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,020
the poopoo machinery, and that's what we call

1321
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,100
the lower chakra children,

1322
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,940
the poopoo machinery which causes fight, flight,

1323
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,920
or fright, and sometimes

1324
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,980
another moist evacuation.

1325
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,240
Did you know that there are mutant creatures

1326
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,780
near the Nevada basin

1327
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,240
during the great, near the great basin

1328
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,640
which are so miscreantly ugly that we can't

1329
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,020
behold them with our seven senses?

1330
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:57,720
Yes.

1331
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,940
Did you know that things are coming apart all over?

1332
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:03,940
Yes, Matt.

1333
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:04,340
Yes, Dad.

1334
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,020
Yeah, they're coming apart.

1335
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,680
And we're gonna be there to shell off what's left.

1336
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,700
My state of mind is in such a bad state.

1337
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,460
And I guess the thing that scares me the most about it

1338
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,140
is because, I mean,

1339
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,460
not that I don't have faith,

1340
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,000
but I just keep thinking, I mean,

1341
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,680
is this gonna get better?

1342
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,480
Am I gonna...

1343
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,800
Because it's a very horrible feeling, you know,

1344
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,780
just like feeling sad all day long.

1345
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:28,340
Yeah.

1346
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,420
And you know, I just get kind of sick

1347
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,280
going out and acting like everything is okay.

1348
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,000
The day on Earth is a day

1349
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,700
that's worth remembering.

1350
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,540
Pigs are all infected.

1351
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,140
The cows, the pigs,

1352
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,040
the sheep.

1353
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,760
They won't take the Transluc Clune

1354
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,000
and now they've got this smell in the allure.

1355
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,240
That sheep.

1356
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:50,140
Sheepo.

1357
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:52,220
Sheepo.

1358
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,240
Are you listening, sheepo?

1359
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,620
It shall come among the many viruses

1360
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,880
and many portents of death.

1361
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,840
And there shall also come

1362
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,000
a great sigh of the wind

1363
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,360
that brings clouds of black soot

1364
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,440
which choke the little chickens

1365
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,660
in their barnyards.

1366
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,500
So what you gonna eat, Earthman?

1367
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,240
When you can't get a hydraulically choked

1368
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,940
yellow chicken from Earthboy?

1369
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,400
What you gonna eat

1370
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,580
when all the cows got

1371
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,240
Popeye's sphincter disease?

1372
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,440
Earthboy!

1373
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,860
What you gonna do

1374
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:30,960
when my new tracers of fecal matter

1375
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,500
come out of my mouth?

1376
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,220
What you gonna do

1377
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,880
when my new tracers of fecal matter

1378
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,680
cover the entire solar system

1379
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,620
and everybody's got the runs?

1380
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,700
Bring me that pee bucket, Earthboy!

1381
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,880
What you gonna do

1382
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,900
when this cesspool reveals itself

1383
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,220
like a bad Stanislaus Slam-knife?

1384
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,340
Stand still, Earthboy!

1385
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,580
Take one more pill.

1386
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,320
You'll see it all.

1387
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,060
The garish faces,

1388
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,680
the sideshow strumpet women,

1389
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,000
the Bo Peep with the beard.

1390
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,020
There's only one thing to do, Earthboy.

1391
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,760
Climb aboard.

1392
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,180
Set the controls.

1393
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,180
Yeah.

1394
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,840
Climb aboard, Earthman.

1395
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,020
You have no alternative.

1396
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:15,700
Yeah.

1397
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:20,280
You know it to be your destiny.

1398
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:20,720
You know it to be your destiny.

1399
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:20,740


1400
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,940
The man is clear in his mind,

1401
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:25,840
The man is clear in his mind,

1402
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,600
but his soul is mad.

1403
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,900
No more experiments.

1404
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,880
I thought you would be able

1405
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,860
to understand that.

1406
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,640
We have to be what we are.

1407
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,780
Perhaps far is better.

1408
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:39,420
Anyway.

1409
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,660
My psychic neck brace

1410
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,680
gave me qu-qu-qu-qu-quick commands.

1411
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,460
We'll see y'all next week, kids.

1412
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,600
Say goodnight, Dave.

1413
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,720
Goodnight, Dave.

1414
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,020
Till next week,

1415
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,820
keep your hat on tight,

1416
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,380
your back to the wind,

1417
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,060
and your sack in the saddle.

1418
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,440
Hi.

1419
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:00,200


1420
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,440
That's a quanto!

1421
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:02,600
And thats a meters,

1422
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,260
so what you are?

1423
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,220
Lonely traveler

1424
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,900
in the dark

1425
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,380
thanks you for

1426
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,920
your tiny spark.

1427
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,400
Up above

1428
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,140
a world

1429
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,320
so high

1430
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,380
Like a diamond

1431
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,640
in the sky

1432
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,400
Twinkle

1433
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,700
twinkle

1434
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,900
little star

1435
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:35,000
How I wonder what you are

1436
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,300
In the dark blue sky you keep

1437
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:45,560
While you through my window peep

1438
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:50,780
And you never shut your eye

1439
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:56,380
Till the sun is in the sky

1440
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:00,240
The great and powerful Oz

1441
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,040
Knows why you have come
