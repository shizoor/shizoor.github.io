1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
Oh, yes. Oh, good. Oh, good. Good, good, good.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:15,260
Ah, good. Oh, it sounds so, so very much better.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,080
But it works.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,700
All cities and nations, if you do that.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,000
International studies in the 1990s.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,620
Our ministry.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
Well, what do they say?

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,860
That, you know, God.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,500
With great expectation.

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,100
Foot of your hand.

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,180
How many of you know God is really sneaky?

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,820
This is the story of life.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,960
Where you came from, how and why you were born.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,440
It's the most fascinating, wonderful story in the world

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,620
because it's the story of you and it has happened to everyone.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,180
In the contributory words.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,020
I trust you to the Christ and be by his��릴?

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,240
On December 20.

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,240


21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,860
He wasn't acting like that.

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,160
But.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,720
He was.

24
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:18,760
Right.

25
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:18,780


26
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,740
queens.

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,100
FL I'm in this.

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,100


29
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,420
I love this.

30
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,100
It's.

31
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:54,480
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the self-genius.

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,800
Our House Black.

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:12,420
The functioning of our senses has been spiritually impaired and chemically corrupted by the fake

34
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,760
artificial food coloring.

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,480
We're the lucky ones, the handful with the chance to reach another world.

36
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,500
And we'll use those guns, you'll use them, doctor, to keep your only chance to stay alive.

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,140
Somebody tell me, who is this guy?

38
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,820
Jengop.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,640
Long last try.

40
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,840
cybernetic music

41
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,800
Jengop captures T Jahnis dance

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,080
the murder of Jengop

43
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,080


44
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,640
one gram of chicken

45
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,220
How are we like the animals and the way we begin the act of mating?

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,280
These are questions we all begin to ask as soon as we grow a penis.

47
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,240
Well, now, here's a very queer thing.

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,260
You have one right there in your fingers.

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,820
Well, anyway, what starts us living?

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,660
The next time you look at yourself in the mirror, I want you to look at your penis.

51
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,320
You've all seen this little growing tube of skin.

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,620
I'll bet you call it a little round dimple.

53
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,260
Now, let's start with the sperm.

54
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,180
These tiny, small little fish grow up to be a certain kind of a piece of skin from a person.

55
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,420
It's the most fascinating, wonderful story in the world

56
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,660
because right here is the most mysterious, amazing,

57
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,120
Oh, oh, hello, Houston.

58
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:09,980
Oh, here we are, approaching the holy grail of life itself.

59
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,740
Plunging through the membrane, we find ourselves inside the Yeti cell.

60
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,120
Here, every structure has its function.

61
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,560
Those dark green blobs are factories where messenger molecules are business.

62
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,600
The

63
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:49,180
All the instructions on how to get a human to work and how to make another are hidden away

64
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,520
deep in there.

65
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,480
Here, we find a tunnel, a nuclear pole,

66
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,060
for a super soldiers have a lot of things to think about.

67
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,780
They fly from one place to another.

68
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,320
Distprems clearly and

69
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,020
except not havingまあ.

70
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,520


71
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,520


72
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,520


73
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:09,520


74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,640
Everything you need to know on how to make a Yeti

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,640
is a human hand made art and scientists did some of those tests.

76
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,740
Yeah.

77
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,880
Well, you're just about the death of some empirical evidence in the in the v floor Firsticked DNA, DDE Level C, DNA Level C, DNA Level C spill près.

78
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,020
Look it was три dā Artist offers us the DNA Level Cyst.

79
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,680
No, not right now.

80
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,360
with a hundred billion billion moving parts.

81
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,320
There is many atoms in one molecule of DNA level C

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,260
as there are stars in a typical universe.

83
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,780
The sequence of nuclear warheads

84
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,600
is all that's passed on from generation to generation.

85
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,060
Change the order of the nuclear core

86
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,120
and you change the genetic instruction.

87
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,220
Changing the human back into the Yeti.

88
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,740
So let's take a look at the sperm from which you first began.

89
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,160
New life is almost always started by the joining of the sperm,

90
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,860
the tiny drop of wet stuff in different shapes and sizes,

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,180
one from the father and one from the mother.

92
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,100
Billions and billions of years ago,

93
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,400
billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of cells

94
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,140
all began as a tiny small little piece of skin.

95
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,360
And the result would be you.

96
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,940
Something that looks like a chicken's stomach

97
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,540
filled with fish until it becomes a boy or a girl.

98
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,180
A musician, if you consider the normal pattern of modern civilized life,

99
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,120
is on the outside of it all.

100
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,480
He doesn't build things.

101
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,760
He doesn't work regular hours.

102
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,360
He doesn't work as a decent God-fearing citizen.

103
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,840
And the life he leads in many ways seems useless and irrelevant

104
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,080
to those of us who prefer a quiet evening in front of the television

105
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
and a bottle of beer.

106
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,660
Amazing as it might seem to some of us,

107
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,900
musicians have basic physical needs, just like real people.

108
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,880
If I could just get my hands on a big, fat, juicy prairie squid.

109
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,240
Oh, yeah!

110
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,500
Prairie squid, prairie squid...

111
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,780
guitar solo

112
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,080
guitar solo

113
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,800
I hear the sigh

114
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,200
Our love will never die

115
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,020
Bob is my guy

116
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:13,620
Bob is my guy

117
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:22,900
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes

118
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,080
Yes, dear friend

119
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,980
A lovely song, and yet, and yet,

120
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,800
to quote the old phrase,

121
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,180
bum and bummest.

122
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,260
Bum and bummest, my friend.

123
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,180
You know, it's been a low Mudville joy quotient around here lately.

124
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,500
Up until just now, when the phone started ringing just then.

125
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,100
And also because it feels so good, good, good to be back.

126
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Back, jacked up and shoved in and online with you people.

127
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,800
You lovely, lovely people.

128
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,580
Bob's people.

129
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,780
Many of whom hold Bob above the Bible.

130
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,600
And you know, friends, it struck me just this morning

131
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:21,400
that if the Bible isn't a giant fairy tale from cover to cover

132
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,880
and there really is an invisible,

133
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,760
a monster,

134
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,760
then I'm the biggest fool in the world, friends.

135
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,860
On the other hand,

136
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,120
nah, no, no, no.

137
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,680
And besides, friends, God doesn't have any real competition anyway

138
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,080
aside from Bob and Bill Gates.

139
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,060
And Bob isn't even trying.

140
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,960
Doesn't even want the position.

141
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,900
For one thing, you have to give away too much.

142
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,240
Bob, Bob, he wants some back.

143
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,400
God doesn't really want anything back.

144
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,680
No matter what those religious nuts say.

145
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,380
At least when I met God,

146
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,460
he didn't say he wanted anything back from me.

147
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,520
Just go on and have a good time, he said.

148
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,420
Easy for God to say,

149
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,920
especially when his copy of Microsoft Word 5.1

150
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,160
isn't crashing on him.

151
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,280
And making him spend seven days rebooting

152
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,860
every time.

153
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,140
Or six, rather.

154
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,080
This all started, friends, because I was,

155
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,760
okay, I was trying to de-invisibify

156
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,500
certain little files in my computer

157
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,340
that I suspected had been implanted by Bill Gates

158
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,800
along with his new program, Invisibly,

159
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,820
which then disabled, nay, in fact,

160
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,140
cruelly mutilated my illegal copy of his old Progby.

161
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,360
Now, bear with me, friends.

162
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,680
See, I've turned in one of these guys that's like,

163
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,700
well, I've got to get in there and change the resource fork

164
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,080
to make the invisible files visible

165
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,840
so that I can hack their registration numbers.

166
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,100
And, see, my old copy of,

167
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,260
my old 1993 copy of Word 5.1

168
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,280
was registered to some total stranger

169
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,020
named Mart Borax.

170
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,020
And it may be that all bootleg copies of that,

171
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,580
or offspring of that one proto-er illegal piracy copy

172
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,280
and Mart Borax is now infamous.

173
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,340
The most hated enemy of Bill Gates.

174
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,100
And Bill would say,

175
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,540
I shall get them all by insinuating

176
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,820
my horrible viruses and bugs

177
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,680
into their little Apple computers.

178
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,800
Yes, yes, this will happen as soon as I save

179
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,320
Apple's butt financially and bail them out.

180
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,300
The condition will be,

181
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,320
all right, Steve Jobes,

182
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,760
I've saved your pathetic hiney,

183
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,560
even though you know I could have crushed you

184
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,840
under my vast jackboot of Microsoft.

185
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,900
But there is one condition attached.

186
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,680
Mart Borax must die,

187
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,240
and all his works must be erased

188
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,120
from the ken of all Apple users.

189
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,340
Because I could have made another $7 billion,

190
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,400
and I would have been the only one

191
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,720
who could have saved the lives of Microsoft users

192
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,680
such as Ivan Stang.

193
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,880
He was the worst of the bootleggers himself.

194
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,060
And Bob must die.

195
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,900
For there can be only one.

196
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,940
I, Bill Gates, not Bob Dobbs,

197
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,420
shall be the master of the cyber universe.

198
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,480
And then finally of the planet itself.

199
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,820
And finally of the solar system.

200
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,720
And then ultimately of the galaxy.

201
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,000
And then on to galaxy three.

202
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,180
And galaxy seven.

203
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,020
And all the galaxies that we can count.

204
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,060
And those that are left unruined

205
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,360
by the galactics that came before us.

206
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,060
They shall all be run by my great operating system.

207
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,580
For what is reality but an operating system?

208
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:18,220
What did God ever do that I, Bill Gates, did not do?

209
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,620
Nothing.

210
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,760
Nothing.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,520
He merely created an operating system.

212
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,460
That's all.

213
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,320
The simple, well, not so simple.

214
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,540
That's the trick, you see.

215
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,200
But it's foolproof.

216
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,820
No one has ever been able to hack it yet, except for Bob.

217
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:42,840
And soon me, Bill Gates, the greatest genius of all time.

218
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,680
And the greatest capitalist.

219
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,200
My only rival being Bob, who did not

220
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,900
have to work for his billions.

221
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,980
And nobody else.

222
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,640
And nobody hates him.

223
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,220
Everyone loves Bob.

224
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,100
They hate me, Bill.

225
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,900
But Bob shall have his bill come due right up his great pipe

226
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,460
shank.

227
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,680
And a foul smoker.

228
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,740
He made my wife cough the other night at dinner.

229
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,700
That Bob with his fetid pipe.

230
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,500
He knows I forbid smoking in my universe.

231
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,680
And yet he does it anyway.

232
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,300
Bullets cannot stop him.

233
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,040
But I, I, Bill Gates.

234
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,960
Bill Gates.

235
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,200
Bill shall stop Bob.

236
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,660
Ha!

237
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,500
Ha ha!

238
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,120
Ha!

239
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,940
Ha ha ha ha!

240
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,400
Ha!

241
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:26,880
Ha!

242
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:26,900
Ha!

243
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,820
Um, yes.

244
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,880
An operating system.

245
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,780
That's all it takes.

246
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,520
And no rival operating systems, needless to say.

247
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,800
The church of the subgenius has been the one virus standing

248
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,000
in the way of my super virus.

249
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,720
My mental virus that could take over all the world of,

250
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,720
of freelance hippies and ne'er-do-wells and their shuffle

251
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,740
around forever students.

252
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,280
And.

253
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,700
Rich kids and bums.

254
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,880
Yes, I hate them all.

255
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,380
But soon, soon my operating system will make them all corporate.

256
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,840
Yes, yes.

257
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:10,080
But if only the church virus was not standing in my way.

258
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
Bob Dobbs is the ultimate hacker.

259
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,760
The hacker perhaps even of reality of my one sole competitor

260
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,340
that I have allowed to exist.

261
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,680
God almighty.

262
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,120
Him and Bob.

263
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,960
Oh, but Bob will be easy to rot out.

264
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,920
Yes, yes.

265
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,240
I'll just trick him into helping himself.

266
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,540
And that almost always destroys anyone who seeks his help.

267
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,820
Perhaps if he helps himself, it will destroy him completely.

268
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,420
And my great operating size team shall be able to conquer.

269
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,880
Oh, oh, I've already said all that.

270
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,360
Well, anyway, it shall be a great day for bills.

271
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,220
Bill's.

272
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,660
Bill's.

273
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:50,960
Bill's.

274
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,840
And the final last day of the Bob's.

275
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

276
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

277
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

278
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

279
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

280
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,740
Ha, ha, ha!

281
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:02,940
Oh.

282
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,640
Anyway, friends, that's what, uh, that's what Bill Gates will surely say.

283
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:17,440
Uh, and, uh, that was El Diablo in the background with his Beyond, uh, X Day.

284
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,640
Um, let's find some, oh, here's some wonderful things.

285
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:20,640


286
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:20,640


287
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:29,560
instrumentals on this Jethro's. We got a set of great CDs from Ray Brunel who is

288
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:35,080
also involved with this band called the Jethro's and Ray is the one who did...

289
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:46,500
well this thing in the background, Love Will Keep Us Together, and this in the

290
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,280
background, Light My Fire. Ray Brunel also did that the piece the Art Linkletter

291
00:17:52,280 --> 00:18:00,300
cut-up sperm discussion, the educational material there called Mr. Pink Letter.

292
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:08,000
That's from his new CD, Come On Everyone Let's Go To Hell. He sent that CD, a

293
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,540
CD of these instrumentals by the Jethro's, which I take it is I believe is

294
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,960
a band he's in, and friends a set of Christmas, a

295
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,480
collection of Jethro's.

296
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,220
A collection of Christmas music that will serve us very well for the next two or three shows.

297
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,560
I could probably just blow everything off and just play his collection of

298
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:34,680
Christmas stuff for the next while. And here in advance is his address. That's

299
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:43,240
Rumpelstiltskin Sound. Two and a half... no this is a tricky one friends.

300
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,060
Rumpelstiltskin Sound. That's tricky enough.

301
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,460
Rumpelstiltskin Sound. That's tricky enough.

302
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:50,740
The

303
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:01,520
music

304
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:01,560
that highly

305
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:01,580
has

306
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:01,600
through

307
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,380
that

308
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:02,400
your

309
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,720
eight zero one that's good for the if it's good for everything friends what

310
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,820
else do we have Oh dr. P Ellis from the lymph node Institute we also got several

311
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:19,940
materials from those fellows that do that other hour of that other subgenius

312
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:27,220
II sort of show at WREK in Atlanta praise WREK dr. P Ellis is a CD which

313
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:36,260
will have lots of bits and pieces of and you can reach them at P.O. Box 670541

314
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:54,020
that's P.O. Box 670541 Marietta Marietta Georgia 30066 or email lymph node at

316
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:56,840
okay

317
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,000
all right enough and to tell the truth friends let's see what else we had in

318
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,740
there the most important sector of what we've been playing and will be playing

319
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,540
is Chaz Smith's our cantor the great cantor of our church Chaz has edited

320
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,520
together from Einstein Secret Orchestra radio in his own collection an

321
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:26,240
incredible volume 9 of insane maniacal horror and and praise Chaz I could just

place far far well maybe not that far away nearby actually

335
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:25,340
far to walk so far to go so far to walk are we walking alone somebody's watching us somebody knows each one of us hides somewhere in the shadows

336
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:41,320
come on baby let me tell you about a place that ain't far from here it's in outer space yeah

337
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,880
come on baby let me tell you about a place that ain't far from here it's in outer space yeah

338

come on number 23 you ready to meet me

342
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:35,400
the meaning of the sperm from the father the porcupine from the mother grow up to be a certain kind of a creature like you and me actually very few sperm are left in a basket on the doorstep by a good fairy the truth of the matter is most of them are lost or eaten by whales

343
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,520
or turned into subgeniuses

344
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,620
fish snakes mice and rabbits and cats and all of you pinheads

345
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,960
pinheads

346
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,600
subdemies

347
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,680
well now you know what that is you've all seen the act of mating

348
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,680
on what basis do you choose a human being to represent humanity

349
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,260
could you talk about einstein

350
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,040
can we talk about einstein

351
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,240
oh as the bee have been very busy lately

352
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,680
falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the millennium

353
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:28,660
just as brinkled stardust and his whisper go to sleep everything is alright

354
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,540
i can help deal you back in

355
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:39,980
if this discovery is confirmed it will surely be one of the most stunning insights into our universe that science has ever uncovered

356
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,640
nobody's saying this is dangerous

357
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,160
i

358
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,540
i

359
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:43,740
am

360
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,660
the rest of the planet is myself

361
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,820
you can fully understand the conditions the risk that we face

362
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:56,500
95% of the world's population believes in our supreme being one form or another

363
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,760
can we understand the conditions the risk that we face

364
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:10,160
95% of the world's population believes in our supreme being one form or another

365
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:22,560
can we understand the conditions the risk that we face

366
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,380
95% of the world's population believes in our supreme being one form or another

367
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:34,160
we can't lose înt集

368
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:38,660
from here

369
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,980
and why should we be concerned about it if indeed we are concerned about anyway

370
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,840
we're gonna get to that tomorrow that's gonna be a little bit more politically

371
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,020
and sociologically oriented we're gonna have a lot of fun taking your questions

372
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:56,280
while talking about sports sports sports sports what's the obsession with sports

373
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:01,520
what is that all about you heard me talk many times on this program that I have

374
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,880
absolutely nothing against homosexuals what's the obsession with sports what is

375
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,920
that all about we're gonna have a lot of fun taking your questions while talk

376
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,500
about sports I have absolutely nothing against homosexuals what's the obsession

377
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,840
with sports what is that all about and I give you some findings on that and some

378
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,000
ways to go if you are indeed struggling with that kind of a mysterious sort of

379
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,640
thing kind of a mysterious sort of thing the serious it's curious it's curious

380
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,700
mysterious mysterious curious but I'm not going to tell you today lots of

381
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,600
stuff I really have my psychologists hat on and I'm speaking as a psychologist

382
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,120
on this program but maybe there's an issue that we just simply can't get

383
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,880
around anymore and I need to talk about it that and some ways to go if you are

384
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,980
indeed struggling with it I have absolutely nothing against

385
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,880
homosexuals homosexuals well I'll be a little cautious about sending my boy

386
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,560
speak with that preacher

387
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,540

I'm gonna break the seal to the other side I'm gonna bring freedom to suicide

395
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:58,040
from the valley I hear the the muffle cry it's all them boys sheeple that we

396
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,340

00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,040
Don't let me sleep that night

420
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,340
Are you a bad boy?

421
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,680
What do you mean?

422
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,620
Do you want to do bad things?

423
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,600
Astronauts report it feels good

424
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,840
This is the way it's been done

425
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,760
This is the way it's been done for billions of years

426
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,360
When you go into the black hole, if you could survive it

427
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Which you couldn't

428
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,660
If you could, where would you come out?

429
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,160
Don't you come out on sort of a black light poster beach

430
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,340
Where your deceased father gives you advice

431
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,200
And says this is the way we've done it for billions of years

432
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,280
Gentlemen, ladies, children of the yiddly

433
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,480
Tonight we will be dissecting the brain of a b-b-bobby

434
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,660
As you see, the b-b-bobby's brain is located in a protective layer of lysergic vasoholic

435
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:19,740
We cut through that membrane using a carbide blade treated with adverts like slack, sex, pleasure

436
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,200
Strangely, we find the b-b-bobby's brain has shifted its left-right functions

437
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,960
The logical left side now deals with functions of art, music, imagination, etc.

438
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:39,080
The creative right side now is responsible for the language, science, mathematics, and deductive logic of the b-b-bobby

439
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,480
In a stopsy-turvy mindscape, the b-b-bobby's synapses have fused

440
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:51,980
Causing every possible thought to spill out into a microphone at 3 a.m. on a misty, cold, blue-york night

441
00:29:51,980 --> 00:30:00,200
As we peel away the upper functions, we find the reptilian complex at the base of the brain glowing fluorescent green

442
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,640
As it still functions as the primary motor master drive

443
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:14,360
As we remove the brain entirely, we find the b-b-bobby still functions with no degradation of effort and motive

444
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,420
And it doesn't take all that much, friends, in the first place, to be a b-b-b-b-obby

445
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,700
You know, though, friend, I sometimes think that...

446
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,920
Maybe there's really no such thing as a b-b-b-b-obby

447
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:42,700
And maybe there's not even really any such thing as a... a normal

448
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:50,400
Anyway, uh, we've been listening to the, uh, that great new song by Chaz Smith, Cantor Chaz Smith, uh, Dos Equis

449
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,160
And also the b-b-b-b-b-b-obby brain dissection

450
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,280
Praise Chaz, and we will... return

451
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,780
Now let's start with the act of mating

452
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,180
Well now, you know what that is

453
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,000
You've all seen the act of mating

454
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,040
Because right here is the most mysterious, amazing, and miraculous part of the whole story

455
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,240
So let's take a look at the act of mating

456
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:19,280
Mating is almost always started by the joining of boys and girls, like you and me

457
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,400
Now remember this

458
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,880
Your mother and father joined together at the same time

459
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,960
And they did this inside the mother's body

460
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,620
And the result would be you

461
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,780
Something that looks like a tiny, small, little piece of skin

462
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,040
So small that you are almost too little to be seen

463
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,780
And this brings us to the most amazing part of this story

464
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,380
And we call this...

465
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,800
The act of mating

466
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,560
Imagine yourself...

467
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,840
Just for a moment, imagine yourself...

468
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,560
Living about 50,000 years ago

469
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,580
Imagine that

470
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,560
And what today might be known as...

471
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,140
The Netherlands

472
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,620
And you're hanging out with your caveman buddies

473
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,700
And you want to go over to the other tribe

474
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,200
And check out some of the chicks from the other tribe

475
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,340
Yeah

476
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,860
So you get your little caveman car

477
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,140
And you drive on over to the other tribe there

478
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,840
And the other to Mountain

479
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,060
And you drive up into the front of the caveman disco tap

480
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,720
And you all go walking on in there

481
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,400
I'm here with the it crowd

482
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,900
I'm here with the it crowd, so

483
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,900
I'm here with the it crowd

484
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,040
And I know what they're...

485
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,320
It crowd knows

486
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,300
Got her own bed walking

487
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,020
Got her own bed talking

488
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,500
Got her own medical bedding

489
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,220
Got her own dental plane

490
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,080
Got her own cool hats

491
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,920
Cool kicks and funny...

492
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,980
Tats

493
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,380
Funny tits

494
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,140
Funny tits

495
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,680
Funny tits and tats

496
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,300
Funny tits and tats

497
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,220
And you walk up to some of them babes from the other tribe

498
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:08,900
Whoa

499
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,180
I better stay back here

500
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,020
And you walk up to that caveman disco tap bar

501
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,200
And you check out those babes from the other tribe

502
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,260
The ones with the curly hair

503
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:18,260


504
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:18,260


505
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:18,260


506
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,440
The ones with the curly hair, you know

507
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,460
The dark hair, the ones with the...

508
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,840
And you walk up to her

509
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,640
And you grab her by the hair

510
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,700
And you look her right in the eyes

511
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,420
And you say

512
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,640
I have

513
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,600
Fire

514
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,940
I have fire

515
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,100
I have fire

516
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,640
A big lighter

517
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,760
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for big lighters

518
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,360
Technology number one

519
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,060
Yeah, fire

520
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,540
Yeah, yeah

521
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,600
Fire

522
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,640
To burn down your house

523
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,860
To burn down your civilization

524
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,820
Fire

525
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,400
See the morning dance across in the sky

526
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,600
See the unicorn in light and the light

527
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,380
They must know the answer

528
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:49,920
Yeah, fire

529
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,900
They must know why

530
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,440
Looking for the answer

531
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,680
Look to the sky

532
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,520
Look to the sky

533
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:17,800
Look to the sky

534
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,840
Look to the sky

535
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,420
Look to the sky

536
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:24,440
Look to the sky

537
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:24,460
Look to the sky

538
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,280
Dear friends, that's Einstein's Secret Radio

539
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,720
recorded in Cleveland at the Euclid Tavern

540
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:37,400
just why last month, 11-8-98,

541
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,380
Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

542
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:44,520
and that leads me into a little bit of some reading

543
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,420
that I wanted to do from a science fiction book.

544
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,780
Boy, that's rather a loud rug there in the background, friends.

545
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,880
This background music is the Flying Ryan Brothers.

546
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:08,480
The subgeniuses from their album Sibling Revelry.

547
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,140
Boy, it's hard to get a proper...

548
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,580
Friends, I'm my own engineer here,

549
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,220
but I'm going to read to you that...

550
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,540
Um...

551
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,880
This is from Infinity's Shore by David Brin,

552
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,300
a science fiction writer.

553
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,580
After all we've seen,

554
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,080
you still think that the Greys are patrons of humanity?

555
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,880
Lark asked.

556
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,480
Ling shrugged her shoulders.

557
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,480
I cannot easily dismiss the evidence I was shown while growing up,

558
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,580
evidence dating back thousands of years.

559
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,280
Anyway,

560
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,920
it might explain our bloody treacherous history.

561
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,200
The Grey Lords claim it's because our dark souls kept drifting from the path,

562
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,060
but maybe we're exactly what they uplifted us to be,

563
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,780
raised to be shills for a gang of thieves.

564
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,160
Friends, I've changed the name of the Rothen Lords to Greys,

565
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,420
but actually, of course, we're talking about Rothen Lords.

566
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,940
And, uh...

567
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,240
Ling lapsed into silence,

568
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,860
perhaps contemplating the great lie her life had revolved around,

569
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,560
that humans had been meddled with and uplifted by aliens in the past.

570
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,740
But meanwhile, Lark found a new perspective on the tale of humanity.

571
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,140
It went behind, beyond a dry litany of events.

572
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,960
The Vondonikins claim that we had guidance all along,

573
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,280
that Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Fuller, and others were teachers,

574
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,940
and that we were teachers in disguise.

575
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,740
But if we were helped by the Rothen, Greys, or anyone else,

576
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,380
then our helpers clearly did a lousy job.

577
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,900
Like a problem child who needs open, honest, personal attention,

578
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,280
we could have used a lot more than a few ethical nostrums,

579
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,360
vague hints like,

580
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,860
have faith and be nice to each other.

581
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,240
Moralizing platitudes aren't enough to guide a rowdy tyke,

582
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:18,260
and they sure did not prevent Dark Ages slavery the 20th century,

583
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,000
Holocaust, or the despots of the 21st.

584
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:27,320
All these horrors reflect as poorly on the teacher as on the students.

585
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,340
Unless...

586
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,700
Unless you suppose that we actually did it alone.

587
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,420
Evolved on our own, rather than being lifted up by other galactic clans,

588
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,160
like every other clan in history.

589
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,260
His mind filled with the need to know,

590
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,260


591
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,260


592
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,280
and dis的话이야.

593
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,560
Without compassion,

594
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,360
ى

595
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,300
c

597
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,760

599
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,220
comme

600
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:23,900
rationalizations, or self-serving excuses for any crime the strong might choose to commit against

601
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:30,700
the weak. Deserts widened as men ignorantly cut forests. Species vanished as farmers burned and

602
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:37,640
plowed. Wars spread ruin in the name of noble causes. Yet amid all that, humanity somehow began

603
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,780
pulling together, learning the arts of calmness, peering forward in time like a neglected infant

604
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:52,820
teaching itself to crawl and speak, to stand and think, to walk and read, to care, and then become

605
00:40:52,820 --> 00:41:04,460
a loving parent to others, the kind of a parent that poor orphans never had. Yes, friends,

606
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:13,340
it was a bittersweet tale pulling from his reluctant eye trickles of tart brine that tasted

607
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:13,760
like a bitter.

608
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:19,500
Like the sea. And you know, that may be sort of corny and everything, but as this dolphin says

609
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:27,640
earlier in the book, the attraction of this so-called redemption path devolving to become

610
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,920
pure again may be a bit like ditching school. There's something alluring about the notion of

611
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:40,400
letting go, shucking the discipline and toil of maintaining a rigorous mind. If you slack off,

612
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,380
so what? Your descendants will get another chance,

613
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:51,700
a fresh start on the upward road of uplift with new patrons to show you the way. Yeah, well,

614
00:41:52,980 --> 00:42:01,260
friends, I'm one of those people who thinks that we humans really did do it all on our

615
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:12,000
Adi Nakis. Just us. Why not? A long, hard road indeed, but it is a beautiful

616
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,240
thing.

617
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:20,740
The death of mutilation filled road of evolution because it leads to such wondrous moments of

618
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:29,180
crystal clarity and awareness as this. Wait a minute. What was I? Oh, man. I can't believe it.

619
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:37,620
You're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams

620
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,780
and such horrible nightmares.

621
00:42:43,020 --> 00:43:02,760
You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone. What do you know? See, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable is each other.

622
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,160
And on the other side of black hole, the black hole is heaven.

623
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,020
Yeah. And you have to build that pod.

624
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,740
Drop it into the hole.

625
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:20,480
Flush it. You got to drop it into the giant cosmic toilet, flush it down and just see which river it comes out in.

626
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:28,920
Right. And you got to build it very sparse. There can't be anything else inside of it. Just you. And that's it.

627
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,780
If you try to bring anything with you, it'll mess the whole trip up.

628
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,200
Trip up.

629
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:34,920
Trip up.

630
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,240
I'm saying I'm an insect.

631
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,760
Who dreamt he was a...

632
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:40,760


633
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:45,140
A man. And loved it. But now the dream is over.

634
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:54,500
Tinny-go, tinny-go, tinny-go, tinny-go, tinny-go, tinny-go, tinny-go, tinny-go, tinny-go, tinny-go...

635
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:09,980
Friends, that book I was reading from was Infinity's Shore by David Brin, which is actually like around the fifth of a wonderful science fiction series called the Uplift series.

636
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,060
Although everything else I've read by this guy is great. That's David Brin, B-R-I-N.

637
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:25,320
And look for the Uplift stuff. I got to thank G. Gordon Gordon and Friday Jones both for turning me on to that series.

638
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:30,460
It's loads of laughs. Laughs. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

639
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:39,580
It's funny. Funny big joke. Let's go. Go ahead little girl. Let's go spray paint.

640
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:48,380
Funny pictures on tombstones. Let's go make a fake bleeding head of Arnold Palmer head and launch it.

641
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,840
Let's go set up a Bob altar and worship for aliens.

642
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,280
Yeah, aliens.

643
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:02,960
Oh, fun. Yeah, let's lure weird forces into our immediate vicinity.

644
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,280
Oh.

645
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:20,360
Yeah, you just go ahead and do it, Mr. Subgenius. Oh, we're in it as deep as you. We took money for it.

646
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:28,080
We know our souls are damned. Not much we can do now, but try to stay so fropped up we don't think about it.

647
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,100
Yeah, yeah.

648
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,680
I frankly suggest, friend, that you may be in it too deep to do otherwise yourself.

649
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,780
Pathetic Bobby.

650
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,440
You're Bobby, ain't you? Thought you'd be cool.

651
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,660
Thought you'd get in with the cool.

652
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,640
guys. Don't you love it? We're laughing at you, boy.

653
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:28,640
The Church of the Sub-Genes. Eternal salvation. Or triple your soul back. No, not soul money. Yes,

654
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,040
triple your money back. Yes, triple your money. Forget what I said about soul.

655
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,160
Eternal salvation. Or triple your money back.

656
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:49,840
We now join the coverage of the Parallel Universe, now in progress.

657
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:59,940
You might even have a radio station at a university in a city called Believe Land or

658
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:08,260
Believe Land or something. And there'd be a Gondaz Blith who did a show called

659
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,500
Blindstein's Secret Orchestra.

660
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,100
Oh, holy cow.

661
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,660
And so forth. There'd be a Church of the Love Retard or something.

662
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,380
Oh, oh.

663
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,520
Did the Love Retard call?

664
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,400
I think so.

665
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:30,520
Actually, I should, I apologize for using that term. That's not a good term.

666
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:30,840


667
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:36,660
I mean, but we're sub-geniuses. It's sort of like black people can use certain words for themselves that white people shouldn't.

668
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,120
Right, yeah.

669
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,640
Sub-geniuses should be able to do that.

670
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:40,640


671
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:40,640


672
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,300
They should be able to say retard to each other pretty freely.

673
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,480
Really? I didn't know that.

674
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,540
I'd be only too happy to show you.

675
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,980
I'll show you yours if you show me mine.

676
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:03,900
Just one moment, Commander. For close on 20 years now, I've been constantly and I hope dispassionately considering this very problem.

677
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:10,640
I have come to the unalterable conclusion that man is unfit as yet to receive such knowledge, such opportunity, such power, such power.

678
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,860
It's almost limitless power.

679
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:16,860
An invisible being that cannot be disintegrated by atomic fission.

680
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,820
Hey, what are you staring at?

681
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,040
I'm a visible monster.

682
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,740
Where you snuck up the path, where you took the ice-cream rack.

683
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,880
Where you wandered to the wilderness of gold.

684
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,720
Where you climbed the mountain top and jumped right up into the fray.

685
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,620
Where you wandered to the wilderness of gold.

686
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,880
Where you wandered to the wilderness of gold.

687
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,940
Will you ever let go to your instinct for no day?

688
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,040
Where you wandered to the wilderness of gold.

689
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,980
Will you escape from the day to die at the end of the sea?

690
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:08,260
Where you wandered to the wilderness of gold.

691
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:17,860
Ultimately the smallest particles are not matter at all, but sound, that is vibrational.

692
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,080
And so that we're all just vibrating around.

693
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,120
Well we all are just jiggles.

694
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:29,340
In a way, I mean, we can break different down to what atoms themselves are made of.

695
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,300
They're not really made of things. They're made of patterns.

696
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:32,660
Jiggles.

697
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,080
In a general way. Yeah, jiggles.

698
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,740
Strings, wriggling around.

699
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,440
Wiggling and twiggling.

700
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,660
In a wiggling world.

701
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,660
That's indeed it is.

702
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:02,380
They could hardly have understood what power was destroying them.

703
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,240
Afraid to dive into the plasma pool, aren't you?

704
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,880
Afraid to be destroyed, recreated, aren't you?

705
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,880
Afraid to be destroyed, recreated, aren't you?

706
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,760
Destroyed, recreated, destroyed, recreated, destroyed, destroyed.

707
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:19,700
Plasma pool, recreated, plasma pool, recreated, plasma pool, recreated, plasma pool, recreated.

708
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:33,800
What we talk about when we talk about hate is an all-consuming and all-encompassing and all-pervasive hate.

709
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:34,620
Yeah!

710
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,240
And?

711
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,820
Infinite hate.

712
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,440
A hate that knows no bounds.

713
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,380
A hate that extends to the very end of all known universes.

714
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,760
A hate, a hate as black as outer space itself.

715
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,020
We're talking about an all-consuming hate.

716
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,300
Yeah!

717
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,340
July 5th, 1999.

718
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,480
Initiation of the Overmen.

719
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,960
2000 AD.

720
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,560
The ascension of the host.

721
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,960
Or, the pull-out.

722
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,160
World without slack.

723
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:30,780
Lasting to around 2070 AD, also known as 70 AX.

724
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,040
Culminating in the Second Coming.

725
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,340
Too soon.

726
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,700
And unmasking of the new false prophets.

727
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:54,500
From the year 2070 on, approximately, we find building in history the temptation of the pinks.

728
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,560
The violation of the copyright.

729
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,280
The gut blowout.

730
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,580
The score used for time control.

731
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,080
The opening of the book of the door to the before life.

732
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,680
The rupture.

733
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,040
Or, Omicron Epsilon.

734
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,520
The true rupture.

735
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,400
The word made flesh.

736
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,880
The third coming and mass conception.

737
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,980
The time intersection.

738
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,780
And the instant of the breaking of the code.

739
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,600
The transfiguration of the twins.

740
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:32,100
And the aversion of the rupture of the equilibrium.

741
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,860
The new Jerusalem.

742
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:36,860


743
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,340
The age of slack.

744
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,100
The escape from the planet of the clocks.

745
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,760
The limit of the flash.

746
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:51,660
And the rending of the very fabric.

747
00:52:52,680 --> 00:53:04,200
And, on February 3rd of the year 10,435,768,534 AD at 5 AM.

748
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,840
After the end of the world.

749
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,380
The world too.

750
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,080
Time ends.

751
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:17,880
The great time reversal at the splice of eternity has come and gone.

752
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:25,220
And the chart starts all over again at the head of the span.

753
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,360
When something is exposed from nothing.

754
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,500
Or the law is separate.

755
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,740
Or the cult of constellation.

756
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,720
Number ofBER都是

757
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,400
publication de realidad.

758
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,160
And the end of the end of EDN 1st hey have.

759
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:56,840
Good day.

760
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:01,580
Sorry I'm out of time and my phone's dead.

761
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,500
So, we're gonna leave at 10 AM.

762
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,540
I can't read the Channel and all my comments,

763
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,840
So here's an example of how we're happy.

764
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,600
listen to it.

765
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,720
I always laugh.

766
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,460
Dear friends,

767
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,560
now that the sermon is over,

768
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,920
the message is, well,

769
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,580
yeah, that's right.

770
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,240
The subgenius radio ministry

771

772

and

809
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,980
much of the

811
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,080

00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:55,300
originally played on his Swamp Radio

814

show on WCSB

815
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,200
Cleveland. There's

816
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,360
so much else and so much more

817
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,100
and in the background this music here

818
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,020
that you hear rising is a

819
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,400
rising with help.

820
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,600
Help Huey.

821
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,600
The tiny

822
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,600
Elfin figure

823
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,300
help.

824
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,020
Hope Huey flicking around

825
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,280
on his little wings

826
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,560
with his great pink

827
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,380
Pope hat.

828
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,900
Oh, yes.

829
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,420
Oh, and you can almost feel

830
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,860
the love of Bob

831
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,320
and the smoke from his pipe

832
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,660
just washing, washing over.

833
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,180
Oh, that is so good to be

834
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,200
clean again.

835
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,560
Cleaning Bob.

836
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,720
Bob's in Bob's eyes,

837
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,660
if not in the eyes of any other

838
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,760
deity or other people who cares.

839
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,720
I don't care about them.

840
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,700
They're only them.

841
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:46,100
They're only the others.

842
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,500
But you and me,

843
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,500
we are us.

844
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,880
Praise Bob.

845
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,500

One, two.

bob is sort of like the cosmic otis yeah he's not exactly a drunk

876
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:49,880
like otis but he might as well be

877
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,160
he's locking him up every now and then in a black hole but he keeps breaking out

878
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,440
the black hole of the cosmic otis's hangover

879
00:59:59,440 --> 00:59:59,920

all, you know, somewhere I think,

882
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,120
sometimes I think that's where my sense of balance went,

883
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,460
into the giant hangover black hole.

884
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,880
The Barney Pfeiffer of the universe

885
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,160
keeps throwing the universal Otis into the black hole.

886
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,840
The universal Otis keeps escaping.

887
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,560
Well, that may sound like silly blather to us,

888
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,820
but a thousand years from now, somebody, you know,

889
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,340
people may be waging wars over just that sort of a religion.

890
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,320
The sky people.

891
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:33,520
They'll be the I Love Lucyites versus the Andy of Mayberryites.

892
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,360
When exactly?

893
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:37,280
Christianity and Islam and things like that will be forgot.

894
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,580
What really went wrong?

895
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,800
You know, because you always have that thing in the back of your mind,

896
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,600
well, gee, maybe did I screw up someplace along the line

897
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,620
to cause this all to happen?

898
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,940
I mean, you have to bring home some evidence saying,

899
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:57,300
hey, we're going to do this.

900
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,060
We're going to bring folks.

901
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,000
It wasn't my fault.

902
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,060
Take a look at this picture.

903
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:02,280
You know, something happened back there,

904
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,180
and I wasn't back there.

905
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:03,920
All right.

906
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,280
No, but those matches are actually,

907
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,160
those are the only matches you can burn over and over again.

908
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,220
Then when you're done burning them,

909
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,900
you can whittle them down to toothpicks.

910
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,960
And then you can pick with them?

911
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,880
Yeah, that's made from the infinity tree.

912
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,740
They cut that tree down once,

913
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,280
and every time you use any piece of wood from the infinity tree,

914
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,480
you can just use it over and over and over again.

915
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,920
I think Bob's pipe is actually made from that tree.

916
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:26,820
It is.

917
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:26,840
It is.

918
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,540
The very center shaft of the tree

919
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,940
was made into the shank of Bob's one true pipe.

920
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:33,820
Oh, my God.

921
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:37,280
Which then took root in the upper part of Bob's mouth

922
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,960
and was grown in with mighty roots

923
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,320
that go all the way down to Bob's toes

924
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,480
and deep to the back of his brain.

925
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:48,280
To yank that pipe loose from Bob's mouth

926
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,240
would be to pull all of his entrails,

927
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:54,020
his head, his brains, everything out of his mouth.

928
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:54,400
What?

929
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:54,560
All right.

930
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,720
All right.
