And remember friends, the great American novel Illuminatus by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.
It's being made into an audio book by the guys who put together maybe Logic University.
And this, what you're about to hear, is chapter one of the audio book of Illuminatus.
So, let's get started.
Deep Leaf Audio presents Illuminatus Part One.
The Eye in the Pyramid by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.
Performed by Ken Campbell and Chris Fairbank.
Dedicated to Gregory Hill and Kerry Thornley.
Book one.
Feverum.
The history of the world is the history of the world.
The history of the warfare between secret societies.
Ishmael Reed.
Mumbo Jumbo.
The first trip or Keetha.
From Dealey Plaza to Watergate.
The purple sage opened his mouth and moved his tongue.
And so spake to them and he said.
The earth quakes and the heavens rattle.
The beasts of nature flock together and the nations of men flock apart.
Volcanoes usher up heat while elsewhere water becomes ice and melts.
And then on other days it just rains.
Indeed, do many things come to pass.
Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst KSC.
The Book of Predications.
The honest book of truth.
It was the year when they finally emanentized the eschaton.
On April the first the world's great powers came closer to nuclear war than ever before.
All because of an obscure island named Fernando Poe.
By the time international affairs returned to their normal Cold War level.
Some wits were calling it the most tasteless April Fool's Day.
The world's greatest
joke in history.
I happen to know all the details about what happened.
But I have no idea how to recount them in a manner that will make sense to most readers.
For instance, I'm not even sure who I am.
And my embarrassment on that matter makes me wonder if you will believe anything I reveal.
Worse yet, I am at the moment very conscious of a squirrel in Central Park just off 68th Street in New York City.
That is leaping from one tree to another.
And I think that happens on the night of April the 23rd.
Or is it the morning of April the 24th?
But fitting the squirrel together with Fernando Poe is, for the present, beyond my powers.
I beg your tolerance.
There is nothing I can do to make things any easier for any of us.
And you will have to accept being addressed by a disembodied voice.
Just as I accept the compulsion to speak out.
Even though I am painfully aware that I am talking to an invisible, perhaps non-existent audience.
Wise men have regarded the Earth as a tragedy.
A farce.
Even an illusionist's trick.
But all, if they are truly wise and not merely intellectual rapists, recognize that it is certainly some kind of stage in which we all play roles.
Most of us being very poorly coached.
And totally unrehearsed.
Before the curtain rises.
Is it too much, if I ask tentatively, that we agree to look upon it as a circus?
A touring carnival, wandering about the sun for a record season of four billion years.
And producing new monsters and miracles.
Hoaxes and bloody mishaps.
Wonders and blunders.
But never quite entertaining the customers well enough to prevent them from leaving.
One by one.
And returning to their homes for a long and bored winter's sleep.
Under the dust.
Then say, for a while at least, that I have found an identity as Ringmaster.
But that crown sits uneasily on my head.
If I have a head.
And I must warn you that the troop is small for a universe this size.
And many of us have to double or triple our stints.
So you can expect me back in many other guises.
Indeed.
Do many things come to pass?
For instance, right now, I am not at all whimsical or humorous.
I am angry.
I am in Nairobi, Kenya.
And my name is, if you will pardon me, Nkrumah Thubar.
My skin is black.
Does that disturb you?
It doesn't me.
And I am, like most of you, midway between tribalism and technology.
To be more blunt as a kikuyu shaman.
Moderately adjusted to city life.
I still believe in witchcraft.
I haven't yet the folly to deny the evidence of my own senses.
It is April the 3rd.
And Fernando Poo has ruined my sleep for several nights running.
So I hope you will forgive me when I admit that my business at the moment is far from edifying.
And is nothing less than constructing dolls of the rulers of America, Russia and China.
You guessed it.
I am going to stick pins in their heads every day for a month.
They won't let me sleep.
I won't let them sleep.
That is justice.
In a sense.
In fact, the President of the United States had several severe migraines during the following weeks.
But the atheistic rulers of Moscow and Peking were less susceptible to magic.
They never reported a twinge.

Always very large.
The Puka appears here and there.
Now and then.

A benign but mischievous creature.
Very fond of rum pots, crack pots.
And how are you, Mr. Wilson?
How are you, Mr. Wilson?
Who in the encyclopedia wants to know?
President, let's go.
Dr. Chumley, the screwiest thing just happened to me.
I know, I know. I believe me heads will roll.
But Dr. Chumley, I was looking for...
No remission.
No remission.
No remission.
Without the shedding of blood.
No remission without the shedding of blood.
It's the word of the Bible and the word of God.
And it says it plain and clear.
So no high-brow professor can say it means something else.
And this is what it says.
No remission.
No remission, brothers and sisters.
No remission without the shedding of blood.
Without the shedding of blood.
No remission.
No remission without the shedding of blood.
All the blood in the world isn't enough.
Every man, woman, and child isn't enough.
Even all the animals, if you added them in line in some pagan or voodoo sacrifice, it wouldn't be enough.
It wouldn't be enough, brothers.
The good book says so.
Because all the blood in the world isn't equal to one drop.
Not one drop.
Not one drop.
Not one drop of the precious blood of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
You may mock and you may jest, but at the last judgment, the smile will be wiped off your face.

What husbands and...
Well, dear, you see this human vagina...
Oh, well, I guess I've seen worse.
Now, George.
Now, look.
When a man and a woman are married,
the penis beats around the bush.
That's it.
Oh, yes.
That was pretty silly, wasn't it?
Oh, sure, kitten.

Eight, five, three, two, one.
Now.
Oh, yeah.
Stop.
What they're doing is they're nailing their trash up on a pole.
We've all seen them. Signs.
Two on your side.
Consumer reporter Shelley Bailey Shaw introduces us to a man who's made ridding his neighborhood of these illegal signs
really his mission to get this done.
He has, Natalie.
And normally in our two on your side reports, we try to be your advocate, your voice.
But tonight we want you to meet a man who's already on your side in a battle waged street by street, pole by pole.
O'Nenslow is an unemployed bookbinder with a bike.
On a bike, you see everything.
And a beef.
So when I'm out riding, I see all the signs.
I used to wish somebody would do something about that.
Then I realized I am somebody.
That's when he started his company.
He's got a collection of sorts.
170 signs in just four months.
Every time I see a phone number on a pole, I think I got to keep people from calling that number.
So they get the idea that they're not going to be making a profit from trashing our neighborhood.
Keep in mind, it is illegal to hang these signs on city or utility poles.
Even this sign advertising jobs for people who want to put up more signs.
Easy hours, easy cash.
A few years ago, Nenslow says most of the signs were for the poor.

Most of the signs were for work at home jobs or weight loss programs.
But now, nearly all of them target people caught in the credit crunch.
I buy houses.
My nemesis, the most efficient of all the illegal sign posters.
He's got a ladder, so he puts them way up and nails them in really good.
I kind of have to respect him because he works hard.
His nemesis.
Another I buy houses.
Even switched from small nails to two-inch roofing nails.
Forcing Nenslow to develop his own.
He's got a few signs.
He's got a new weapon.
Got them.
Dedicated guy, isn't he?
But then, so am I.
For a very short time, the city fined a few illegal sign posters.
It's a timely process.
It's a resource-heavy process that we just don't have the ability to sustain.
Well, this is Shelly Bailey-Shaw calling from K2 News.
We decided to call the I buy houses guy ourselves.
When you send out high schoolers to put the signs out, you tell them not to put them on the poles,
but they do anyway because they're paid on a contract.
They're paid on a commission basis.
And the owner says he only takes them down if there's a complaint.
Dead.
Regardless, Nenslow remains undeterred.
It's easy to want to give up when you think you're the only one who cares about something like this.
But you just got to keep at it, and eventually people will notice, and they'll help you out.
They'll be on your side.
Now, the city encourages volunteers like Nenslow, so long as they don't damage painted light posts,
the city may try to start up some sort of formalized program
but hasn't done so yet.
And you know, there's only one person that has ever on the street actually thanked him for what he does.
So we should thank him for all his efforts and people who do the same thing.
You better believe it.
Anybody seeing him do it should walk up and say thanks a lot.
Absolutely.
And maybe grab a pole of their own.
You better believe it.
Shelly, thanks much.
Thank you.

The American Academy of Neurology has issued a new guideline for using tics.
All available studies indicate that using tics is not helpful and carries significant risk
and is also associated with diarrhea, bloodstream infections, and blood clots and therefore
is recommended.
Once again, all available studies indicate that using tics is not helpful and carries
significant risk but should never be recognized in the future.
