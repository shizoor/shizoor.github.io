1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
I'm Robert Wisdom, and you've been listening to the American Music Party.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,060
Hey, Robert, you need to leave your deck running,

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,720
because I've got some Elvis outtakes coming up here that you might enjoy.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,120
Indeed. Okay.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,320
It's embarrassing.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,920
You know, I mean, we all love the king and everything,

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,600
but let the truth be known,

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,180
I think this was recorded at some live show

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,020
just shortly before he crossed over into the before life,

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,560
or the afterlife, whichever comes first for people like him.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,280
Do you gaze at your bald head

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,800
And wish you had hair

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,520
And your heart filled with pain

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,900
Shall I come back

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,920
Tell me, dear

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,900
Are you lost?

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,320
Oh, Lord, Lord.

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,840
I wonder...

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,980
Come on, Elvis, get it together.

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,740
Someone said,

21
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,600
the world's a stage, and each must play a part.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,780
Ha, ha, ha.

23
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,260
I can...

24
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,340
Ha, ha, ha.

25
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,460
Ha, ha, ha.

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,020
Ha, ha, ha.

27
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,440
Ha, ha, ha.

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, God.

29
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,980
Oh, man, I...

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,340
Ha, ha, ha.

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,320
More of them kind pills, Bob.

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,780
Ha, ha, ha.

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,900
And I had no cause to die.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,920
Ha, ha, ha.

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,200
Oh.

36
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,780
Sing it, baby.

37
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,000
Ha, ha, ha.

38
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,600
Shall I come back again?

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,280
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,680
Is your heart filled with pain?

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,520
Shall I come back again?

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,780
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:56,160
Is your heart filled with pain?

44
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,700
Last week, this is called Naga.

45
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,980
You don't have to say anything. You don't have to do anything.

46
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,740
Oh, okay. Sorry.

47
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,660
What?

48
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,680
Come on.

49
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,440
I'm glad we both got a laugh out of that.

50
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,540
Oh, boy.

51
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,840
Boy, I'll say.

52
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,400
Oh.

53
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,920
Well, it once was a man.

54
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,040
The world.

55
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,160


56
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:35,500
The salesman, and he had devised a plan to get the shackles from my feet.

57
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,240
Oh yeah, but now he's gone.

58
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,080
A martyr for the cause, for the father.

59
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,360
And he's coming again.

60
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:57,360
Who knew that the first shot was gonna be the last shot.

61
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,800
But he's got a hard driving pipe.

62
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,040
The gas smoke all through the night.

63
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,120
And although he may be hurting the universe.

64
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,380
He's gonna squirt all the smoke.

65
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,760
And he's coming again.

66
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:30,580
And he's coming again.

67
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,920
He's singing this mighty gospel song.

68
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,760
From the men in black.

69
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,240
With just a shot from his mighty sack.

70
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,060
If only he could make it back.

71
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,940
From the land of the dead.

72
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,280
But until that happy day.

73
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,040
We can only drink and say.

74
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,400
Father's my Lord.

75
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,900
And he's coming again.

76
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,140
I know he can make it.

77
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,200
Without him we can't take it.

78
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,580
We'll lose the pieces of our minds.

79
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,500
To the pink boys and the whims.

80
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,920
Until the day that he comes back.

81
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,680
It'll be a world with no sack.

82
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,780
Mom just calls out.

83
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,180
And he's coming again.

84
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,000
Father's my Lord.

85
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,040
Father's my Lord.

86
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,740
Father's my Lord.

87
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,600
And he's coming again.

88
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,840
If we don't want the answers upon us.

89
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,420
Then we need Bob to be honest.

90
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,440
Father's my Lord.

91
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,340
Father's my Lord.

92
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,460
Bob's my Lord.

93
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,300
And he's coming again.

94
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,100
Great God is coming for me right now.

95
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,400
Great God almighty.

96
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,720
Bob is my Lord.

97
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,700
And he's coming again.

98
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,860
Oh yes.

99
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,280
That was Slack Master Cleave.

100
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,880
And the spurious jive dear friends.

101
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,980
Help me somebody.

102
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,640
Thank you.

103
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,200
You're welcome.

104
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,320
I'm Bob.

105
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,320


106
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,320


107
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,320


108
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,320


109
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,660
So what's the point of me being a nerd?

110
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,120
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

111
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,440
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

112
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,300
which reaches from the inner mind to...

113
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,200
The subgenius.

114
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,580
Our own slack.

115
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,680
Welcome potential initiates.

116
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,620
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

117
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,940
Gosh.

118
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:27,500
Well, you've heard those intro tapes a million times before.

119
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,400
But we've got important news here.

120
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,840
And there's no time for us to do a mailing to the members of the church.

121
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,360
So you're going to have to tell all your friends that may not be listening to this show.

122
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:48,540
But as of a couple of days ago, I found out that there's going to be a subgenius video devival.

123
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,000
That's right.

124
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,000
We're going to have a revival right here in Dallas at, of all places, Mistral.

125
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,240
That's right.

126
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:05,100
That's that disco video joint in the Anatole Hotel on I-35.

127
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,140
That's the hotel with the pyramids on it.

128
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,340
That's happening.

129
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,620
Half price for subgeniuses, folks.

130
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,640
But you have to be able to show a membership card or just Bob's face.

131
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,360
Bring that face with you.

132
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,520
And if you don't know what I'm talking about, then forget it.

133
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,300
Don't even show up.

134
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,320
But how did the subgenius church end up at a fancy, schmancy place like Mistral?

135
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,920
A veritable citadel of pinkness.

136
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,000
And it is, friends.

137
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,120
A place that most subs wouldn't be caught dead in, even if they could afford it.

138
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,520
It's because they wanted to show video art over there.

139
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:59,520
And, you know, that's a nicer place than most of us are used to, in a way, you know, in terms of niceness.

140
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,400
That's a slick joint.

141
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,760
I don't think you have to dress up, though.

142
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,320
Well, dress up subgenius style, right?

143
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,880
Because this is a devival.

144
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,820
And it'll be interesting.

145
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,800
It'll be interesting to see the reactions of their regular crowd to a subgenius devival.

146
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,460
Because I'm not going to water the preachings down.

147
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,600
It's mostly going to be a video show on their giant wall screen thing.

148
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,740
So, you know, if you've ever wanted to see what the Hour of Slack looks like, this is going to be it, basically.

149
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,680
I'm going to be doing this just like an Hour of Slack, only instead of audio cassettes, it'll be video cassettes.

150
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,220
And, I don't know, they wanted to have a video art show.

151
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,300
And we're under the entirely mistaken.

152
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,720
They're under the impression that this church, this one true church, is art.

153
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,280
And it was not, as many people might think...

154
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,600
The subgenius.

155
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:48,860
What?

156
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,460
What?

157
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,640
Oh, forget that.

158
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,360
Like I said, you've heard that one.

159
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,320
You've heard that one.

160
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:03,560
But the reason they're doing this show, friends, is not because of the brouhaha stirred up by the Dallas Observer in the new issue.

161
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,460
Which, if you haven't seen it, it's got this complete celebrity gossip fabrication.

162
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,520
Dreamed up by some Baltimore reporter geek.

163
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:17,640
And for some reason, it's inexplicably reprinted word for word in the Dallas Observer.

164
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,660
Even though we tried to set them straight.

165
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,080
Maybe we didn't do it in time.

166
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,620
You know, that may just be it.

167
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:35,560
But a couple of months ago, this Baltimore reporter called me up, obviously bent on skinning David Byrne alive by hook or by crook.

168
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,820
I don't know what this guy has against talking heads.

169
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,900
Except that they're popular.

170
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,560
You know?

171
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,600
But I said, no, listen, listen.

172
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,200
We're not mad about the fact that there's a subgenius devival scene in the True Stories movie.

173
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,820
But no word of subgenius.

174
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,220
That's not that big of a deal.

175
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,420
It was an understandable situation.

176
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,760
David Byrne certainly didn't mean to rip anyone off.

177
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,140
And he isn't ripping anybody off.

178
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,600
He doesn't owe us a credit.

179
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,860
But it just would have been nice.

180
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,180
That's the way we looked at it.

181
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,960
And that's what I told the Observer when they called last week.

182
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,960
I said, it's no big deal.

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,640
Nobody cares.

184
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:27,620
But this Thursday, while the Observer comes out, and there Reverend Stang is on the front page, as if I was as important as Bob Dobbs, wearing a Puzzling Evidence t-shirt.

185
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:37,560
And the story basically says that, oh, all the subgeniuses are up in arms about David Byrne's evil ripoff.

186
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,480
And we're threatening lawsuits, and this, and that.

187
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,480
And further down in there, it says,

188
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,240
Byrne is genuinely surprised by these allegations.

189
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:54,720
And frankly friends, so was I, since we never really quite made those allegations to begin with.

190
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,640
I don't know.

191
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,780
I feel exploited, friends.

192
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,120
But not by David Byrne.

193
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,020
I mean, they didn't say anything about the hour slacking or anything local.

194
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,540
These newspapers say.

195
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:14,860
talk about how silly we are to talk about the conspiracy, but in so doing, in so doing,

196
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:20,460
they prove the existence of the conspiracy. And what we mean, friends, by the conspiracy

197
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,980
is much worse than what they think we mean with their blinkered viewpoint. We're talking about

198
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,640
the unconscious conspiracy, friends, the conspiracy that doesn't know it's a conspiracy,

199
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:39,300
the conspiracy that just merely is sort of an attitude of distrust, of strangeness.

200
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:47,400
And the truth is, we, I mean, this is all a bunch of tabloid pablum, friends. The truth is,

201
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,120
we did rip David Byrne off. He made the film first, then Bob saw it, then Bob went back in

202
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,880
time and invented the Church of the Subgenius in 1953 and set up the multimedia de-Bible style.

203
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,620
So if you're a fan of the Church of the Subgenius, you know what I mean.

204
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:01,620


205
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,360
If you want to see evidence that we stole David Byrne's ideas in 1986 and then produced copies of them

206
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:15,300
three years earlier in 1983, hence proving the power of Bob, then go see the Subgenius video show

207
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:22,700
at Mistral this Thursday night. This Thursday night, Subgenius de-Bible and video show.

208
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:31,000
And one other thing about this Observer thing, I'm poking through, that's a good magazine,

209
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,400
you know.

210
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:42,660
Normally, but what got to me, it says here, Dobbs himself is as mythical as Virgil, Texas.

211
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,360
Because, friends, they can't believe in Bob. They can't let themselves believe in Bob.

212
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,660
They can't think, Bob's too good to be true, they think. You know, it's got to be a joke.

213
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,200
It's got to be a joke. There could not be a man as great as J.R. Bob Dobbs.

214
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:08,220
Further on down here, it says other wild, talking about our shows, other wild stage acts include

215
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:17,020
a group of Arkansas cowboys, they mean doctors, doctors for Bob, who worship a, quote, fake,

216
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:23,020
unquote, bleeding head of golf star Arnold Palmer before giving it the nine iron treatment,

217
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,240
thus appeasing the audience's cries of launch it, launch it.

218
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,880
Fake.

219
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,480
Fake bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, folks.

220
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:38,480
You know, if that head is fake, then I'd like to know how that old woman was able to

221
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,620
get up out of that heel chair, even if she didn't have any legs.

222
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,420
Makes me want to turn to Bob, friends.

223
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,760
Glass Madness will tell you about Bob.

224
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,740
I've been helpless so long, my eyes are confused.

225
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,300
My brain all full of junk.

226
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,500
I don't know what I should do.

227
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,680
Maybe go up on a mountain and become a monk.

228
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,940
I'm screaming, Bob Dobbs, won't you help me?

229
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,760
Bob Dobbs, see me through.

230
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,340
Bob Dobbs, can't you see my problems?

231
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,080
Bob Dobbs, what am I going to do?

232
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,400
Hard to say, Bob Dobbs, hard to forget, I'm treating myself, I'm the only one on the

233
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,540
mountain.

234
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,560
But I'm afraid I'm formula.

235
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:50,560


236
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,600
I'm sorry, Bob, I'm just so sorry anytime that you have to have a hangover.

237
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:52,600


238
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:52,600


239
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:52,600


240
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:52,600


241
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,080
I get this all a-roaming all around me all day long.

242
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,560
Are you OK?

243
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,700
しゃ m'осто it shape that Rushs on?

244
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,800
But did you know this cub cyber conflict led to my death?

245
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,120


246
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,160
Huh, huh?

247
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Hoping that I could find Bob Dobbs.

248
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,820
Don't you help me, Bob Dobbs.

249
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,160
Send me through, Bob Dobbs.

250
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,300
Can't make it, Bob Dobbs, without help from you.

251
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,300
I need help, Bob Dobbs.

252
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,480
I need help.

253
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,980
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

254
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,540
Hey, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

255
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,540
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

256
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,840
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

257
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,640
Ally,ители, are you all right?

258
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,340
Hey, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

259
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,660
You can't wet water.

260
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:38,940
You can't digest your own stomach.

261
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,440
You can't swallow your own throat.

262
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
You can't run from your own legs.

263
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,400
You can't hide from JR Bob Dobbs cause he's stupid.

264
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,360
You can't hide from Guy cause he's bigger than you.

265
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,580
He's bigger than all reality.

266
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:54,640


267
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,500
Help me somebody.

268
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Pull the lever down to go.

269
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,580
My legs are on fire.

270
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,020
Need some help, need some help.

271
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,340
Great job.

272
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,880
Pull the lever down to go.

273
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,860
You can see it's still in the container there.

274
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,760
Pull the lever down to go.

275
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,840
The guitar is still on fire.

276
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,320
And the famous Lame code is still intact.

277
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,420
Pull the lever down to go.

278
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,460
I think that was the rest of it.

279
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,720
We were finding money at the files.

280
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,780
Money was going in there.

281
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,000
Which was an exciting sight.

282
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,060
All the video tapes we got here at the station.

283
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,080
And you know, it's only Instagram that's burned up too.

284
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,280
All of the music that we were playing has disappeared.

285
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,640
We're going to go get some money.

286
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:54,640


287
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,200
Not my guitar pin.

288
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,380
My special Bob shirt.

289
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,940
My Bob hat is burning.

290
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,320
My Bob t-shirt is burning.

291
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,160
I'm deceased.

292
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,300
I'm totally deceased.

293
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,340
Subgenius Beach Party.

294
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,880
Subgenius Beach Party.

295
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,500
Subgenius Beach Party.

296
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,280
That was a beautiful little death scene

297
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,540
from Puzzling Evidence and Glass Madness.

298
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,780
This is Doctors for Bob.

299
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,920
Subgenius Beach Party

300
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,580
with the great Snavy

301
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,340
and the lovely Eklund

302
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,220
on sacks in the back.

303
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,720
But let's leave things

304
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,380
of this world behind

305
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,960
and walk now down the path of Bob

306
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,040
for this brief minute of slack

307
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,680
from the church of the subgenius.

308
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,760
Oh yes, praise Bob, friend.

309
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,720
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

310
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,640
Come on in.

311
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,520
I've come to tell you the truth.

312
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,600
The truth about the path to slack

313
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,940
through hyperventilation.

314
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,480
Yes, my friend.

315
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,780
You can get high from hyperventilation.

316
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
And it's legal.

317
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,140
And it's an exercise we're preaching.

318
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,860
And if you can learn to talk like me

319
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,080
and talk this way

320
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,920
all the time, then everybody you meet

321
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,120
will be your friend.

322
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,640
And you will get so high,

323
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,380
you will get so high, you will meet Bob.

324
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,760
You will not be able to stop seeing Bob

325
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,900
because you will have so much slack

326
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,240
in your brain.

327
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,520
There won't be any more room for thought.

328
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,500
And when your mind is free,

329
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,020
free of thought,

330
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,940
then you will have the slack,

331
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,220
the slack you need in your life.

332
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Praise Bob.

333
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,320
Help me somebody.

334
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,000
Do I hear a praise Bob?

335
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,640
Let there be slack.

336
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,460
Subgenius speech party.

337
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,740
Subgenius speech party.

338
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,100
Subgenius speech party.

339
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,260
Subgenius speech party.

340
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,800
Subgenius speech party Eeeee Mar Subgenius speech party.

341
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,220
Subgenius speech party.

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,620
Subgenius speech party.

343
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,200
Subgenius speech party.

344
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,640
I've got the suntan lotion.

345
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,740
Did you bring the neutron howitzers?

346
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,340
TAP, tap, TAP, TAP, TAP, TAP.

347
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,600

Nothing is real

353

I can't help it

354
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,840
Nothing is real

355
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,400
I can't help it

356
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,580
Nothing is real

357
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,900
Nothing is real

358
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,120
People are strange

359
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,520
Ones in contact

360
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
Ones in contact

361
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,860
Ones in contact

362
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,120
I can't help it

363
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,180
Nothing is real

364
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,520
Nothing is real

365
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,960
Nothing is real

366
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,240
Nothing is real

367
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,720
When you're strange

368
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:19,900
When you're strange

369
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,300
All you need is love

370
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,040
When you're strange

371
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,560
All you need is love

372
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,260
When you're strange

373
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,020
All you need is love

374
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,040
Ones in contact

375
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,520
Ones in contact

376
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,180
Nothing is real

377
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,600
Nothing is real

378
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,700
Nothing is real

379
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,020
Nothing is real, dear friends,

380
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,540
at least in the minds of Reverend Huey

381
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,900
and the other people who do these hideous collages.

382
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,720
and the other people who do these hideous collages.

383
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,620
But all I have to do is touch this button

384
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,560
and save you from that...

385
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,880
Nothing is real

386
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,020
God, that really does just keep going, doesn't it?

387
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,280
Nothing is real

388
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,600
Nothing is real

389
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,140
Nothing is real

390
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,140


391
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,760
Nothing is real

392
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,480
There's a good Bob

393
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,420
There's a bad Bob

394
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,800
People that followed the wrong one

395
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,880
and got no job

396
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,460
People that followed the wrong one and got no job

397
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,300
People that followed the right one's happy

398
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,480
People that followed the right one's happy

399
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:23,480


400
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,000
People Bob

401
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,700
People Bob

402
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,380
People Bob

403
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,380
People Bob

404
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,200
People Bob

405
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:46,400
No atom of mere matter divides itself into alternate cells almost constantly,

406
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,880
but our universe does.

407
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,280
But our universe does.

408
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,820
All the time,

409
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,260
the universe splits in order to express every alternative open to any phenomenon transpiring within,

410
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,940
no matter how small or seemingly insignificant.

411
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,360
This is the only way our minds can express the perception of the fifth dimension,

412
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,380
or more properly, the second dimension of time.

413
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,860
So this introduces the concept of time viewed as a plane rather than a line.

414
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,360
But there's another dimension of space,

415
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,780
so is the case with time, there is also a corresponding up-down time.

416
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,800
So this introduces the concept of time viewed as a plane rather than a line. But there's another dimension of space, so is the case with time, there is also a corresponding up-down time.

417
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,440
This is the direction in which our mental eyes exist.

418
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,580
In this direction we find alternate time tracks similar to the sidewise ones,

419
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:33,760
with the difference being that theirs is oriented in the direction opposed to temporal gravity,

420
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:40,720
so that elements of those other selves are constantly falling into our awareness from above.

421
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:47,480
The neutron passes through all these spaces with equal ease and is modulated by them,

422
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,800
much like the photon is modulated by the neutron.

423
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:49,800


424
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:49,800


425
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,800
The neutron uses life form to inhabit the space belt as for some dell soldiers.

426
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,040
But the particle is gespannt and portal to the pretty in death instincts and talks through their возможно

427
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,080
futility such as emails dropzilla

428
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,900
it's a combined universal process

429
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,700
and evolution of transcendental computers

430
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,980
the first known it feels it has ever removed

431
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,460
all of its coordinating phenift cualities

432
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:07,600
during certain motion

433
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:19,600
for any run of the earth's cache over any given time.

434
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:19,800
But this information and its software files affect Malachy nervous system,

435
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,120
The primordial sea teemed with the most primitive of bacteria.

436
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,880
Their genetic material was a simple molecule shaped like a lumpy ladder.

437
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,080
It was very chemically stable.

438
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,700
The neutron passed through Earth and spewed out a wake

439
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,560
that left each and every molecule of DNA twisted beyond recognition.

440
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,140
In this state, its stability was ruined,

441
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,080
and any force or random glitch that Mother Nature had to offer changed it somehow.

442
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,840
Thus, evolution had begun.

443
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,600
You can't wash soap.

444
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,920
How you gonna wash soap?

445
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,840
You gonna try to cut it in half and rub the two ends together?

446
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,800
You can't wash soap.

447
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,300
You gonna try to throw it in a washing machine?

448
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,060
You gonna try to slide it through a car wash?

449
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,500
You can't wash soap.

450
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,400
You can't wet water.

451
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,680
You can't digest your own stomach.

452
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,780
You can't swallow your own food.

453
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,100
You can't swallow your own throat.

454
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,400
You cannot hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs, cause he's stupider than you.

455
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,780
You can't hide from God, cause he's bigger than you.

456
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,040
He's bigger than all reality.

457
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,440
Help me somebody!

458
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,120
One take rhythm killers versus doctors for Odin.

459
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,000
Take 43.

460
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:48,420
And friends, that was, uh, what we just heard there was a little bit of the continuation of the

461
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,020
the Mr. Science lecture series about the Mutron.

462
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,860
Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger, your host on that one.

463
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,060
There's other Mr. Science tapes available.

464
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,600
Uh, Buck Naked, uh, did one about the Before Life.

465
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,540
We'll be playing that.

466
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,220
Uh, and, uh, I did one about the squirting universe, which I can't play.

467
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,520
Cause I can't tell the full squirting gospel truth over the airwaves.

468
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,520
It's against the law.

469
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,020
After that, there was a little bit of, uh, more continuation.

470
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,460
Of the continuation of Can't Hide From God rant from Doctors for Bob, J.R. Hyperkleets,

471
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,040
and who knows what this is.

472
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,000
But listen in headphones.

473
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,060
Grrrr.

474
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,820
Grrrrrrr.

475
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,340
Grrrrr.

476
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,640
Grrrrr.

477
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,040


478
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,640
Grrrrrrr.

479
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,040
Grrrrrrrrrrr.

480
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,280
Grrrrrrrrr.

481
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,660
Grrrrrrrrr.

482
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,220
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

483
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,260
Oh

484
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,080
Oh

485
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,040
Oh

486
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,060
Oh

487
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,720
Oh

488
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,520
Oh

489
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:29,700
Oh

490
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,920
Oh

491
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,740
Oh

492
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,200
Oh

493
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,220
Oh

494
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,420
Oh

495
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:48,400


496
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:55,720
Hey, you know, friends, that's particularly true since George DeMarc was let go by KZEW.

497
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,780
Horrible thought.

498
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:07,560
I mean, now that they won't, I mean, his show was too weird for KZEW.

499
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,940
You know, what kind of alternatives are there at this point, friends?

500
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,280
Sickening.

501
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,940
All there is left is Doctors for Bob.

502
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,820
Doctors for Bob!

503
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,040
Doctors for Bob!

504
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,780
Doctors for Bob!

505
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,580
I'll go down.

506
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,260
Rotate to full.

507
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,660
360 degrees.

508
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,060
Now do.

509
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,480
DeMarc and woman!

510
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,080
Bob goes down!

511
00:33:59,540 --> 00:33:59,760
Bob!

512
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,060
Lord, lead us in a closing prayer.

513
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,860
Whether you're going to do it or not, it's missed.

514
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:27,820
The fame of the Bob soon spread beyond the circle of his small disciples following the first revelation to Mullah Hussein.

515
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,120
And it reached the authorities of both the church and the state.

516
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,520
And they were alarmed by the enthusiasm with which the people accepted the Bob's message.

517
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:45,420
The same wave of opposition and hatred that had surrounded Jesus began to engulf the Bob.

518
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,080
There are some people who have brought her.

519
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,200
Some reason or another don't get into our acts.

520
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,920
So-called acts.

521
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,160
I remember a policeman came up to me.

522
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,560
There was some type of incident.

523
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,940
Something about a woman.

524
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,120
I don't know.

525
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,120
Losing her legs or something.

526
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,200
He said,

527
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,240
Boy, what the hell do you think you're doing?

528
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,400
I said,

529
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,120
Well, we're both surrealists, sir.

530
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,540
Bold surrealists.

531
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,320
Bold surrealists.

532
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:37,220
Son, do you know how many men we got out of the states and the district who just love to claim they're nothing but bold surrealists?

533
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,160
Help me, somebody.

534
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,140
Now, this might not have much to do with it.

535
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,300
And you can tell.

536
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,360
I'm not going to deal with the Dobbs doctor.

537
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,260
But I was wondering how many people in here know how to make a grandma face sandwich.

538
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,680
Well, you take in, say, two pieces of rye bread,

539
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,080
spreads some mustard on it, some lettuce, tomatoes.

540
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,580
You might want to put some sprouts if you're one of these healthy people.

541
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,140
In your grandma's face!

542
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,480
I am a jerk.

543
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,480
I get naked.

544
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,540
I will rot.

545
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,460
This is comparing.

546
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,980
I am an activist.

547
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:18,840
I am a

548
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:38,200
I did this act, the grandma face sandwich in San Francisco.

549
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,720
And a woman told me that it made her sick.

550
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,800
I said, well, yeah, I know what you mean.

551
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,160
I forgot to toast the bread.

552
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,160


553
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,900
Nobody goes to Earth.

554
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,400
Nobody goes to Earth anymore.

555
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,080
It's a burned out cinder since the third nuclear holocaust.

556
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,300
Now, existence isn't all it's cracked up to be.

557
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,540
And there's another caller existing on the planet.

558
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,340
You are the last caller from the planet.

559
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,180
The planet is about to be exploded.

560
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,560
Do you have anything you wish to say?

561
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,300
I think he died already.

562
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,640
No, no, no.

563
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,140
I'm not.

564
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


565
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


566
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


567
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


568
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


569
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


570
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


571
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


572
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


573
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


574
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


575
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


576
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


577
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


578
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


579
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


580
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140


581
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,920
Lرجomre took that person and the girl.

582
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,680
I think she had a bad memory.

583
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:28,680


584
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:28,720
There's a little bit of idea about days indispensability of thisladdy.

585
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:28,720


586
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:28,720

00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:33,660

00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:33,660


594
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,440
And there they were.

595
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,160
Hello?

596
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,720
kids into the bedroom and turn down the speaker.

597
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,480
As to which should be frightened of whom.

598
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,880
Well, let me tell you something.

599
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,820
The conspiracy got to it.

600
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,420
Plain and simple.

601
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,280
Somehow they found out that I was going to feature the sex, sickness, and slack tape.

602
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,620
And they rigged the tape deck so that it implanted obnoxious noises.

603
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,120
Squeak!

604
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,420
All throughout the tape.

605
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:30,080
Oh sure, there were sections that didn't have that squeak noise.

606
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:38,820
But I didn't have the heart and the mind to subject you to the rest of that squeak noise.

607
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,600
Touchy subject, sex, ain't it?

608
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,240
That's because the conspiracy forces you to be.

609
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,580
Embarrassed about sex.

610
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,900
A natural, healthy function.

611
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:58,020
The sickness enters the picture when guilt prevents you from experiencing the ecstatic glee of sex in any form or permutation.

612
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,680
Accent on the mutation.

613
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,940
Except, of course, pedophilia.

614
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:08,620
Child sex is the type of perversion that the conspiracy subliminally supports in its advertising.

615
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,400
And by its general repression of slack-filled sex.

616
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,080
The beginning of sexual repression is...

617
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,020
...derminated in the minds of parents who believe that masturbation in infants and children...

618
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,700
...is a naughty no-no.

619
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,320
You may think that the situation has relaxed.

620
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,440
At least they don't send the kids to institutions where they bind them so they can't move.

621
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,500
Don't be deceived.

622
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,900
Victorian principles have permeated the collective unconscious of humanity.

623
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,080
And we've only begun the fight against the control by the real sexual deviants.

624
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,780
The repressed ninnies with insane super-egos.

625
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,260
They run around denying the existence of sex.

626
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,260
They're lying that it's a squirting oozing universe.

627
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,520
And they think they're working for God.

628
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,360
But hell, sex is a religious sacrament.

629
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,700
If they can't take a joke...

630
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,420
...but don't take that literally now.

631
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,420
Sister Chris here.

632
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,240
It's 12.35. Time check.

633
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,240
Sister Chris's version of time check.

634
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,420
3 complete minutes for material analysis.

635
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:23,420


636
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:23,420


637
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:23,420


638
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:28,660
Oh yes dear friends, you are going to make it to that video show at ekstræl.

639
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,140
Oh importantly, my Nor Eight Friends

640
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,500
you're going to race against time to get there by somewhere around 9 o'clock

641
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:33,700
Support Una Zoan

642
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,980
because you're going to know if you aren't there...

643
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:41,480
You may never get a chance to see the subgenius videos in their prefinished form.

644
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:41,820
kn숙

645
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,240
That's right. This is some of the most amazing material you've ever seen.

646
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,260
的

647
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:50,780
ever seen. Some of it about the church, some of it live. Well, let's just read from the

648
00:40:50,780 --> 00:41:02,060
Dallas Observer a fake description. For instance, the true stories features a look at one fundamentalist

649
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:07,380
church meeting complete with wild conspiracy theories, a gospel chorus, and a backing video

650
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:14,220
screen full of strange corporate image montages. All elements found in the Church of the Subgenius'

651
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:21,960
annual revival shows, Stang contends. The multimedia flavor of the segment is also

652
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,720
subgenius in nature. Byrne didn't do it as well as we have, says Stang, but he sure tried to.

653
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,480
You know, I don't know how they got that quote out of my mouth, because I've never even seen

654
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,300
true stories. So how could I say that they did it better? I'm afraid I didn't. Although I'm sure

655
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:43,340
that, I'm sure, I'm sure that we did. Or something like that.

656
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:54,800
At any rate, it's Mistral this Thursday night around 9 o'clock. Mistral, Subgenius,

657
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,860
Devival Video.

658
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:24,700
There was that great night out. The

659
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:42,100
act transferes to I think the part where voices

660
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,180
I hate him!

661
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,600
This is Doctors Floating.

662
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,280
It is Doctors Floating.

663
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,080
This is Doctors Floating.

664
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,060
This is Doctors Floating.

665
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:42,620
This is Doctors Floating.

666
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,660
Ah, so much for that script.

667
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,480
Who needs these scripts anyway?

668
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:53,800
Who needs these scripts anyway?

669
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,380
Dear friends,

670
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,840
I feel sorry for anybody who doesn't listen in headphones.

671
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:00,560


672
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,260
Let's go!

673
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,580
Let's go!

674
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,980
Let's go!

675
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,940
Let's go!

676
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,260
Let's go!

677
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:12,220
Let's go!

678
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,620
Let's go!

679
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:15,620


680
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,400
Let's go!

681
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,140
Ah!

682
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,680
Let's go!

683
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,480
They sent me the tapes

684
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,660
They sent me the tapes

685
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,180
I heard

686
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,900
from subgenius.

687
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:34,980
Ah, well.

688
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,460
I heard and

689
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,760
I am very very happy.

690
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,520
I take the

691
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:52,060
My family and my mother, father and brother, they heard, very, very interesting.

692
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,460
Oh, why? What? What did they say?

693
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:02,480
I said, it's my friends. My friends in subgenius is Bob.

694
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:09,000
So I am Bob in China.

695
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:18,620
So you can give me hello to subgenius friends.

696
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:35,220
I thank you. He helped me and give my sound in the tape and in the radio.

697
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,980
I think American people heard it.

698
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:38,980


699
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,100
My son is very, very interesting.

700
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:51,980
So I am talking about Chinese funny story.

701
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,180
I wrote that article for you.

702
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,460
Is it an excellent award?

703
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,980
It's an excellent award.

704
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,740
Xiao Guang said, no, the teacher said it was too abstract.

705
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,460
No way.

706
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,640
The topic is not to write that.

707
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,940
You mean my father?

708
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,280
Yes.

709
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,660
Xiao Guang said, but you wrote my grandfather.

710
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,920
I can't hear a word you say.

711
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,240
What's happening?

712
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,140
What's the matter?

713
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,820
I would, you know, I have a tendency to say, now, wait a minute.

714
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,060
This is not going to destroy somebody's life.

715
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,160
I firmly believe, I don't really believe there's any great big conspiracy either.

716
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,400
Why do you suppose this piece looks so much older than the rest of the cross?

717
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,880
Let's move on to this line.

718
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,360
Is this Shirley from Cranford?

719
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,440
Here, here's $50.

720
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,320
And he gives me $50.

721
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,260
And then I go and pay my bill.

722
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,320
And he gives me credit for it.

723
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,860
You see, he gives me credit for it.

724
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:04,820
And this writing also occurred from the foundation of the world.

725
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,560
Because in Revelation 17, verse 8,

726
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,480
Revelation 17, verse 8,

727
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,220
it talks about those whose names were not written in the book of life

728
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,960
from the foundation of the world.

729
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,700
If you go to a grave where there's a dead person in it,

730
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,800
and you call out to that dead person,

731
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,440
or you beat on that casket,

732
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:33,520
is that dead person going to hear you?

733
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,780
And these contactees also,

734
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,760
are plunged into a kind of nightmare,

735
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,560
which includes everything.

736
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:47,880
Black Cadillacs, hypnosis, truth dress, the whole business.

737
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:52,640
Look, man, whatever you're doing, you work as hard as you can at that.

738
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,000
You do the best job you can,

739
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,160
and whatever happens, happens.

740
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,440
Five seconds.

741
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,500
Five seconds, friends.

742
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,680
I think you should all be aware that this is not a tape.

743
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,580
What you are watching is happening now.

744
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,640
That's enough. I'm going to talk now.

745
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:21,840
They had me, you know, committed seven years.

746
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,240
Seven years. Chris Gross did it.

747
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:24,800
Seven years.

748
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,120
Here, Dr. Chris Gross did that.

749
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,640
When we deal with the rights of those who are somehow strangers out there,

750
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:36,780
we also are dealing away our own rights and the rights of our loved ones.

751
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,360
But, if you want that degree, find out about these schools,

752
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,100
and there are many, many of them,

753
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,540
and you might not have to spend three years.

754
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,620
Well, now my effort to construct my own private religion

755
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,860
was in more trouble than ever.

756
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,960
The combination of my early training,

757
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,880
and then seeing a friend become a believer in Christ,

758
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,840
gave me the feeling that I should include him in my religion.

759
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,400
My wife, Rosalie,

760
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,520
The fight in Jesus, that's it?

761
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,060
had probably decided before this that I, with my UFOs and my hypnotism,

762
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,860
my fascination for things supernatural,

763
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,800
that I was a little kooky.

764
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,620
And now I added a new element,

765
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,040
and it surprised my wife.

766
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:31,320
Are you telling me you've added Jesus to all the rest of this gospel,

767
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:32,840
according to St. Jonathan?

768
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,860
Asked Connie.

769
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,360
The telegram keeps telling us to make a decision for Christ, doesn't he?

770
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,700
And I think that's what I need.

771
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,600
Bob replied.

772
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,840
Well, I've reached a decision too, honey,

773
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,460
and if you're deciding for Christ, so am I.

774
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:56,480
That I'm continually surprised at how outrageous,

775
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,220
or it seems to me lately,

776
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,680
many of the groups see how outrageous they can be with somebody else.

777
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,060
Do you understand what I'm saying?

778
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,100
I agree with you totally.

779
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,720
I mean, it's an effort to see who can outdo the other

780
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,680
in terms of destroying things on stage.

781
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,840
And what kind of message is that giving to young people in the audience,

782
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,960
those who are 12 and 13 years old?

783
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,640
You can find out at the Subgenius Video Show.

784
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,380
Come to the Subgenius Video Show at Mistral this Thursday night.

785
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,120
I'm giving all my money to KNON.

786
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:27,920
How about that?

787
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,560
That's why I can talk about it.

788
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,840
Is that the message that we really want to give to young people?

789
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,500
It is.

790
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,520
Drink a little beer and drink a little scotch.

791
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,400
Turn around and kick your neighbor in the crotch.

792
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,300
It's no fun if you just stand and watch.

793
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,560
Do the punk hookah.

794
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,740
That's Barry Coma's Funk Pizza Pavilion

795
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,680
on the corner of Grunt and Screech,

796
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,460
next door to the Strap and Shiv Bondo Hut.

797
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,720
You'll hate it.

798
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,160
And that's what it's all about.

799
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,960
Harry's at Shreds.

800
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,420
Never his mind on where he was.

801
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,220
Hm?

802
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,260
What he was doing.

803
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,660
Hm.

804
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,700
You are reckless.

805
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,860
Won't you please tell the man

806
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,420
I didn't kill anyone

807
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:18,500
No, I'm just trying to have me some fun

808
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,540
Welcome to Babylon, children.

809
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,860
It's great to be here in the belly of the beast tonight

810
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:34,020
before we get started with our second L.A. Devival.

811
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,420
If we could all please bow our heads

812
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:40,280
and have a moment of sacred, traditional

813
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:41,540
NOISE!

814
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,160
Doesn't that sound like fun, folks?

815
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,700
Well, if you go to Mistral this Thursday night,

816
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,500
you're in for a subgenius video devival,

817
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,840
just like what you're hearing here.

818
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,620
All of you, we're here to do three things tonight.

819
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,860
That's praying to the boss,

820
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,260
help us get rid of the evil,

821
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,620
and protect the Sons of Satan.

822
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,600
And the last thing you'll do,

823
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,860
is just to have your asses kicked in the back.

824
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,180
See you this evening.

825
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:19,820
No!

826
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,280
No, no, no!

827
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:26,280


828
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:26,460
No, no, no, no!

829
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:26,480


830
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,220
No, no, no, no!

831
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:29,220


832
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:29,220


833
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:29,260
No!

834
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:29,280
No!

835
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


836
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


837
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,360
No!

838
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:29,500


839
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:29,500


840
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:29,500


841
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:29,500


842
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:29,500


843
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,080
Ladies and gentlemen, seeing is believing.

844
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:40,600
And we, my co-religionists and I, have brought back living proof of our expedition,

845
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:45,500
in which 12 of our party met horrible death.

846
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:52,400
But before I say anything more, I'm going to show you the greatest thing your eyes have ever beheld.

847
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,120
He was a king and a god in the world he knew.

848
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:02,320
But now he comes to civilization, a mere show to gratify your curiosity.

849
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:12,040
Ladies and gentlemen, look upon Pope Sterno Kekover, the eighth wonder of the world!

850
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:21,000
The glory go on to our name.

851
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,720
Quote, version, unquote.

852
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:32,600
So, I'd just like to take this opportunity to state briefly and for the record,

853
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:41,440
that my fellow doctors for Bob and myself are members in good standing of a church.

854
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:48,380
But not just any church, for the church to which we belong just happens to be,

855
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,200
beyond a shadow of a doubt, the world's only bogus true religion.

856
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,740
Of course, I am referring to.

857
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,860
The Church of the Subgenius!

858
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:08,940
Now the Church of the Subgenius, as founded by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

859
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:13,740
Saint of Sales, Master of Slack in 1953, is the pan-religion of the future.

860
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:23,320
Uniting superior mutants, social renegades, twisted geniuses, and sci-fi sinners

861
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,100
in a worldwide ramble!

862
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:32,820
The world is in the midst of a great pain of immorals, and prophetic yucks, and grins,

863
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:39,660
yucks and grins which will hopefully, inevitably, lead us directly to a commodity all too lacking,

864
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:42,380
in today's modern, dead, age-ago, society.

865
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:46,060
And that commodity, friends, is slack!

866
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:50,840
Now slack is what the conspiracy wants to take away from us.

867
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,040
Slack is what the conspiracy wants to deprive us of.

868
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:56,100
Slack is our way of grabbing life by the laparotomy.

869
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,720
And by the laparotomy, we can't just turn our heads around and scream at it!

870
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:06,340
Now back in the 50's, Bob himself noticed a decided lack of slack in our culture.

871
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:11,020
He noticed an awful prevalence of normalcy!

872
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:17,160
He noticed that the normals formed a vast conspiracy against the difference,

873
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:23,240
an insidious conspiracy dedicated to squelching our natural rogue instincts.

874
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,080
Dedicated to wiping out our conscience!

875
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,080


876
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:33,760
fun fact dedicated in short to the total and utter eradication of the original slack with

877
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,860
which we were all born.

878
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:40,360
So Bob wanted to fight this conspiracy, ladies and gentlemen, and what better way I'd ask

879
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:46,420
ye than by the foundation of a major new world religion.

880
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,620
It's the Church of the Subgenius.

881
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,520
Praise Bob.

882
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:49,940
Woo!

883
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,800
Help me somebody.

884
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,340
And it's going to be very difficult.

885
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,720
This is officially an atomic seance.

886
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,440
We will need to build up critical mass.

887
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,180
Thank you, children.

888
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,320
Thank you, children.

889
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,360
Thank you, children.

890
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:20,520
I'm here tonight to preach to you about the one and only church, the one true church,

891
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:26,140
the church of love and money, the world's first industrial church, the church of the

892
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:27,420
subgenius.

893
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,340
Now, children, children, the pope of all New York is not a hard man.

894
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,780
He's not a bad man.

895
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,680
He's a man of Bob.

896
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,900
And he knows you've been here a long time.

897
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:45,860
He knows you want that slack, that slack that sets you free, that slack that makes you see,

898
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,300
the slack that puts a cloud in your stride.

899
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,780
I'm not going to take a lot of your time.

900
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,400
I'm not going to take a lot of your time tonight.

901
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:57,980
I got a short message, an important message, but it won't work without you.

902
00:58:59,060 --> 00:58:59,700
What?

903
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,500
What strange land is this?

904
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,060
What am I doing here?

905
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,660
How did this happen?

906
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,600
Why am I asking you?

907
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,520
I'm beginning to suspect thou playing late at night.

908
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,700
But I am sleeping.

909
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:19,040
You slimy mobos come out dreaming, sucking me into your world of horror.

910
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,740
Can this be the world?

911
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,420
The world of tomorrow?

912
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,440
Wait a minute, just a second.

913
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,240
I know who you are.

914
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,400
Yes, it's true.

915
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,140
You're the citizens of the neighborhood.

916
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,920
What the hell is it that you're trying to do to me?

917
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,580
Help me, help me.

918
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,840
I gotta get out of here.

919
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,560
You're making me brain damaged.

920
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,920
All these people hanging around my head.

921
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,760
It's the eye of the living.

922
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,260
It's the eye of the living.

923
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,760
Brass, I just need a slight cranial adjustment.

924
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:50,760
Let the dead man sleep.

925
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:50,760


926
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:50,760


927
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:50,760


928
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,940
I'm dead as pulling my guns inside out.

929
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:56,180
And pulling my brain out through my gum cavity.

930
00:59:56,420 --> 01:00:00,300
As my head implodes and is yanked out by some damn Yankee Garber.

931
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,180
Perhaps I'm a beauty queen.

932
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,620
The target of a thousand flying jackasses.

933
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:11,620
Preying and mocking defiance of their stultified, stupefied deposition on my new TV.

934
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,660
Perhaps I've already won ten million dollars.

935
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:18,980
With the mofo geeks chasing me through the woods trying to rip off my britches.

936
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:22,800
And use me for a human weenie roast in front of the campfire bells.

937
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:28,340
Oh yes dear friends, that was Zug's Rift with his beautiful new album.

938
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:36,400
And here we have, somewhere in here I believe, Doctors for Bob.

939
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:48,040
Doctors for Bob, live at the Twilight Room doing, since we're on Elvis Presley, their version of Heartbreak Hotel.

940
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:59,260
Now friends remember, you can come to a subgenius devival and big screen video show at Mistral this Thursday night around 9 o'clock.

941
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:05,900
This is gonna be the weirdest material you've ever seen projected on a video screen.

942
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:11,980
And a live devival. We'll be preaching and slinging tapes at the same time.

943
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:18,020
And friends, if you want to know more about the Church of the Subgenius, you just write to Bob at P.O. Box 118.

947
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:39,160
I found a new place to dwell.

948
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:47,060
It's out on the edge of a lonely street.

949
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:51,620
It's called the Heartbreak Hotel.

950
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:59,180
Feeling so lonely baby.

951
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,440
Feeling so lonely baby.

01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:13,780
