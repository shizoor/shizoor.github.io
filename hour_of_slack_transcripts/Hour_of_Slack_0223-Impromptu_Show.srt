1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
As much as we thought it was going to be a live show tonight from a darn opium den,

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,520
well, not opium den, it's an alcohol den, but what's the difference as far as I'm concerned?

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,540
We couldn't do it. We were going to do a live show at RC,

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,860
but we were like opening for a Grateful Dead show, see?

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,680
And we don't know how to do a Grateful Dead show.

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,560
Well, some of us probably do, but Dave Moynihan was sick.

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,060
He was sick. He was the guy that was going to do it.

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,260
We were just opening for him. He couldn't do it.

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,780
And so there's some people sitting down there at RC Bar going, what's going on, man?

10
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,280
And I'm sorry, friends.

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,180
There's nothing you can do about it.

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,840
Numero...

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,240
Pneumonia or whatever, you know, I mean, serious colds and so forth.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,360
So once again, it's just another hour of slack.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,500
And yet, and yet, well, this way you'll get to hear the professional version

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:20,580
of what we were going to do in a very rinky-dink way over there at RC Bar on Henderson.

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,700
Yeah, we're going to do pretty much the same thing.

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,780
And then next...

19
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:31,820
Next week, or maybe a week later, sometime in the next two or three weeks, we will do it live.

20
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,800
But for now, you have to hear the...

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,540
I'm sorry, you have to hear the recorded studio version, so to speak.

22
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,240
Of course, it's just as chaotic as it would have been over there, practically,

23
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,180
because we don't know what's going on, and you don't know what's going on,

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,760
and that's what's so wonderful about it, isn't it?

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,960
Isn't that what you love about it?

26
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,640
I'm just waiting to see what kind of a horrible goof-up...

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,140
your radio announcer will make.

28
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,740
Oh, you can count them up?

29
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,480
Just listen, count...

30
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,160
Let's start a new contest.

31
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,520
Count my mistakes.

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,620
Go ahead.

33
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,660
Don't make no difference to me.

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,460
Don't make no...

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:18,380
Never mind at all, because instead of actually being able to do the Grateful Dead show,

36
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,560
which we would not really have been that good at, but we will next week,

37
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,940
instead we...

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,620
Well...

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,060
Well, we're...

40
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,300
We're doing what we know a little better than the Grateful Dead,

41
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,660
which is the 60s in general,

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,100
and the effluvia, the fallout from the 60s,

43
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,180
as it exists today.

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,140
Only 30 years later.

45
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,620
Hehehe.

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,760
Yeah, I remember that time way back then when I did that Mahoody,

47
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,140
and then we ran down to the Mahoody,

48
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,540
and we...

49
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,300
Oh, man.

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,200
That was one big co-hern-key...

51
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,340
Cool...

52
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,700
Like, groppin' groove-go thing, man, baby.

53
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,080
And, uh, yeah.

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,660
Yeah.

55
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:06,660


56
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,000
I sure got the blues this morning, baby.

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,640
Yeah, and I'm here to tell you about it.

58
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,360
So you might as well pick up on it.

59
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,960
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of slack.

60
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,340
That's right.

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,880
because we're

62
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:35,880


63
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,140
y

64
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,580
pump

65
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,680
train

66
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,920
pum

67
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,220
let's

68
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,780
Let it be

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,260
Clutch your hands

70
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,480
Oh, the world's left to live

71
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,900
And I ain't gonna copy you

72
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,500
Principal?

73
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,820
Oh yes, dear friend.

74
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,460
This is Li Liqing, a Chinese subgenius.

75
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,920
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON in Dallas, Texas.

76
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,920
Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people.

77
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,200
Here in China, just like in America,

78
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,380
the people need Slack.

79
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,300
In Chinese, we call Slack 乐天台

80
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,480
But it must be true Slack, not the bad Slack of the conspiracy.

81
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,920
Please, Bob, help me somebody.

82
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,520
Bob!

83
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,120
I don't care

84
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,820
I don't care

85
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,640
This

86
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,280
Cause I've taught my own words to live the will

87
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,800
And I ain't gonna copy you

88
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,160
She said, cutting her own legs off

89
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,040
in what was to be the foment of a startlingly trend

90
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,960
among the so-called punk de-tele-hantia.

91
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,240
Problem.

92
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,080
That's the problem with the punk de-tele-hantia, dear friends.

93
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,980
I just don't have any sense of history.

94
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,880
So, uh, we're gonna try to fill you in on the worst of the 60s tonight.

95
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm afraid.

96
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,520
I don't want to walk and talk about Bob.

97
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,020
I just want to see his face.

98
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,280
This is the first time I've called, and I really love your show.

99
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,160
Thanks for calling in.

100
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,000
You're welcome.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,100
And, um, I'm calling.

102
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,640
Thank you.

103
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,480
Okay, um, I'm a born-again Christian, and Jesus Christ is my Lord.

104
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,920
And about three years ago, he delivered me of drugs.

105
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,380
And one of the drugs that I was on was acid.

106
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,540
And I remember, um, I didn't like it.

107
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,900
I wanted to get off of it, and I didn't have no control over my mind.

108
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,680
And I said, well, I'll just go sleep it off.

109
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,360
So I went to sleep, and I remember the devil, the devil and Jesus.

110
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,540
Like, it was a, I felt the warfare, the battle.

111
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,080
Mm-hmm.

112
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,440
And, um, I remember I cried out to God.

113
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,740
I said, God, you know, I'm really sorry, and this is really scaring me.

114
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,740
And I remember I went to sleep, and I woke up the next morning, and there was this big burn on my knee.

115
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:36,040
And, um, and I told my husband about it, and he said, no, you must have just, you know, burnt yourself with a cigarette, because I smoked at the time.

116
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,920
And I was wondering, um, is that possible?

117
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:40,880
Okay.

118
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,340
That...

119
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,380
Yeah, well, uh, I don't know exactly the significance of it.

120
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,060
But most anything is possible.

121
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,080
But what you're telling me, I mean, I have verified in my research around the world.

122
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,040
For example, you could have been in a room with a half a dozen other people who had dropped acid.

123
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,640
And you would have all been seeing the same landscape, going through the same adventure, encountering the same entities.

124
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,300
Now, that's, uh, I mean, I've talked to too many people who've had that experience.

125
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,660
So you know that you are all being manipulated by a common deceiver.

126
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,360
And, uh, but I've also talked to people who have...

127
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,360


128
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,640
who have literally come to Christ on an LSD trip.

129
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,040
Satan overdid himself and freaked them out.

130
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,940
And they got so scared, they cried out to God.

131
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,820
And, uh, the Lord did rescue them.

132
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,560
And I'm not recommending drugs to lead somebody to Christ by any means.

133
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,700
But God is very gracious.

134
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,940
So something really is going on.

135
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,320
Your brain is being manipulated.

136
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,280
Yeah, and we'd like to manipulate it a little bit more, dear friends.

137
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,400
In the meantime, friends, as I said before,

138
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,720
this was supposed to be a, uh,

139
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,580
a live, dead show from the, uh, the RC bar.

140
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,260
Uh, technical and health problems caused that not to happen.

141
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,420
So instead, we're gonna sit here in the studio and do what we were gonna do,

142
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,880
which is talk about the 60s and actually the early 70s.

143
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,320
Kind of both, uh, but it's interesting to find out

144
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,340
because it's interesting to find out

145
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,140
where the 60s segued into the 70s

146
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,120
and went from sort of a political, cultural thing

147
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,440
to kind of a, uh, drug thing.

148
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,880
Too bad, wasn't it?

149
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,400
How many of y'all were hippies?

150
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,880
Had long hair, listened to rock music,

151
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,380
believed in free love, which was neither?

152
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,220
I don't know. It's kind of a shame.

153
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,200
Free love never bled over into the church of the subgenius,

154
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,680
probably because we had too much respect for the women.

155
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,400
How many of y'all dropped acid?

156
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,660
How many took part in demonstrations?

157
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,180
How many, above all, served for our country in Vietnam?

158
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
If you did, I salute you.

159
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,060
Not the war, but those who served.

160
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,340
Now, me, I was, uh, of the 60s, but not in it.

161
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,120
I was a little too young.

162
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,960
I was more like part of the 70s drug brother generation,

163
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,060
you know, the kind that could have gone to Woodstock but didn't.

164
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,700
Never got into the Grateful Dead, but, uh,

165
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,080
Hendrix, yeah, Zappa, mm-hmm,

166
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,960
Quicksilver Messenger Service, Poco,

167
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,340
Firesign Theater, Zap Comics, ee!

168
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,860
But I was a suburban kid, friends.

169
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,760
I had it easy.

170
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,300
In 1968, I had, I hate to admit it, but it's true,

171
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,280
in 1968, I carried a Nixon sticker on my briefcase.

172
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,000
And yet, by 1969, I'd seen Easy Rider,

173
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,460
and so I realized the hippies were up to something.

174
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,140
Unfortunately, by 1972, what they were up to mostly was dope,

175
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,560
but I clung to the, well, not the political part,

176
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,120
but the cultural hippie thing.

177
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,280
Yeah, just the cultural part.

178
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,460
And that's more than I can say for most of my contemporaries.

179
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,580
I mean, hey, man, I've got the most complete underground comics collection in Dallas.

180
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,920
The guy that draws most of the sub, well, the main subgenius,

181
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:31,500
uh, heavy-duty activist artist is also the guy who now draws the furry Freak Brothers,

182
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
believe it or not.

183
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,400
Yeah, all that old underground comic stuff.

184
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,540
The rip-off press that published that stuff, they're, they're publishing Bob now.

185
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,660
The circle is unbroken.

186
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,800
Not to brag, but we are bragging.

187
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,360
Yeah, the 60s was a fun, scary time.

188
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,480
I did some 60s-type things, hitchhiked across Europe

189
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,100
with a hippie chick, and then I married her.

190
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,860
That wasn't a very hippie-like thing to do.

191
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,040
Lived on a Sioux Indian reservation in South Dakota.

192
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,220
Worked on, worked there, actually.

193
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,820
I wore braids and buckskin like an idiot.

194
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,340
Smoked hash in Morocco just like everybody else.

195
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,120
And as my dad said,

196
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,640
son, if everybody jumped off a cliff with you,

197
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,400
no, no, but I did.

198
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,420
Only, I had a parachute, dear friends.

199
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,100
Because I had...

200
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,060
buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, yeah.

201
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,720
How about I stayed a mutant?

202
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,240
I really did.

203
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,280
I got married when that was the least cool thing you could do.

204
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,960
Cut my hair short just when long hair got acceptable.

205
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,080
Made underground films, man.

206
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,460
But punk style.

207
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,960
And finally, went to work for Bob Dobbs

208
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,400
and the Church of the Subgenius

209
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,520
and told everyone who was cool to buck off.

210
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,120
So call me old-fashioned, friends,

211
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,000
but I believe that you can maintain the spirit of the 60s

212
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,700
by blowing off the external trappings of them.

213
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,760
Of course, some of these ideas have to get modified.

214
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,520
I used to think, heck, if somebody wants their country to be communist,

215
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,040
let them.

216
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,960
But then I went to China.

217
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,480
And I compared China and Japan,

218
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,180
and I thought to myself, well, who's kept their heritage?

219
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,180
The country that was subjugated and occupied by the United States?

220
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,020
Or the one that just went Marxist?

221
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,540
And friends, the one that was subjugated and occupied by the US

222
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,040
kept far more of its traditional values and prospered.

223
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,660
Whereas the Marxist commie countries became hell on earth.

224
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,000
But to get back to the subject, I mean,

225
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,240
I guess it all started when Bob Dobbs met Ken Kesey

226
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,760
and sold him some LSD.

227
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,980
Had quite a markup, I might add.

228
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,560
I don't know, maybe it began when Dobbs bumped into Dr. Albert Hoffman

229
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,360
and made his hand slide across that wet table of fungus spore effluvia.

230
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,480
And maybe it started when the two-year-old Bob Dobbs

231
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,400
was accidentally dosed with belladonna instead of aspirin

232
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,980
by a drunken druggist, his own father, as a matter of fact.

233
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,460
Well, I don't know.

234
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,500
We're going to look into what delineated the 60s

235
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,740
and why it's irrelevant in the 90s,

236
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,040
as will be heard once again on this show, dear friends.

237
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,800
It's a nasty and tricky, tricky, tricky question.

238
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,560
It concerns me because a lot of our psychiatrists here today

239
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,700
is administering drugs that in fact do manipulate your brain as well

240
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,860
and can lead to hallucinations and so forth.

241
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,300
So you probably had a real experience.

242
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,340
Where the burn came from and what the significance is,

243
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,600
I don't know, but it is definitely possible

244
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,880
to have these physical intrusions into your body

245
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,420
from the spirit dimension.

246
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:26,900
Sure.

247
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,560
If you can just get your mind

248
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,680
together, then come on across to me.

249
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,720
We'll hold hands and then we'll watch the sun rise

250
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,100
from the bottom of the sea.

251
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,000
But first, are you experienced?

252
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,860
Have you ever been experienced?

253
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,160
Well,

254
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,460
I have.

255
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,700
And that eliminates some of the arguments that have come before

256
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,800
that these are physiological or pharmacological manifestations

257
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,600
because if it was pharmacological,

258
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,940
then an LSD would generate different kinds of disjointed hallucinations.

259
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,800
The common element there suggests a common deception.

260
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,680
And we're really back into 2 Corinthians

261
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,920
and we're talking about deceivers, angels of light and the like.

262
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,340
And I think that's a logical explanation.

263
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,720
The Bible calls it sorcery.

264
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,100
Sure.

265
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,260
The New Testament indicates it would be revived in the last days.

266
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,680
The world would refuse to repent when God's judgment would come.

267
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,700
And one of the Greek words for sorcery is pharmakia, pharmakos.

268
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,420
Sorcerer takes consciousness-altering drugs to contact spirit entities

269
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,940
to gain supernatural powers.

270
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,420
And my alma mater, UCLA, believe it or not,

271
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,280
gave Carlos Castaneda his PhD in anthropology for Journey to Ixalan.

272
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,500
I know, I know

273
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,500
You probably scream and cry

274
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,980
That your little world won't let you go

275
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,180
But who in your measly little world

276
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,500
Are you trying to prove that

277
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,720
You're made out of gold and

278
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,940
Can't be sold?

279
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:28,820
Hey!

280
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,040
If you could just get your minds together

281
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,000
And come along with me

282
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,060
Hold hands and watch the sun rise

283
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,560
From the bottom of the sea

284
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,260
What good is it to be a man?

285
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,200
If this is a privileged crowd here tonight,

286
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,840
because the Pope of all New York is going to do his 60s nostalgia rants

287
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,680
for the last time.

288
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,740
So, Joseph, I need you to not only listen carefully,

289
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,060
you must respond to me.

290
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,860
And let me now at this point introduce my perky spokesman, Otto Kapp.

291
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,620
Can we have a lovely hand for my perky spokesmodel?

292
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,720
Kapp is going to help you, help me tell you

293
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,860
what delineated the 60s and why it's irrelevant in the sub-90s.

294
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,840
Tell the truth!

295
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,420
Now, Jonah, help me now.

296
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,400
We're going to talk about the first thing that delineated the 60s.

297
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,780
Can I get a P?

298
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,040
Can I get an O?

299
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,120
Can I get an L?

300
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,580
Can I get an I?

301
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,020
Can I get an I?

302
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,200
Can I get an I?

303
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,120
Can I get an I?

304
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,100
What's that spell?

305
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,840
What's that spell?

306
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,980
What's that spell?

307
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:03,980


308
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,200
That's right, children.

309
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,140
Politics.

310
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,240
Is everybody done laughing?

311
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,300
Politics in the sub-90s, children?

312
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,620
The last political thought you've had in the last six months is,

313
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,740
who's Von Hall?

314
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,580
Politics is a dead issue, and let me explain to you why.

315
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,220
Why?

316
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,860
You can go to Poland and vote, children, if you want to vote.

317
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,200
You can go to Chile and vote if you want to vote, children.

318
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,740
And the people that live there know what they're voting for.

319
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,120
And do you know what they see as democratic freedom, children?

320
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,360
I'll tell you.

321
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,040
Do you know what they want in Russia, children?

322
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,860
What do they want?

323
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,580
They want Led Zeppelin albums and 501 Blues, children.

324
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,680
Led Zeppelin!

325
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,960
The products of a free society are now mistaken

326
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,640
for the society which had the freedom to produce them.

327
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,900
So nobody around the country, around the world,

328
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,540
is looking for politics, children.

329
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,420
They want ghetto blasters as big as El Dorado.

330
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,300
Me!

331
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,380
Me!

332
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,220
More slack!

333
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,100
When you invest in pop culture,

334
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,660
which is what you've been given as a substitute for politics, children,

335
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,980
you get bored in a hurry.

336
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,940
And you get bored in a hurry so that you'll go out and buy more pop culture.

337
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,820
More pop culture!

338
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,760
You're so convinced that your taste in rock and roll,

339
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,220
or art, or movies,

340
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
is what defines you, children,

341
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,960
that you buy and buy and buy to shore up that definition.

342
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,060
And you're playing right into the conspirators' hands, children.

343
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,780
Right! Right!

344
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,260
But as it turns out, children,

345
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
you're also playing into our hands, children,

346
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,920
because Bob is a savior designed for a consumer society.

347
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,100
Bob is...

348
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,160
A short-duration personal savior!

349
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,300
That's right, children.

350
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,340
Bob wants you, Bob wants you

351
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,840
to take him into your heart,

352
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,580
to take him into your mind,

353
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,220
to take him into your wight,

354
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,680
and then cast him out, children,

355
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,840
and make your own church.

356
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,540
And children, when you look around at the shambles

357
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,060
that the modern world has become, children,

358
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,520
don't blame Bob.

359
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,260
He doesn't make history.

360
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,840
He just exploits it.

361
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,800
And if children, if you look at these subgeniuses,

362
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,740
and you see how deep their devotion is,

363
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,160
and how truly they believe,

364
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,900
and how much Bob means to them,

365
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,820
and you say,

366
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,580
a joke is all that's left children,

367
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,580
yes, that's true, children,

368
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,140
but it's a joke you can believe in.

369
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,440
Joke!

370
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,580
Now, children,

371
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,640
let's talk about the next thing that delineated the 60s.

372
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,720
You're going to help me.

373
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,520
Give me a B.

374
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,320
B!

375
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,140
Give me an R.

376
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:42,800
R!

377
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,700
Give me an A.

378
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,160
A!

379
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,020
Give me an I.

380
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,560
I!

381
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,240
Give me an N.

382
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:46,700
N!

383
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,680
Give me an S.

384
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:47,920
N!

385
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,680
What's that spell?

386
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,480
Brain!

387
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,200
What's that spell?

388
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,040
Brain!

389
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,600
What's that spell?

390
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,460
Brain!

391
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,900
That's right, children, brains.

392
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,340
Children, you're going to find this hard to believe.

393
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,220
You're going to say to me,

394
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,140
no, Dave, no.

395
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,100
No, Dave, no.

396
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,940
But in fact, children, at one time,

397
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,040
it was hip to be smart.

398
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,000
No!

399
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,360
Hip to be smart, children.

400
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,080
Now, that's nostalgia, children.

401
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,060
Think back on the days when it was hip to have brains.

402
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,220
Children, nowadays,

403
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,580
if you're in a conversation with someone,

404
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,540
and you imply that anything underlies anything,

405
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,040
if you show the slightest spark of intelligence,

406
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,440
people look at you like you're crazy.

407
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,140
Crazy!

408
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,740
And that's why in the church we say,

409
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,780
if you act like a dumb ,

410
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,340
they'll treat you like an equal.

411
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,120
That's right, children.

412
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,000
You know what Bob says, children?

413
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,280
What does Bob say?

414
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,260
You know how dumb the average guy is?

415
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,840
Well, by definition,

416
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,640
half of them are dumber than that!

417
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,000
I mean, children,

418
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,860
do you really want to think about your job?

419
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,440
Do you really want to think about your future?

420
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,800
Do you really want to think about that check you take home?

421
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,580
Do you want to think about the environment?

422
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,480
Do you really want to think about the government?

423
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,560
Hell no, children!

424
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,000
So, children,

425
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,300
I think it's safe to say that brains are a dead issue

426
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,700
in the sub-90s.

427
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,120
The next thing that delineated the 60s,

428
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:12,520
help me, children,

429
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,220
give me a D.

430
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,900
Give me an R.

431
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,420
R!

432
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:15,620
R!

433
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:15,620


434
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:15,620


435
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:15,620


436
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:15,620


437
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,160
Give me a U.

438
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,520
U!

439
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,320
Give me a G.

440
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:17,820
G!

441
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,660
Give me an S.

442
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,080
S!

443
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,580
What's that spell?

444
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:19,960
R!

445
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,920
What's that spell?

446
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,500
R!

447
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,200
What's that spell?

448
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:22,720
R!

449
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,860
Drugs, children.

450
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,060
Drugs?

451
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,760
Well, let's run down the drugs

452
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,060
that delineated the 60s, shall we?

453
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,440
Let's start with marijuana, children.

454
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,800
I don't know about you,

455
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,940
I don't know the last time I saw any marijuana.

456
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,380
And when I,

457
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,820
in the 60s, children,

458
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,760
marijuana was $12 an ounce,

459
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,020
not $220!

460
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,260
Yeah!

461
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,100
Now,

462
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,220
I don't know if you've ever seen

463
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,220


464
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,240
but it's $220!

465
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,280
Yeah!

466
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,620
Yeah!

467
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,960
Nowadays, children,

468
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,960
life being what it is,

469
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,920
when people say to me,

470
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,140
day!

471
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:49,900
Day!

472
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,840
When they say to me,

473
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,220
red day!

474
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,300
Red day!

475
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,420
New York City day!

476
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,480
New York City day!

477
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:56,520


478
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,140
Do you want some marijuana?

479
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,400
Do you want some marijuana?

480
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,700
I say,

481
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
no thank you, children.

482
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,120
I can get depressed and paranoid

483
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,760
for free.

484
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,020
All right, now,

485
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,720
let's talk about cocaine, children.

486
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,440
I know cocaine is popular now,

487
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,340
but the only one thing to say about that,

488
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,720
and that was said by the great subgenius,

489
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,620
Saint Hunter Alexander,

490
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:15,840
S. Thompson,

491
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,920
when he said,

492
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,180
Yeah!

493
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,780
Drug culture?

494
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,160
What drug culture?

495
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,060
It's just a big dirty business.

496
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,200
Now, children,

497
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,340
psychedelics,

498
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,820
psychedelics in the sub-90s, children,

499
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,440
the Pope of all New York doesn't think so, children.

500
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,440
The Pope of all New York thinks in real life

501
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,180
it's sufficiently hallucinatory

502
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,840
in the sub-90s.

503
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,860
If I could quote another,

504
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,140
another great subgenius,

505
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,400
Saint Paul Krasner,

506
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,340
when he said,

507
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,960
when you're watching TV

508
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,700
and you see something

509
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,280
you absolutely cannot believe,

510
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,420
just flap your arms like a bird, children,

511
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,440
and if you float up to the ceiling,

512
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,680
you're on LSD.

513
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,180
And if you stay in your chair,

514
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,900
you're in the sub-90s.

515
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,580
All right, children,

516
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,580
the last thing that delineated the 60s,

517
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,740
give it up!

518
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,680
You can see!

519
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,480
Sorry, we can't say sex on the radio.

520
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,900
Let's cast our mind back,

521
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,540
all of those of you who are the same age

522
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,500
as the Pope of all New York,

523
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,400
those of you who are in college

524
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,520
and the early and mid-70s children,

525
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,120
do you perchance remember

526
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,260
all the crazed weasel-like running

527
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,880
you were doing with everybody

528
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,780
who came along in the early 70s, children?

529
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,960
Would you do that now, children?

530
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,460
I don't think so.

531
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,000
But maybe, maybe, children,

532
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,280
you'll be smart enough to do it.

533
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,660
Maybe you won't listen to me,

534
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:41,660


535
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,780
but you'll listen to the conspiracy children.

536
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,760
Remember, children,

537
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,320
the prisoners are happiest

538
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,900
with the prisons they built for themselves,

539
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,800
and the anti-sex league of 1984

540
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,920
is taking shape, children.

541
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,160
It's taking shape.

542
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,140
But I know you won't let the conspiracy

543
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,040
kick your away.

544
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,760
Now, Tony, I don't think you all know

545
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,700
what happened on July 5, 1998.

546
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,380
I think you all know that that's the day

547
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,380
the X-Men come down.

548
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,480
And you know, Tony, the X-Men,

549
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,360
they're businessmen.

550
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,000
They're simple businessmen,

551
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,380
just like Bob is a businessman.

552
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,620
And all they want, children,

553
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
is real estate.

554
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,760
They want real estate, children.

555
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,060
And they have a contract for the planet Earth,

556
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,940
the X-Men,

557
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,380
and they have the means to repossess it.

558
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,500
Do you know who stands in their way?

559
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,200
Do you know who stands in their way?

560
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,560
Say Bob, children.

561
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,960
Who is it that stands in their way?

562
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,080
Who stands in their way?

563
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,360
Who is it that stands in their way?

564
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,020
Bob!

565
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,820
Bob only stands in their way

566
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,260
with your help, children.

567
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,220
Bob only stands in their way

568
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,560
when you buy the MacGyver,

569
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,600
the subgenius 995!

570
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,380
You better watch the stores everywhere.

571
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,040
Hold on.

572
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,760
You go to the table where my will-o-law is.

573
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,060
I buy T-shirts, former stickers,

574
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
buttons, badges,

575
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,660
and the new Arise video tape.

576
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,600
Now, children, a long time ago,

577
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,900
when the church and the subgenius began,

578
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,740
1998 seemed as far away as your day.

579
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,780
But now, children, it's only 10 years in.

580
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,560
10 years in.

581
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:11,860
10, children.

582
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,400
10 little years.

583
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,220
And you may, those of you who like to read Nostradamus,

584
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,360
think that plagues are going to be visiting us in those 10 years, children.

585
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,880
Drought, fire, war.

586
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,340
But, children, the plagues of the next 10 years

587
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,800
will not be externally derived, children.

588
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,940
They will be internally derived.

589
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,760
They'll be the plague of sitting at home

590
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,040
and watching your tape

591
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,420
when you should be making Bob art,

592
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,560
when you should be corresponding with other subgeniuses,

593
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,540
when you should be buying the MacGyver,

594
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:41,940
when you should be buying from Bob

595
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,980
and tying to the sacred P.O. box.

596
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,840
The conspiracy, children, wants to break us apart,

597
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,880
make us function as that all-important consumer unit individual

598
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,600
and get rid of us.

599
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,460
But there's a man, children,

600
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,440
a man with a pipe.

601
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,420
And he's waiting, children.

602
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,240
He's waiting to save you.

603
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,140
But it's up to you, children, to open your heart to Bob.

604
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,120
It's up to you, children, to let Bob come in.

605
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,460
It's up to you to see the value in Bob.

606
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,460
And now, children, in closing,

607
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,780
I'm going to quote from the great subgenius saint Lester Bayes.

608
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,380
I'm going to read you something, children.

609
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,020
This was written upon Elvis' death, children.

610
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,960
So be patient with me and listen to this.

611
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,780
If love is truly going out of fashion forever,

612
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,240
then along with our nurtured indifference to each other

613
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,160
will be a more even contemptuous indifference

614
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,400
to each other as objects of worship, like Bob.

615
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,280
We will continue to fragment in this matter

616
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,140
because solipsism holds all the cards at present.

617
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,680
It is a king whose domain engulfs even Elvis.

618
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,440
But I can guarantee you one thing, children.

619
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,100
We will never agree on anything as we agreed on Elvis.

620
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,100
But, children, the fact is that just as this church

621
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,800
has an infallible pope, it has a fallible saint.

622
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,580
And in that regard, Lester Bayes was mistaken.

623
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,040
Because there is one thing, one man, one entity

624
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,640
we will agree on as we agreed on Elvis.

625
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,860
And who is that man?

626
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,640
Who is that man?

627
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,980
Who is that man?

628
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,280
Who is that man?

629
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,720
Who is that man?

630
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,640
Who is that man?

631
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,740
Children, that man is Bob.

632
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,060
And Bob is there for you.

633
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,180
Bob loves you.

634
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,420
Bob needs you.

635
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,080
Bob wants to help you.

636
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,940
Bob wants to fight the conspiracy.

637
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,980
Bob wants to bring you joy.

638
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,600
Bob wants to grant you slack.

639
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,140
Naturally.

640
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,100
With the help of the Reverend Island Stand.

641
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,280
With the help of Court Holland.

642
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,460
I'm forward, Court.

643
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,260
With the help of the Reverend Sterno Docs.

644
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,320
You're going to help me help the Calumet's Christmas City First Climbers

645
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,780
only for Bob Corral sing about Bob.

646
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,380
Are you ready?

647
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,920
Are you ready?

648
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:51,580
Are you ready?

649
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,940
Now, children, you're going to sing back to the Pope of all New York.

650
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,360
Are you ready?

651
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:56,880
Say yes.

652
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,420
Yes.

653
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,100
Are you ready to take Bob into your heart?

654
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,680
Yes.

655
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,080
Are you ready to take Bob into your mind?

656
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:01,640
Yes.

657
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,140
Are you ready to take Bob into your what?

658
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:03,840
Yes.

659
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,320
All right, children, here we go.

660
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,760
You ready?

661
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,160
Yes.

662
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,900
There once was a man.

663
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,100
There once was a man.

664
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:17,680
And when the Herbert жестed a bit,

665
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,500

Don't want to scream and cry

This little world won't let you go

677
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,900
But who in your world

678
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,420
Are you trying to prove

679
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,360
That you're made out of gold

680
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,920
And can't be sold

681
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,040
But first

682
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,860

Pointing their plastic finger at me

Don't pursue my kind

¶¶

715
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,480
Now imagine a world where heroin was legal,

716
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:08,480
but...

717
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,440
possession of coffee was punishable

718
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,560
by up to 50 years in jail.

719
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,620
In other words, friends,

720
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,560
think of a world where you could run down

721
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,320
to the nearest convenience store

722
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,920
just about any time of day or night

723
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,900
and purchase any amount of liquid heroin you wanted.

724
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,040
A whole bottle of heroin would be about three bucks.

725
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,960
Or you could go down to a heroin den

726
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,540
and sit and shoot up with all your shooting buddies

727
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,080
until about 2 a.m.

728
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,540
Then you'd get on the expressway

729
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,860
and drive home.

730
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,800
Or, for that matter, folks,

731
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,460
in the heroin world,

732
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,780
where imagine that the authorities

733
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,360
making heroin so much a part of their business world

734
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,520
that nobody closed a big business deal

735
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,020
without having a few shots of smack with the client.

736
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,360
Wouldn't there be billboards all over the roads

737
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,480
for the coolest brands of heroin

738
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,000
showing beautiful models,

739
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,540
skin popping next to a wall,

740
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:08,840
a waterfall?

741
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,960
And on TV, well,

742
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,180
not only would there be all these ads

743
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,500
showing your favorite sports heroes

744
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,860
shooting their favorite brand of heroin,

745
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,580
but in any party scene,

746
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,800
any scene of any TV show

747
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,920
where people were shown relaxing

748
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,060
or having a good time,

749
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,660
well, they're always taking just a few little

750
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,940
sniffs of smack.

751
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,560
Now, the leaders of a world like that

752
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,500
would have to be pretty insane, right?

753
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,340
I mean, it'd be obvious

754
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,740
that the leaders themselves

755
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,720
were not only heroin users,

756
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,760
but stood the game quite a bit

757
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,620
from the whole population,

758
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,260
aside from a few anti-heroin fanatics

759
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,900
leaning on this substance to relax.

760
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,580
But let's take it a step further, friends.

761
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,120
Imagine if these people made coffee illegal,

762
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,420
because they said it was addictive

763
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,760
and it led to harder stuff like espresso.

764
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,440
But yet, untold millions of people

765
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,620
had been drinking coffee for thousands of years

766
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,520
and no one had ever tried it.

767
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,520


768
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,520


769
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,520


770
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,520


771
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,520


772
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,520


773
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,520


774
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,520


775
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,540
No one had ever OD'd.

776
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,100
You drink it, and it sharpens you up a bit,

777
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,720
and then later you crash a bit.

778
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,920
But it's so illegal

779
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,500
that the smugglers are getting fantastically rich

780
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,920
having contraband coffee beans

781
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,640
flown up from South America.

782
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,280
And there'd be this whole subculture

783
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,500
of bean heads,

784
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,600
people that were into coffee

785
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,400
partly as a rebellion against the establishment.

786
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,100
And the whole reason that coffee

787
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,960
led to harder stuff like

788
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,000
espresso or NyQuil,

789
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,200
was because to buy coffee,

790
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,200
you had to go to a coffee dealer's house,

791
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,780
a pusher's house,

792
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,640
where you'd encounter people who were espresso users.

793
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,120
And on top of that,

794
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,820
a one-ounce bag of coffee beans

795
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,480
would cost like a hundred bucks

796
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,420
just for an ordinary Maxwell house grade.

797
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,340
And people'd be arrested

798
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,620
and spend their whole lives in jail,

799
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,460
maybe even be executed for using coffee,

800
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,260
which is relatively harmless,

801
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,560
while this whole planet of junkies

802
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,500
was going skyrocketing

803
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:08,840
and the world was going to be shot free.

804
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,840
And President Reagan would be up,

805
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,440
you'd see him in the news at,

806
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,100
you know, partying with world leaders,

807
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,100
all of them snorting a bit of smack

808
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,000
and shooting up.

809
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,080
Imagine what a horrible, topsy-turvy world

810
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,100
that would be, friends,

811
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,740
where they made a powerful,

812
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,900
central nervous system depressant

813
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,260
not only legal,

814
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,780
but glamorous.

815
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,400
While an organically grown,

816
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,160
harmless bean off of a bush

817
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,920
could wreck your life,

818
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,420
only because of the laws against it.

819
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,560
But, but,

820
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,120
but that could never happen here.

821
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,120
No, not in this world, friends.

822
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,340
Nah, nay, nay.

823
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,880
Couldn't happen.

824
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,320
No way, baby.

825
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,660
We're an enlightened people here.

826
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,760
So just forget that little allegory.

827
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,200
You know, let's not get depressing about it, friends.

828
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:06,800
Let's,

829
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:13,160
let's just lean back with a good stiff drink

830
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,280
and forget it.

831
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,100
It sure is quiet around here tonight

832
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,660
with the TV on the blink.

833
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,460
I know if I go to bed this early

834
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,340
I won't sleep a confounded wink.

835
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,700
Think I'll just mosey off uptown

836
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,220
to see who all I can see.

837
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,780
Sure as hell, I'll be up in the morning,

838
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,460
and, sweetie, you can go ahead and hit the hay.

839
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,680
No need waiting up for me.

840
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,580
I'll just stand here outside the old bar.

841
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,840
I can't go in,

842
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,720
cause I'm on the wagon.

843
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,680
No more of that beer, wine, and gin.

844
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,580
I'll just sneak up here and take a little look

845
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,380
through this window.

846
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,380
Oh, what do you know?

847
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,820
There's old Joe.

848
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,100
He's still on a bender.

849
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,500
Uh-oh.

850
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,360
I think he's seen me.

851
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,700
Yeah, he has.

852
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,860
And just look at that smile.

853
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,940
Oh, well, I can't see what it'd hurt

854
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,540
to stay just a little while.

855
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,040
No, Joe, I can't have one with you.

856
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,300
You know I'm on the wagon.

857
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,960
Well, make it a small one.

858
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,800
No use to keep on begging.

859
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,880
Hey, Joey, wonder what wife is gonna think.

860
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,460
You think she'll let me in?

861
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,620
What the heck, if she won't,

862
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,840
I'll just have to stay over at your house again.

863
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,680
But if I'm not, I'll stay.

864
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,800
If I go home like this,

865
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,320
I'm gonna be in a mess of trouble.

866
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,440
Here I am, done winning back on my word of honor,

867
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,920
feeling single and seeing double.

868
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,260
Hey, wait a minute, Joe.

869
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,360
Now, this is on me.

870
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,420
One more won't do no harm.

871
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,300
Hmm, that do feel good going down.

872
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,960
Sun nice and warm.

873
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,700
Hey, Joe, dig them crazy twins over there.

874
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,900
They're dressed up just alike.

875
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,660
Boy, wouldn't a little woman have a little

876
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,620
bit of a fit if I brought one of them home tonight.

877
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,780
I'm just sitting here kidding myself.

878
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,100
I wouldn't trade her for all the world.

879
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Though she did put me on the wagon,

880
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,120
she's still a good old girl.

881
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,240
Hey, bartender, you got any coffee?

882
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,260
I bet I look a fright.

883
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,900
I've done gone and set your talking, Joe,

884
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,100
and got myself hiring a kite.

885
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,320
Hey, where'd old Joe go?

886
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,020
Do what?

887
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,240
You say you left.

888
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,620
You mean I've been sitting here all this time

889
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,580
mumbling and jabbering to myself?

890
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,600
Well, if I just knew for sure that my old tomcat

891
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,980
wouldn't mistake me for a mouse and that I could

892
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,440
get by the dog, I'd go sneak back in the house.

893
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,680
I'll sleep off this, too, I'm in,

894
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,480
and I'm gonna quit getting on these sprees.

895
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,300
I'm going back on the wagon.

896
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:03,540
I'm going back on the wagon,

897
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,320
because this drinking's killing me.

898
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,700
I'm sorry, I'm on a soapbox at this point,

899
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,300
and I'm gonna...

900
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,140
I'm in a bad mood.

901
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,520
So I'm gonna flip back over.

902
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,300
I'm gonna let Jane or Hyperclete just spell it out for you, eh?

903
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,520
This song is dedicated to Jesse Presley,

904
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,840
the aborted fetus twin brother of Elvis.

905
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,920
You can't arrest me, officer. I'm not drunk.

906
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,940
I might be half-ass drunk, though.

907
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,260
Whee!

908
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,160
Just a half-ass drunk.

909
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,340
Half-ass drunk.

910
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,240
Well, you know who you are

911
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,320
when you got a hangover and it's all hung over back

912
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,040
straight in your girlfriend's car.

913
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,380
Half-ass drunk.

914
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,020
Just you and me.

915
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,140
Sergeant Carter, haircut, gunner, piled, hooked up,

916
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,560
living off of LSD.

917
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,160
Have a ass drunk

918
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,820
and I'm feeling blue.

919
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,640
Well a flood come in and it washed away my den

920
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,620
and my water bill's still past due.

921
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,000
Have a ass drunk

922
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,360
Called my boss

923
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,100
I ain't feeling quite right.

924
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,980
Well it can't be Monday cause I don't remember Sunday

925
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,840
and my hands are sitting Saturday night.

926
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,380
Sweet love song.

927
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,860
Have a ass drunk

928
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,040
and I'm drunk as

929
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,980
Well I used to have a job but I'm sick of getting robbed

930
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,980
so I finally just up and quit.

931
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,340
Mama had a fit.

932
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,980
Have a ass drunk

933
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,720
and all my head feels odd.

934
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,820
Well baby needs food but his daddy's

935
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,380
got a need to lose.

936
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,560
Well the baby better find himself a job.

937
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,840
Have a ass drunk

938
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,400
Have a ass drunk

939
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,980
Have a ass drunk

940
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,640
and I'm having fun.

941
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,560
Stopped on a hill cause I had to take a pill

942
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,540
but I couldn't quite find my tongue.

943
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,020
Have a ass drunk

944
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,520
Hell I can see.

945
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,080
Well they said the light was red.

946
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,100
Now a couple of folks

947
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,980
Well there was 22 mangled

948
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,740
and there was one guy that was gimped up pretty good

949
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,480
he had to sort of walk like this for the rest of his life

950
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,760
and there was one guy

951
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,720
who was pretty neat

952
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:28,820
and he was a little bit of a jerk

953
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:28,820


954
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,760
but they had, he was hurt pretty good I guess

955
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,820
they had like this machine that was like

956
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,800
hooked up where he had this tube running up

957
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,460
through his nose you know

958
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,480
and that was the only way he could breathe

959
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,920
and well there was this one dude

960
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,780
it was like a blade he chopped straight down

961
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,840
on his toes and last I heard he still

962
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,680
couldn't walk. There was one guy

963
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,320
well this is what's weird

964
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,120
they found parts of him on the front of the car

965
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,020
and other parts of him on the back

966
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,240
of the same car

967
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,680
I mean it sort of defies the mind

968
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,720
doesn't it how you could find pieces

969
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,620
of the same person on the front

970
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,080
and back of the same car

971
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,960
I mean it, I just don't understand

972
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,180
they ought to run some kind of scientific test

973
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,940
I don't even see how that could even happen

974
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,460
And a couple folks dead

975
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:19,960
well it

976
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,880
well it sure looked green to me

977
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,360
half ass drunk

978
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,160

979
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,920

980
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,480
amethyst to an old tin can

981
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,420
trying to outrun the fuzz

982
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,520
half ass drunk

983
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,300

984
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,880

985
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,400

986
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,200

Think it felt alright

1054
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,480
If that woman that you meet

1055
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,440
Could I think

1056
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,600
Of how you

1057
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,380
Feel

1058
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,660
Sweetie

1059
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,880
You took love

1060
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,540
And shined a light on you

1061
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,120
You can never be gone

1062
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,160
You better be chill

1063
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,920
You need a drink, Lord

1064
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,360
And shined a light on you

1065
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,500
Like the evening sun

1066
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,700
When you're drunk

1067
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,960
In the hall of the evil

1068
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,780
Which flows on

1069
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,660
And you're late

1070
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,540
Not a friend to leave you

1071
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,420
In the cold, gray dawn

1072
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:56,920
Oh, just ain't too many

1073
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,060
Flies on you

1074
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,340
I just can't

1075
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,900
Crush them all

1076
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,340
Angels beating

1077
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:11,400
All their wings in time

1078
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,520
Smiles on their faces

1079
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,000
And a thing right in their eye

1080
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,560
Oh, Lord, I heard one

1081
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,760
Say

1082
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,520
Oh, Lord, I heard one

1083
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,420
Say, something is

1084
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:23,420


1085
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,300
Come on off now

1086
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,820
With that question

1087
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,040
Hold it close

1088
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,500
See the appeal

1089
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,220
You bring desire

1090
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,640
On your face

1091
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,140
Oh, come on

1092
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,480
sewn up

1093
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,100
Felt as your

00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,060

00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,460
Yeah!

1100
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,800
Yeah!

1101
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,960
Like the evening sun

1102
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,100
Yeah!

1103
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,380
Yeah!

1104
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:28,120
After relaxing on the lake, Bob's ready to have a great time entertaining his friends.

1105
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,240
Right Bob?

1106
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,060
Bob?

1107
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,120
Bob?

1108
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:39,160
This is the church that's gonna kick ass on the normals!

1109
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:46,080
The mediocrities, the pit boys, the hippies, the Trekkies and the Admin!

1110
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,500
I wonder...

1111
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,180
What?

1112
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,280
If God were to come to Earth, would they find him so strange?

1113
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,780
That they would be afraid?

1114
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,420
And would they shoot him?

1115
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,980
Did not his son come once, Pedro?

1116
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,500
And they kneel him to a cross?

1117
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,540
And then spent two thousand years learning to believe in him?

1118
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,280
All things take time, Pedro.

1119
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,860
We will certainly come out on top again if we succeed in being defeated.

1120
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,760
You talk like a madman!

1121
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,560
But I live like a sane one.

1122
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,880
I was a fascist when Mussolini was on top.

1123
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:30,060
Now that he has been deposed, I am anti-fascist.

1124
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,960
When the Germans were here, I was fanatically pro-German.

1125
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,320
Now I'm fanatically pro-American.

1126
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,340
You'll find no more loyal parties in all of Italy than myself.

1127
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,140
You're a shameful opportunist!

1128
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:52,480
What you don't understand is that it's better to die on your feet than to live on your own.

1129
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,780
You have it backwards.

1130
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,740
It's better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.

1131
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,240
Enjoy life like Bob.

1132
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,020
The End

1133
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,120
I dressed up to do you harm.

1134
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,440
And I'm here to make you go.

1135
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,980
Give a kiss to Vladimir, for he's in the bottom of the tomb.

1136
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,980
I hate you.

1137
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,080
You love more than I do, don't you?

1138
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,880
I hate you.

1139
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,780
I never thought it was a legal term.

1140
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,360
Some things work, I hate you.

1141
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:08,880
I hate you.

1142
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,020
I hate you.

1143
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,540
More than, more than a black or blue.

1144
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,060
I hate you.

1145
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,280
I've seen you live a royal crime.

1146
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,580
I hate you.

1147
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,060
I hate you.

1148
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:37,700
I hate you.

1149
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:37,700


1150
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,340
I can do everything to power you alive.

1151
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,380
I can do everything.

1152
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,140
I am a fine flame.

1153
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,320
I'll give you a shine, bottomless issue.

1154
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,500
So I won't do the same.

1155
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:56,160
Peace and love will always be here, and I love you.

1156
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:03,520
I've got a clear, clear case in my hands.

1157
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:03,520


1158
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:03,540
literature.

1159
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:03,540


1160
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:03,540


1161
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,380
Thank you.

1162
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,520
Thank you.

1163
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,800
Thank you.

1164
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,460
Thank you.

1165
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,980
Thank you.

1166
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,440
Thank you.

1167
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,240
Thank you.

1168
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:46,300
Thank you.

1169
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,740
Thank you.

1170
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,300
Thank you.

1171
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,080
Thank you for your wine, California.

1172
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:48,600
Thank you for your sweet little friend.

1173
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:57,100
Yes, I've got the desert in my journey.

1174
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,040
Uh-huh.

1175
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,400
And I hit the speed.

1176
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,520
I'm not sure.

1177
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,640
Come on.

1178
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,400
Come on down.

1179
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,380
Swing a genie.

1180
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,460
Come on.

00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:20,820

You got it in you.

Come on.

1187
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:43,940

Some jigs do do all your tricks.

00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,880
