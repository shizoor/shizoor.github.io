1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,580
First time believing in the works.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,620
Cut your hair off every time.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,800
AHHHHHH!

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,300
Oh stop! Stop!

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,500
Okay, okay, okay.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,300
AHHHHHH!

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,200
HAHAHAHA!

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,880
More red dye!

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,440
It's K-N-O-N 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,320
We see you soon!

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,840
We see you soon!

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,380
AHHHHHH!

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,440
AHHHHHH!

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,660
AHHHHHH!

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,140
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack.

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,820
Remember the elements.

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,540
You know, I think I saw those things once.

18
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,200
The UFOs.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,520
It was really, it was kind of scary.

20
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,760
I saw all these fucking colored lights.

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,700
And sounds.

22
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,160
I mean sounds and lights like I ain't never heard before.

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,720
Yep the little glass doors.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,180
But yeah, it is a ​​worshipped object.

25
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,180


26
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,180


27
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,180


28
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,180


29
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,260
Praise Bob.

30
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,280
We're here to worship dear friends.

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,500
to worship the WORD of Bob

32
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,120
BOB

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,020
Bob! Bob! Bob!

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,020
Bob! Bob! Bob!

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,280
Bob! Bob! Bob!

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,820
Bob! Bob! Bob!

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,440
He's a maniac!

38
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,500
He's a maniac!

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,180
Bob!

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,140
He's a maniac!

41
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,920
Bob!

42
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,580
But let's leave things of this world behind

43
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,220
and walk now down the path of Bob

44
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,200
for this brief minute of slack

45
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,840
from the church of the subgenius.

46
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,220
Release your hold on this tenuous practical joke

47
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,400
they call reality.

48
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,620
Let your body be sucked out of your ears

49
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,720
for we're going to take you deep, deep inside yourself

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,240
to the place of silence in the noise.

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,020
We're going deeper, deeper into your consciousness,

52
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,020
down past the membranes of the fabric of your very mind.

53
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,180
We bore down into the cranium,

54
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,860
drilling through the irrelevant memories of job and normality,

55
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,020
piercing the squamous epizootis,

56
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,220
rolling around in the hollowed-out inside of the skull,

57
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,120
scraping along the edges of the birth canal

58
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,320
and stretching the imagination gland until it pops.

59
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,800
Now, let all your thoughts drain out through the brain pan,

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,620
tumble down through the sinuses,

61
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,900
slide down the esophagus,

62
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,620
and finally, let them plunge to the base of the soul itself,

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,500
located in the lowest organ of your body, the foot gland.

64
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,380
And finally, an idea, a key, an ultimate plan

65
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,980
is born at the very bottom.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,200
And finally, an idea, a key, an ultimate plan is born at the very bottom.

67
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,040
of your mind.

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,620
And it is Bob.

69
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,100
Wake up, puppet boy!

70
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,920
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

71
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,860
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,040
I have Bob's Leggings!

73
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,720
No trouble.

74
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,260
Just get set and get going.

75
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,900
You hear me?

76
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,460
Recording.

77
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,700
Everything's going fine.

78
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,660
No trouble.

79
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,480
Welcome, potential initiates,

80
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,540
and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

81
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,200
Bob?

82
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,120
What about Slack?

83
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,320
That's your key phrase.

84
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,520
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

85
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,240
Here, the watch in front of us blurs and distorts time.

86
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,000
Soon, we will be deep in a hypnotic trance.

87
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,480
What wonders will we see?

88
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,560
What wonders will we see?

89
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,220
Hey, kids!

90
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:04,240
Get some money out of your parents' wallets and send it to Bob.

91
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,280
Here!

92
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,400
Pull at a level, and you're done.

93
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,920
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the hour of Slack.

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,260
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry,

95
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,540
hour of Slack.

96
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:27,540


97
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,860
Slang. Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

98
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:41,740
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megaphist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius,

99
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,160
with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

100
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,400
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

101
00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:02,400
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.

102
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:12,460
You have to love Bob. He loves you, but you love Bob. You have to.

103
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,260
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

104
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,140
He'll kill you. He'll bob you out.

105
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,100
He'll bob you out.

106
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,480
Folks, you heard it here first.

107
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,680
You heard it here first.

108
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,300
If you don't love Bob, he'll bob you out.

109
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,460
He will bob you out.

110
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,140
Yes?

111
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,280
You can assure your family's safe, secure comfort.

112
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,180
But hurry. But hurry. But hurry.

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,040
We're in a hurry, dear friends.

114
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
We're in a hurry.

115
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,240
We're in a hurry.

116
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,660
We're in a hurry.

117
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,260
Ah, yes.

118
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,660
The harvest.

119
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,540
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

120
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,180
Tonight's Hour of Slack is underwritten by...

121
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,580
The Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company.

122
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:38,980
The Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company features Dobbs-approved church wear, including t-shirts, buttons, and survivalist uniform patches.

123
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,380
That's The Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company serving the public since...

124
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,120
God knows when.

125
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,320
God knows when.

126
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,560
The P.O. Box number there...

127
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,020
There, not here...

128
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:11,220
Is P.O. Box 595148, Dallas, Texas 75359-5148.

129
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:18,120
Thanks, Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, for supporting K.N.O.N.

130
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,260
Thanks, Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, for supporting K.N.O.N.

131
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,000
And for the

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,180
Uh, yes dear friends and...

133
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,020
well this is the last Hour of Slack you're gonna hear for a couple of weeks because I'm gonna be out of town.

134
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:40,020
And good ol' Robert Wisdom's gonna do an extra hour, but it will be a Spike Jones Hour, he says.

135
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,380
So those of you who've, uh, subgeniuses who've never heard Spike Jones...

136
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,880
Check it out.

137
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,080
and if you have I know you will check it out

138
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,660
yes

139
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,160
the music of Bob

140
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:09,040
no Johan was filled with visions of Bob when he wrote this one and thanks to Tom

141
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:15,720
Williams who did call in to support the sponsorship of the lily Jing the Pope

142
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,180
the very Pope of all China who will indeed now come to this fair nation

143
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,580
about

144
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:33,120
and so to get away from this song on tape deck number one we have to bring up

145
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,680
negative plans

146
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,680
so that we may then go

147
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,180
hey

148
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,140
hope you know where your life

149
00:08:53,140 --> 00:09:12,920
bitch revealed over the air by then doctors of precision

150
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,960
Oh, yes, dear friends.

151
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,020
Yes, very strange.

152
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,220
Teaching me, huh?

153
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,240
Yes, very strange.

154
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,340
Now, I remember indeed.

155
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,680
We both left the front line.

156
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,940
He took me to a cave.

157
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,500
And inside he lighted a lighter.

158
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,440
And I saw a stall there.

159
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,100
He opened the door of it.

160
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,360
And inside was something that looked like a porcelain altar.

161
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,820
And then...

162
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,940
And it exploded.

163
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,720
I was farting fire.

164
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,760
It was unbelievable.

165
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,760
For the first time in my life.

166
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,640
Could this be the ancient rite of pyroflagellation?

167
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,340
What?

168
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,520
Pyro what?

169
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:40,920
What?

170
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,160
Anyway.

171
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,520
I have shown this trick to my kids many times.

172
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,500
And they too.

173
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,520
They too play this game which sometimes is very dangerous.

174
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,040
Sometimes it can backfire, you know.

175
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,080
Oh.

176
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,660
Yes.

177
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,600
Yes.

178
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,600
The backfire.

179
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,760
It can result sometimes in dangerous incidents such as the gut blowout or the bladder splatter.

180
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:25,940
But.

181
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,480
Some other strange things have surfaced.

182
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,720
Ah, there we go.

183
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,700
It's coming out of bed.

184
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:45,700


185
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:45,700


186
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:45,700


187
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,000
both ends now on KPFA.

188
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,840
We wanted a morning celebration.

189
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,760
It was. Now we have all those little creatures

190
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,500
running around like crazy.

191
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,500
Okay, everybody just heap it down. We've got a caller here.

192
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,320
I know, I know. I can't believe it.

193
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,720
He called.

194
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,620
Oh, hello.

195
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,660
Rewind that caller.

196
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,820
Oh, I'm really here, huh?

197
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,540
No, uh-uh.

198
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,660
I'm not, huh?

199
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,920
I was just wondering what station this is.

200
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,280
So was I. Earlier it was KNON from Dallas, Texas,

201
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,160
but that was a satellite being the Mobius Rex

202
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,760
was pulling in.

203
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,980
No, it still is KNON.

204
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,220
I have to look around here and find out.

205
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,840
It's not KPFA in Berkeley with puzzling evidence.

206
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,280
Well, you know, they left several numbers last night

207
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,760
and I called about five or six of them.

208
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,200
I thought it was some pretty revolutionary radio there.

209
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,820
Here?

210
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,760
We're coming in on this beam, man.

211
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,980
Where were you listening to? What kind of show?

212
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,320
Uh, KNON, I guess.

213
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,760
Dallas, Texas.

214
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,760
Yes, that was it.

215
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,820
No, you can't hear that in San Francisco.

216
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,260
Anything you'd like to hear?

217
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,740
Anything you'd like to tell the purveyors of that show?

218
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,740
What's that?

219
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,920
Is there anything you'd like to tell the purveyors of that show?

220
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,720
They're listening right now.

221
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,260
Yes, we are.

222
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,780
Oh, I would like to say that you guys, you know,

223
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,320
me and my girlfriend were listening to you tonight

224
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,540
and we were even listening through a dual radio,

225
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,060
through two telephones, listening to the radio.

226
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,280
Through duals in Brazil?

227
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,800
And it was wonderful, man.

228
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,320
We were sitting here and we tried calling the numbers

229
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,700
that they had given, you know,

230
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,620
trying to do pledges or whatever it was.

231
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,040
I thought it was great radio, man.

232
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,540
I'm so sick of commercial crap.

233
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,260
I can't even stand it anymore, you know.

234
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,900
And to hear something like that coming across the airwaves

235
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,340
is wonderful.

236
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,660
Get in that commercial crap.

237
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,880
How much do they pay you to do this?

238
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,500
Shit.

239
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,380
They haven't paid me anything yet.

240
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,520
Ow, listener, ow, ow.

241
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,540
Okay, well, they will.

242
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,360
No, they won't, man.

243
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
They don't pay for that sort of stuff.

244
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,320
That's right.

245
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,900
But I think it's great, man.

246
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,920
That's all I want.

247
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,380
It is.

248
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,020
Well, that's great.

249
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,620
Finally, after all these numbers I heard

250
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,520
through the course of the evening,

251
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,300
I finally got a great number and I got through.

252
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,960
It breaks all my nerves.

253
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,300
I know, there are a lot of numbers down here.

254
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:44,520
That's great.

255
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:44,880
That's her show.

256
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,980
Puzzling evidence.

257
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,080
Okay, well, great.

258
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,120
I just want to say that that's fantastic.

259
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,140
Man, does this go on all the time?

260
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,920
Is there other, does this happen regularly?

261
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,480
Yes, it does go on 24 hours a day

262
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,980
and every once in a while here at KPFA,

263
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,140
they plug in, oh, I sent the call letters, but.

264
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,700
Oh, no.

265
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,360
Oh, no.

266
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,120
Oh, no.

267
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,600
Well, you see, that poor guy listening to KPFA and Berkley,

268
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,340
well, because they were subgeniuses,

269
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,920
that night he was listening to a tape of KNON

270
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,480
and while he was calling,

271
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,080
calling up the Dallas phone numbers

272
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,060
trying to pledge money to KNON,

273
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,800
but there he was in Berkley not knowing where he was

274
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,720
and where we were and why any of that happened.

275
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,600
But, friends, you can call here and fulfill your pledge

276
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,880
and talk to the Willa Dobbs about why we worship Bob Dobbs

277
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,320
and why you should, too, if you value your skin

278
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,760
and since we value your wallet, dear friends,

279
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,120
both.

280
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,240
The Church of the Subgenius, which you're listening to now,

281
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,800
and KNON, which we have temporarily supplanted until midnight.

282
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,780
Now, and you can call 828-9500 or 823-7490

283
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,720
and, you know, if it rings and rings and rings,

284
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,980
well, that's because Will's got a live one on the other line.

285
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,640
So, hang on and don't give up.

286
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,980
Oh, listen to that show.

287
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,940
Hurting your speakers.

288
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,360
You know, this is going to...

289
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,120
Taping this show is going to damage your equipment.

290
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,920
Did you know that?

291
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,740
Because of the copy protection that you hear now working into it.

292
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,300
And we want...

293
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,140
We want...

294
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,280
Some of the...

295
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,500
Almost everybody has fulfilled their pledges, dear friends.

296
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,540
You have done that.

297
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,220
Almost all of you, except for the accursed Alan,

298
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,180
the damned Laura,

299
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,360
the hellbound Jeff,

300
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,120
the poor dejected Bill,

301
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,240
Brian,

302
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,300
Dean.

303
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,360
Dean?

304
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,060
I can't believe it.

305
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,700
And John, with the last name of a Robert Anton Wilson character.

306
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,960
It's hard to believe, man.

307
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,140
Mike, the hopelessly doomed one.

308
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,340
Matthew, Jim, and Troy, the anything for a laugh trio.

309
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,740
Friends, you need to go ahead and finish off that.

310
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,220
How do they know we're here?

311
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,200
It's just a little check.

312
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,820
These aren't giant checks, I see.

313
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,460
They're like 20 bucks.

314
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,000
Almost all of them there.

315
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,800
One of them, 60.

316
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,220
Yeah.

317
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,260
Well, we need that, man, or we're going to look stupid.

318
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,860
On this giant thermometer here they put up in this station.

319
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,600
And they're jamming, man.

320
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,740
They're jamming again.

321
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,980
Oh, God.

322
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,540
Only one thing to do in it.

323
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,840
Squeak the little radio chair until...

324
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,460
Until it pops.

325
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,440
Oh, people who wait in the shadow of deep thought

326
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,240
are the descendants of Broom Thunder.

327
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,740
With their whole magic ties, the time of waiting is over.

328
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:56,660
Seven and a half million years, our race has waited for this great and

329
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,740
hopefully enlightening day, the Day of the Answer.

330
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,220
Never again will we wake up in the morning and think,

331
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,480
who am I?

332
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,560
What is my purpose in life?

333
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,520
Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to the

334
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:14,520


335
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:14,900
to work.

336
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,500
For today, we will finally

337
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,380
learn once and for all the plain

338
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,040
and simple answer to all these

339
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,080
nagging little problems of life,

340
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,760
the universe, and everything.

341
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,520
From today, we can enjoy

342
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,120
our games of Brookian

343
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,340
Ultra Cricket in the firm and

344
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,420
comfortable knowledge that the meaning of

345
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,360
life is now well and

346
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,320
truly sorted out.

347
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,540
Yes, tonight, friends, you're going to hear two different versions

348
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,400
of the meaning of life.

349
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,640
Good evening.

350
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,140
Good evening.

351
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,820
Oh, deep thought.

352
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,680
Do you have...

353
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,620
Have you, uh...

354
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,100
That is, uh...

355
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,200
An answer for you?

356
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,820
Yes.

357
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,500
Yes, I have.

358
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,080
There really is one?

359
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,000
There really is one.

360
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,800
To everything? To the great question of life, the universe, and everything?

361
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,620
Yes.

362
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,660
Are you ready to give it to us?

363
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,480
I am.

364
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,440
Now?

365
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,280
Now.

366
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,120
Wow.

367
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,900
Though I don't think you're going to like it...

368
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,760
Doesn't matter. We must know it. Now.

369
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,760
Now?

370
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,300
Yes, now.

371
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,860
All right.

372
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,160
Well...

373
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,900
You're really not going to like it.

374
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,660
Tell us.

375
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,360
All right.

376
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,980
The answer to everything...

377
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,340
Life, the universe,

378
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,860
and everything...

379
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,640
Is...

380
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,380
Is...

381
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,640
Is...

382
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,020
Yes?

383
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,020
42.

384
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,760
6 four monday

385
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,080
9 weekend

386
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,080
It's almost 7 am

387
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,220
I'm disappointed, just a little worried.

388
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,400


389
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,400


390
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,400


391
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,420
It's like 3pm?

392
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,640
9 cars and 3 meters of snow.

393
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:34,640


394
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:34,700
An linha has no speed.

395
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,900
The構ANOS

396
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,360
And what's there?

397
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,400
An arena.

398
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,400


399
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,400


400
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,700
I had showed…

401
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,500
Here it is.

402
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,440
We're gonna buy you what's in that magazine later after the show.

403
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,500
I mean, after all, this is a church. There's got to be a certain amount of hypocrisy.

404
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,980
And a certain number of colors.

405
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,220
Fantastic, man.

406
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,960
Yeah, fantastic.

407
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,760
Yeah, well, all I gotta say is that's terrific, man. I hope y'all keep doing it because...

408
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,220
We will transfer the word to the...

409
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,500
Aesthetic of our friend.

410
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,780
To that other K-N-O-N friend.

411
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,020
Yeah, well, I think we need more anti-commercial stations, and I'm willing to pay for it.

412
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,020
Oh, I agree. Yeah, me too. True, thanks.

413
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,220
Okay, bye.

414
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,980
Synthetic spleen.

415
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,240
They're okay. Synthetic spleen collar.

416
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,940
Please leave your name and a message. You may start your message now.

417
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,380
Okay.

418
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,100
Hey, man, I'm a prisoner. I'm a prisoner in San Quentin, man.

419
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,760
I wanna have a little correspondence, you know what I mean?

420
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,740
No, no, that's counterfeit. It's 20 to 6, and you can't use the phone right now.

421
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:53,120
No, man, it's like, you know, I snuck into the phone room, man. The guards are gonna beat the shit out of me when he finds me.

422
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,960
Okay, we'll play a song for you then, as metal meets flesh here at San Quentin.

423
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,760
Let's discuss your non-plus repercussions there.

424
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,160
I'll probably get an extra year in jail because I was taken to the phone room.

425
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,820
The least you can do is give me a little condolence.

426
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,800
Oh, wait a minute, the guard's coming. Oh, wait a minute, I'm just here.

427
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,180
Oh.

428
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,820
We're showing our concern down here by playing those pink songs that everybody hates so much.

429
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,520
Oh, symbolic.

430
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,600
Here's one by a band called Burnjob.

431
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,760
It's spooky.

432
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:30,060
Oh, spooky indeed. This show's always spooky, but we use another word to describe it, but we'll try not to say it,

433
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,900
because that's the sub-lulululululul message that we're not allowed to say in the air.

434
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,500
Let's see if I'll just go over here and press play.

435
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,580
Whoop!

436
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,260
Oh, no.

437
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,060
Oh, more pink music.

438
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,740
Oh, it's good pink music, but still, it's still $8 a ticket down in Bass.

439
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,420
Kid's playing with the phone.

440
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,000
And you can call and play with the phone.

441
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,680
828-9500 or 823-7490.

442
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:20,200
And speak to the Will-o-Dogs about why you have to have an hour of slack every Sunday night.

443
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,580
The scary show.

444
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:24,880
Oops!

445
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:37,500
For instance, archaeologists working in some of the more desolate areas of this land have turned up fossils of footprints.

446
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,320
Footprints which show early development.

447
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,480
The foot-gland.

448
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,080
The what?

449
00:22:50,640 --> 00:23:00,780
The foot-gland, which is an apparatus of the body that was developed in the human race solely through the efforts of Bob.

450
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,580
Now you talk about it.

451
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,020
There was something very strange about Bob.

452
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,300
I don't know.

453
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,300


454
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,300


455
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,300


456
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,300


457
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,840
We were never shaking hands.

458
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,760
He was shaking my foot.

459
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,200
Shaking your foot?

460
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,320
Yes, he said.

461
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,300
Let me shake your foot.

462
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,540
I always ask him, why do you give me so much attention, Bob?

463
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,260
He just smiled and he said, let me shake your foot.

464
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,660
Well, this could be...

465
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,620
Let me see your foot.

466
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,800
What?

467
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,480
Yeah, just slip off your boot.

468
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,020
Okay, then.

469
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,120
It seems like old times are returning.

470
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,240
Okay, I slip off my boot.

471
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,080
And here is my foot.

472
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,760
Yes, yes.

473
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,700
Yes, I see it.

474
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,900
It's very undeveloped, but it is indeed a foot-gland.

475
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,460
You may not be familiar with this organ.

476
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,640
But of course it is well known to the subgenius.

477
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,500
This is the organ upon which you walk and you walk extensively.

478
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,300
After a great deal of physical exertion,

479
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:33,880
you lead yourself to some of the most phenomenal acts of sex that you've ever performed.

480
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,600
Now I remember.

481
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:48,380
One day, when the war was just over, Bob showed me something.

482
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,280
He had it folded in his handkerchief.

483
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,420
He folded it open and there was a spear point.

484
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,340
The point of a spear.

485
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,840
And inside it was a nail.

486
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,840
And he said to me,

487
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,860
Look at this point.

488
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:19,500
This spear point pierced the side of Christ when he was hanging on the cross.

489
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:27,660
But this nail that's inside of it is even more important.

490
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:34,700
This nail pierced Bo's feet.

491
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,180
The feet of Jesus Christ.

492
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:46,520
So perhaps that has something to do with your foot-gland.

493
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:55,200
He told me he was bringing this very powerful object

494
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:02,860
that was in the hands of Adolf Hitler straight to Churchill.

495
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
Who gave it to you guys.

496
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,260
The Americans.

497
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,500
You owned that very powerful object.

498
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,920
At the time when the first big explosion in Japan took place.

499
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,140
This Bob is somebody strange.

500
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,680
I think now.

501
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:42,460
And you can turn to page 17 in your subgenius church radio syllabus and we can begin the lesson.

502
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,200
Now my friends.

503
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,900
My old buddy God was a weird cat.

504
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,240
He really was.

505
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,080
He was into everything.

506
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,200
He used to make universes.

507
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,700
Cranked out quite a number of them years ago and supposedly he's still at it.

508
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,460
I don't know if it was really an infinite number of universes.

509
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,940
I mean you got to stop somewhere.

510
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:12,860
But old God he had this deal where you go from one universe to another every time you died.

511
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,080
They start you off in the before life which was sort of like eternal paradise.

512
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,740
To kind of get you off on the right foot.

513
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,880
And all of a sudden you'd lose your memory and get born here on earth.

514
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:32,040
And then when you got old and died you'd pass on to the etheric universe next door.

515
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,260
And why after you died there you'd be born into the angelic universe.

516
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,100
So once there friend you'd find out there were dozens and dozens of them.

517
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,700
Each one better than the last.

518
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,400
In fact each one incomprehensibly better than the last.

519
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,640
And as long as you didn't screw up too bad you could keep on traveling up through the universes.

520
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,560
Getting ever closer to the Bob head.

521
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,860
But right when you thought the next level would be the last.

522
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,020
And the ultimate peak experience of it all.

523
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,700
Eternal slackness friends.

524
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,500
Why instead right then you'd get reborn on earth with your memory wiped out again.

525
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,320
Just a few years after you died there the last time.

526
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,640
And you'd have to start all over again.

527
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,120
And that's how it all keeps going on infinitely.

528
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,840
Friends you know sooner or later you run out of infinity.

529
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,320
Even infinity.

530
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,460
But see here's the thing.

531
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,940
Usually these facts are never announced in this universe.

532
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,680
Friends and we do it on this show where we know it won't be believed.

533
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,080
But see if you die bad friend.

534
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,000
Or if you're a messed up person.

535
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,920
You might leave behind a part of your soul.

536
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,480
The lower soul or what we call the nental eye.

537
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,700
And that becomes a poltergeist friend.

538
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,120
Or a wandering shade.

539
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,900
An earth bound spirit doomed to roam the earth.

540
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,780
Pathetically repeating it's sad loop of behavior.

541
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,520
That made it split from the higher soul in the first place.

542
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,920
Can you imagine a ghost trying to buy a pack of cigarettes for eternity friends?

543
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:44,840
Not a gift a love angel getting.

544
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,920
A story if it's true.

545
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,160
Love story in our hands.

546
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,860
P 04

547
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:50,860


548
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:50,860


549
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,140
Damn it men.

550
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,640
that's some shit I always wanted.

551
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,480
We love asshole pelvic floor.

552
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:00,760
What did I go down for 있나?

553
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:00,760


554
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,780
A

555
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,780
Z

556
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:22,460
The rule of life, stretching on and on, but it stops them well. Because time keeps ticking away. Time keeps on ticking away. Because time keeps ticking away. Time keeps on ticking away.

557
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:35,200
Let me tell you about a boy, an average but he's twice in love with two very different girls.

558
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,540
He knew when life is short, he told them both the truth, but they already knew.

559
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,140
Now he's a happy guy.

560
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,780
Now he's a happy guy.

561
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,480
Now he's a happy guy.

562
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:17,660
Well, there's a random turn on the game show field.

563
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,240
Unpredictable.

564
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,080
Unpredictable.

565
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,440
Unpredictable.

566
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,920
Unpredictable.

567
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,700
Unpredictable.

568
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,520
Unpredictable.

569
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,320
Unpredictable.

570
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,080
Unpredictable.

571
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,360
Unpredictable.

572
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,840
Unpredictable.

573
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,440
Unpredictable.

574
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,940
incarnated as a work of art

575
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,820
He's got a brand new start

576
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,260
Hey!

577
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,140
Hey!

578
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:06,980
Hey!

579
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,800
Hey!

580
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:12,760
Hey!

581
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,500
Hey!

582
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,280
Now he's a happy guy

583
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,960
Now he's a happy guy

584
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,660
Now he's a happy guy

585
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,280
Now he's a happy guy

586
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,960
Now he's a happy guy

587
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,260
Oh, yes.

588
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,820
And what did we hear there, dear friends?

589
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,680
We heard the Amsterdam subgenius special report courtesy of Inhibiting Factor.

590
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,680
We heard Yours Truly with the Life After Death rant.

591
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,940
And we heard the new unreleasable Devo song, one of many.

592
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,180
You know, there's an interesting thing about that song there.

593
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,640
If the De Laurentiis folks had not changed their mind,

594
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,040
the tune from that song would have been the theme,

595
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,400
the main theme for the movie Dune.

596
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,700
But they did change their minds.

597
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,300
Hey, are you the kind of person who likes to stay up late at night

598
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,040
and get kind of...

599
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,200
Volcano Inn is definitely the place for you to turn to late at night.

600
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,860
Just check out our late night programming schedule.

601
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:48,860
Truly.

602
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,900
Home of the weird.

603
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,300
Who's day in the fall night?

604
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,000
Sunday, 12 to 2 a.m. it's Radio Freeboro with Ari and Terry

605
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,720

12 to 2 a.m. it's Mark's Hotline.

610
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:23,060
It's with Mark Teuton featuring acoustic blues of the 20s and 30s.

611
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,620

612
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,240
playing what you want to hear.

613
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,860
Wednesday, it's Outside Radio from 12 to 2 with Steve Barton,

614
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,120
a mix of avant-garde and industrial weirdness.

615
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,240
2 to 4 a.m. it's Mixed Well Before Serving,

616
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,700
a show with classic early to mid-70s rock and roll-like Little Feet and Jimi Hendrix.

617

More hardcore underground dance music just for you.

621
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,320
Friday, Radio Soiree with the amazing Neon Creature,

622
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,560
not of this earth.

623
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,620
Weird, outside, definitely electronic.

624
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,720
One more time, 2 to 4, it's Mixed Well Before Serving.

625
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,320
Saturday, 11 to 1, Lone Star Dead with Dave Moynihan,

626
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,840
playing the best of the...

627
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,400
...Grateful Dead.

628
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,600
1 to 4 is HA with Alan Andre.

629
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,200
Where else can you hear Bauhaus, Skinny Puppy,

630
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,600
and Scrapping Fetus Off the Wheel all on the same show?

631
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,080
So hey, if you're up and you're out, tune in.

632
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,160
K-N-O-N, 90.9.

633
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,520
The players return through late night, whenever you want to get...

634
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,800
...This is the Hour!

635
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,060
Oh, great. They didn't even mention the Hour of Slack. Huh.

636
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,100
I guess we're just not as bizarre as those punk music shows.

637
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,080
They're so much more bizarre.

638
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,220
Oh, gosh.

639
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,680
What is fact, and what is apparition?

640
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,040
In an English garden, a ghost appears to be trying to recapture some lost time of her past life.

641
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,680
They're here.

642
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,300
Hauntings can go on.

643
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,780
Determination has to...

644
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,540
...to the young man who has been starved to death.

645
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,140
What I meant to say was...

646
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,260
Out in the vast realm of the night, what terror does the night hold for you?

647
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,580
What monstrous vision might be awaiting for you?

648
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,580
Beyond life, beyond the grave, beyond the realm of death.

649
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,440
You mean life after death?

650
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,420
Yes.

651
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,360
Is there?

652
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,520
Yes, I think there is.

653
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:54,420
If I'm correct, the life force is conserved always and in all things, even after death.

654
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,260
And you think that applies to what's happened here tonight?

655
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,040
Yes.

656
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,480
Yes, I do.

657
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,700
I think that girl, creature...

658
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:11,160
...drained energy, life force, partially from Bukowski and totally from the guard.

659
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,640
That girl was no girl.

660
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,060
She's totally alien to this planet and our life form.

661
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,560
And totally dangerous.

662
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:30,320
There is no such a thing called death.

663
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,640
It's just a transformation.

664
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

665
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,300
As you knew, will know, subgenius souls, or...

666
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:53,060
...nental essences, are volatile, brightly colored, and usually very fast when they care to be.

667
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,520
They go where they want and are hard for others to control.

668
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,720
Souls of normals, however, are bland-looking pill-like beings.

669
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:09,480
Although in life, subs and norms are almost indistinguishable, after death this is a hard mistake to make.

670
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,280
When a subgenius dies, the nantescence bursts through.

671
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:22,000
It's massless seed careens in a pan-galactic journey, lasting but a moment of our time.

672
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,920
It usually returns once to make sure it's really dead, before moving on to the before-life.

673
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:38,780
Due to a 10,000 year disinformation campaign by the con, a jaded stereotype of heaven and hell is being pushed by the false churches.

674
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,100
In fact, there's little difference between the two.

675
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,260
Subgeni are all human beings.

676
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,100
They often commute between heaven and hell.

677
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,240
I was still reporting from Doc's Docks.

678
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,980
Still trying to give you some idea of what it was like.

679
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,980
To figure out why we gave them all that much money to begin with.

680
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,760
What they did with it.

681
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,420
Doug, try one more.

682
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,620
Try one more.

683
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,700
One more. One more.

684
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,380
Doug, try one more.

685
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,760
I kept hearing it over and over again.

686
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,320
I want more.

687
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:16,820
I want more.

688
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,300
I want more.

689
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,040
I want more.

690
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,080
I want more.

691
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,080


692
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,880
Subgenius spiritual mastery is not maintained without struggle.

693
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,860
The subgenius must be vigilant and must hone his abnormality.

694
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,360
He must tithe the church.

695
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:39,260
Otherwise, the nantescence loses its spark, and then subgenius degenerates and dies normal.

696
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,240
This is a death worse than any fate.

697
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,120
When a normal dies, it exhausts all of its puny strength in a vain effort to hover near

698
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,300
the body it squandered.

699
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,300
A pale, shell-like entity soon is carried away by wind or other forces.

700
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,560
Being lighter than air, the pink, although they may be bland versions of other colors,

701
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,380
the pink soul drifts aimlessly.

702
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,260
Although pinkster souls, also known as plugs, do take a toll on the soul, they are not

703
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:15,840
intended to cluster.

704
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:22,680
The plugs are gathered up by cosmic agents, usually representing Jehovah One, who has

705
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,440
the largest franchise in this area.

706
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,140
The plugs are sprinkled into vats.

707
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,720
The vats have an energy source which melts the plug shells, making them bond together.

708
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,980
As new plugs continue to collect above, the norm souls' shapes and colors blend until

709
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,240
they resemble a lumpy stew.

710
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,240
Ultimately, the plugs form a clear slurry, which drains the soul.

711
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,560
Thus, normals cannot be said to have led past lives.

712
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,020
It was just normal.

713
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,120
I'm Pastor Bucknaken.

714
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:06,980
You can write to me at Post Office Box 140026, Dallas, Texas 75214.

715
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,240
I'm your host, altitude south, denk, and welcome everyone to Porch with an advantage.

716
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240


717
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240


718
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240


719
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240


720
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240


721
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240


722
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240


723
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,240


724
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:57,680
Patterns everywhere, patterns of behavior, sometimes seem unfair. Can you recognize the patterns that you find?

725
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:18,540
Patterns unfamiliar, patterns lead you through, to patterns of discovery, tracing out the clues. Can you recognize the patterns that you find? Stuck in your mind.

726
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,520
Wonder who did shoot Bob anyway? He he he.

727
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,580
Guess I'll walk on down to the Victoria Theatre, plug into the old computer.

728
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,660
So, I'm going to go to the theatre.

729
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,020
I don't see anything going on at all.

730
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:36,080
Check out the other reasons why you should buy some genius products.

731
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,460
Reason number one, I am the one.

732
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:49,500
Reason number two, you can know doctors for Wotan.

733
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:57,080
Reason number three, we will not suffocate you or your wife with mayonnaise.

734
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,000
This has been a message from the Subgenius Church. We hope that you will send us money.

735
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:19,500
Don't forget, if you don't have a check or credit account with the Subgenius Church, you can send food stamps, money, broken engine repair parts, pieces of a meaningless void, half-forgotten personality forms, and or broken tree rot caterpillar dung.

736
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,800
You can send brain-walking tree sockets or tree backwards mouth climbs.

737
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,680
You can send tunnel inner non-existent void particles.

738
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,940
You can send negro-influenced voice wave tap-shoe disc patterns.

739
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:53,660
You can send us cow vomit, tooth broken, leaven gated, elongated, creation-oriented, spear gum, rest ruts, scars.

740
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,800
You can send us Niki.

741
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,200
Niki flakes.

742
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:10,620
You can send us rogue, black, coal, orange, peel, vision, groove, single-file, sink, rassembled, GEEZ.

743
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,780
Doctors for Bob.

744
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,740
Doctors for Bob.

745
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,800
You can send us other things, including broken wheelchairs.

746
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:25,340
You can send us void anti-matter form, reality shape form patterns.

747
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,880
You can send us new patterns, that which do not exist within the given universe.

748
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:40,000
In this land, where stability is hard to find, you can rearrange the pattern so unkind.

749
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,200
Don't bother asking why.

750
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,400
The pattern never dries.

751
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:55,320
Pathless infinite void, those who will not write their names and addresses and or social security numbers on paper.

752
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:59,920
pieces of paper, but can send these in the forms of credit cards and or walking sticks

753
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,760
broken or fixed.

754
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,400
It can be repaired glass, it can't be broken mirrors, but however if you send us your tires,

755
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,360
be sure to remove them from the car first.

756
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,040
We can't pay the postage on anything smaller than a pickup truck.

757
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:19,100
If you want to send broken pillows, pieces of glass, you can send off for, please order

758
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,760
our handmade robot kits, genetic farming, something that does have three life form patterns,

759
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,960
these life form patterns are on Sterno and myself.

760
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:35,620
I think Doug Smith is also patented, but his patent is owned by US Steel.

761
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:47,060
Just try one more Doug, go ahead, try one more Doug, try one more, try one more.

762
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:53,840
Dr. Condom please, Dr. Condom, I've got a prescription for you, especially for a year.

763
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,740
Dr. Condom please, Dr. Condom, I've got a prescription for you, especially for a year.

764
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,220
Give me a skull job.

765
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,920
Dr. Oh look, this is the one.

766
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,000
Dr. Tie that skull to a pill, stop it from levitating.

767
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,380
Dr. Everybody dead behind that door.

768
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,020
Dr. The door wouldn't do.

769
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,360
Dr. That skull's levitating, lads.

770
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,680
Try one more Doug.

771
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,680
Dr. Tie it to a post.

772
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,480
Dr. Over there by that mule.

773
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,160
Dr. Quick.

774
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,160
Dr. This isn't a line, this is a daisy chain.

775
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,100
Dr. Hook them up boys.

776
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,160
Dr. Get the soap.

777
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,320
Dr. Hey that soap's on a rope and the rope's on a...

778
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:24,640
Dr. This is the end of the line.

779
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,840
Dr. My lord.

780
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:26,960
Dr. The rope?

781
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,000
Dr.

782
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:28,800
Dr.

783
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,340
Dr.

784
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:30,520
Dr.

785
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,220
Dr.

786
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:31,380
Dr.

787
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:41,340
Dr. Some people...

788
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,240
Dr. Just get lost on the way to the light.

789
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,660
Dr. And they need someone to guide them to it.

790
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:50,540
Dr.

791
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:50,860
Dr.

792
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,280
Dr.

793
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:51,680
Dr.

794
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:55,360
Dr.

795
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:55,360


796
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:55,380
Dr.

797
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:55,720
Dr.

798
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:55,720


799
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:55,720


800
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:55,720


801
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:55,820
Daniel исторically and antholistically

802
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:24,720
Eric wrong a lot of соответs know to to my

803
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,240
escape velocity, but not the need for a veracity.

804
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,780
Look, if you're both a particle and a wave,

805
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,440
you're exhibiting a certain particle,

806
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,780
particulate-like behavior.

807
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,140
That behavior can be measured.

808
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,060
You're going to collapse the wave function

809
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:39,080
into the wave implement.

810
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,620
It is well, with that kind of wave front,

811
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,920
you suffer from the need to employ such a mechanism

812
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,540
in figuring things out in a two-dimensional type of schema.

813
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,220
Maybe the listener knows about this.

814
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,580
Oh, those little glistening listeners

815
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,640
would never understand,

816
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,500
but what's that sound like, heavy breathing?

817
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,240
There's a lot of power.

818
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,200
It's a small room, but there's a...

819
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,000
There's something that sounds like a huge beast

820
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,360
drawing its scaly coils along a stone floor in here.

821
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,720
Bob is coming, friend, and you can take that literally,

822
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,680
because death for a subgenius hero

823
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,840
is merely a transfer over to the pleasure dimensions.

824
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,840
Now, unfortunately, many of us aren't heroes.

825
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,220
There's no water in hell, friends.

826
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,800
There's fire, and you can't get a drink,

827
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,560
and you can't...

828
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,540
put out that fire,

829
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,440
and you have many, many lives in hell.

830
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,860
It's reincarnation, just like here on Earth,

831
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,080
because Earth, you know, is just the top floor of hell.

832
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:32,820
That's right.

833
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,440
You're in hell right now.

834
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,580
You are in hell now.

835
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,580
Of course, this is the part of hell

836
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,140
where you don't even know you're in hell,

837
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,460
and when the demons mention it,

838
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,720
you think they're kidding.

839
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,500
Oh, you'll find out.

840
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,360
Hell is real,

841
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,700
and there's no water down there, friend.

842
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,600
They don't even have rock and roll in some parts of hell,

843
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,740
and you can never win.

844
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,080
The computer, by definition, it cannot lose.

845
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,460
You can score real high,

846
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,260
but sooner or later, it's gonna get you,

847
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,620
because they creep up on you,

848
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,380
and that's the way it is here on Earth.

849
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,620
They creep up on you

850
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:07,060
and try to get you all mixed up about heaven and hell.

851
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,640
Bob is coming, my friend,

852
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,800
but when he's finished with that,

853
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,980
he's gonna be mad.

854
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,620
Let there be slack.

855
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,600
Lift that tail.

856
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:22,300
Perhaps it would be good to get a reading from Level 7, you know.

857
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,000
Not again.

858
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,100
They need to know what's happening up here.

859
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,000
Down on Level 7,

860
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,500
they think they've got the best type of facilities

861
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,860
and the best type of storage.

862
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,540
What is it really like down on that seventh level?

863
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,240
Well, in terms of the psychology,

864
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,580
it's quite a simple case.

865
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,660
There's a neurotic aggression of childhood

866
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,460
brought on by the stress of new conditions.

867
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,660
Yes, yes, yes.

868
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,680
That's all very interesting,

869
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,400
but what's the gut feeling of being down there?

870
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,740
Well, I suppose it's just as well.

871
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,080
We all feel the same way the X-117 feels.

872
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,440
Storyteller.

873
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,920
Yes, he was the dark raven that courses in the blood,

874
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,840
the mysterious magnetic neon Indian

875
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,620
who sometimes appears above the milky cactus-studded landscape

876
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,000
of the far west,

877
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,040
home of the grotesquely descended chukawala,

878
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,040
the piccolillo cactus,

879
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,300
and the starkly staring yucca pole.

880
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,900
Triceratops, magatherium.

881
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,020
I think I'll have a wiener right now.

882
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:17,740
Delicious.

883
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,940
If you skin them first.

884
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,180
Tell us,

885
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,320
what the theme of tonight's show is.

886
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,700
Doctors still don't know.

887
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,200
The show that dare not even form

888
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,060
out of a nebulous cloud of matter.

889
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,320
That's right.

890
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,880
It's merely words now.

891
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:32,880
Like many bad...

892
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,620
What was the resistance?

893
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,000
Either you're listening or you're not listening.

894
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,860
There's no in-between.

895
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,700
There's no kind of...

896
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,220
Good evening.

897
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,000
This is puzzling evidence in the field

898
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,280
with the subgenius forces

899
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,920
attacking the various religious factions here.

900
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,380
In the area.

901
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,600
Now we will be...

902
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,900
Here we have to...

903
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,260
Secure my...

904
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:02,520
Excuse me.

905
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,480
We will be joining the forces here in the field momentarily

906
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,840
with the sword armaments.

907
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,600
Battling the Baptist forces in Texas

908
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,460
and the Christian forces in California.

909
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,420
Here we're going to the headquarters now.

910
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,100
All is about.

911
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,000
Okay, we've brought rock and roll

912
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,020
down to its essence here.

913
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,240
This is about 96 songs

914
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,680
all brought together on a special computer program

915
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,660
to find out exactly what rock and roll is all about.

916
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,160
This is the essence of rock and roll.

917
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,780
A torrent of words.

918
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,880
A trickle of sense.

919
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,720
...forwards and forwards in the same time.

920
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,180
There's no such thing as time in this kind of a reaction.

921
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,820
It's either there or it's not there.

922
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,640
It's a state of positive, a state of non-positive.

923
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,680
Yes, doctor.

924
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,780
We have achieved time control.

925
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,440
We've achieved time control in our little rocket.

926
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,680
You've got to understand that the Pauli Exclusion Principle

927
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,560
precludes any of these.

928
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,260
Pauli Exclusion.

929
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,680
Yes, it precludes any of us from having the same quantum numbers.

930
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,800
Pauli Exclusion.

931
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,940
In our rocket, we've managed to...

932
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,100
That's why we have such a hot ring of electrons

933
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,980
at the outer parts of a station.

934
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,540
And we achieve time control in this fashion.

935
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,100
But what about all our listeners who aren't able to achieve time control?

936
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,380
Yes, and what about the effects of jamming?

937
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,880
And less energetic levels.

938
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:21,880
The valence band.

939
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,700
And less energy.

940
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:25,800
The valence band.

941
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:25,800


942
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:25,800


943
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:25,800


944
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:25,800


945
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,580
Now, see, friends, what quantum mechanics tells us

946
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,460
is that for every ironclad rule of physics,

947
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,640
you'll always find an exception.

948
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:37,220
In my opinion, it's because our idea of physical laws

949
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,180
has so far been limited to what we,

950
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,500
us poor, pitiful human beings,

951
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,520
can see and measure.

952
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,820
We wouldn't be able to measure the physical properties

953
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:48,200
past our limited wavelength, so to speak.

954
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,240
There could be a whole secondary law of physics

955
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:51,980
that's mostly wrong.

956
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:56,940
hold sway on a level that we don't normally perceive, but it bleeds over into our world

957
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,540
occasionally.

958
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,400
More so for some than others, friends.

959
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:05,200
Now, I'm not at all psychic, but that's probably because like most Americans, I'm

960
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,340
closed off from latent, vestigial senses that our race once enjoyed when we had to live

961
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,840
with nature rather than trying to dominate it.

962
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,720
Now, you get into these more quote primitive unquote tribes and you'll find that not

963
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,760
only do they take magic for granted, but it actually works.

964
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:26,800
Now, I've met a couple of trance mediums in my time and people who sort of had one

965
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,440
foot in the other world and it's not always good for you, friends.

966
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:36,500
If you do have to mess with the elder gods, you better plan not to get into it too deep.

967
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:42,700
The problem with we humans in dealing with the gods, so to speak, is that we don't

968
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,080
give ourselves enough credit.

969
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,100
Now, without us, where would they be?

970
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:46,740
You know?

971
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,700
I mean, there are a lot of people out there.

972
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:48,700


973
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,820
They're a force of nature and we're a force of nature.

974
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,380
Which is more destructive, friends?

975
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,780
All the poltergeists and tribal deities on earth or the Kerr-McGee company?

976
00:53:59,060 --> 00:53:59,380
Huh?

977
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,600
I mean, which is killed off more mountain gorillas?

978
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,200
Which can poison the entire atmosphere by pushing a bunch of buttons?

979
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,220
So you know, friends, you can afford to believe in the gods and the lesser gods and the mediocre

980
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,380
gods and the just plain minor random minded spirits.

981
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,280
Because you have to admit.

982
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,540
You're on a team.

983
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:24,520
Us humans are a team that in some ways has the upper hand.

984
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,860
The gods don't possess nuclear weapons.

985
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,300
The saucer people don't even possess nuclear weapons.

986
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,940
We're the only ones who can totally destroy us.

987
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,620
And doesn't that make you proud to be a human friend?

988
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:45,020
Part of the team that's able to unleash more destructive force than all combined demons,

989
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,260
Greek gods, ghosts, UFOs, and aliens?

990
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:48,260


991
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:48,460
Is the Polar

992
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:48,460


993
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,260
Would you my friends conclude that that is our only vehemence in 했는데 history?

994
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,620
The Personien of the Moon拍 Euißementii

995
00:54:52,620 --> 00:55:04,380
This is from the Puesikos Templar attempt at ما مُذقص todos los가지고

996
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,440
The great Parkour zombie!

997
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:18,240
Battle until they live.

998
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,800
Walk, was it?

999
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,220
Wall climbing?

1000
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:22,260
Was it?

1001
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,580
Wall climbing, well, I was wall climbing.

1002
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,960
I was wall climbing.

1003
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,220
That's what Bob said to do.

1004
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,240
That's what Bob told me to.

1005
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,900
I was wall climbing.

1006
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:33,760
Yeah, yeah.

1007
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,540
It was .

1008
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:43,240
And, uh, and, and, uh, I, I get, I get,

1009
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,800
real scared, Bob.

1010
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:52,080
Because, uh, I, I've seen them.

1011
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,860
Uh, I've seen them before.

1012
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,820
But there's more of them now.

1013
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,060
And, uh, cause there's lots more.

1014
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:08,080
They're, they're floating in the, in the air.

1015
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,180
And they, they're living in the wood,

1016
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,180
and the rocks, and everything.

1017
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:16,760
And they're, they're always kind of,

1018
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,880
laughing and, and, uh, killing and laughing and,

1019
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,140
all the time.

1020
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,740
Duncan Lunan of the British Interplanetary Society

1021
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,740
has interpreted the signals as a message

1022
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,780
from a space probe.

1023
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,800
A message from a dying planet in Epsilon Bootes.

1024
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,780
Now, many groups who claim to be in contact

1025
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,460
with space brothers say that those self-same aliens

1026
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:48,240
have the ability, uh, to dampen, uh, their energy.

1027
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:53,020
or smother our nuclear arsenal before it can be exploded.

1028
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,460
But why would the UFOs save us, friends?

1029
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,480
Just so they can go on mutilating our prize heifers?

1030
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:00,940
Eh?

1031
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,580
Oh, no, friends.

1032
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,160
We Earth mortals have a much bigger say in our destiny

1033
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,920
than ever we did when we believed in the nature spirits.

1034
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:14,520
But then, you know, if the weird forces ever did need to get after us,

1035
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,220
think what they could do.

1036
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,980
Oh, they're as high-tech as we are, if they want to be.

1037
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:23,100
Your average modern-day poltergeist or haint

1038
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:27,200
can turn on appliances, load video decks, and so on.

1039
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,620
Now, what if, friend, a distressed nuclear weapons engineer

1040
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,420
were to commit suicide in a missile silo,

1041
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:40,160
which would henceforth be haunted by the etherical astral body

1042
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,840
of the leftover embittered lower soul,

1043
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,620
which was too confused to stick with its higher counterpart

1044
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:46,200
and go to hell?

1045
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,740
So it stays around half in our reality,

1046
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,880
trying to make contact, but unable to,

1047
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,500
and finally driven mad while gaining experience

1048
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,220
in discharging electrical circuitry

1049
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,960
by sheer poltergeist hate force.

1050
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:07,040
Or it could get into radar view screens at NORAD

1051
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:11,400
and appear as blips on radar like incoming Russian missiles.

1052
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,900
Oh, friends, did you ever wonder

1053
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,200
what a nuclear blast would do to your health?

1054
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:16,500
Your soul?

1055
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:21,420
If ever there was something that could erase parts of more than one reality,

1056
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,060
it's that.

1057
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,120
So maybe the ghosts are worried about nuclear weapons, too.

1058
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,760
Maybe it would even destroy them.

1059
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,480
But we'll find out, come Omicron-Epsilon, friends,

1060
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,920
the time intersection, when this universe intersects

1061
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:38,060
with the backwards time stream universe in the year 2178

1062
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:41,180
and the images of the Akashic records become flesh

1063
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,760
and your weirdest dreams come to rampaging life.

1064
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,180
Ever see for real?

1065
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:46,800
The forbidden planet?

1066
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:51,260
Friends, that's what happened to the super race of aliens in that movie.

1067
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,040
And it's what happened to the Elder Gods

1068
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,700
who forced us to build Atlantis in the days of the Yeti.

1069
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,980
Yes, friends, Omicron-Epsilon,

1070
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,280
the vision beholding itself in subgenius prophecy.

1071
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,420
We'd better hope Bob's with us on that day, my friends,

1072
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,220
and you better hope he finds the twins with the scissors of sight,

1073
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,020
whatever that means.

1074
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,100
And if not, well, the negative universe leaks over.

1075
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:25,860
And, friend, when was the last time you had you a big ol' steaming hot bowl of Wolf-brand anti-matter?

1076
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,800
Well, that's too long.

1077
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,520
And, friends, these are ghoulish thoughts,

1078
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:38,020
but you can write to P.O. Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1079
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,180
Hope you got that.

1080
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,640
For more information on how to halt these horrible things.

1081
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:46,020
And this is KNON 90.9.

1082
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,580
FM in Dallas, Texas.

1083
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,460
Stay tuned for Ron Lindsey.

1084
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,180
And down memory lane,

1085
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,560
Praise Bob!

1086
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,540
Must go on.

1087
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,780
It must go on.
