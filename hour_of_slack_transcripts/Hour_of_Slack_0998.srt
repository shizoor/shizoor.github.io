1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,720
I tried the frog.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,900
Groovy.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,140
Let us pray.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:20,680
Yes, Bob waits in the great luminous green beyond, puffing huge clouds of toxic smoke.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:27,560
His grin resonates through the cosmos, and his millions of dots,

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,880
the thousand of luminous globes which comprise his essence,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,080
glow and glower into every corner of the universe.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,660
As we join together in this bobbly ceremony, at this delightful hour,

9
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:50,100
the hour of the Church of the Subgenius radio show, more than an hour and less than a show,

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,700
we think how thankful we are for the little things in life,

11
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,580
for Billy Barton, Mickey Wynn, and, of course,

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,460
the late lamented gremlin, Mr. Ermus Formus Weirbogus.

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,200
This call requires a coin deposit.

14
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,000
Who are you?

15
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,160
Please hang up momentarily.

16
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,020
What are you?

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,280
Then redial your call.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,180
Where did you come from?

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,820
By first depositing a local rate.

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,720
I think you're evil!

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,120
Posted on the instruction card.

22
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:23,920
Evil!

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,420
The Subgenius.

24
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,080
Power.

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:27,720
All.

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,640
What?

27
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,980
I think you're evil!

28
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,460
I don't think so.

29
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,500
From PR News in Washington, I'm nine years old and living in California.

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,140
Excellent.

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:45,980
Former FBI officials claimed that President Bush has acknowledged that Boeing rejected French voters during the early 70s.

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,820
No problemo.

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,220
On Wall Street 3910523272.

34
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:50,920
Trust me.

35
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,640
This is French President Jacques Chirac, a Wiccan whose religious beliefs include PR's PR.

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,480
In Washington.

37
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,400
Buggye monsters threatening Earth.

38
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,860
This one cordially invites them to address us, one and all.

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,220
And now for some last minute

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,680
Subgenius.

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,400
Power.

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,040
All.

43
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,060
What?

44
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,500
Well, what do you make of it?

45
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,720
I'm not sure yet.

46
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,240
I wish I could figure it out.

47
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,180
Get away!

48
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,260
Get away!

49
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,660
On July 5th, 1998.

50
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,620
7 A.M.

51
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
When we all have hangover.

52
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:35,560
Lootan's judgment will take place in the form of what the pre-scripture's called the advent of the angelic host.

53
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,580
And that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand.

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,660
And that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.

55
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:13,580
The plan is to invade, to infest key men in government and industry with some alien force from outer space that seeps into the human body and takes over.

56
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,900
Within five years, the United States, as we know it, will cease to exist.

57
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,120
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.

58
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,580
Praise the Lord.

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,420
And these times are the times of the devil.

60
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,700
These times are not going to get any better, my friend.

61
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,580
Amen. They're going to get worse and worse.

62
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,420
Okay, I know you all think you want to know what's going on.

63
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,620
That's okay.

64
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,080
So I saw this thing coming.

65
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,000
I saw this thing coming to me.

66
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,340
I didn't know what it was, but it looked funny.

67
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:11,360
Okay, it exists.

68
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,200
Now if you're out in here watching, or watching shows, go then to your office, and watch what I'm about to tell you.

69
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:20,920


70
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,440
And then such a людей

71
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,140
and such an explorationist guy.

72
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,300
The Galactic Center.

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,500
Total collapse of world civilization.

74
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,300
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world.

75
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,080
Only his predictions are just a little different.

76
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,800
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m. to be exact,

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,660
the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them,

78
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,660
will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses,

79
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,700
the true believer subgeniuses,

80
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,320
up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

81
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,360
To carry a few picked survivors of our doomed civilization

82
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,800
to a new life on another world.

83
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,200
It's let's have a party.

84
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,280
Is it time for that big operation?

85
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,840
And believe it or not, plenty of people,

86
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,540
4,000 of them so far and more every day,

87
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,680
have already joined up.

88
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,240
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.

89
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,600
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

90
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,120
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

91
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,460
Hello there!

92
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,400
Ha ha.

93
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,820
Flying saucer.

94
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,980
Flying saucers.

95
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,760
Flying saucers.

96
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,280
Now, am I crazy?

97
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,920
Yeah, something like that.

98
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,240
So I'm crazy.

99
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,120
Yes!

100
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,000
Ha ha ha.

101
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay.

102
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,040
I am crazy.

103
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,560
Yeah.

104
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,500
The saucer.

105
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,180
Flying saucer.

106
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,740
Flying saucer.

107
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,460
The saucer.

108
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,260
The saucer.

109
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,980
The saucer.

110
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,860
Flying saucer.

111
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,860
Flying saucer.

112
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,740
Flying saucer.

113
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,540
I thought I was going crazy.

114
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,040
Yeah, why not?

115
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,720
Okay.

116
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,200
Okay.

117
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,880
Ha ha.

118
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,660
Flip it.

119
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,400
It's five a day.

120
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,080
It's disgusting the way we treat humans.

121
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,120
Done great.

122
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,640
Done great.

123
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:16,940
Ahhh!

124
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,100
My big Bob is just the guy with the pipe.

125
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,520
Oh that's crazy talk.

126
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,120
So what's new with you, Rockner?

127
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,300
Well.

128
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:25,300


129
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,920
I'm doing good. I'm getting my gear ready for X Day.

130
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,620
So far in advance.

131
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,580
Uh-huh.

132
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,300
You know, maybe I should start preparing.

133
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,540
Yeah, it's always best to start getting ready for X Day like about a month ahead of time.

134
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,200
Well, some would say that it's best to get ready for X Day a lifetime ahead of time.

135
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,040
Because X Day could be tomorrow.

136
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,920
Exactly.

137
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:55,160
I mean, and X Day is not just, you know, some little event that people go to at that little campground there.

138
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,880
No, X Day...

139
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,860
X Day is a state of mind.

140
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,740
Mm-hmm.

141
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,300
X Day is life on the edge.

142
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,000
The edge of...

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,820
Sanity.

144
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:04,740
Ugh.

145
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,460
An alien cannot invade a dead man.

146
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,440
We're merely using this corpse for a demonstration of placement.

147
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,340
Monsters like a doomed man will be around thee all about.

148
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,100
And shall wait thee to look past the door which should be locked.

149
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,220
And thy silences will terrify thee.

150
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,080
And bring thee naught but death.

151
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,340
And thy hearts shall be all that's left but evil.

152
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:34,520
For thy spirit is locked away inside the white stone which my angels have grieved from space.

153
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,620
So we've got to get ourselves through from these two stones here...

154
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,920
there...

155
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,900
to those two stones down there.

156
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,640
And we can actually sort of will ourselves into the saucer which is hovering in the next dimension.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's about time.

158
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,440
Yeah.

159
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,680
It's not an actual physical thing of saucers coming out of normal reality.

160
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,700
it's sources coming out of an alternate reality

161
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,840
the tools of conquest do not necessarily

162
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,720
come with bombs and explosions

163
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,700
and fallout

164
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,960
yes dear friends and this tool

165
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,380
of conquest is

166
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,640
hour of slack number 998

167
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,220
funny that sounds

168
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,300
sort of like 1998

169
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,480
and indeed it's almost

170
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,100
8x day dear friends and we're almost

171
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,000
to hour of slack number

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,900
1000 are we

173
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,500
approaching the end

174
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,900
or is it merely a new beginning

175
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,340
of the end

176
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,860
praise Bob I don't know but we

177
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,860
are going to Brushwood in

178
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,900
Sherman New York for the gut

179
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,860
blowout of the season

180
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,880
of the X because this

181
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,980
is the age of Afriktius

182
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,620
friends it's the day of dogs

183
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,680
and the night of the living

184
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,820
Bob and Bob

185
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,880
as Rocknar once said

186
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,700
Bob could sell lions

187
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,880
to Christians in the Colosseum

188
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,140
friends not only

189
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,820

190
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,840
but so too are Dr. Howell

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,860
friends we heard

198
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,620
earlier in the show and will also

00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,820

200
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,680
classy cut up artist

and besides

207
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,240
the Puzzling Evidence show friends

208
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,420
we'll be hearing live taped radio

209
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,720
from WCSB Cleveland

210
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,900
that being Dr. Sinister's

211
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,220
Radio Synesthesia

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,340
10pm Sundays on

213
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,060
WCSB.org

214
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,340
where Rocknar, a lonesome

215
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,520
and yours truly call in

216
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,880
when he's on the air

217
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,980
when he's on the air

218
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,000
getting ready for X Day

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,720
man I'm a last minute

220
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,920
kind of guy

221
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,400
I used to be but now

222
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm like I want to use

223
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,460
this month to like get all my stuff

224
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,360
together so that the day

225
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,920
that I leave I'm ready to go

226
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,720
it is one month from today

227
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,980
less than a month

228
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,200
well today is the 5th

229
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,160
hard to believe isn't it

230
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,320
that the year is practically half

231
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,780
over here

232
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,200
incidentally there are

233
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
666 episodes

234
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,560
between June 6th

235
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,100
6am and X Day

236
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,760
hmm

237
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,200
coincidence

238
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,420
hmm

239
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,640
I don't know maybe probably

240
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,700
hello you're on the air

241
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,940
Dr. Sinister

242
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,200
hello Reverend Stang

243
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,680
this is Reverend Stang

244
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,600
I just realized I'm on a tricky phone

245
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,400
where I can't turn my speakers down

246
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,400
princess we turn that black knob

247
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,520
no no no

248
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,240
no no no

249
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,340
no

250
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,620
oh not that button

251
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,360
uh oh

252
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,240
thank you for pressing the self-destruct button

253
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,660
there are a lot of black knobs

254
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,700
it's kind of ironic

255
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,000
everything's really hectic around here

256
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,420
and you know

257
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,640
the end of the world is only one month away

258
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,140
yeah hard to believe

259
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,240
and yet

260
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,640
I'm running around fretting whether there'll be enough

261
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,660
sacred goods to sell

262
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,560
at our end of the world gathering

263
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
and that kind of thing

264
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,620
selling you know

265
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,060
right

266
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,360
because actually

267
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
you know we'll be on the air

268
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,820
and we'll be on the saucers

269
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,840
we you know

270
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,800
the stuff will still be useful to us

271
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,440
because we'll be taken away on the saucers

272
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,220
and not left here to

273
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,340
you can take it with you

274
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,580
yes

275
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,320
that is what the other religions lied about

276
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,520
they were saying that after you don't need money

277
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,860
but when you're oh you know

278
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,460
when you pass into the other world

279
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,720
you need to have good deeds

280
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,400
no you need money too

281
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,200
why do you think I bring weird money to X Day

282
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,360
that's right

283
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,340
uh Stang you want to explain the concept of weird money

284
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,480
money

285
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,060
the con no I I don't understand the concept of weird money at all

286
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,880
I only understand uh the

287
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,780
money

288
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,740
the false federal reserve notes

289
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,560
oh

290
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,040
the at which are I mean it's all those aren't any more real

291
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,780
that's just that's weird money

292
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,300
uh for all intents and purposes

293
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:09,820
sure

294
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,100
I mean you can still buy a coca-cola with it

295
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
and that's that's all that matters right now

296
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,340
you can you can buy a lot more than a coca-cola with uh

297
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,620
but as Bob said

298
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,420
federal reserve notes

299
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,460
well after X Day comes

300
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,340
people will buy a coca-cola with it

301
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:22,340


302
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:22,340


303
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,800
people are going to be

304
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,040
they'll be eating roach crap

305
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,940
by the year 2000

306
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,680
and he was right

307
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,960
a couple of years from now

308
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,480
well you could argue that everything is recycled roach crap

309
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,060
well you know the funny thing is

310
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,120
a lot of roaches crap

311
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,960
we are eating a certain percentage of roach crap

312
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,440
if you if you look at the

313
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,100
right federal guidelines for our food

314
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,080
there's an allowable amount

315
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,940
but but roaches are

316
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,660
and insects in general

317
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,540
are certainly going to end up being

318
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,340
used as a food for the future

319
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,940
as a food source

320
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,440
as the world becomes worse

321
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,740
well in some parts of the world

322
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,100
that yeah that's a major protein source for some people

323
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,580
is eating insects and things

324
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,920
maybe the concept of eating roach crap

325
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,320
is to help us evolve into

326
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,340
insectoid life forms

327
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,780
I am I am ready for uh

328
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,500
I'm part dung beetle you know

329
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,360
we're all we're all Bob's dung beetles in a way

330
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,140
now aren't we

331
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,440
yeah

332
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,120
until Bob himself returns

333
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,320
we're just still pushing that steaming load up there

334
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,320


335
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,320


336
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,340
we're just still pushing that steaming load up there

337
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm going to throw the bomb

338
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:23,560
on Bob's dung beetle

339
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,880
even if we're trying to slack off

340
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,720
it ain't the same without Bob

341
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,840
that's right

342
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,480
and he shall return

343
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,040
and the evil people who control

344
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,340
the subgenius foundation will be over

345
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,140
oh I mean uh

346
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,040
the the good heads of the subgenius foundation

347
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,700
will overthrow the evil conspiracy people

348
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,620
who are at the root of all of

349
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,200
all of the world's problems

350
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,360
that's right

351
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,840
you too can become part of

352
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,340
the uh

353
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,000
the only revolution that matters.

354
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,720
We want to be part of the solution

355
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,160
and part of the problem.

356
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,360
We want to control both.

357
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,280
You know what?

358
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,060
That's the only way to go these days

359
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,320
because the problems have solutions

360
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,700
and the solutions have problems.

361
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,420
And you don't know who to trust anymore.

362
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,300
Who can you trust?

363
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,500
Well, you can always...

364
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,540
Don't trust Bob.

365
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,120
Don't trust Bob.

366
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,780
I would not trust him very much.

367
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,500
You can trust Bob to do the thing

368
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
that's best for Bob.

369
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,040
Yeah.

370
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,140
I mean, you can trust him...

371
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,160
That's going to happen no matter what.

372
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,000
You can trust him about as far

373
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,800
as you can throw him.

374
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,040
Which...

375
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,480
He's a fairly large...

376
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,980
Well, he's not that tall.

377
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,060
He's not as tall as you always think

378
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,680
he's going to be.

379
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,600
Well, you know, his terrestrial form

380
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,720
of course isn't quite that large.

381
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,860
But, you know, we all know that

382
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,560
that, you know, it conceals a great mass.

383
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,880
A great mass of...

384
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,340
He is a great man.

385
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,780
He is great in all of the ways

386
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,800
that one can be great.

387
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,980
He is the Alpha Endo-Man.

388
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,120
He is the Omega.

389
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,380
Simultaneously the mouth

390
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,500
and anus of the universe.

391
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,640
I don't trust him.

392
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,440
With all due respect, Master,

393
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,880
is he not the Chosen One?

394
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,600
So the prophecy says.

395
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,820
I don't care about oracles

396
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,380
or prophecies or messiahs.

397
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,520
I care about one thing.

398
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,620
With all due respect, Commander,

399
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
there is only one way to save our city.

400
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,280
How?

401
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,880
Bob?

402
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,880
Damn it, Morpheus.

403
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,320
Not everyone believes what you believe.

404
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,820
My beliefs do not require them to.

405
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,060
I can't help thinking.

406
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,680
What if you're wrong?

407
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,740
What if all this, the prophecy,

408
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,100
everything is bullshit?

409
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,360
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

410
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,360
But how would that be different

411
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,300
from any other day?

412
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,640
That's utter nonsense.

413
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,300
The future is always nonsense

414
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,740
until it becomes the past.

415
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,560
What kind of nonsense is this?

416
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,380
A prophecy

417
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,280
that misread

418
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,580
could have been.

419
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,480
He will not let me down.

420
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
He never has.

421
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,220
I hope right you are.

422
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,880
I don't understand it.

423
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,860
Everything was done

424
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,860
as it was supposed to be done.

425
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,160
The prophecy tells us.

426
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,160
It was a lie, Morpheus.

427
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,300
The prophecy was a lie.

428
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,320
It was all another system of control.

429
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,260
I don't believe that.

430
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,520
This sort of thing has cropped up before

431
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,400
and it has always been due to human error.

432
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm not going to say a thing

433
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,960
until I talk to my lawyer.

434
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,640
Good night.

435
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,260
Good night.

436
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,040
Goodbye.

437
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,760
I'm illogical.

438
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,260
I answer

439
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,100
that if this religion

440
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
will this world tyranny

441
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,280
of God everywhere

442
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,100
is ever to end.

443
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,480
Where is he, man?

444
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,140
Why isn't he out here?

445
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,980
Yeah, well, where is he, man?

446
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,700
I hate this.

447
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,500
We got control over nothing.

448
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,240
Oh, we got control over nothing.

449
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,800
Oh, my God.

450
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,980
You're disturbing.

451
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,360
You're disturbing

452
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,320
the peaceful mood I'm in.

453
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,240
You are disturbing

454
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,680
the peaceful frame of mind I'm in.

455
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,020
You are disturbing

456
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,280
my peaceful frame of mind.

457
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,640
Could you turn that down?

458
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,460
You know, it's not like

459
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,500
how it is on TV.

460
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,020
With sound effects.

461
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,840
Bob's University presents

462
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,360
Work with Bob the Slack.

463
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,060
We're going to be fired up about that.

464
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,320
How many of you would be excited?

465
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,300
Slacker, slacker, slacker, slacker.

466
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,600
If I was going to use

467
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,100
three words for a slacker,

468
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,500
these are the words I would use.

469
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,160
It's going to get moldy.

470
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,040
It's going to get nasty.

471
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,080
It's going to get stinky.

472
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,840
Slackers are always

473
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,480
hard as you can possibly go.

474
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,600
Hey, listen.

475
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
I want to tell you this.

476
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,640
It's a whole lot easier to come

477
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,340
when your kids want to come with you.

478
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,860
Right?

479
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,340
You know, I don't know a whole lot.

480
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,240
Become a slacker.

481
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,700
I want to be a slacker.

482
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,200
Some of y'all are on another planet,

483
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,980
but I want to be a slacker.

484
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:21,980


485
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:21,980


486
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,640
I want to tell you this.

487
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,660
You've done nothing but watch television.

488
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,680
That's unbelievable.

489
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,520
Slackers are people.

490
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,700
Now listen.

491
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,360
Use me.

492
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,140
Slackers take a lot of time.

493
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,740
Man, they grow and expand.

494
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,920
Slackers take a lot of energy.

495
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,360
You say, what are you talking about?

496
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,340
Hey, listen.

497
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,520
When you're getting beat,

498
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,820
you want some new, fresh vitality

499
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,440
in your life.

500
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,840
If you're a slacker,

501
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,760
I want to tell you,

502
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,760
if you're sitting back,

503
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,220
if you're soaking in,

504
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,120
I want to tell you something.

505
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,900
Hey, listen.

506
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,020
Hey, listen.

507
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,680
Their parents are about to kill them.

508
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,860
I mean, they really are.

509
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,660
See, I mean,

510
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,140
they're doing their thing, man.

511
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,800
Tell me.

512
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,760
Jim Jones,

513
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,380
Stephen King,

514
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,920
they take a shift.

515
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,740
Every week, they take a shift.

516
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,100
Now, I want to tell you this.

517
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,720
Listen.

518
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,880
And listen.

519
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,460
Being a slacker,

520
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,620
being a slacker,

521
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,680
do you want your life

522
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,560
to count for something more than a shift?

523
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,440
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.

524
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,340
Being squeezed,

525
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,160
playing a drum,

526
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,480
who cares?

527
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,340
Right.

528
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,460
This next day,

529
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,700
we don't know whether

530
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,180
this will be the end

531
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,800
or the beginning of the end again.

532
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,700
Or an end of the beginning.

533
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,060
I'm ready for either one to happen.

534
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,000
I mean, let's face it.

535
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,340
We've waited for the saucers to come.

536
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,120
This will be our eight.

537
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,240
Yeah, and we're going to have to deal with

538
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,440
whatever happens either way,

539
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,720
so we might as well be prepared.

540
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,820
You know, we might as well

541
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,720
gird ourselves mentally for the coming...

542
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,500
The important thing is we just don't know.

543
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,840
That's the lesson that Bob gave us about X-Day

544
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,760
is we don't know.

545
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,500
That's right.

546
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,060
Bob could come any second.

547
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,660
Are you...

548
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,780
How do you know you don't know?

549
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,860
Once again, are you ready?

550
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,260
Have you been living your life

551
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,920
the way that you should?

552
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,180
That's the operative question.

553
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,020
As if the world ends tomorrow.

554
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,160
That is, have you been living it to the max?

555
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,880
Don't save your money.

556
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,500
Or as the case may be,

557
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,800
have you been completely blowing everything off?

558
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,640
As if the world ended tomorrow.

559
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,660
That's black, baby.

560
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,480
That is a dilemma.

561
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,620
When you know you're going to die,

562
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:21,900
you know you're going to die tomorrow.

563
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,620
At that moment, you...

564
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,060
In a way, then you have slack

565
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,320
if you really know it.

566
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,500
Oh, absolutely.

567
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,380
Because you don't have to worry about it anymore.

568
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,880
If there's no suspense involved.

569
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:33,480
Right.

570
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,740
It's a form of slack unlike any other, really.

571
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,340
Right.

572
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,060
One might call it terminal slack

573
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,340
instead of original slack.

574
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,440
I guess I can relax now.

575
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,860
Nothing more I can do.

576
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,180
Might as well take the day off.

577
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,420
That's right.

578
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,600
Hmm.

579
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,580
That's...

580
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,680
That's one of those things...

581
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,440
I really wish...

582
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,540
Wish I could have is 24 hours notice.

583
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,100
Well, yeah, the conspiracy is certainly coming out

584
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,180
with a large number of movies

585
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,980
about the world ending.

586
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,460
What they do every summer

587
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,000
as Subgenius X Day gets closer

588
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,400
or Hollywood has to get in on the bandwagon.

589
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,220
That's right.

590
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,320
Now, didn't they try to steal our idea

591
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,040
with the movie Fin Dependence Day?

592
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,100
Oh, that was the most obvious one.

593
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:20,600
Yeah.

594
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,600
The most...

595
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,960
The most blatantly obvious one.

596
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,900
They actually stole...

597
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,500
Took imagery from the cover

598
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,000
of Book of the Subgenius.

599
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,740
They actually showed real subgenii

600
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,460
in this one clip of the film...

601
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,660
In this one segment of the film.

602
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,720
There were people on the rooftops,

603
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,740
you know, with the signs saying,

604
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,540
take me up, you know.

605
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:34,880
Right.

606
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,400
Right.

607
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,420
That was their takeoff on...

608
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,020
That was to make us look silly.

609
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:40,900
Right.

610
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,300
But...

611
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,740
We know how it'll be.

612
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,620
But, yeah, no, every year there's...

613
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,820
There was Armageddon

614
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,800
and there's...

615
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,700
Every year there's at least two or three.

616
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,800
And, of course, this time it's...

617
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,680
It's...

618
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:51,680


619
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:51,680


620
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:51,680


621
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:51,680


622
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:51,680


623
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:51,680


624
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,300
War of the Worlds,

625
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,080
which might or might not be a travesty

626
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,300
of the great novel by the great H.G. Wells.

627
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,540
If it was anybody but Tom Cruise in it,

628
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,880
I'd probably go see it.

629
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,540
Well, I'll go see it

630
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,340
even though it has Tom Cruise in it

631
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,100
because H.G. Wells is the one being raped

632
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,160
by Hollywood.

633
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,620
Now, why couldn't...

634
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,260
He's one of my heroes.

635
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:13,420
Why couldn't they have gotten

636
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,920
his great-grandson Simon Wells to direct it?

637
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
I mean, he directed the movie

638
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,080
The Time Machine, didn't he?

639
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,900
I didn't hear that.

640
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,840
Simon Wells.

641
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,620
Which what?

642
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,240
Simon Wells is H.G. Wells' great-grand...

643
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,340
Oh, oh, right.

644
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,400
The grandson who did The Time Machine.

645
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:29,940
Right.

646
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,500
Oh, God.

647
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,740
Oh, that's such a horrible, horrible nightmare.

648
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,840
Every time I think of that,

649
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,720
that's one of the great stories of all time.

650
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,140
That guy just ripped the nards

651
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,320
right out of the story.

652
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,780
Turned it into Indiana Jones versus the Morlocks.

653
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,200
And then at the end of the movie,

654
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,580
he saves the world.

655
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,580
Oh, good.

656
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,440
The humans.

657
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,440
They're all gonna be saved against the Morlocks

658
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,860
because a big, strong, handsome man came

659
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,100
and did a strong thing

660
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,160
and threw the right switch on that time machine

661
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,060
and blew up all the Morlocks' underground.

662
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,900
Isn't that convenient?

663
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,420
Now we can have a happy ending.

664
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,320
Hey, hey, hey.

665
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,180
God, Hollywood just makes me

666
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,500
just wanna puke.

667
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,420
Isn't that what you said about close encounters?

668
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,240
Oh, well, see, to me,

669
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,540
this new war of the world,

670
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,980
is possibly Spielberg's way of making up

671
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,700
for those two demonic films,

672
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,980
Close Encounters and E.T.,

673
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,860
which depicted the aliens as being,

674
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,700
oh, friendly to all the pinks.

675
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,360
They're gonna lead the pinks

676
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,980
into a wondrous new world of light and love and knowledge

677
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,200
rather than the slaughterhouses

678
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,180
that they actually intend for us.

679
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,960
And I think War of the Worlds, I'm hoping,

680
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,820
will depict X-Day in the proper sense

681
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,660
that Wells originally meant.

682
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Which is that the human race are insects,

683
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,040
fleas to these creatures.

684
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,660
They're just exterminators.

685
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,900
Are we even fleas,

686
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,560
or perhaps we're just part of the landscape?

687
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,880
Right, there's not even a question of fighting.

688
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,660
Perhaps we're like rocks.

689
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,180
Right, we're not, we're not,

690
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,760
it's like ants trying to fight people.

691
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,520
Yep, yep.

692
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,840
Now, speaking of which,

693
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,620
did you ever see the movie Fantastic Planet?

694
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,480
I'm sure you have.

695
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

696
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,540
Now, that was a good movie way back in the day,

697
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,620
but since Hollywood's, like,

698
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,460
all about remaking everything anyway,

699
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,520
why not just write up a script

700
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,460
and take it to Pixar?

701
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,540
Well, that point,

702
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,560
the point that the aliens would keep us as pets

703
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,680
actually is made in the original

704
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,980
War of the Worlds novel.

705
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,840
Huh.

706
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,400
A soldier, the protagonist meets a soldier

707
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,960
in the ruins of a city,

708
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and the soldier, played by Papa Joe Mama,

709
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,380
goes into this great rant about how,

710
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,880
oh, there'll be people who'll sell out,

711
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,440
they'll work, they'll love to go to work for the aliens,

712
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,660
while some will...

713
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,080
Some of the humans will hunt other humans,

714
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,860
and the aliens will have their own little pet boy,

715
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,240
but, oh, the pet boy grew up,

716
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,500
so it had to be put down.

717
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,160
They're too dangerous when they get grown up.

718
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,900
Yeah, I remember that from the radio play.

719
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:07,940
Yeah.

720
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,420
Fantastic.

721
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,180
Yeah, that's from the original novel by H.G. Wells,

722
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,080
which I would recommend anyone to read.

723
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,780
It's just wonderful steampunk depiction

724
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,160
of the end of the world.

725
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,360
Yeah.

726
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,360


727
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,660
Yeah.

728
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:21,660


729
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:21,660


730
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:21,660


731
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:21,660


732
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:21,660


733
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:21,660


734
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:21,660


735
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,300
The funny thing about it is,

736
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,900
it takes place at the turn of the previous century,

737
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,540
so flying machines had not even really been invented

738
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,380
at that point.

739
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:30,660
That's right.

740
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,520
I want to have, like,

741
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,380
War of the Alien Creatures

742
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,340
against War of the Earthly Creatures,

743
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,600
and have all the aliens on one side,

744
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,480
and all of the Earth monsters on the other side.

745
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,520
What Earth monsters?

746
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,200
Like Frankenstein and Dracula,

747
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,780
and all the creatures,

748
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,880
all the famous monsters that didn't come from outer space,

749
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,200
versus all the famous monsters

750
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,140
that came from outer space.

751
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,180
All of the six-foot-high posters of Frankenstein

752
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,280
that sold for a dollar in the back of the comic book.

753
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:57,640


754
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,180
You'd have to have dinosaurs

755
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,120
that would be part of the Earthly monsters.

756
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,840
But you could have, you know,

757
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,540
like the various aliens.

758
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,780
Maybe to them, you're the model.

759
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,140
E.T. would be on the model.

760
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,920
Yeah, like that one.

761
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,880
That ghastly alien with an eyeball

762
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,400
staring out of a massive, twisted...

763
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,700
The thing that wouldn't die.

764
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,240
I mean, the crawling eye would be...

765
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,200
The crawling eye, yeah, right.

766
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,960
That was an invasive monster.

767
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,860
What about mutants?

768
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,520
But the abominable snowman

769
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,280
would be on the Earth creature's side.

770
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,600
Mutants are a war job.

771
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,680
And they'd be on the human's side, really,

772
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,780
or the side that will keep the humans alive.

773
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,100
The side that would be of Earthly origin

774
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,100
versus the side that's of extraterrestrial.

775
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,640
What about genetic mishaps?

776
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,480
That's Earthly origin.

777
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,260
They do happen, but with constant vigilance.

778
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,100
They would be on our Earthly origin side,

779
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,040
monster side.

780
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,280
So right now, we have an idea

781
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,500
that's searching for a plot.

782
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,800
If you've got a good plot to go with our idea,

783
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,440
we'd like you to call right now at 510-848-4455.

784
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,220
Just press...

785
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,680
Press extension 4 and ask for...

786
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,100
Ask for Larry, the plot boy.

787
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,580
Larry, the plot boy, is waiting for your call right now at...

788
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,760
510-848-4455.

789
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,300
Call now.

790
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,700
And give Larry, the plot boy, a reason...

791
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,460
...for existence.

792
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,300
He's sitting over there twiddling his thumbs.

793
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,380
He needs you to call right now.

794
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,220
Larry, the plot boy, is sitting there wasting your money.

795
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,740
We're paying him to sit there and answer your call.

796
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,360
Plot boy is...

797
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,040
You know, this just isn't working out, puzzling.

798
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,000
I think we're going to have to fire plot boy.

799
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:39,780
Oh, no.

800
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,420
Already?

801
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,300
He was only hired eight minutes ago.

802
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,780
Well, you do it this time.

803
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,120
I'm tired of being the ax man for this show.

804
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,860
More dead bugs and cigarette butts.

805
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,080
That's Michael Pepe's dinner in his video.

806
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,220
If I had a nickel for every plot boy I've fired for this show, I'd be a millionaire.

807
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,020
I really like this dramatic music, though.

808
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,040
It's normally...

809
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,040
This makes me feel like the show's important.

810
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,260
And it is.

811
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,160
Because we're...

812
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,460
Celebrating a new political movement.

813
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,200
And we have a new sponsor for the show, right?

814
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,560
Grand Grape Soda.

815
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,480
It's airtight storage containers.

816
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,320
Yes, airtight storage containers.

817
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,900
That's right.

818
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,660
The greatest invention.

819
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,120
It's been around since the beginning of time.

820
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,180
It's solved the old problem about how to dispose of a body.

821
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,540
That's right.

822
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,700
Just put them in an airtight storage container.

823
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,000
Right.

824
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,440
These durable, stay fresh containers are airtight to protect open bags of sugar.

825
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,200
That's right.

826
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,080
They, uh, what's inside might not be fresh, but you'll never smell it as long as they're continually airtight.

827
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,280
Now that's the important thing.

828
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,260
Made of dishwasher safe plastic, each container holds 5,000 bags of sugar.

829
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,600
And if you're so egress...

830
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,160
With certain contents.

831
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,780
You wouldn't want it to be in your dishwasher.

832
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,440
That is a certainty.

833
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,280
And there are some sizes that are too large for modern dishwasher technology.

834
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,720
In jumbo, elephantine, and humungo.

835
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,760
And then of course we have the Juggernaut airtight storage container.

836
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,660
Yes, big enough for both Juggernauts.

837
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,560
And we have the immovable object storage container.

838
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,220
The one that you can't move anywhere.

839
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,000
You can't even take the top off of.

840
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,120
But it becomes an interesting conundrum for the Juggernaut container.

841
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:22,820
Ha ha!

842
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,400
Anyway, I have some hopes for the new War of the Worlds.

843
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:33,440
And you know, there's another War of the Worlds movie being made that is a period, low budget period version.

844
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,340
Oh.

845
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:42,380
That actually supposedly was filmed in Suffolk in England and is completely true to the book.

846
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,900
I think a movie is not going to do a book like War of the Worlds justice.

847
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,360
I think you should have done it.

848
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,220
I think that it should have been done as like a six hour mini-series.

849
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,600
Oh, I don't know.

850
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,860
It's actually not that complicated of a story.

851
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,240
Planet meets planet.

852
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,500
Planet loses planet.

853
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,740
Planet gets planet back.

854
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,840
Yeah.

855
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,220
And I can understand Spielberg.

856
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,560
There's two points about it.

857
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,600
Well, the kids these days think the War of the Worlds didn't really happen in 1900.

858
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,980
But they absolutely believe that it was just completely a failure.

859
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,180
They think that the radio show was just a hoax.

860
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,440
It was not a historical thing, but a hoax.

861
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,480
Anyway, the kids won't swallow that.

862
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,380
And plus, you can't say they're from Mars because, well, we've been to Mars and there's

863
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,820
nothing but rocks and dirt.

864
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:42,920
And underground cities filled with four-armed giants and naked green women.

865
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,440
It's the underground Mars.

866
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,540
What was Mars like?

867
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,260
What was Mars like before the shift?

868
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,500
Surprisingly, it's not surprising.

869
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,080
All the stories are the same.

870
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:07,740
You read about Mars in the works of Kim Stanley Robinson, Edgar Rice Burroughs, William S. Burroughs.

871
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,720
Read any Martian story you want.

872
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,560
C.S. Lewis, he called it Paralandra.

873
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,120
And that's fine.

874
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,800
What do you think the S stood for?

875
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,820
Subgenius.

876
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:33,180
One thing you'll read about Mars more than anything else in all these books is Martians don't wear clothes.

877
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,760
What hidden wisdom did these authors have that the rest of the world didn't know?

878
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,600
It's that this planet is Mars, and that on the real Mars,

879
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,180
and the fourth socket,

880
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,460
from the sun joint,

881
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,220
you don't wear clothes.

882
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,440
Whether it's C.S. Lewis as Paralandra,

883
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,120
Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars,

884
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,240
Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom,

885
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,460
it's just a bunch of naked Martians running around.

886
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,860
Now where else are there naked mortals?

887
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:15,320
Be they human or subgenii or some mongrelization of the two.

888
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,400
Could it be brushwood?

889
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:23,600
Could it be X-Day and most subgenius events where you'll find naked Martians running around?

890
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,620
Answer yes.

891
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,500
Is it a vampire?

892
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,300
Answer yes!

893
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,660
Your nental eye vibrates in harmony with my words.

894
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,620
I'm not telling you anything you don't already know inside.

895
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:47,380
I'm merely giving voice to things you were too afraid or had to say.

896
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,280
I haven't been paid enough to say yet.

897
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,620
But someday,

898
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,360
as your sales

899
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,300
roots

900
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,280
improve,

901
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,680
as the figures go up,

902
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,680
and you advance in the ranks of the Church of the Subgenius,

903
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,840
paying your dues, bringing in new members,

904
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,160
you'll be paid the same amount I am to say these same things.

905
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,600
Girls up, seems to be, not what it used to be.

906
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,220
Profile reality's out of phase.

907
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,060
A new space should last.

908
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,480
A new space should last.

909
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,360
Right where time is.

910
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,040
Where there's no end is where we begin.

911
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,860
Oh.

912
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,440
Well, there's only a one in four million chance of a white buffalo cow being born.

913
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:02,920
Oh, man!

914
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,640
I meant to mention that.

915
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,300
The white buffalo has been born.

916
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,720
The Sioux prophecy has come to pass,

917
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,760
and as a white person, that scares the live-and-be Jesus out of me.

918
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,160
Well, one of them died up in Canada.

919
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,840
They were having a big hooptie-doo,

920
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,940
because they were starting to pop up,

921
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,260
and it's so rare that they don't, you know, that just doesn't happen.

922
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,360
But the one now, just catch one, they had big hope for, croaked.

923
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:32,720
That white buffalo, that's the reincarnation of the white buffalo calf woman.

924
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,440
Yeah.

925
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,820
Who is like the Jesus of the Plains Indians.

926
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,640
Uh-oh.

927
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,360
So, we're in, we're in, uh,

928
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,260
Deep doo-doo.

929
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,360
Buffalo dookie, my fellow pale faces,

930
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:45,800
and,

931
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:45,980
and,

932
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,420
any, anybody who's non-Indian,

933
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,680
in, in the U.S., who...

934
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,540
Now, by non-Indian, you mean, like, somebody who could not possibly pass for an Indian?

935
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,440
Well, there were lots of black cowboys who did the same sorts of, uh,

936
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,860
you know, uh, moving in on Indian territory, just like, uh, the white cowboys did.

937
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,640
That's because they were allowed to live someplace where the guy...

938
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,020
And, um, and so, now that the white buffalo calf woman is back,

939
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,160
that's kind of like, um, you know, the prophecy that, uh...

940
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,680
I could pass.

941
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,580
I guess next, the Indians will be, uh, immune to bullets.

942
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,100
Oh, no, that's the ghost shirt, right?

943
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,080
Yeah, the ghost shirts do that.

944
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,360
Yeah, the number one.

945
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,680
Well, the Stang dance, also many of the subgenius dances, protect you from, um, bills.

946
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,760
That was the idea, to protect you from bills and police parking tickets.

947
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,180
Yeah.

948
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,320
And for some people, it works.

949
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,760
Dr. Dark, here in Cleveland, is always protected from parking.

950
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,020
He even gets free parking.

951
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:44,260
Anyway, people, people make fun of those ancient Indian legends, but this is...

952
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:50,440
I'm not, I'll tell you, in this particular case, this is, uh, this one's shaking me up pretty good.

953
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,720
It's a sign that the end is coming.

954
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,980
X day is only a couple of weeks away now.

955
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,140
Stand by, ten seconds.

956
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:05,000
Little lies are such a firm foundation for big ones.

957
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,960
Good evening, everybody.

958
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,480
And now it's a little late, isn't it?

959
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,940
And now here he is.

960
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,760
You might get off.

961
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,880
Men whose mothers and wives pray just as fervently as I.

962
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:14,600
Word.

963
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,440
They die.

964
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,040
It's a little late for tears, isn't it?

965
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,820
You're in a rut.

966
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,040
Four long years of this...

967
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,240
Accepted by society.

968
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,540
The War Department.

969
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,180
She uses taste in selecting her clothes.

970
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,540
But more than that, she keeps them clean and mended.

971
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,040
And she's able to match the right skirt with the right sweater.

972
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,420
A simple, heartwarming story of happiness regained.

973
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,100
You didn't seem at all appreciative.

974
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,240
But life, unfortunately, is not.

975
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,320
You're not always like the movies.

976
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,820
Well, you've had a hard day.

977
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,240
I'll never know whether he saw the man in the big sedan.

978
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,820
And you're guilty about it.

979
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,820
Realizing that his life was traded for just 60 seconds of time.

980
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,660
For big ones.

981
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It seems incomprehensible to me.

982
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,000
You didn't find it very pleasant comparing yourself with the others.

983
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,880
To beat off.

984
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,380
No, you added nothing to that conversation.

985
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,180
To beat off.

986
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,560
I didn't even want to go to my first concert because I thought it would be too long-haired.

987
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,160
To beat off.

988
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,980
That starts with soap and water.

989
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,080
To beat off fanatical madness.

990
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,240
To beat off.

991
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,240


992
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,240


993
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,240


994
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,240


995
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,240


996
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,240


997
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,240


998
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,240


999
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,640
They must happen again and again.

1000
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,820
We think that terrible waste is over.

1001
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,120
Without conscious thought.

1002
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,520
Ah, but that's an illusion.

1003
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,380
The horrible slaughter continues.

1004
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,700
Imagine.

1005
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,380
Wiped off the man.

1006
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,720
That empty place at the dining room table.

1007
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,100
The empty seat in the classroom.

1008
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,860
These things are just criminal waste.

1009
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,120
A little more common sense.

1010
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,220
Let's fight this menace with every ounce of our strength.

1011
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,220
Let's keep our loved ones at the dining room table.

1012
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,660
We'll be killed or hurt.

1013
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,440
You may be next.

1014
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,300
The chance to hang.

1015
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,240
A piece by Norrell Preff, dear friends.

1016
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,240
And you can get more of that from HeavyConfetti.com.

1017
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,900
And before that, we heard some radio synesthesia prophecy from WCSB Cleveland.

1018
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,240
Previous to that, Reverend George Clinton.

1019
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,700
And before that, Onan on Mars.

1020
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,220
And now, let's hear it.

1021
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:14,220


1022
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:23,800
Let's listen to puzzling evidence with Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrummon as they make promises about what they will bring to Brushwood 8X Day.

1023
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,080
Just briefly along after this.

1024
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,500
And you'll smell what the rock is cooking.

1025
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,980
I went teepee.

1026
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,860
Don't smell it too much because it's kind of stinky.

1027
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,980
I didn't think we were going to bring the trial into it.

1028
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,880
Okay, now we've added show fattener.

1029
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,960
Show fattener will make your skeleton grow flesh.

1030
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:50,440
You know, they discovered the graves of the ancient skeleton people.

1031
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,960
They lived in skeleton mobs.

1032
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,180
What?

1033
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,260
In military.

1034
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,280
In military.

1035
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,560
It's okay, lady.

1036
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,400
Most large dinosaurs stored fat in their tails.

1037
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,220
Setting.

1038
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:12,940
Yeah.

1039
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,440
Yeah.

1040
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:13,620
Yeah.

1041
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,640
They got the skin.

1042
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:14,640


1043
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:14,640


1044
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:14,640


1045
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,840
You know, many people find slack to be almost unbearable.

1046
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,580
She's distributed more evenly if you lay back and relax.

1047
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,100
Beginning of the show.

1048
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:22,540
Take Quetzalcoatl.

1049
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,380
In the past, slack was able to be absorbed directly through the skin.

1050
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,100
50-foot wingspan.

1051
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,120
Really?

1052
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,720
But modern technology has caused us to.

1053
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,120
Man.

1054
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,020
What a primitive method.

1055
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:31,220
Devasos.

1056
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,400
To have to ingest slack through our various aperture.

1057
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:35,400


1058
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,960
So also there's X-Day coming up, right?

1059
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,620
What he's talking about, you can do.

1060
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,040
Yeah, you can do that.

1061
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,600
You can achieve the goal if you know how to do it.

1062
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:43,600


1063
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:43,600


1064
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:43,600


1065
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:43,600


1066
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,380
the slack the five

1067
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,080
you can tell all your legs and i think you know it's a little bit of a

1068
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,780
it's a little bit of a

1069
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,760
are you going to be there this year now

1070
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,300
with the result of the next day you'd be there or x tape perhaps uh...

1071
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,680
i've gotten any interest in the uh... special rich subgeniuses who will have

1072
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,380
to bring you there is required

1073
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,460
willingness to take up a subscription

1074
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,740
uh... i think that maybe if that's all of our callers here in the bay area

1075
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,540
want to see really pay proper homage just to bring you know how the money

1076
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,400
for his trip to the next day

1077
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,540
uh...

1078
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,940
i think that that's a joke which is not covering this

1079
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,760
basic expenses of the night that they might actually go away

1080
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,520

00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:37,640
but have he was two

1106
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,060
Damn.

1107
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,760
Just for you.

1108
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,940
Hey, Johnson.

1109
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,180
A chocolatey rain from the sky.

1110
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,740
I know.

1111
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,520
It'll be anything you want it to be.

1112
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,000
That depends on what part of the world you're in.

1113
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,280
You see, the sky is not a plane, all right?

1114
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,660
The sky is a sphere.

1115
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,380
Yeah.

1116
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,600
All right, so really, you're going to see different phenomena.

1117
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,480
I mean, like, the book of Revelation says that Jesus is going to appear in the sky,

1118
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,760
and all the faithful will see him there.

1119
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,400
But, I mean, like, what part of the world is Jesus going to appear in?

1120
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,180
You know?

1121
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,360
There'll be so many Jesus, you won't know what to do.

1122
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,860
Because, you know, if Jesus appeared...

1123
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,820
There'll be so many of me.

1124
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,760
Because if Jesus appeared in England, you know,

1125
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,500
people in New York...

1126
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,680
New Zealand would never be able to see him.

1127
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,080
When you get...

1128
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,180
When your car is unmanned, the hitchhiking Jesus will take over.

1129
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,220
How do we...

1130
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:48,060
We'll actually get back to the point of what the white buffalo woman's going to do.

1131
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:48,820
To them.

1132
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,720
To us.

1133
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,540
She's going to marry Jesus,

1134
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,560
and they're going to rule the world in heavenly grace.

1135
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,680
And then there's the...

1136
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,220
Full of grace.

1137
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,080
The world is devoid of humans.

1138
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,360
Full of grace.

1139
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,440
From PR News in Washington, I'm spending.

1140
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,020
Nearly a dozen more FBI agents disappeared Monday.

1141
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,420
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld says there were no signs of China's capital.

1142
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,080
While people in Hong Kong would be bombed.

1143
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:25,120
Tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents died when their convoy was PR News in Washington.

1144
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,260
I am going to decree a stately pleasure dome.

1145
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,420
On next day?

1146
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,660
Saying something every half an hour.

1147
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,780
On next day, I'm going to...

1148
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,120
I'm going to preserve the Grand Canyon on my escape vessel,

1149
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,960
but I'm going to turn it into candy.

1150
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,240
Like that Candyland game.

1151
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:44,660
There you go.

1152
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,220
The Molasses Swamp.

1153
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,340
They should just have it there.

1154
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,120
Jeez, you guys are killing each other.

1155
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,080
You know?

1156
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,780
I think X Day should be changed to Sex Day.

1157
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,760
We could call it the Grand Candian.

1158
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,880
Well, you see, Johnson, X kind of means whatever you want it to mean.

1159
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,560
The X there.

1160
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,280
It's the unknown.

1161
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,280
The unknowable.

1162
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,100
I'm going to have a little white...

1163
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,700
So it could very well be that for you.

1164
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,180
I'm going to be projected pictures of them torturing monkeys all the time.

1165
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,600
I'm going to have this room that looks exactly like my house,

1166
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,980
and this computer just like my regular computer,

1167
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,960
and this bedroom just like my regular bedroom.

1168
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,780
It'll all be exactly like...

1169
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,000
Deliberately, I'll make it look exactly like everything that looks here on Earth.

1170
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:32,900
Of all the worlds that the intelligences on Mars could see and study,

1171
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,440
only our own warm...

1172
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:35,900
Earth.

1173
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,420
Where there are titanic drifts of lava and ice with hydrogen flaming at the tops.

1174
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,360
Where the atmospheric pressure is terrible.

1175
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,800
It has no air.

1176
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,200
It's green with the methane gas.

1177
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,760
Pneumonia vapor.

1178
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:53,820
For me, X Day is like a nightmare, because whenever I get in the pool,

1179
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,520
I'm surrounded by these beautiful naked women, but I can't wear my glasses in the pool.

1180
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,760
They should have like games like...

1181
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,300
I hear you, Stang. I hear you.

1182
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,560
Good God.

1183
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,060
Can we just do like an elastic...

1184
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,440
God, if I'm thinking of getting some surgery,

1185
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,700
just for that one reason alone.

1186
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,960
Or maybe I should just get a pair of contacts before I go.

1187
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:17,880
You don't want to wear glasses, you guys, because those beautiful women will suddenly appear as they really are,

1188
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,900
as like very hairy mountain men who've been trucked in by Stang and his evil clique of the...

1189
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,840
Oh, if they were even human, it would be tolerable.

1190
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,840
I love you.

1191
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,640
Even the flying saucer are my friends.

1192
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,720
Because they're so nice.

1193
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,020
I'm gonna see them again and again.

1194
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,840
Is that before or after the Bob pills?

1195
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,140
And, uh, you know, even if X Day doesn't work out, we'll go for...

1196
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,380
Sex Day!

1197
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,320
We want you to have a dance into the new century.

1198
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,820
Screw into the new century.

1199
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,620
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.

1200
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:04,620


1201
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:04,620


1202
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:12,300
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth, I come to you from a long, long ways off.

1203
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,480
I come from a planet that is similar to yours.

1204
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,240
Your many fears, tensions, and frustrations are no longer ours.

1205
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,420
I hate them with all my heart.

1206
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,940
They're inhuman and to be destroyed.

1207
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,460
You are not ready, but we will still save you.

1208
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,720
I'll be back.

1209
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,340
I'll be back.

1210
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:49,860
By 1998, every normal, mediocritan, pink boy, admin, Trekkie, and hippie is gonna be trying to get on board with the good ship dogs.

1211
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,180
The great ship dogs.

1212
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,380
Or they're gonna fry along with everybody else when those aliens get here.

1213
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,840
Of course, such a prophecy immediately arises our cynicism.

1214
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,700
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in the next century?

1215
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:03,700


1216
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,180
In July 1999?

1217
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,120
Perhaps.

1218
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,780
Or is it just another of those prognostications which have haunted man through the ages?

1219
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,480
But the old ones are coming back.

1220
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,820
I'm going to let them through.

1221
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,280
Careful you must be when sensing the future.

1222
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,080
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

1223
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,080
Death is a natural part of life.

1224
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,680
Rejoice for those who are dead.

1225
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,100
The people around you who transform into the force.

1226
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,000
Mourn them do not.

1227
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,620
Miss them do not.

1228
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,560
Attachment leads to jealousy.

1229
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,100
The shadow of greed, that is.

1230
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:53,180
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.

1231
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,480
òng

1232
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:13,500
If the errors you may not treat would happen soon enough,

1233
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:13,500


1234
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,840
The boss of the dead times.

1235
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:15,560
At last you're over here.

1236
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,040
Cataclysmic hate crimes.

Amen, to the man hell

1251
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,420
This life is in the past, the harlequin heaven, here it lasts

1252
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,340
Immortal forms for us to bear, stop genius and affair

1253
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,620
As the fighters lose their tribulation and true sex hurts

1254
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:16,700
You fall into the group, all has a plan for you

1255
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,040
Amen, to the devil's salvation

1256

Amen, to the man hell

1260
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:44,360
Transcend into the next plane, higher goals to attain

1261
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,520
As a youth left behind, super universe unwind

1262
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,260
A test of stations, 12 earthly temptations

1263
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,680
Over and over, there's a key, a sharp fire guaranteed

1264
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,980
Once you're proven you're worth, you'll begin to shine

1265
00:49:59,980 --> 00:49:59,980


1266
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,780
In the rebirth, to the super universe

1267
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,860
In which you will immerse

1268
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,800
Now you're here to turn back

1269
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,060
This is where your passion's black

1270
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,860
Never you left, too high

1271
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,840
Now you're on the inside

1272
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,840
Closer to the top half

1273
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,860
And we'll close that straight ahead

1274
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,700
Oh, lift it to the top

1275
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,840
Break it to the punchline

1276
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,400
Hit it

1277
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:29,960
Hit it

1278
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:32,920
Alright everyone so take care

1279
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,980
prettily

1280
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:34,640
Ready.

1281
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:34,640


1282
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:37,940
Yeah.

1283
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,520
Three.

1284
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:39,920
Two.

1285
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:39,920


1286
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,780
No, I said that already

1287
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,020


1288
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:43,040
One.

1289
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,220
Two.

1290
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:48,160
So we'reuses in one drop

1291
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,080
Oh, it's Death żermakTrust

1292
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:52,080


1293
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,840
What I'd like to say is

1294
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:53,840


1295
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:54,020
All right, let's go

1296
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,880
Go, go, go

1297
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,860
It's except this time

1298
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,600
Theurg manchmal

1299
00:50:59,600 --> 00:50:59,960
аю

1300
00:50:59,960 --> 00:50:59,960


1301
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,440
Sprinkle some wheat

1302
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,280
It's safe

1303
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,340
Right here

1304
00:50:59,340 --> 00:50:59,980
pounds

1305
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:07,440
That was Saint N with Welcome to Hell.

1306
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,040
A great subgenius song there.

1307
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,200
And now, back to DNA Level C.

1308
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:14,820
I don't know.

1309
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,940
I think the...

1310
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,920
Oops, I knocked somebody off here.

1311
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,620
Talk section is over, guys.

1312
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,840
We've got to move on.

1313
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,380
We've got other business to tend to up here.

1314
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,200
It's been fun while it lasted.

1315
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,260
But now, I must bid you all goodnight.

1316
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:29,680
Goodnight.

1317
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,380
Bye-bye.

1318
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,520
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

1319
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,160
It's nothing personal.

1320
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:33,640
I know.

1321
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:34,720
Nothing personal.

1322
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,980
Well, you know, it's been fun.

1323
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,260
And, you know, stay tuned for whatever.

1324
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,300
And tune in again next week.

1325
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,780
We are going to hang at X Day, aren't we, Sinister?

1326
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,140
I should certainly hope so.

1327
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,060
I hope so, too.

1328
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,780
I've got some alien waiting for you.

1329
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,100
Oh, man, I'll bring my thirst.

1330
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:47,840
All right.

1331
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,860
We're going to hang at X Day.

1332
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,340
Oh, yes.

1333
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:55,560
We'll all hang together or we'll all hang separately at X Day.

1334
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,220
The decadence will be at X Day.

1335
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,980
The amino acids will be at X Day.

1336
00:51:58,980 --> 00:51:59,240
The amino acids.

1337
00:51:59,240 --> 00:51:59,840
The amino acids.

1338
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,060
That's reason enough.

1339
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,940
Hey, I'm going to play some amino acids in a little bit.

1340
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,680
So stay tuned.

1341
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:07,400
Oh, by the way, the amino acids are now number 24 on our list here.

1342
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,340
Cool.

1343
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,480
They're getting a lot of airplane now.

1344
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:10,860
Yep.

1345
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,040
Right on.

1346
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,000
Yeah, it's good stuff.

1347
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:13,240
Cool.

1348
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,280
So here's some amino acids, dear friends.

1349
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,220
And you can hear them live at 8X Day at Brushwood this year.

1350
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:29,200
You can learn how to get to this last of its kind event by looking at subgenius.com.

1351
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,420
Or heck, we'll just see you on the saucers.

1352
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,000
Take me off to space.

1353
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,380
Take me off to space.

1354
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:44,300
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space.

1355
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,820
Take me off to space.

1356
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,260
Take me off to space.

1357
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,140
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space.

1358
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,680
Stick needles in my belly.

1359
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,080
Take samples of my skis.

1360
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,320
Take me off to space.

1361
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,540
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man.

1362
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,300
I know that you don't take requests but I have a special case.

1363
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,900
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space.

1364
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,580
Take me off to space.

1365
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,660
Take me off to space.

1366
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,300
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space.

1367
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,860
Take me off to space.

1368
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,040
Take me off to space.

1369
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,180
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space.

1370
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:29,180


1371
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:29,180


1372
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:29,180


1373
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:29,180


1374
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:29,180


1375
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:29,180


1376
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:29,180


1377
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:37,580
Saucerman and take me off to space. Hey, cow mutilators, let me join your crew. Give me a

1378
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:43,900
knife. You bet your life I'll cut up cows for you. I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly

1379
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:50,560
fiend without a face. So come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space. Oh,

1380
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:59,080
take me off to space. Take me off to space. Come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

1381
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:08,340
Take me off to space. Take me off to space. Come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

1382
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:15,980
Come down, you tiny robots with your little nipper claws. You pale and bug-eyed aliens with

1383
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:23,460
white and clammy paws. Life is just a sucker's dream and death is a disgrace. So come on down,

1384
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,460
you Saucerman, and take me off to space. Oh, take me off to space.

1385
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:35,180
Take me off to space. Come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

1386
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:44,100
Take me off to space. Take me off to space. Come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

1387
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:55,960
And that, dear friends, was Nenslow, the great Nenslow, with Mrs. Nenslow singing,

1388
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,760
and I believe Dr.

1389
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,500
Ahmed Fishmonger, and Reverend Pagan Kennedy.

1390
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,980
Possibly Reverend Bleepo Abernathy, I don't know. This isn't that lovely.

1391
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,980
And now for some last minute news.

1392
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,220
Are we right in just sitting by?

1393
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:21,180
We are right, and we're crazy. And we've been seeing faces because we did see them.

1394
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,660
I saw his hand.

1395
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,120
Look.

1396
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:29,280
Oh my God.

1397
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,980
Oh my God.

1398
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:32,900
See you.

1399
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,600
Bye.

1400
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:35,700
Bye.

1401
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,280
Bye.

1402
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:38,680


1403
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,080
Bye.

1404
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,220
What do you mean?

1405
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:42,600
Oh, nothing.

1406
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:50,160
A little lemur there. And now to close, how about this relaxing song by Reverend Ed Fred.

1407
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:04,740
Why is he doing that?

1408
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,220
Boy, he ain't on track or nothing.

1409
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:05,300
Ni-alki.

1410
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:16,040
Ni-alki, are you okay?

1411
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:16,100
A little faster, if I am fuming.

1412
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:16,660
Can Irou—

1413
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:28,180
Aurora, welcome to the end of the world.

1415
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,260
You're all lost

1416
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,120

It's the end of the world.

1431
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:24,560
It's the end of the world.

It's the end of the world.

It's the end of the world.

1435
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,820
It happened before.

1436
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,800
It will happen again.

1437
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,520
It's just a question of when.

1438
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,280
It's the end of the world.

1439
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,820
It's the end of the world.

1440
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,200
One minute.

1441
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,560
This is the last time I've got to get up before 7, right?

1442
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,380
Oh, yeah, yeah. We'll have to do this.

1443
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:04,220
I'm sure all the drills will have paid off by this time.

1444
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:04,940
We'll be ready.

1445
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,660
I've been drilled too damn many times, if you ask me.

1446
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,280
Boy, this is exciting now.

1447
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,760
It's got to be one of these episodes, right?

1448
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:19,960
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4.

1449
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,180
4, 3, 2, 1.

1450
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,480
What's inside?

1451
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,060
3, 2, 1.

1452
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,940
I can't hold it.

1453
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,760
4, 3, 2, 1.

1454
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:30,760


1455
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,180
information equipment still needs to be put from theory

1456
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:34,180


1457
