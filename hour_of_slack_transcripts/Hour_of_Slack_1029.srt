1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:18,720
Well, I saw the thing coming out of the sky, but a one long horn and one big eye, like a Mr. Shakin' in the city. It looks like a subgenius, our old son.

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:38,120
The predicament of man forced to live in a barren, godless eternity, like a tiny flame flickering in an immense void with nothing but waste, horror, and degradation, forming a useless, bleak, straight jacket in a black, absurd cosmos.

3
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,440
Thank you, Bob.

4
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,180
Uh, yes, yes, yes, dear friends.

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,600
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 13.

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:01:02,640
1029, which is brought to you this time entirely by Reverend Susie the Floozy and WREK, the greatest station in Atlanta, Georgia, which happens to be at Georgia Tech.

7
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:18,460
Now, some of you may remember Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans and the insanely late, wrong, and insufficient actions by FEMA and the completely unqualified George Bush.

8
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:18,700
For those of you who don't know, I'm George Bush.

9
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,060
I'm one of the frat mates who run it.

10
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,860
We did our subgenius take on that debacle when it happened, and so did Reverend Susie the Floozy.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,080
Bob, howdy, did she?

12
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:43,420
In fact, she did four episodes of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse on Hurricane Katrina in her truly inimitable media barrage style, starting now.

13
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,120
When my bad dream came to me.

14
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,600
Piercing the future.

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,080
The future's bail right through.

16
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,080
Our theme this year is Louisiana, where the fun begins.

17
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,520
And old man Reverend?

18
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,660
Well, he helps carry that fun throughout the state.

19
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,620
Yes, from the mouth of the Mississippi at the Gulf of Mexico to the Delta region.

20
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,640
Louisiana.

21
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,700
Louisiana's got fun.

22
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,040
And fun people.

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,800
Like in the mouth of the river.

24
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,040
We've got probably the most fun people of the state.

25
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:44,080
Denizens of New Orleans' lower depths, its back streets, its out-of-the-way neighborhoods, its odd speech, its ethnic whites, incredibly true-to-life dialogue, and the zaniest series of high and low comic adventures.

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,180
Oh, what in heaven's name is he talking about?

27
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,360
In such poor taste.

28
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,620
This is making me so nervous.

29
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:48,760
I'm so depressed.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,360
Oh, man.

31
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:49,900
Cheer up.

32
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,180
The world's going to end in ten minutes anyway.

33
00:02:51,700 --> 00:03:00,720
Long before the Superdome, where the saints of football play, lived a city.

34
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,140
The city.

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,860
Way down, down in New Orleans.

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,380
In the land of those creatures.

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,960
Oh, there's a garden of Eden.

38
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,240
Do you know what?

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,820
I mean

40
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,080
Creole baby with flashing

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,740
eyes

42
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,760
Softly whisper with tender sighs

43
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,800
And then you stop

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,140
Won't you give your lady

45
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,380
a little smile

46
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,980
And then you stop

47
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,960
You bet your life you'll

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,420
give her a little

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,500
ah ah ah

50
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,100
Never ever ride it on

51
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,300
with a beautiful

52
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,060
dream

53
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,840
Way down yonder in

54
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,640
New Orleans

55
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,600
Alright boys let's go

56
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,460
Let's go

57
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,600
Ah ah ah

58
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,060
Ah ah ah

59
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,840
Ah ah ah

60
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,940
Ah ah ah

61
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,360
Ah ah ah

62
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,320
Ah ah ah

63
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,920
Ah ah ah

64
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:12,920
Ah ah ah

65
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,740
And then you stop

66
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,820
Won't you give your lady

67
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,400
a little smile

68
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,040
And then you stop

69
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,080
You bet your life you'll

70
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,840
give her a little

71
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,160
ah ah ah

72
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,220
Never ever ride it on

73
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,440
with a beautiful

74
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,180
dream

75
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,040
Way down yonder in

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,780
New Orleans

77
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,740
New Orleans is, on the other hand,

78
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,700
a comfortable metropolis which,

79
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,920
as a certain apathy and stagnation,

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,120
which I find inoffensive.

81
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,080
At least its climate is mild.

82
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,160
I think not.

83
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,680
Why?

84
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,980
Hurricane winds can toss debris

85
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,960
that will shatter even well-protected doors and windows.

86
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,740
You should expect winds of 74 miles an hour or greater

87
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,520
or dangerously high water and storm surges.

88
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,860
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.

89
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,440
Cheers.

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,520
The witness made a drinky, drinky motion.

91
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,400
As far as the natural threat from natural disasters, from hurricanes,

92
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,380
we sort of push that to the side and say,

93
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,980
well, didn't happen last year.

94
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,980
You know, it didn't happen the year before,

95
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,400
so maybe we'll slip by again.

96
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:25,940
Oh yeah?

97
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,140
That's what you think.

98
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,940
I think not.

99
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,440
Look, I don't know what the hell your point is.

100
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,040
To defend against the tide that rushes in on them,

101
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,020
construct a bowler to drive the sea from land.

102
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,280
What the hell are you talking about?

103
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,720
Whack him.

104
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,000
All right, mighty man.

105
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,220
Whatever you say, pal.

106
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,640
Move right along here.

107
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,940
The money was in place.

108
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,380
The money was in place.

109
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,140
But now, because of the issues of Homeland Security,

110
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,940
that money has been diverted.

111
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,160
The project has been postponed.

112
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,820
We don't know when it will be completed, if ever.

113
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,940
This move was predictable.

114
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,320
In the same manner, those banks were made.

115
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,320
Anything for a buck.

116
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,300
Well absorbed.

117
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,140
The one who built them did not make them as high or thick,

118
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,060
whoever he was.

119
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,800
Why, what a marvel.

120
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,540
So that's very, very frustrating to have to deal with that.

121
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,920
I only hope there's no leak.

122
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,440
Oh, my.

123
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,280
The river, old man river, don't say nothing.

124
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,020
He must know something.

125
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,300
Old man river keeps on rolling along.

126
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,160
The Mississippi River is famed in atrocious song and verse.

127
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,660
The most prevalent motif is one which

128
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,220
attempts to make of the river an ersatz father figure.

129
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,020
Actually, the Mississippi River is a treacherous and sinister

130
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,600
body of water whose eddies and currents yearly claim many lives.

131
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,280
I have never known anyone who would even venture to stick his

132
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,980
toe in its polluted brown waters, which seethes with sewage,

133
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,380
industrial wastes, and deadly insecticides.

134
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,480
Even the fish are dying.

135
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,560
Therefore, the Mississippi, as father God, Moses, daddy,

136
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,620
phallus pops, is an altogether false motif, begun, I would

137
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,340
imagine, by that dreary fraud, Mark Twain.

138
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,300
So look out for me.

139
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,820
Oh, my.

140
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,340
I'm a dirty water.

141
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,940
You're Mr. Freeze.

142
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,060
Hockey-bound wise.

143
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,840
And I gotta need more noise on this ship.

144
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,840
And I gotta need to climb up on your back and ride.

145
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,100
Got a problem?

146
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,380
Where's Uncle George?

147
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh, Uncle George.

148
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh, he's in the den typing.

149
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,300
Why don't you run in and say hello to him, but don't disturb him.

150
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,240
We won't.

151
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:40,960
All right.

152
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,620
And so we're constantly, um.

153
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,000
George was pasting the article.

154
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,960
And the junior achievement scrapbook that was one of his mementos from his last semester

155
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,440
at school.

156
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,660
George's mother, on the other side of the living room, hopefully watched her son work

157
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,660
on his school scrapbook.

158
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,880
She and his father didn't seem to be able to do anything with him.

159
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,240
Palestine.

160
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:02,860
Palestine.

161
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,620
No.

162
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,260
No.

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,740
What chance did a boy without a high school education have nowadays?

164
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,060
What could he do?

165
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,880
Depends on how far a man wants to go for a couple of million dollars.

166
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,000
And he's a good guy.

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000


169
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,280
And, um.

170
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,940
Ask the president.

171
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,080
There was something funny about the whole business.

172
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,200
You just can't shake that off.

173
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,260
Not a couple of million.

174
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,380
I mean, that is big.

175
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,500
That is not nothing.

176
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,420
Maybe there's no oil there at all.

177
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,120
Yeah?

178
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,440
That's what you think.

179
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,000
Here's the tape from the seismograph.

180
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,300
Holy smokes!

181
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,840
The oscillation of this line proves that there's definitely oil there.

182
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,840
And a lot of it.

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,240
Meaning?

184
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,420
Ask the president.

185
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,620
Gosh, you're a duck.

186
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,740
I'm gonna try to keep forgetting those.

187
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,700
We've got to get our act together.

188
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:44,980
We've got to get our act together.

189
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:44,980


190
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:44,980


191
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:44,980


192
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:44,980


193
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,840
I'm thrilled and honored.

194
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,400
That's my boy!

195
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:59,560
The choicest iron comprises his head, but the right foot of clay, on it, more weight

196
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,960
than on the left is pressed.

197
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,400
Sign here.

198
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,540
He picked up a black fountain pen from his blotter and affixed his signature to the bottom

199
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,140
of the document.

200
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,840
Get it?

201
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,380
Yeah!

202
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,140
Woo!

203
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,980
Now the fun begins.

204
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,960
This is the siren, but the siren is actually more powerful than the siren.

205
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:14,960


206
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:14,960


207
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:14,960


208
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:14,960


209
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,140
The right foot bears a crack, a fissure dripping tears.

210
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,100
The final hour is approaching for the people of Earth.

211
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,880
That's great.

212
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,840
Give it to me.

213
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,260
Great.

214
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,260
I can take it.

215
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,880
They said the government triggered the wetlands crisis when it tamed the Mississippi River.

216
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:32,260
Yeah?

217
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,580
Yeah.

218
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:32,960
Sure.

219
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,540
Yeah, right.

220
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,200
Now they want to unleash the river to undo the damage.

221
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,860
What?

222
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,300
No.

223
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,440
Isn't that wonderful?

224
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,040
No.

225
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,360
Eyes are tight, everybody.

226
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,800
No fault.

227
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,540
It's science run amok.

228
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,380
The propagation of such a weird, fantastic, and impractical plan as concentrated by the

229
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,640
defendant is capable of formatting a disturbance for which the company may have to recover.

230
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,000
Whatever.

231
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,640
It is our duty to stop it.

232
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,140
What do you mean?

233
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,120
How do we know that?

234
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,780
It's terrible.

235
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:08,240
Meanwhile, far below the Earth's surface, everything was quiet and kind of peaceful-like.

236
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,980
What's that?

237
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,900
My God.

238
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,280
What is that?

239
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,160
What?

240
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,060
It's awesome.

241
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,460
Just speaking the vernacular of the passenger, it's a storm-blower-lubber-whopper.

242
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,300
Hurricanes bring high winds that can damage property.

243
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,440
Bring in lawn furniture, toys, and garden tools.

244
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,540
If you can't bring them indoors, anchor them to a permanent fixture so they don't blow away and cause even more damage.

245
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,820
Ooh, I better go take down the manger seat.

246
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,620
If baby Jesus got loose, he could really do some damage.

247
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,940
Hey, hey, look at that.

248
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,860
Oh.

249
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,380
Oh.

250
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,100
Oh.

251
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:39,300


252
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:39,700


253
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:39,700


254
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:39,700


255
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:39,940
Oh.

256
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,060
Oh.

257
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,740
Oh.

258
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:40,960


259
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,260
Oh.

260
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:41,560
Oh.

261
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:41,580
Oh.

262
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:41,980
Oh.

263
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,080
Oh.

264
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,280
Oh.

265
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,280


266
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,080
Oh.

267
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,280


268
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,320


269
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,320


270
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,320


271
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:43,720
Oh.

272
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:43,720


273
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:43,720


274
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,660
Oh.

275
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,700
Oh.

276
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,200
Oh.

277
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,740
Oh.

278
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,500
Oh.

279
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,140
Oh.

280
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:06,700
Oh.

281
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,360
It's gonna rain today

282
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,160
Cause you just walked away

283
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,020
The clouds are here and soon

284
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,400
The rain will fall

285
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,820
And the rain that falls today

286
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,420
Will wash my world away

287
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:50,420
And this will be the biggest storm of all

288
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,800
On the day that I first met you

289
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,700
I thought

290
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,060
I thought my love would change

291
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,380
Your shining face

292
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,740
Turned all the clouds away

293
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,840
Now as I sit crying

294
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,220
The clouds are back again

295
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,740
Today is gonna be

296
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,100
A rainy day

297
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,700
It's gonna rain today

298
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,440
Cause you just walked away

299
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,240
The clouds are here and soon

300
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,860
The rain will fall

301
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,100
And the rain that falls today

302
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,740
Will wash my world away

303
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,680
And this will be the biggest storm of all

304
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,760
And this will be the biggest storm of all

305
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:22,060
And this will be the biggest storm of all

306
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,860
And this will be the biggest storm of all

307
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,700
And this will be the biggest storm of all

308
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,100
You gotta be here soon

309
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,600
He was probably quaffing a liquid lunch

310
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,960
In one of the many taverns

311
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,280
In the vicinity of our organization

312
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,580
There is a bar on every corner in the neighborhood

313
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,400
An indication that salaries

314
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,320
In the area are abysmally low

315
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,500
On particularly desperate blocks

316
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,100
There are three or four bars

317
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,020
At every intersection

318
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
Muscle relaxed

319
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,240
And quickly pleased

320
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,260
The world's about to end

321
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
Oh, yes sir

322
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,340
Nice weather for you

323
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,880
Last orders please

324
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,240
This failure to make contact with reality

325
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,820
Is however characteristic

326
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,500
Of almost all of America's art

327
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,420
Any connection between American art

328
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,360
And American nature

329
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,740
Is purely coincidental

330
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,300
But this is only because

331
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,480
The nation as a whole

332
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,000
Has no contact with reality

333
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,800
That is only one of the reasons

334
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,000
Why I have always been forced to exist

335
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,280
On the fringes of its society

336
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,160
Consigned to the limbo

337
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,200
Reserved for those who do know reality

338
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,260
When they see it

339
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,800
Plan ahead to survive the next hurricane

340
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,120
A hurricane watch is issued

341
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,740
When there is a threat of hurricane conditions

342
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,900
Within a 24 to 36 hour period

343
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,420
You may still have time to take precautions

344
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,400
If there is a hurricane warning

345
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,960
You may be advised to evacuate the area

346
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,660
Make sure that there is plenty of fuel in your car

347
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,320
If you are advised to evacuate

348
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,440
You may have to drive up to 50 miles

349
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,320
To reach safety

350
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,340
Check the contents of your emergency supply kit

351
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,120
And fill plastic water bottles

352
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,800
With one gallon of fresh water

353
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,900
Per person per day

354
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,340
Look I've spilled my martini

355
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,580
On my most priceless jacket

356
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,240
This party stinks

357
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,580
Let's go to a smart bar

358
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,340
Where is my coat?

359
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,720
Let's go to a smart bar

360
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,040
This is making me so depressed

361
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,220
Let's go to a smart bar

362
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,500
Let's go to San Francisco

363
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,460
Oh what in heaven's name is this?

364
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,220
What in heaven's name is he talking about?

365
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:08,780
Mike!

366
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,260
Adios!

367
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,000
Hasta luego!

368
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,720
Sayonara!

369
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,500
Gotta get out of hell

370
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,840
Gotta get out of hell

371
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,160
Gotta get out of hell

372
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,340
Gotta get out of hell

373
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,200
What's the best way out of here?

374
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,280
The best way

375
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,740
Come on let's get out of here

376
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,740
Oh no you won't

377
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,600
You're gonna stay here

378
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,760
He really didn't have enough money to go anywhere

379
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,880
Oh dad

380
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,420
The best thing was to stay at home for a while

381
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,960
I gotta get out of here

382
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,460
Gotta get out of here

383
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,700
Gotta get out of here

384
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,840
Gotta get out of here

385
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,780
Gotta get out of here

386
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,940
The Greyhound bus line is sufficiently menacing to make me accept my status quo

387
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,080
And I am certainly not perverse enough to attempt air travel even if I were able to afford it

388
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,540
Actually even riding in a car affects me enough

389
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,080
Of course the worst thing is riding on top in one of those Greyhound scenic cruises

390
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,620
So high up

391
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,680
I vomited several times

392
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,520
Oh no!

393
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,660
Oh no!

394
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,140
Oh no!

395
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,420
Oh no!

396
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:07,680
Oh no!

397
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,320
Oh no!

398
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,200
Oh no!

399
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,900
Oh no!

400
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:10,900


401
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:10,900


402
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:10,900


403
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,620
I shall not leave

404
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,380
No one can deter me

405
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh no!

406
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,800
Oh no!

407
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:14,800


408
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,380
Get out of my trailer I won't get out

409
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,440
Gotta get out of here

410
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,400
Gotta get out of here

411
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,280
Gotta get out of here

412
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,720
Gotta get out of here

413
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,820
Load up that Land Rover in the garage

414
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,000
Pick up Dutch and the kids and head for the hill

415
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,680
Yeah

416
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,420
Oh my

417
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,720
You really know me

418
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,640
Oh no

419
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:28,840
Oh no

420
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh no

421
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,260
I think I'll go pick up the stuff for you

422
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,220
You crazy bitch

423
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,180
Where you going with that suitcase in your hand?

424
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,320
Oh no!

425
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,420
Don't you know more than some of what we play?

426
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,900
Where you going with that suitcase in your hand?

427
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,740
Hey!

428
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,200
Hey!

429
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:46,380


430
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:46,820
Hey!

431
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,680
It's full of money

432
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,440
It's full of change

433
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,420
You're never making it outside

434
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,560
Everyone's strange

435
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,960
Where you going with that suitcase in your hand?

436
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,040
Hey!

437
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,100
Hey!

438
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,320
Hey!

439
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,600
Everyone is chained to their honey

440
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,840
Everyone is chained to their honey

441
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,060
Hey!

442
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,060


443
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,120
Everyone is chained to their honey

444
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,040
I said I

445
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,000
I

446
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,020
Oh yeah

447
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,660
I've got a Porsche

448
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,560
Get the hell out of there

449
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,380
Oh yeah

450
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,960
I said I was going to pick up the stuff for you

451
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,260
I'm awesome

452
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,260


453
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,260


454
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,100
Because it's stormy Monday

455
00:17:53,100 --> 00:18:00,240
And two-s-day just as bad

456
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,020
The cold, it's stormy Monday

457
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,380
It's a twister! It's a twister!

458
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,900
I am where all light is mute

459
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,080
With a bellowing like the ocean

460
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,720
Turbulent in a storm of warring winds

461
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,620
The hurricane of hell in perpetual motion

462
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,600
Sweeping the ravaged spirits

463
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,540
As it rends, twists, and torments them

464
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,340
I saw souls come uttering cries

465
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,660
Wind-tossed and lofted by the storm

466
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,160
Master, I cried, who are these people

467
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,860
By black air oppressed?

468
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,940
The answer is floating away

469
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,080
Oh, this is terrible.

470
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,180
Terrible?

471
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,520
Look over there at that wrecked fuselage.

472
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,520
What wasn't smashed seems to have been burned.

473
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,960
Yes, it's no use.

474
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,420
Not even a clue the size of a pea.

475
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,960
We wanted to examine the wreckage, but some tough guy wouldn't let us go near it.

476
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,780
Well, why didn't you show him your credential, Kay?

477
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,780
I did, but he said there might be an explosion.

478
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,560
Why, there couldn't be any possibility of an explosion now.

479
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,880
When will they learn?

480
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,660
Oh, God, I've been misinformed.

481
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,820
Jim, get up.

482
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,680
They're after us.

483
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,720
We ain't got a minute to lose.

484
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,780
I ain't got all the provisions of war yet.

485
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,520
Forget that.

486
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,100
Just shovel out and I'll lay into that pole, Jim.

487
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,540
This is happening way too fast.

488
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,180
And half.

489
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,600
Look out for me, oh, muddy water.

490
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,200
Your mysteries are deep and wide.

491
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,440
And I got a need for going someplace.

492
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,700
And I got a need to climb apart.

493
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,020
Go back and ride.

494
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,500
Looking up, he saw the Mississippi beginning to descend over the foot of Canal Street.

495
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,360
Oh, Jesus, when are you going to cut me some slack, huh?

496
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:22,160
The question that the world is asking right now, why did God let this happen?

497
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,480
God can use nature.

498
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,440
He can use the elements he has in the past.

499
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,160
And he can.

500
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,480
We read newspapers of catastrophes that have taken place in the world.

501
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,640
And a hurricane comes and sweeps a town or a city off of the face of the earth.

502
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,500
Doors die.

503
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,440
God shatters cities.

504
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,540
Buildings crumble.

505
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,800
And the earth opens up and swallows humanity.

506
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,180
And the newspapers and the news media calls it an act of Satan.

507
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,980
The terrible storms that rip through this planet earth and cause so much destruction.

508
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,860
Has it ever entered your mind?

509
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,600
Has it ever entered your mind?

510
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Well, why do people die, Brother Swagger?

511
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,280
They die because of the evil from God, Prince of the Powers of the Air?

512
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,460
He steals, he kills, he destroys.

513
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,080
God is a death-god.

514
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
That's the kind of God he is.

515
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,300
Stop and think a moment!

516
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,160
God is the despot.

517
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,300
God is the dictator.

518
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,660
God is the fast gun riding at high noon wearing a black hat.

519
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,520
God is the Internet.

520
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,600
If it keeps on raining, the levee's gonna break.

521
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,580
If it keeps on raining, the levee's gonna break.

522
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,060
But when the levee breaks, we got no place to stay.

523
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,540
You think of God and there is an acid taste on your tongue

524
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,320
because you see him as arbitrarily reaching down without thought

525
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,860
and snatching something away that means more to you than anything in the world.

526
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,220
The mean old levee talking to weep and moan.

527
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,800
The mean old levee talking to weep and moan.

528
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,380
You know what God would have tasted to make a mountain out of his home.

529
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,780
Oh well, oh well, oh well.

530
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,880
How many of you have thought those things?

531
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,340
How many of you the television that's been in your mind gets turned to off?

532
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,040
Deep down inside the question rooms it eats like bitter bread.

533
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,780
Jesus, what kind of God is that?

534
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,780
Who would want to serve him?

535
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,080
Because God is a killer.

536
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,840
God is a destructor.

537
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,120
He's a destroyer.

538
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,960
He is long-suffering, not willing to end as you've been left alive.

539
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,460
Oh, don't it make you feel bad when you try to find your way?

540
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,000
And you don't know which way to go.

541
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,180
Oh, when you're going down south and there's no one to give you.

542
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,220
So you go down to Tupelo.

543
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,960
Yo, yo, Chicago.

544
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,920
Yo, yo, Tupelo.

545
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,220
God loves the caskets as much as we do.

546
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,520
God loves...

547
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,480
God loves the tombstones in the cemeteries as much as we do.

548
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
Well, crying won't help you.

549
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,580
Well, praying won't do you no good.

550
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,880
Well, crying won't help you.

551
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,120
Well, praying won't do you no good.

552
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,540
Because when the levee breaks, Mama, you've got to move.

553
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,420
Oh, last night I sat on the levee and moaned.

554
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,520
Oh, last night I sat on the levee and moaned.

555
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:09,200
Oh, thinking of my baby and my happy home.

556
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,900
You're going to Tupelo.

557
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:26,520
Tupelo town, baby tupelo town.

558
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:26,520


559
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:26,520


560
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:26,520


561
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:26,520


562
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,980
I'm gonna take you down to the way, baby

563
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,220
I'm going down

564
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,880
I'm going down, down

565
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm going down, I'm going down

566
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
I'm going down, I'm going down

567
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
I'm going down the city

568
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,720
To the world, sir

569
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,760
It's an emergency!

570
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,960
Everything was going wrong.

571
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,620
We had a storm, but then before we could come in

572
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,260
and begin the rescue effort and the evacuation effort,

573
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,460
we had a second catastrophe.

574
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,340
That was the levee breaking and the flood coming.

575
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,940
19% of all flooding occurs outside the identified flood hazard area.

576
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,860
Oh, honey, don't be so naive.

577
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,180
That's how the world works.

578
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,340
We've had to contend with the fact that it's very difficult to move around.

579
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,360
The flooding has also had an impact on the availability of buses.

580
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,940
It's had an impact on the availability of gas and drivers.

581
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,840
How do we know that?

582
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,080
We're doing the best we can.

583
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,000
Silence! Silence, you perverts!

584
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,540
Let me reassure you, your fears are groundless

585
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,500
and you're complacent.

586
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,420
Silence, moronic!

587
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,220
That's good.

588
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,020
This film will explain everything to you in words that you can understand.

589
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,880
This is a public service message from FEMA.

590
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,320
Go to the basement or to an inside hallway

591
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,520
at the lowest level you can safely reach.

592
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,760
Get onto a piece of sturdy furniture,

593
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,460
such as a workbench or heavy table or desk,

594
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,980
and hold onto it tightly.

595
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,960
This could be bad advice.

596
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,960
What do you need right now

597
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,640
to get control of this situation?

598
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,860
I need...

599
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,340
I need...

600
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,700
500 buses, man.

601
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,380
We're talking about, you know,

602
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,920
one of the briefings we had,

603
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,740
they were talking about getting, you know,

604
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,880
public school bus drivers to come down here

605
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,480
and bus people out here.

606
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,020
I'm like, you gotta be kidding me.

607
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,280
This is a national disaster.

608
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,160
Get every doggone Greyhound bus line in the country

609
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,360
and get their asses moving to New Orleans.

610
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,740
That's they're thinking small, man.

611
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,840
And this is a major, major, major deal.

612
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,020
But you know...

613
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,480
Tuesday just as bad.

614
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,940
And, uh, uh, that's, that's reality.

615
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,200
Yes, it is.

616
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,680
I was of the city that chose to leave.

617
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,860
I wouldn't worry too much about selling out.

618
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,140
I could never really accept the party line.

619
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,680
Where it kept changing.

620
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Monday's Tuesday, Tuesday's live.

621
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,080
I could never really manage that.

622
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,600
And then I started thinking for myself

623
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,220
and asking questions and then...

624
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,480
We're not gonna allow it.

625
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,360
Oh my God!

626
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,540
Run, folks.

627
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,040
He might kill us all.

628
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,140
The jar had widened.

629
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,400
The great chain of being had snapped

630
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,800
like so many paperclips

631
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,780
strung together by some drooling idiot.

632
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,080
Death, destruction, anarchy, progress,

633
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,160
ambition and self-improvement

634
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,400
were to be his new fate.

635
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,140
And a vicious fate it was to be.

636
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,840
Now he was faced with the perversion

637
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,120
of having to go to work.

638
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,980
So I, I, I, I...

639
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,000
No goodness whatever adorning his memory,

640
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,020
arrogant in his vice was that one when he lived.

641
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,080
Understand the relief efforts

642
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,440
and the extent of the relief efforts

643
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,480
and the progress of the relief efforts.

644
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,760
After all, we're dealing with

645
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,380
one of the largest relief efforts

646
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,880
in our nation's history.

647
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,780
From time to time, well, maybe a lot,

648
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,700
he would doze off in meetings.

649
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,240
Perhaps fall sound asleep is a better description.

650
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,700
He'd sleep solidly for a few seconds

651
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,900
and then awaken as though he'd not missed

652
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,860
a beat of the discussion.

653
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,800
We marveled at his ability to catnap

654
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,320
and at what became known as the recovery factor.

655
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,740
This might consist of waking up

656
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,460
and immediately writing something,

657
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,940
anything on a pad or a vigorous nod of approval

658
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,080
as the speaker made what might have been a telling point,

659
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,480
though he hadn't heard a word of the presentation.

660
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,520
The federal government will do its part

661
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,880
to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina.

662
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,240
But the private sector needs to do its part as well.

663
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,480
Trade from people like you is the kiss of death.

664
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,660
And that's why I've asked Presidents Bush and Clinton

665
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,440
to lead a nationwide fundraising effort.

666
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,040
I knew that I still had to behave lawfully

667
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,020
without being particularly helpful.

668
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,560
But worst of all was the disgrace.

669
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,580
Did I want this to come out? No.

670
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,400
Was I embarrassed about it? Yes, absolutely.

671
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,300
How unbelievably gross.

672
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,280
First of all, you can't take that personally.

673
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,340
You've got to cut out the crap.

674
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,280
You've been drinking.

675
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:54,980


676
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,560
The President is...

677
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,000
And I said no.

678
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,040
I didn't even know about this.

679
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,020
I wasn't aware.

680
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,660
No one should be telling anybody.

681
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,880
Why don't you go home?

682
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,440
Leave it off.

683
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,280
Now that's all I know to say about this.

684
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,040
Constant, unrelenting leaks into face

685
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,380
is not sexual relations.

686
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,080
I love a bob.

687
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,360
Yeah! Yeah!

688
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,280
Come on.

689
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,520
It was no big deal.

690
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,200
Must have been urgent.

691
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:19,940
And how.

692
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,200
In the days ahead, the former presidents

693
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,560
will ask Americans to open their hearts and their wallets

694
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,320
to those in need.

695
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,520
Dadgum!

696
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,920
Government, you sorry rack of fractures.

697
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,960
You got yourself an itch and you're walking

698
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
made of scratches.

699
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,340
Well, you're dadgum.

700
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,460
Yeah, you're dadgum.

701
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,700
And the federal government's got an important role to play.

702
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,300
Oh.

703
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,420
If you believe you can come in here and wreak havoc,

704
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,520
get ready because we're prepared

705
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,960
and we're not going to let you turn your back on us.

706
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,360
We're going to turn this into a lawless town.

707
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:03,780
It is later than you think.

708
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,220
Oh, and then to my heart and the basement.

709
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,860
Oh, oh, oh.

710
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:16,900
Oh.

711
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,480
Crash on the living, mama.

712
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,840
Water gonna hold.

713
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:24,940
Oh.

714
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,480
Water gonna overflow.

715
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,940
Oh, oh, oh.

716
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,400
Swamps gonna rise.

717
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,740
Ain't no boats are gonna roll.

718
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,800
Oh, oh, oh.

719
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,720
Now you can train on down to Williamsport.

720
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,400
You can bust your feet and you can rock this joint.

721
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,500
But oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?

722
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,820
You're gonna have to find yourself another best friend.

723
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,700
And somehow it'll happen to you.

724
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,140
Uh, that's, that's reality.

725
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:00,660


726
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,380
George Bush is the perfect wise man.

727
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,500
And her.

728
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,460
And all.

729
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,380
And all.

730
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,440
During the 60s, the Tug Valley Flood Control Commission was founded.

731
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,840
The citizens needed a chairman.

732
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,460
Someone who knew and loved the river.

733
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,600
Someone who would stay awake at night while the populace slept.

734
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,100
The newspaper carried the story.

735
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,860
The headlines read, Mayor Bob was to be the chairman.

736
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,860
After serving with great vigil through numerous floods, Mayor Bob never missed a flood.

737
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,380
Then the waters came in the fall of 73.

738
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,580
The rivers started rising.

739
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,480
The people started worrying.

740
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,740
Where's Honey Bob?

741
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,140
The crowd went out.

742
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,520
The word finally came from all around.

743
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,920
Mayor Bob is out of town.

744
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,840
Even the sheriff's out of town.

745
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,840
Oh, we can't have a flood without the mayor.

746
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:03,880
And when he gets to that promised land, Noah from the ark will say, Mayor, welcome today.

747
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,720
Soul-selling, no-good sons of a dead shoe-fitting fire starters.

748
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:16,620
I ought to tear your no-good, goddang preambulatory voting frame and nail it to your government walls.

749
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,540
All of you, you bastards, dadgum.

750
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,980
Oh, we can't have a flood.

751
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,920
Without the mayor.

752
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:24,820
Really?

753
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,780
I know you don't feel that way.

754
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,860
Well, I'm probably going to get in so much trouble, it ain't even funny.

755
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,760
It's funny.

756
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:38,100
Now, you mean to tell me that a place where you probably have thousands of people that have died

757
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,620
and thousands more that are dying every day,

758
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:47,140
that we can't figure out a way to authorize the resources that we need?

759
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,120
Come on, man.

760
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,800
You know, I'm not one of those drug addicts.

761
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,240
I am thinking very clearly.

762
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,360
And I don't know whose problem it is.

763
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,460
I don't know whether it's the governor's problem.

764
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,520
I don't know whether it's the president's problem.

765
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,180
But somebody needs to get their ass on a plane and figure this out right now.

766
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,820
And we shall learn more of his wisdom later.

767
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,740
Come on.

768
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,080
Please hold up in the Elysian Fields project.

769
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,840
She got spooked.

770
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,920
She took off before I could get anything out of her.

771
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,960
Hold up.

772
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,060
Hold up.

773
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:26,580
Hold up.

774
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:26,920
Hold up.

775
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,340
Before you go farther, be aware that now you are in this, the second ring.

776
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,820
Look well, for here one sees things which in words would be incredible.

777
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,320
Nobody's doing it.

778
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,060
On every side, I heard wailing voices.

779
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,380
For God's sake, everybody's coming.

780
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,180
Nobody's coming.

781
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,940
I get to feeling funny when I'm alone.

782
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,780
Those carols are down there.

783
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,520
Don't forget.

784
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,820
And I can't stand being in this plane half with them.

785
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,360
And I can hear them screaming, screaming and crying.

786
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,880
And then I get all nervous.

787
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,920
Now go to your room, Sally, and stay there until we summon you.

788
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,420
It was only playing.

789
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,620
I won't ever...

790
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,800
Stop that gammering and move.

791
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,020
And don't try anything funny or you'll be right down there with Susie.

792
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,200
And how would you like that?

793
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,040
Oh, please change your mind.

794
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,140
Don't you look at me, freak.

795
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,560
However, in spite of this urging and warning,

796
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,080
streets and highways are...

797
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,060
...packed with stranded people trying to...

798
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,720
...or apparently can flee just anywhere.

799
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,900
I repeat, the safest course of action at this time is simply to stay where you are.

800
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,880
...the Coast Guard area in area waters.

801
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,280
Stand by for special instructions.

802
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,400
Make search of all suspicious craft or blueprints...

803
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,740
...for an urgent public safety message from FEMA.

804
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,640
Hurricane force winds, rain and floodwaters can make streets and bridges impassable.

805
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,880
In a hurricane,

806
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,040
you may be cut off from your home and family.

807
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,260
That's why every family should have a family emergency communication plan.

808
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,260
A plan for getting back together if you're ever separated during a disaster.

809
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,520
Listen to this station for more information from local authorities and...

810
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,740
Police attention.

811
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,280
Stop and search all vehicles and persons leaving...

812
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,880
Stay in your homes.

813
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,060
Stay in your homes.

814
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,100
Those found without specific military orders are subject to summary execution.

815
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,380
Stay in your homes.

816
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,780
Repeat, Conrad Channel.

817
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,460
This is a Class 1 emergency.

818
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,220
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

819
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,260
Hey!

820
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,740
Where do you think you're going?

821
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,640
Daddy's having talks.

822
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,220
Whee!

823
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,560
Excellent.

824
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,820
This message from FEMA Recovery Radio.

825
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,780
Just Stay Put is the message from FEMA.

826
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,500
FEMA Director Michael Brown.

827
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,940
Don't let your guard down.

828
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:45,820
We often think that now the hurricane has moved out of this particular area that it's pretty safe.

829
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,720
What they need to be cautious about is there'll still be floodwaters.

830
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,820
There still may be some structural damage in the...

831
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,900
home that's not readily visible to the naked eye.

832
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,060
There may be downed power lines.

833
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,880
There's certainly going to be a lot of debris in the area.

834
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,260
So the dangers of the hurricane still exist.

835
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,820
They need to be careful when they go back into those areas they live.

836
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,900
Try to be patient.

837
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,000
Don't rush out and get in the way of emergency workers endangering them and yourself.

838
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,180
Federal and state help is on the way and we'll be ready for you when you're ready.

839
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,240
FEMA will do everything possible to help victims get back on their feet.

840
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,420
We'll be here as long as we're needed.

841
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,700
This message from FEMA Recovery Radio.

842
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,620
They pushed through the dispersing crowd and started walking rapidly down Canal Street.

843
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:33,020
They've made slight splashing sounds in the cold dusk, reflecting in the streets dampened by the light mist that had been falling steadily for some time.

844
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,640
We got us a big crowd on Burr but looked like we could have us a football game.

845
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,980
The irony involved caught my fancy, I must admit.

846
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:46,480
Something from Joseph Conrad sprang to my mind, although I cannot seem to remember what it was at the time.

847
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,380
Perhaps I likened myself to Kurtz in The Heart of Darkness,

848
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,800
when, far from home, I was in the middle of the desert.

849
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,740
Far from the trading company offices in Europe, he was faced with the ultimate horror.

850
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,020
I do remember imagining myself in a pith helmet and white linen jodhpurs, my face enigmatic behind a veil of mosquito netting.

851
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,980
When I was just a little boy, standing to my daddy's knee,

852
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:18,700
my papa said, don't you let the man get you, do what he's done to me,

853
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:25,540
cause it'll get ya, get it right now.

854
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:36,580
I could remember the fourth of July, running through the backwoods bay,

855
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:45,040
and I could still hear my old hound out the parkin', chasing down a hoodoo there,

856
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,680
just chasing down a hoodoo there.

857
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,020
Ballin' on the bayou.

858
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,340
Ballin' on the bayou.

859
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,740
Ballin' on the bayou.

860
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,160
I know these backwoods boys, they're another hand that scares me, man.

861
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,020
Ah, child.

862
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:17,880
What?

863
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,920
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

864
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,520
We need help.

865
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,540
Really?

866
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,280
We want help! We want help!

867
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:37,080
Metropolitan area, people are stranded, and people are trying to reach them now.

868
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,480
Help! Help! Let me out of here! I know you're out there! Yes!

869
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,560
Why isn't anybody doing anything? I know you're out there! I can hear you screaming!

870
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,580
We'll do all our power to help.

871
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,660
Oh, yeah, right.

872
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,760
No, seriously.

873
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,820
Yes.

874
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:54,820


875
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:13,620
There ain't nobody that would lend me a helping hand.

876
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:20,760
I'm searching for help all over this land.

877
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,380
I'm stuck in the mud, y'all.

878
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,260
Oh, Lord, and I just can't seem to get out.

879
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:40,980
I'm having trouble, and I'm having such a whole lot, y'all.

880
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:47,080
And it's beyond, oh, beyond the shadow of doubt.

881
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,700
I don't think you know what I'm talking about, listen.

882
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:56,420
I'm going everywhere where there is something free.

883
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:03,340
But I can't seem to find no one, no one who wants to help me.

884
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,980
I'm stuck in the mud, y'all.

885
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,960
Oh, Lord, and I just can't seem to get out.

886
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:22,720
I'm having trouble, and I'm having such a whole lot, y'all.

887
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,940
And it's beyond, oh, beyond the shadow of doubt.

888
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,260
I don't think you know what I'm talking about, listen.

889
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,520
What's up, man?

890
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,400
Bad house!

891
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,760
Bad house.

892
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,580
It's terrible.

893
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,040
Fallen to pieces.

894
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,940
And people here should know that it's a bad house.

895
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:40,940


896
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:40,940


897
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:40,940


898
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,880
I've had to do this forever.

899
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,120
Can you tell me what that means?

900
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,880
That's your car.

901
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:52,440
That's a good news truck, isn't it?

902
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,640
Is it?

903
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,900
I got my Sondheim S 500 Eco-Sities.

904
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:56,900


905
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:56,900


906
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:56,900


907
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,700
Four notice signs are going around everybody.

908
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,320
I've got a V IPS out and there's the S 50 Ecovite on the back.

909
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:05,780
Looks more like, like I love this stuff.

910
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:05,780


911
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:05,780


912
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,580
The pilot, yeah, he's in the back.

913
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:06,580


914
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:06,580


915
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,740
Wow.

916
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,080


917
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:08,600
Yes.

918
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,980
Oh man, I just wish we could see their tears.

919
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,620
Nobody's coming to get us.

920
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,740
Nobody's coming to get us.

921
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,180
Everybody's promised.

922
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,320
Nobody's coming to get us.

923
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,520
It brings a tear

924
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,640
into my eyes

925
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,440
when I begin

926
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,160
to realize

927
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,700
I cried so much

928
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,240
since you've been gone.

929
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,220
I guess I'll come

930
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,200
and my heart will tear.

931
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,340
I'll sing

932
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,420
I'll sing

933
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:02,760
and cry

934
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,380
just like a child.

935
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,600
My pouring tears

936
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,740
are running wild

937
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,160
if you don't think

938
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,080
you'll be home soon.

939
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,640
I guess I'll drown

940
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,240
oh yes

941
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,840
in my own tears.

942
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,960
I know it's true

943
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,300
into each life.

944
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,780
Oh, some rain

945
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,920
rain must pour

946
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,420
into my eyes.

947
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,880
I am so blue

948
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,460
I am so blue

949
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,620
here without you.

950
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,180
Here without you.

951
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,920
It keeps raining

952
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,100
more and more.

953
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,140


954
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,480
I am blue.

955
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,200
I am blue.

956
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,140
Come on.

957
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,020
Come on.

958
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:33,700
Come on.

959
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,520
Oh, yes.

960
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,520
Oh, I won't

961
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,580
be all alone.

962
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,080
If you don't think

963
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,900
you'll be home soon.

964
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,360
I guess I'll

965
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,300
die in trial.

966
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,740
Oh, don't let me in.

967
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,740
Drown in my own tears.

968
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,660
When I'm in trouble, baby.

969
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,260
Drown in my own tears.

970
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,460
Oh, yeah, me.

971
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,580
And don't let me in.

972
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,520
Drown in my own tears.

973
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,240
I guess I'll drown

974
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,360
in my own tears.

975
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,320
Oh, oh, oh.

976
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,200
Oh, oh, oh.

977
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,280
Oh, oh, oh.

978
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,000
Oh!

979
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,620
I'll drown in gimmick.

980
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,360
And don't let me in!

981
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,600
And don't let me in.

982
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:48,860
Why?

983
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,860
Senor, come on.

984
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:53,760

986
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:53,760


987
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:53,900
Come on!

00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:53,980


990
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:53,980


991
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:53,980


992
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,580
Yeah, he's alive!

993
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,160
Shrek!

994
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:57,660
Are you all right?

995
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:57,660


996
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,500

00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,120
guardsmen in the leg

help it's a takeover it's a violation of the constitution i mean you can't keep up with the

1020
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,800
number of rumors spreading

1021
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:35,660
so fast unless you hear this directly from law enforcement or us then you know don't give any

1022
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,160
validity to this because it's creating a lot of problems better look out there ain't no explosion

1023
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:56,240
during the tug valley floods of 1963 residents of the black gym area of palm creek in pike county

1024
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,640
were being evacuated by a norfolk

1025
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,480
western engine one of the women residents who had had to move during many floods in the past

1026
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:13,720
was overheard to say another flood like that will do us in this is the fema radio news service do you

1027
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,380
know that your homeowner's insurance doesn't cover flood damage prepare find out if your property is

1028
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:23,280
at risk and what your options are to avoid financial losses get flood insurance before a storm strikes

1029
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,780
that's great another rise on palm creek another inch of rain another foot of water

1030
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:36,760
we ain't got no flood protection not a sandbag can be found we've lost all our possessions and

1031
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:44,020
that's tree and dog just drowned and she drowned nobody's coming together why couldn't they drop

1032
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:50,760
the 3 000 pound sandbags they said it was some pulleys that they had to manufacture but you know

1033
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,300
in a state of emergency man you you you are creative you figure out ways to get stuff done

1034
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,780
then they told me that they went overnight and they said they're not going to do it again and

1035
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:05,240
they built 17 17 concrete structures and they had to pull his on them and they were going to drop

1036
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:11,240
them i flew over that thing yesterday and it's in the same shape that it was after the storm hit

1037
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:20,180
there is nothing happening and they're feeding the public a line of bull and it's spinning

1038
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:26,420
and people are dying down here i will make brief answers they have no hope of death

1039
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,600

1044
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,120
this is

1045
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:14,440
put this series you all have to and you too too many of us you are i'm a bit stuck with

1046
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,160
our

1047
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:15,160


1048
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,960
finishing

1049
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,660
today

1050
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,340
well

1051
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,740
okay

1052
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,400
The rest of the world is unfair to the Americans.

1053
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,160
Do you remember the last time a Korean family adopted an American child?

1054
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,220
Did you ever receive a care package from Pakistan?

1055
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,720
The United States has sent millions of dollars in clothing abroad.

1056
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:53,460
And now, while young people are running around naked on their college campuses,

1057
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,420
has anybody sent them a pair of shorts?

1058
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,400
Oh, Dad.

1059
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,740
Nobody ever helps the Americans.

1060
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,300
Nobody would even lend me one gallon of gas.

1061
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,100
Nobody helped.

1062
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,280
If you need any help with your coffee, call me.

1063
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,380
What am I going to do about it?

1064
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:16,860
Well, all I need is the moonshine and someone playing the harmonica.

1065
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,940
And I'm as happy as a pigeon's flop.

1066
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,380
Holy smokes!

1067
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,180
What a mess.

1068
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,540
So look out for me.

1069
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,220
Oh, buddy.

1070
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:27,660
I'm going to the water.

1071
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:32,240
Your mysteries are deep and wide.

1072
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,460
And I've got a need for going somewhere.

1073
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,060
And I've got a need to climb upon your back and ride.

1074
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,500
A ride.

1075
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,000
Now that's a good idea.

1076
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,200
Come on.

1077
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,600
We're going to go for a joyride.

1078
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:47,700
Joyride.

1079
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,240
What the?

1080
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:51,940
Yeah!

1081
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,340
Yes!

1082
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:56,260
Good!

1083
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,900
Whatever's been in there, it's been in there for years.

1084
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,220
We've been swimming in it.

1085
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,480
We've been playing in it.

1086
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,700
And we've been swallowing it.

1087
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,040
Oh, how awful.

1088
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,960
We traveled on through a great arc of swamp between that slough and the dry valley.

1089
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:16,960
All the while with eyes turned towards those who swallow the much below.

1090
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,120
I shall perhaps recount that pilgrimage through the swamps.

1091
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:25,460
A journey into the desert from which I returned broken physically, mentally, and spiritually.

1092
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,440
Is anyone here not a downer?

1093
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:29,740
Anyone?

1094
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,000
Redoomed.

1095
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,600
Leaving New Orleans also frightened me considerably.

1096
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,300
Outside of the city limits, the heart of darkness, the true wasteland begins.

1097
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,800
What's the matter, honey?

1098
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,480
Are you lost?

1099
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,140
I'm looking for my sister, Stella.

1100
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,500
My name is Blanche Dubois.

1101
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:53,000
I thought my life would be a Mardi Gras.

1102
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,240
A never-ending party.

1103
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,120
Ha!

1104
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:04,340
I'm a faded southern dame without a dime.

1105
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:07,880
Okay.

1106
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,760
Let's get cleaned up.

1107
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,100
I need a drink before the bar is closed.

1108
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,000
Where in the world did he come from?

1109
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:17,920
He's truly mad.

1110
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,180
Not even vaguely attractive.

1111
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:20,420
Look!

1112
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,360
What's that?

1113
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,620
This is a public service message from people.

1114
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,260
Okay.

1115
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:30,040
I mean, I understand the anxiety people can grab.

1116
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,760
So there is frustration.

1117
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,340
But I want people to know there's a lot of help coming.

1118
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:35,760
Help!

1119
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,740
Help, I need help!

1120
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,640
This is a public service message from people.

1121
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:39,200
Help!

1122
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,240
Help!

1123
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:39,860
Okay.

1124
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:40,760
I mean, I understand.

1125
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,940
This thing's gonna die, man.

1126
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:42,820
This thing's gonna die.

1127
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,180
Look for me when you see me coming.

1128
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,860
I may be running.

1129
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,640
I don't know.

1130
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,400
I may be tired and running.

1131
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:54,600
I don't know.

1132
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:54,600


1133
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:54,600


1134
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:54,600


1135
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:54,600


1136
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:54,940
I may be having fever.

1137
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:59,040
But I'll be headed south to the mouth of the Ohio.

1138
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,740
So look out for me.

1139
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,820
Full mud and water.

1140
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,440
Your mysteries are deep and wide.

1141
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,080
And I gotta meet the far-going sun with you.

1142
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:17,240
And I gotta meet the time upon your back and ride.

1143
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,900
Bitch, I'll f*** your ass up.

1144
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,040
Yeah!

1145
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:20,980
Woo!

1146
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,140
You!

1147
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,580
And the people!

1148
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:24,660
You and me!

1149
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,960
We sweat and slay.

1150
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,760
Body all ached and loud.

1151
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,660
Wrack with pain.

1152
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,560
Toad the barge.

1153
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,300
Lift that bale.

1154
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,220
You get a little drunk and you land in jail.

1155
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,320
Oh!

1156
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,020
Keep a-weary.

1157
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,360
Sick of trying.

1158
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,220
Tired of living.

1159
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,040
Freedom's dying.

1160
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:54,560
Oh!

1161
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1162
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1163
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1164
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1165
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1166
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1167
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1168
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1169
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1170
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1171
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1172
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1173
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1174
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1175
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1176
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1177
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:54,560


1178
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:01,240
My liver keeps on running a-long.

1179
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:06,660
Martha!

1180
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,180
Martha!

1181
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,100
The horror.

1182
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,500
The horror.

1183
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,000
Don't you worry.

1184
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:14,980
We're leaving.

1185
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,380
We certainly are.

1186
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,220
Now get in this go-cart and get us out of here.

1187
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:19,800
Wait!

1188
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,020
I mean, first of all, understand that when you do have to leave, make sure you have the

1189
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,560
kinds of things you want.

1190
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:24,560


1191
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:24,560


1192
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:24,560


1193
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:24,560


1194
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,820
The things in the car that you're going to need.

1195
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:26,680
Cash.

1196
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,400
Medicine.

1197
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,500
Hold on.

1198
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,840
I left a lot of tablets behind, she said and ran into the house.

1199
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,560
She came down the steps with another load and stopped on the brick sidewalk, turning

1200
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,360
to look at the house.

1201
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,560
Ignatius could tell that she was attempting to record the scene.

1202
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,060
Eliza crossing the ice with a particularly large subgenius in her arms.

1203
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,880
Now my nerves are totally frayed.

1204
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,120
We better get out of here, baby.

1205
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,560
She slid into the front seat and started the car.

1206
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,160
We're going to have to go.

1207
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,000
Where do you want to spend the night?

1208
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,320
Spend the night?

1209
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,160
We're not spending the night anywhere.

1210
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,640
We must drive straight.

1211
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,040
I've been in this car since yesterday morning.

1212
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,700
I'm about to drop dead.

1213
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,160
Well, get across Lake Pontchartrain at least.

1214
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,160
Okay.

1215
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,680
We can take the causeway and stop in Mandeville.

1216
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,180
No!

1217
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,300
We can't stop there.

1218
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,600
The water's polluted.

1219
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,760
They're having an epidemic.

1220
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,860
Barges are always huddling into that causeway.

1221
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,960
Then I'll take the old bridge to Slidell.

1222
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,540
Yes, it's far south.

1223
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:24,540


1224
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:24,540


1225
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:24,540


1226
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:24,540


1227
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:24,540


1228
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:24,980
This is not a safe course.

1229
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:25,860
There's no road .

1230
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:25,860


1231
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:25,860


1232
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,140
This is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn't previously aware

1233
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:30,460
of.

1234
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,280
Let's get out of here.

1235
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,160
Quick.

1236
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,280
No, no, no.

1237
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,760
I need a place to stay.

1238
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,960
No, no, no.

1239
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,320
I need another day.

1240
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,520
My soul is lost.

1241
00:56:54,520 --> 00:57:01,860
It's lost, it's lost its way. It's been living in this lost, this lost highway.

1242
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,020
No, no, no, no. No, no.

1243
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,780
Where are you going?

1244
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:23,640
I thought we'd make better time by taking this blue highway I found on the map.

1245
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,380
The river.

1246
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,000
We'll plunge into the lake and drown.

1247
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:54,500
Just run.

1248
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,420
This is a public service message from people.

1249
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,720
I understand the anxiety people have.

1250
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,620
But I want people to know there's a lot of help coming.

1251
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,820
This is a public service message from people.

1252
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,840
I understand the anxiety people have.

1253
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,280
I think that I'm beginning to bloat.

1254
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,140
Even the river has bodies floating.

1255
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,220
But you tell me.

1256
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,540
And over and over again, my friend.

1257
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,100
How you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

1258
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,160
I take responsibility.

1259
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,480
Not.

1260
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:44,320
You have been listening to Hour of Slack number 1029,

1261
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:51,780
which is really Bob's Slack Time Funhouse by Reverend Susie the Floozy on Atlanta's WREK,

1262
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,240
which is always on.

1263
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:53,620
And...

1264
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,540
And streaming from WREK.org.

1265
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:04,960
The music in the background is by Ego Club with EbolaMusic.com.

1266
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:12,880
For morons of the Church of the Subgenius, see www.subgenius.com.

1267
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,400
Praise Bob!
