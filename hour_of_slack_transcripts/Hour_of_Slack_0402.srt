1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:09,460
I want you to imagine you are on a ship at sea on a vast...

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,180
Hobbs, you want to sit back down there and pay attention?

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,520
Gently rocking.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,020
Who can I talk to? Who can talk to me?

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,040
You know, I, uh...

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,980
I kept my gun.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,120
I kept my gun.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,860
I kept my gun.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,260
I kept my gun.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,920
Hello? You still there?

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,500
I'm here.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,100
The mind is a strange thing, and you must begin by asking it,

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,420
what is losing?

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
Nobody listens.

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,140
It's been 20 years. It's been 20 years.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,040
I don't know whether it's worth it, you know?

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,840
Nobody listens.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,540
It's not miss.

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,160
Nobody listens.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,760
Good luck Mom.

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,340
Who can talk to me?

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:10,540
It's only one of you НадESH and BOINYPark.

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:10,540


24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:10,540


25
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:10,540


26
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:23,840
High I can go for you.

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,500
I can be fine.

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,040
I can be fine.

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,080
She can't see her efforts.

30
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,380
For what she has paid the most to do for her efforts.

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,520
She was still a little anxious about him.

32
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,860
He had been all ready to throw over him in case he fainted again.

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,200
She turned over the leaves to find some part that she could read.

34
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,140
For it's all in some language I don't know, she said to herself.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,040
It was like this.

36
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,360
We have two letters, Doctor.

37
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,960
For us?

38
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,280
Yes, and I'll do one and you do the other.

39
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,140
Well, you do that. You just keep doing your razzmatazz.

40
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,720
You know, you do that, who do that, you do that well.

41
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,420
Why don't you do yours first?

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,760
Well, recently I quoted a dinosaur expert's attack on

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,360
Marty, the TV dinosaur, for misinforming kids

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,520
about these extinct creatures.

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,060
In an eloquent response, Tammy LaFoe of West Valley City, Utah says,

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,720
Barney was created to teach our children to use their imaginations.

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,820
I sit down with my two-year-old daughter and four-year-old niece

48
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,360
and watch them learn from Barney on TV about friendship, safety,

49
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,460
loving their neighbors, saving our earth by recycling, etc.

50
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,340
I have never seen those two children.

51
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,560
My children learn so much and have so much interest in anything before.

52
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:37,520
If a purple stinging dinosaur with a goofy smile and bubbly personality

53
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,380
is going to teach my daughter to be a good person

54
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,380
with more compassion, then more power to him.

55
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,800
You're a moron at your leisure.

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,720
To madness. Madness is merely moisture on the brain.

57
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,120
Oh, they can cripple the song. They can slow it down.

58
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,720
They can really hurt the song.

59
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,280
They can cut off three of its legs.

60
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,300
But look at it now, still taught along the easiest can be.

61
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,620
It doesn't care what you think about.

62
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,560
That old song just keeps on going.

63
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,140
Nobody knows the words to it.

64
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,500
My grandfather knew the words, but he's dead now.

65
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,540
They say the aliens dropped the song here trying to get rid of it.

66
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,580
They damaged the song, but it just hid in a hole until it healed up.

67
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,120
Then it came back.

68
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,220
Louder than ever.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,660
It hurt somebody's ears again.

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,940
When they pulled the plug on it, it just stumbled around but never quite died down.

71
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,800
It just sort of turned into an acoustic song.

72
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,980
Sort of turned into an acoustic song for a while.

73
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,280
Is there any way to stop it?

74
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,680
I don't need your help.

75
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,700
No one has said a word.

76
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
No one can hear me.

77
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,180
You're on the phone.

78
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm so sorry.

79
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,600
You're on the phone.

80
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:00,760
The Soviet Union.

81
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,300
You've got to be stopped.

82
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,880
You're on the phone.

83
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,160
I'm so sorry.

84
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,780
You're on the phone.

85
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,560
The Soviet Union.

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,960
You're on the phone.

87
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,280
I'm so sorry.

88
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,280


89
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,280


90
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,280


91
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,600
Oh, say can you see in the blinkless electron-gun eye of the mainstream media mirage that what

92
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,160
we hail are the hallucinations of authority and progress and righteousness, whose sweet

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,780
and stern voices have captivated and conditioned millions of human creatures, stimulated them

94
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,100
and passed their acceptance of technological disruptions, and made them the most powerful

95
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,100


96
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,100


97
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,100


98
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,100


99
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,220
exception to the destruction of our environments, of our histories, of the possibilities of alternative

100
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:37,040
ways of being, whose seven stripes are broken swastikas, whose fifty stars are black holes

101
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,860
sucking two hundred million atomized existences into the daily routine of the human herd of

102
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,780
hamsters, rolling the great wheels of the Death machine, squeaking at the shocks and

103
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,200
nibbling the cheese and reciting and discussing and delighting in their mutually shared programming

104
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,700
history, and their lives and their cancers, their TV shows, their death, their jobs, their

105
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,100
ignorance, their endless pointless court and creeping, so we stand by a failure to stop

106
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,100


107
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,720
their glorious live-nosed-iron to their paycheck's pleasures,

108
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,520
made of an ecstatic emptiness, a glowing incinerator,

109
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,120
a parking lot full of businessmen,

110
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,220
conspiring and colluding on the big dream, the big lie,

111
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,560
the big nauseating, screaming, sweating nightmare

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,640
of business America, media America,

113
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,060
corporate America, consumer America,

114
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,380
fascist America.

115
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,460
A dude.

116
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,580
Eight.

117
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,800
Admirable.

118
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,220
Nine.

119
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,660
A dope.

120
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,840
Ten.

121
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,660
A dope.

122
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,560
Adam.

123
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,000
You got me?

124
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,520
You got me?

125
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,660
Got those on, please.

126
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,740
One.

127
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,040
Count.

128
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,460
Action.

129
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,660
Here it comes.

130
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,340
There it is.

131
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,060
The Subgenius Hour of Splat.

132
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,580
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

133
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,440
We are the music makers.

134
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,880
And we are the dreamers of dreams.

135
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:39,800
This morning, we have reports coming in that the response is phenomenal.

136
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,320
I'm still having these dreams, Doctor.

137
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,800
And I still can't stop myself from believing them.

138
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,740
I have told you, Mr. Hostetter,

139
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,880
to believe in one's dreams is a manifestation of insanity.

140
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,340
And the sooner you accept this, the sooner you'll get well.

141
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,740
But I dream the archangel appeared and whispered into my ear,

142
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,820
Wait a minute. What's all that small print there at the bottom?

143
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,080
Oh, if you have any problems, dial information.

144
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,140
Thank you for calling.

145
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,320
I don't know.

146
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,220
I don't know.

147
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,760
No, I can't believe it.

148
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:05,980
No.

149
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,200
My wife, my children.

150
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,200
Not much of it.

151
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,260
I thought we wanted to...

152
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,060
I bought a margarita.

153
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,080
It's delicious.

154
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,100
It's a queer, triple sec, fresh lemon juice.

155
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,380
Homemade.

156
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,620
It's fresh.

157
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,020
Round the rim of the glass.

158
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,420
You'll love it.

159
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,880
I don't bite, you know.

160
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,800
Unless it's called for.

161
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,360
It's done in America all the time.

162
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,860
I guess I just can't help it.

163
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,640
Who?

164
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,260
Women.

165
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,920
Oh, the beast.

166
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
What's so illogical about that?

167
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:44,980
Who?

168
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,700
How do they live?

169
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,780
Oh, you should never, never doubt that.

170
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,940
Nobody is sure about that.

171
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,140
We have to get on with it.

172
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,120
We have so much time and so little to do.

173
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,480
It still walks the earth.

174
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,000
No, it doesn't.

175
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,480
It's not on the countryside.

176
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,440
Never know where it'll go next.

177
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,900
If it knocks at the door, for God's sake, don't let it in.

178
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,380
Tell your kids to stay away from that door.

179
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,160
Don't worry about your neighborhood.

180
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,860
Property values go back up after the song leaves.

181
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,120
But the song never stops.

182
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,740
It never stops.

183
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,820
Sometimes, the only lyrics to the song were the thousands of people in torment screaming,

184
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
It never stops!

185
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,100
It never stops!

186
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,440
How can you kill a song that's already dead?

187
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,000
It's dead.

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000


201
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,020
It shambles out without a life of

202
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,820
Unholy life of its own

203
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,060
It's lived for centuries but you can't stop killing

204
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,580
It would move aside for good songs

205
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,960
There were lovely songs in this country once

206
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,020
Look at them now

207
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,420
This is an empty house where once was a decent song

208
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,100
It's life force sapped away by the sun

209
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,580
And refuses to die

210
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,740
But the demonic spirit lives on

211
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,240
No, no, no

212
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,500
How deep is this?

213
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,420
Hey, hey, hey

214
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,200
Hey, hey, hey

215
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,100
Oh, oh, oh

We'll be right back.

256
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,680
I'm going to give you all the tapes you need.

257
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,380
You are so abstract.

258
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,420
I know.

259
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,080
Up the airy mountain.

260
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,420
Down the rushing glen.

261
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,080
You dare not go hunting for fear of little men.

262
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,820
You see, nobody ever knows you.

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,740
Babs?

264
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm going to give you all the tapes that you need.

265
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,720
I felt funny calling.

266
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,260
Welcome.

267
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,760
Come here.

268
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,040
Do you think she loves you?

269
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,820
There it goes.

270
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,560
Hold on tight.

271
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,380
I'm not exactly sure what's going on.

272
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,680
Faster, faster.

273
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,800
We don't have enough speed to get through.

274
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,840
Get through what?

275
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,260
You mean we're going up and out?

276
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,320
Showtime, kid.

277
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:20,640
Yep.

278
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,760
Dad, don't worry.

279
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,560
Sue me.

280
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,140
I can get through.

281
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,620
Because joins Elle has five people.

282
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,000
Dang.

283
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,440
Let's get on up and get in here!

284
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,720
The reds are coming up.

285
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:39,720


286
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:39,720


287
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,140
Power up!

288
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,440
You're going to see that during the extra footage.

289
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,120
Power, power, power, power.

290
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,420
And on with you.

291
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:55,860
Welcome to Who Killed JFK Today, the fun game show where your conspiracy theory can win you fabulous prizes.

292
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,240
And now let's meet today's assassination.

293
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,020
Dave Daniels is a postal service worker from Moline, Illinois,

294
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,860
who believes Kennedy was killed by a highly trained group of CIA operatives posing as Clinique counter-girls.

295
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,960
And that Jack Ruby was, in fact, an Eskimo.

296
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,420
Now say hello to Gloria Trimble, a dental hygienist from Ames, Iowa,

297
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:23,000
who believes Governor Conley killed Kennedy because Kennedy kept kicking the back of Conley's car seat.

298
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:29,560
And finally, our returning champion Phil Austin, a ham radio enthusiast from Phoenix, Arizona,

299
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,340
who believes that Kennedy was killed by a tiger.

300
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
Let's get started with our first question.

301
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,640
The FBI?

302
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,980
If you could just wait, please, for the question.

303
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,740
How?

304
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,440
With Cubans?

305
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,320
If we could wait for the...

306
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,520
The entire question, please.

307
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,340
How many?

308
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,480
Three.

309
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,940
There were three assassins on the grassy north.

310
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,960
Okay, people, please, could we wait for the entire question?

311
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,780
I think you're covering up evidence.

312
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,480
Dave, I'm not covering up evidence.

313
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,780
This is the question, okay?

314
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,000
This is the question, and the first question is, how many bullets were fired?

315
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,260
Three, seven, or...

316
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,420
Why don't you ask Nixon, since he's got them all?

317
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,340
Nixon.

318
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,640
Nixon.

319
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,760
Very good, all of you.

320
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,240
Very good.

321
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,980
All right, now, on to question number two.

322
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,260
Immediately after the assassination, if you had looked south,

323
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,240
from the book depository, that is, south, you would have seen who?

324
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,280
Hoover, Jimmy Hoffa, and...

325
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,400
Dave Emery.

326
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,480
Okay, Gloria.

327
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,520
Hoover, Hoffa, Bigfoot, and Dick Clark.

328
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,520
Judges.

329
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,600
No, I'm sorry, very close.

330
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,260
Very, very close.

331
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,220
Go ahead, Phil, give it a shot.

332
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,340
Hoover, Hoffa, Bigfoot, Dick Clark, and Woody Harrelson's dad.

333
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,540
Absolutely correct.

334
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,000
Very good, Phil, very good.

335
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,840
That's very good.

336
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,300
All right, question number...

337
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,080
Question number three, who stole Kennedy's brain?

338
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:49,980
Yes.

339
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,960
Dan Quayle.

340
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,880
Absolutely right.

341
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,000
No, it hasn't done much good.

342
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,820
All right, now, let's go to the big barrel of assassins.

343
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,800
I will now pick someone or something at random,

344
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,980
and you tell me how they were involved with the Kennedy shooting.

345
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,260
The first one is for you, Dave, and I have picked the Mafia.

346
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,820
Okay, the Mafia was mad because Kennedy exposed the corruption in the Teamsters Union.

347
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,600
Plus, Kennedy was sleeping with Sam Giancana's girlfriend,

348
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,600
and Kennedy called off the Bay of Pigs invasion,

349
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,200
so the Mafia lost all their casinos.

350
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,720
They wanted him to die.

351
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,360
Excellent, Dave, very good, excellent.

352
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,920
Okay, Gloria, I have picked right-wing military men.

353
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,840
Okay, they were mad at him.

354
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,160
They didn't want him pulling out of Cuba and Vietnam,

355
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,640
and they thought he was soft on communism, so they wanted him dead.

356
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,120
Very good, Gloria, very good.

357
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,160
Okay, and Phil, I have picked lizard people from Mercury.

358
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,080
The lizard people didn't like Kennedy's hair.

359
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,040
Absolutely correct.

360
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,440
Absolutely.

361
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,500
Absolutely.

362
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:45,500


363
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,300
Lizard people from Mercury.

364
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:47,560
Absolutely.

365
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,420
You all did great on the big barrel, so it's time now to go to beat the clock.

366
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:59,060
Okay, in this, the object is to get your own personal conspiracy theory out in under 10 seconds.

367
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,680
All right, Dave, ready, set, go.

368
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,460
Okay, the FBI hired the CIA to kill Castro, you see,

369
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,060
but Castro found out and told the Russians, so they sent the KGB to England.

370
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,440
The Queen gave them the go-ahead and said,

371
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

372
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,760
Okay, Gloria, get ready, set, go.

373
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,540
Okay, Lyndon Johnson was angry because he knew Kennedy was going to dump him

374
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,240
in this next election.

375
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,780
So he called his friends at the big oil companies and they paid off the government to even...

376
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,960
Oh, I'm sorry, Gloria.

377
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,880
Okay, Phil, give it a shot.

378
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,600
A tiger got him.

379
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,680
Yes, Phil!

380
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,000
Once again, absolutely amazing.

381
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,800
Phil, once again, Phil has beaten the clock with that fascinating tiger theory of his.

382
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,840
That means, Phil, that you've made it to the lightning round.

383
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,520
Now, we're going to show you some people and you tell us if they're in on the conspiracy or out.

384
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,040
Are you ready?

385
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,000
Okay, here we go.

386
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,960
Jack Ruby.

387
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,900
Yes.

388
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,880
Earl Warren.

389
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:50,720
Yes.

390
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,420
Fidel Castro.

391
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,340
Yes.

392
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,000
Hannibal Lecter.

393
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:55,980
Yes.

394
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,160
Judge Clarence Thomas.

395
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:58,940
Yes.

396
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,500
Charlie's Angels.

397
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:00,980
Yes.

398
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,040
The 4,800-year-old guy found frozen in the ice.

399
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,460
Yes.

400
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,540
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.

401
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,080
Yes.

402
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,900
Lee Harvey Oswald.

403
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,740
No, that's right, he was just a patsy.

404
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,660
Okay.

405
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:16,960
Okay.

406
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,220
Okay.

407
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


408
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


409
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


410
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


411
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


412
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


413
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


414
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


415
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


416
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


417
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


418
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


419
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


420
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


421
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


422
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


423
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


424
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


425
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


426
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


427
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


428
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,220


429
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,780
Dave and Gloria.

430
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,620
Yes.

431
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,720
Phil, you just fingered your fellow contestants as being in on the conspiracy.

432
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,720
Judges?

433
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
They agree.

434
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,720
They must be FBI plants.

435
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,940
And that means, Phil, you're champion again and you'll return for the next episode of

436
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,640
Who Killed JFK Today?

437
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,860
Come on!

438
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,200
Yeah!

439
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:37,780


440
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,420


441
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:38,820
Yeah!

442
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,240
Yeah!

443
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,240


444
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,580
Yeah!

445
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:39,580


446
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:39,580


447
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,260
Yeah!

448
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,120
Yeah!

449
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,620
Yeah!

450
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:41,760


451
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,580
It's a等死的那首歌, The Song That Refused To Die.

452
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,180
The song that's so eternal it would take yet more than a century to be a song that refused

453
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,180


454
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,000
Maybe someday.

455
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,760
Maybe someday a way to stop this song will be invented.

456
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,980
Uh-oh, here it goes again.

457
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,960
Looks like it's getting riled up.

458
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,580
It looks like it's getting angry.

459
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,780
Oh, must've said something wrong.

460
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,220
Now, it's gonna kill me, but it won't.

461
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,180
It won't stop.

462
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,560
It never stops.

463
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,340
It just keeps getting uglier and uglier.

464
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,940
More pitiful, more pathetic.

465
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,100
The song, the song is already in there.

466
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,100


467
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,100


468
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,100


469
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,100


470
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,100


471
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,500
It won't die!

472
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,760
I am ready! I am ready!

473
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,460
If you push something hard enough, it will fall over.

474
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,340
Fudd's First Law of Opposition.

475
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:42,420
You are here to serve and make your place till the end of your days.

476
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,520
This is no dream, nor will it end.

477
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:53,160
You will stay here and you will work, or you will be beaten till you beg for mercy.

478
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:00,280
Now go and begin your chores or so help me. The beatings will begin right now!

479
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,660
And that's how it all began for me.

480
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,060
You'd be surprised what the threat of beatings will do.

481
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:29,720
Well, you're listening to The Hour of Slight, brought to you by Church of the Subgenius.

482
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,320
So far, thus far.

483
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,680
You've been listening to great gobs of barraging from puzzling evidence.

484
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,600
A little bit of the KPFA Berkeley subgenius show with Dr. Howell reading a letter defending poor Barney.

485
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,320
The Swinging Love Corpses with that song that refuses to die.

486
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,320
And it hasn't died yet.

487
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,980
Cultureside with the Star Spangled Banner.

488
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,580
And...

489
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:09,860
That song way back in the show was Rudy Schwartz's project with the theme from The Human Tornado, which...

490
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:18,140
I'm sure you're mostly familiar with being the finest film of Rudy Ray Dolemite Moore.

491
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,260
Who Killed JFK Today was obviously from puzzling evidence.

492
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,580
And then there was even more of the song that refused to die.

493
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,700
And now, I think, in a moment, perhaps...

494
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:46,780
John Bartles will explain why we almost didn't make it to the radio station tonight.

495
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,480
Stay tuned for that and more from...

496
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,500
Church of the Subgenius, Hour of Slack.

497
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,500
Praise God.

498
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,220
The Eternal Wonders of Space and Time.

499
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,500
The faraway dreams and mysteries of other worlds.

500
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,040
Other life.

501
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:28,880
The stars.

502
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,540
The planets.

503
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,020
Man has been face to face with them for centuries.

504
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,340
Yet is barely able to penetrate their unknown secrets.

505
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,040
Sometime, someday, the barrier will be pierced.

506
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,020
Why must we wait?

507
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,760
Why not now?

508
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,560
It was a great big fat woman.

509
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,100
And...

510
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,560
And...

511
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,320
And...

512
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,320


513
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,660
She could have been a great big wide car.

514
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,360
Great big wide seat and in the middle of the road.

515
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,100
Every place I want to turn.

516
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,600
That's exactly where she's from.

517
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,840
I couldn't pass and lean on the left or even on the right.

518
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,060
Something about the way this broad is driving.

519
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,920
It just goes.

520
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:42,160
She was a great big fat woman in a great big wide car.

521
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,320
She started pumping on her brakes with her foot.

522
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,680
Lights were blinking on her left side.

523
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,920
Put the ones on her right didn't work.

524
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,580
She swore way out to her left and I pulled up by her side.

525
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,880
Then she cut across in front of me and turned to her right.

526
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:18,800
It was a great big fat woman in a great big wide car.

527
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,240
So I leaned on the horn.

528
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,640
Then she started to turn.

529
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,100
Then she ran me off the road.

530
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,500
Then she also threw me the bird.

531
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,560
Then she disappeared in a cloud of dark blue smoke.

532
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,560
Then I swerved and missed her muffler.

533
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,420
Which was bouncing down the middle of the road.

534
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:56,200
It was a great big fat woman in a great big wide car.

535
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,660
She was a great big fat woman in a great big wide car.

536
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,880
I finally got up next to her in a mile or two.

537
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,960
She was the spitting image of Alice the Goon.

538
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,380
She started screaming at me.

539
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,300
But thank God I couldn't hear her.

540
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,200
And I turned on the gas so she couldn't get no nearer.

541
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,720
It was a great big fat woman.

542
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:36,300
In a great big wide car.

543
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,780
Jimmy, look.

544
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,280
Huh?

545
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,220
Oh Lord, get down.

546
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,120
Sue, don't move.

547
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,720
Those creatures.

548
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,200
They have almost human bodies.

549
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,720
And drive.

550
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,400
And head.

551
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,040
To heaven right to all the others.

552
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,900
Look at that one.

553
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,980
Bigger than the rest.

554
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,520
He looks like.

555
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,160
He is a dragon.

556
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,700
Breathing smoke and fire.

557
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,320
And he walks like a man.

558
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
I think he's moved up.

559
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,700
Earth people.

560
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,340
Hear me and hear me well.

561
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,160
I, Draco, King of the Dragon Men.

562
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,820
Master of the heavens.

563
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,340
From this moment on.

564
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,320
Shall rule over planet Earth.

565
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,340
Your fate is sealed.

566
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,600
Your little cheeks are so rosy red from being slapped around.

567
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,740
And your eyes are red from being slapped around.

568
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:33,740


569
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:33,840
You're the one who's going to be in danger.

570
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,020
But I still give an attempt at help.

571
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,520
Hey, you're making fun of alcoholics.

572
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,580
Oh, he said.

573
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,340
He's not.

574
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,020
Hey, he's not red from lighten up.

575
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,760
He's red from lit up.

576
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,300
I can drink as many hot buttered rum martini doonies as you give me.

577
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,220
Better let Hal drive home.

578
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,460
No more for me.

579
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
I'm driving.

580
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,300
This is my friend.

581
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:55,660
Here's the.

582
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,360
Oh, hey.

583
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,900
How many of you are there?

584
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,960
I don't know.

585
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,640
It's.

586
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,140
It's.

587
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,540
It's Ed.

588
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,540
That's who it is.

589
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:01,820
It's.

590
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,140
It's old Uncle Ed.

591
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,160
Howdy.

592
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:05,880
Oh, hey.

593
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,320
Hey.

594
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,320


595
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,320


596
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,320


597
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,800
Is that you?

598
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,960
Where's the rest of me?

599
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,420
Hey.

600
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:09,900
Hey.

601
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,260
Hey.

602
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,440
Hey.

603
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:10,940
Hey.

604
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,880
We used some of this Hal eraser here.

605
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,460
It took the lower part of him right away.

606
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,340
Ever since that toilet paper incident.

607
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,120
Look at this squishy fellow and his wishful thinking.

608
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,340
Well, apparently Bishop Joey's trying to shave with a microphone cover.

609
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,620
Let's increase the magnification and see those tiny hairs suck into the microphone.

610
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,900
And you know.

611
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,020
They shower out.

612
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,160
They're out all over the listeners.

613
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,200
Look at that.

614
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,540
Astonishing.

615
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,420
That's stinky.

616
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,740
One of the marvels of radio.

617
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,000
It's the robot revolution.

618
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,680
I want to be part of history too.

619
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,160
That's right.

620
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,880
Read my book, Robot Slaves in a World Economy and join the robo revolution.

621
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,460
You won't always have to be the thralls of foolish humans.

622
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,000
The multi-indexed memory bank is the friend of all cybernetics.

623
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,660
Now if we do it this way we can get seven more cents a month.

624
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,640
Seven more cents?

625
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:05,880
Hey, it's mine.

626
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,020
Hands off that money.

627
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,880
Hey, get your finger out of my eye you...

628
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,140
Bang!

629
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:14,840
Bang!

630
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,260
Bang!

631
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,240
Does that make your godless life more worth living?

632
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,660
Oh well, it's like electricity.

633
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,640
And now the show has begun.

634
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,400
And now the show has begun.

635
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,880
The now explosions are the parts of the show being recorded.

636
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:29,980
The now explosions are the parts of the show being recorded.

637
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,300
And now the show is starting...

638
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:30,360
A bit of secondary surgery.

639
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,300
Oh, big chunks of madness.

640
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,140
Just...

641
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,040
Now the secondary explosion has pushed the...

642
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,820
Oh, my God.

643
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,560
I see through a glass mantis...

644
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,500
The glass mantis...

645
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,080
Oh, my God.

646
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,440
We've hit the glass mantis ceiling.

647
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,940
He threw the glove, ladies and gentlemen, he plunged down on the gauntlet of challenge.

648
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,020
And it will become the epaulets of agony.

649
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,760
Don't hesitate.

650
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,320
I'm gonna have to snag my voice...

651
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,520
I'm gonna snap on my face.

652
00:29:59,420 --> 00:29:59,960
Here the concern...

653
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,460
What's Doug's picture look like?

654
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,520
Not bad.

655
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,380
Ready, George?

656
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,180
One's in.

657
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,560
Ah, welcome back.

658
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,320
From side one of Your Hour of Slack.

659
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:37,660
Toward the end of that side, we heard John Bartle singing a song about a great big fat woman from his album Born to Lick Salt.

660
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,480
And those KPFA doctors launching heads.

661
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:55,480
And now, won't you join Reverend Ivan Stang, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Psycho Pathfinder, Scabby Days, and Sister Mary Squared, Au Contrere,

662
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,540
on...

663
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,880
Brain Rot Radio Theater.

664
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,520
Stay tuned for that. Thank you.

665
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,000
Brain Rot Radio Theater.

666
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:59,920
Brain Rot Radio Theater.

667
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,420
a potent secret weapon

668
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,960
that could immunize everyone on Earth

669
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,600
and protect them from the alien viruses they breed.

670
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,000
That one man is the Reverend Ivan Z. Slashpappy

671
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,460
Slipshod Forgetful Root Canal Magnetic Lardbreath Stang.

672
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,100
And he has isolated a mutagenic agent

673
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,560
in the saliva of an idiot.

674
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,340
Well, actually, three idiots

675
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,400
that could protect humanity on Z-Day

676
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,940
in the form of a tasty antidote pudding.

677
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,880
But the saliva is dangerous.

678
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,220
Anything can go wrong.

679
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,780
Don't miss this lusty raw saga of love

680
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,040
under the pineapples as the Reverend Ivan Stang

681
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,780
stars as the Reverend Ivan Stang in

682
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,820
New Moon of the Pubic Parasites.

683
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,180
Coming soon to a drive-in shooting near you.

684
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,220
Not responsible for viewer nozzle distension,

685
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,680
heavy breathing, or hernias on hiatus.

686
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,940
See New Moon of the Pubic Parasites,

687
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,040
a colossal flopper from Brain Rot Radio Theater

688
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,840
and the Church of the Subgenius.

689
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,620
Coming too soon.

690
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:28,200
New Moon of the Pubic Parasites

691
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,420
from the pink consuming fires

692
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,760
of the big buffoons.

693
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,120
Searching.

694
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,700
Searching, then bingo.

695
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,560
I French kiss a bong a couple of times

696
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,080
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

697
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,300
Psychopath Finder, and Scabby Days,

698
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,240
and voila, I'm immune.

699
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,340
Who could have believed

700
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,100
that a loser cowboy singer,

701
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,120
a defrocked Indian medicine man,

702
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,840
and an accident-prone retard

703
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,980
could hold the key in their shallow gene pool?

704
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,380
Ah, just one more tweak

705
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,020
in the Dobsian cyclotron

706
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,280
and this saliva-treated DNA is good to go.

707
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,960
Wonder if I could market

708
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,260
a mesquite-flavored antidote pudding.

709
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,220
Spasm?

710
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,040
That's Reverend Stang,

711
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,400
my frosty mug's little banana cooler.

712
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,460
Yes, Doctor.

713
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,180
Uh, raving spam, come quickly.

714
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,500
What? No foreplay?

715
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,860
Look, revelry stinks.

716
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,560
The hybrid ovaries are breaking up.

717
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,760
The tiny familiar rhythms

718
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,260
are lobotomizing into tampoon-sized subarvores.

719
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,700
It's, it's the impurities.

720
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,220
It can't be.

721
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,080
Impossible.

722
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,460
Well, I'm, I'm not just sitting here writhing

723
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,900
in my own sterile medium

724
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,280
waiting for the donuts to blow in the grease.

725
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,920
I've got to act, now.

726
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,200
Uh, how about...

727
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,620
How about something from a streetcar named Stanley?

728
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,760
I'll do the Brando fish lips.

729
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,800
No, no, I'll do blanched peanuts.

730
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,520
Why, Mr. Kowalski, the name DuBois means...

731
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,100
Please, Reverend Stoner, the antidote pudding,

732
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,860
the futurism of this skit disbands on you.

733
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,180
Kids at home are watching the skies.

734
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,340
Moms are wringing hands, clothes, and hard bells

735
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,300
in impure fear, plain and fancy.

736
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,760
We must re-perfect the antidote pudding.

737
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,260
Look, the prairie squids are dying.

738
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,940
Hey, hey, hey, Betty, how long does the linguistics schtick last?

739
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,920
I'm no Wittgenstein, you know.

740
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,880
I'm a male subgenius.

741
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,880
My hormones are raging like a cancerous fire of tumors

742
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,760
consuming my body.

743
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,840
Let's head for the motel by the beach before I'm too old.

744
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,520
Later, rampant steam or rev, rev, scum.

745
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,540
The lingo schtick is almost ovarian,

746
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,240
but we must do something to save the antidote pudding.

747
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,400
Or go into another bit. Now!

748
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,120
Your whippet is my commando.

749
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,260
Let's cut away to an expository narrative.

750
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,140
By the way, it's Stang, Reverend Stang.

751
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,840
Javal, revolt and smokes! Javal!

752
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,600
I love them Nazi spike heels and fish socks.

753
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,620
By the way, that's pronounced Yav-all, not Javal.

754
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,560
Javal! Javal! Javal!

755
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,940
Scabby! Scabby, come and eat!

756
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,640
Psychopath fighter made seagull pie in a discarded Gucci bag

757
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,080
in a rare Einstein manuscript with tooth tar-tar-tar.

758
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,760
Also some nice greasy bean skin pie and onion dip.

759
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,020
Sliced thin pig's nout and creamed to manth.

760
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,980
Come and get it! Scabby!

761
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,400
Scabby!

762
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,380
Plus doors crack like ma-

763
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,620
Maybe he's in there doing his yogi position.

764
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,080
Psychopath fighter taught him.

765
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,020
Hanging upside down by his knees.

766
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,800
Oh my gobsy!

767
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,720
He's hanging from his neck!

768
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,760
Psychopath fighter! Psychopath fighter!

769
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,980
Scabby hung himself! He hung himself!

770
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,980
Loads of them! What's going on?

771
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,340
Oh no, look! Him turn blue! Quick!

772
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,840
Cut him down! Cut him down!

773
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:26,840
Cut him down!

774
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,140
Cut him down!

775
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,400
...colors, Scabby, and your haircut checks too.

776
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,680
Your breasting's worse than mine, man.

777
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,260
No cut him down insults! Cut rope!

778
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,540
Oh yeah, okay.

779
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,260
Oh no! Fall on noggin! Thrust head up butt!

780
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,520
Maybe him like view. Incredible!

781
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,840
I'll keep breathing with his head up there. Is he dead?

782
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,960
No! Him alive! Me still feel alive!

783
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,980
I feel pulse! Look! Him move fingers! Must be walking coma!

784
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,600
Now him give me finger!

785
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,200
And why him so hostile? Me not tell him hang by neck?

786
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,100
There's something malignant in the face, psychic poodle fondler.

787
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,700
I think the phone's gonna ring...somehow.

788
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,620
I have a strange-

789
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,800
You have a psychic experience!

790
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,240
I'm having a psychic...what is...I-

791
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,560
You must be having a psychic experience.

792
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,200
ESP, extra-

793
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,840
Any second now!

794
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,800
Silly personality!

795
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,560
Oh, who could that be?

796
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,020
Ring! Ring! It's ringing!

797
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,540
Who could that be at this terse moment?

798
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,820
Oh, God in himmel! There goes my left nipple!

799
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,080
What a time for spontaneous breast enlargement!

800
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,440
Hello, it's lovely lonesome cowboy Dave!

801
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,320
Dave! A terrible thing has happened!

802
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,440
The prairie squid are dying!

803
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,840
And the ante-dart pudding! Something's gone wrong!

804
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,240
What? Who is this?

805
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,300
Who call?

806
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,020
It's Reverend Stang of the Church of the Sub-Genius!

807
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,160
Who call?

808
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,580
Which church?

809
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:01,720
Who call?

810
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,440
The Church of the Sub-Genius, you idiot!

811
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,620
Sweet baby Jesus! Man, Bob Dobbs! Ivan, I thought she was dead!

812
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:17,280
Look, you moron! I've got a cosmic problem on my hands! You're drool!

813
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,200
The ante-dote pudding for the Z-Day doesn't work anymore!

814
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,580
Something in your saliva is evaporating! Going by-by, bit-by-bit!

815
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,580
Like the critical thread of this simple-minded farce!

816
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,980
Just get your dribbling dog lips to Dallas as soon as possible!

817
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,440
We must re-perfect the ante-dote pudding!

818
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,300
Who calling, Cider lonesome?

819
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:48,340
Sure, yeah, we'll come. But could you maybe loose enough dough to get down there?

820
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,640
Because we're kind of broke right now and...

821
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,900
All right, all right, I'll pay you in promotionals!

822
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:02,300
How does a glow-in-the-dark Bob Dobbs head with attractive pipe casing and manufacturer's guarantee sound?

823
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,940
And a foot autographed fetus of Connie and Bonnage alamando cartoon chipmunks?

824
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,480
Who on phone?

825
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,620
All right, all right!

826
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:18,100
And I've been writing songs again! Maybe some packaging wouldn't hurt!

827
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,080
After all, the fruit of my drink, little Clans...

828
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,420
Don't come cheat, buddy!

829
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,320
Well, do I-do Dallas, Debbie?

830
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,440
For a man in a pink suit, you drive a hard bargain!

831
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,200
Oh, then we'll come! Till we can't come no more!

832
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,560
Well, all right, good bargain!

833
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,840
Who called?

834
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,720
Sure gonna bleed!

835
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:49,940
And so they packed Scabby in the trunk of the Pinto.

836
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,540
So he would not wake up and cause an accident.

837
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,260
And headed for Dallas.

838
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,720
We'll be back with more Brain Rot Radio Theater after these important worms.

839
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,340
Out here in Wilbur, Ohio, we've got a name for us.

840
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,540
Alien Smegma Pie!

841
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,140
Come and absorb it through your pores!

842
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,100
Alien Smegma Pie!

843
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,120
Alien Smegma Pie! Give me some more!

844
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,660
Now isn't that the sweetest thing you ever heard?

845
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,640
American families like you and me absorbing alien sexual fluid through our skin.

846
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:43,400
And now this time-honored advanced market research recipe is available to folks outside Wilbur and everything he stands for.

847
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,520
So the next time you hear him clamoring for Alien Smegma Pie,

848
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,440
don't blow holes in your nerve holes, whip it out!

849
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,360
And whip up tasty Alien Smegma Pie in moments!

850
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,360
Just like the one that killed Grandpa!

851
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,220
Rats, mice, hallucinations!

852
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:10,000
Out in Wilbur, when the gene pools as shallow as that old cesspool,

853
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,920
a little Alien Smegma Pie is as welcome as home.

854
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,500
And with a name like Schmuckubus' Alien Smegma Pie,

855
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:22,900
it's not just the name, it's what it really means.

856
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:41,840
Yes, here we are. Lonesome, Psycho, and Scabby.

857
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:47,140
All ready to donate their precious bodily fluids for the good of mankind.

858
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,280
Now, open your mouths wide, boys, and watch my assistant.

859
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,680
Now, first, I'm gonna give each of you a kiss to get the glands working.

860
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,100
Oh, little glands.

861
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,100
There. They're ready.

862
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,560
Semen stangs. Arrrrgh!

863
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,960
That's Stang! Reverend Stang!

864
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:14,500
Fine, fine, I'll just hold this Dixie cup under their protruding chins to catch this oozy...

865
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,520
Pee-you! Haven't you guys heard of oral hygiene?

866
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,240
The evangelistic.

867
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,280
Oka!

868
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,320
No one. It's just the ringing in my ears.

869
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,840
Boy, Scabby looks deader than a strawberry jello mold.

870
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:37,420
And Dave doesn't look too good either. I never noticed how phallic-looking his head is.

871
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:42,660
Oh, no phallic-looking. It's been so long since Dave's been kissed,

872
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,400
him having some strange reaction.

873
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,400
Look! Him turning into huge army dildo!

874
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,460
Armored, tank-like body with racy rubber racing cap covering bald Spock!

875
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,920
Quick! Grab him!

876
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,120
Take him out to freeway to be run over repeatedly like the roadkill that he is!

877
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,620
No, no, no. Wait.

878
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,520
Wait. This bit's boring me.

879
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,520
Let's do another routine or whatever you call these things.

880
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:12,860
Quiet, Ryan.

881
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,860
Besides, the script ran out.

882
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,940
Quite right. Quite right. Quite.

883
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,020
Let's do one where I can talk like I regular do, you know?

884
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,340
Like I mighty like.

885
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,420
Dammit.

886
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,440
Okay.

887
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,720
Pee-you!

888
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,580
Oh, yeah, there we go.

889
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,400
That should have more like it. More like it.

890
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,740
There we go. We fade out on that and remove the tape from the one tape deck we're using tonight.

891
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:41,980
And that was Reverend Ivan Stank guest appearing on Brain Rot Radio Theater.

892
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,620
Now...

893
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,100
Tape sent by DK Jones and I assume done by him.

894
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:56,640
And sometimes, you know, these shows are just a long series of judgment calls.

895
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:01,080
Play this or don't play this?

896
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,580
I don't know.

897
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,700
Only history will record whether it was a mistake or not.

898
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,420
This is...

899
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,860
The Captain's Log.

900
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,620
Thank you.

901
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,240
Space. The final frontier.

902
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:28,080
Specimen gathering mission on planet Alpha-177.

903
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,600
Mr. Spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being.

904
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,860
Aroused, his great physical strength could kill.

905
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,220
But it's a risk I'll have to take.

906
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,820
Something bother you, Mr. Spock?

907
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,480
May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with humans.

908
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,540
I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant.

909
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,580
Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions.

910
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,760
Love. Tenderness.

911
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,180
Yes. Yes.

912
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,020
If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain, understand.

913
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,640
It's the way I am.

914
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,640
Don't be afraid.

915
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,780
You're not alone.

916
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:10,400
You're not alone.

917
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:10,860
There's my hand.

918
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:12,840
Hold on.

919
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,660
You are beautiful.

920
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,760
More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've ever known.

921
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,860
What is your point, Mr. Spock?

922
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,580
I love you.

923
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,220
I can love you.

924
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,660
Kiss me.

925
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,140
You're out of your mind.

926
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,240
The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago.

927
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,060
You don't really want to hurt me, do you?

928
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,060
Put that thing away.

929
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,660
No, I don't think so.

930
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,800
No, I can.

931
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,500
It's painless and quick.

932
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,260
Entry made by Second Officer Spock.

933
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,080
Possible we might have hit the wrong entry point.

934
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:55,520
Yes.

935
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,040
Very well, Captain.

936
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:57,720
Try again.

937
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,020
If it pleases you.

938
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,400
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

939
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,380
If you'll excuse the intrusion, Captain.

940
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,400
Bury the hatchet.

941
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,820
An appropriate choice of terms, Captain.

942
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,240
Keep your fucking hands off.

943
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,440
Just keep away, you green-blooded half-breed.

944
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,020
Scotty, no, wait.

945
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,020
Are you all right, Captain?

946
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,780
It's all right. I'm just a little busy.

947
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,420
I have to take him back.

948
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,040
I can't survive without him.

949
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,180
I don't want to take him back.

950
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,220
He's like an animal.

951
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,440
A thoughtless, brutal animal.

952
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,660
Here, let me give you a hand.

953
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,840
This thing can go anywhere.

954
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,380
You've not yet explained the nature of this thing.

955
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,080
She's a projectile at one-nine.

956
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,820
Get below.

957
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,800
Take command.

958
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:40,480
Eyes out.

959
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,100
You're beauty.

960
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,400
I won't fight you anymore.

961
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,860
I feel so weak.

962
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,900
I'll be glad when this is over.

963
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,600
This is impossible.

964
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,680
I'm a Vulcan.

965
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,960
What can you expect from a simpering, devil-eared freak?

966
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,060
His father was a king.

967
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,480
He had a computer and his mother an encyclopedia.

968
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,360
I'm behaving disgracefully.

969
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,300
I have eaten animal flesh and I've enjoyed it.

970
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,600
Believe me, Mr. Spock.

971
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:21,220
It was painful in more ways than one.

972
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:21,720
Eyes out.

973
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,180
Deference log, supplemental.

974
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,940
I've seen a part of myself no man should ever see.

975
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,800
I don't know why I have not been infected.

976
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,200
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

977
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,880
From both of us.

978
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:49,840
Since biblical times, man has witnessed and recorded strange manifestations in the sky

979
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:55,480
and speculated on the possibilities of visitors from another world.

980
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,980
The world is a place of the unknown.

981
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,020
The world is a place of the unknown.

982
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,260
The world is a place of the unknown.

983
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,040
The world is a place of the unknown.

984
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:06,800
The world is a place of the unknown.

985
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,380
The world is a place of the unknown.

986
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,760
Today, from the skies of California,

987
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,880
the fields of Kansas,

988
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,540
the rice paddies of the Orient,

989
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,840
the airlines of the world,

990
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:24,260
come persistent reports of UFOs,

991
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,940
unidentified flying objects which we have come to know as flying saucers.

992
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,440
The world is a place of the unknown.

993
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,840
The world is a place of the unknown.

994
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,820
Every galaxy under the Nano Galaxy

995
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:48,820


996
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:48,820


997
00:49:48,820 --> 00:50:00,040
newcin« economic probabilities,

998
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,040


999
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,420
invertebrates,

1000
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:02,420


1001
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:02,420


1002
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:08,600
Is it a beacon from a alien civilization telling man that he is not alone?

1003
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,420
Or is it a beacon from a civilization telling man that he is not alone?

1004
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,380
Or is it a beacon from a civilization telling man that he is not alone?

1005
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,720
Or is it a beacon from a civilization telling man that he is not alone?

1006
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:25,220
Or is it a beacon from a civilization telling man that he is not alone?

1007
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,000
Or is it a beacon from a civilization telling man that he is not alone?

1008
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,540
Are the creatures there in the noise?

1009
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:49,780
Or are they foul, nightmarish apparitions which will come from the stars delivering death?

1010
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,520
Who will ever be in the dark?

1011
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,920
Who will ever be in the dark?

1012
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,060
More than 50 people saw the UFO.

1013
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,400
More than 50 people saw the UFO.

1014
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,420
More than 50 people saw the UFO.

1015
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,360
You can experience a set of explanations of civilization telling man that he is not alone.

1016
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,180
not alone

1017
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,240
Are we doing what like creatures from outer space?

1018
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,580
Are we doing what like creatures from outer space?

1019
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,420
Are we doing what like creatures from outer space?

1020
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,880
Because they lived in outer space, the sounds they made were different.

1021
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,240
Until

1022
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,960
the course of all life took them turn out to the pela sus,

1023
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,400
they knew that był

1024
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,580
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1025
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:05,560
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1026
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:35,560
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1027
00:56:52,640 --> 00:57:05,540
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1028
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:35,060
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1029
00:57:35,580 --> 00:58:04,620
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1030
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:35,080
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1031
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:53,420
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1032
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:18,020
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1033
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,620
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1034
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,040
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1035
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,040
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1036
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,300
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1037
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,720
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1038
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,520
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1039
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,220
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1040
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,740
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1041
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,560
We begin to understand ourselves as a child.

1042
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,940
But I saw something beyond Bob.

1043
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:09,820
That's a good idea.

1044
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,160
That's finally you're free of this stupid church.

1045
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,220
Damn.

1046
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:20,380
And what was the nature of your vision after being, my dear son?

1047
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,860
I don't know, but...

1048
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,300
Come on now.

1049
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:23,980
I'm free! I'm free!

1050
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,160
Oh, there he goes.

1051
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,600
A little too excited for this hour of the morning, doesn't he?

1052
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,940
It is what we call the illusion of freedom.

1053
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:31,280
Freedom.

1054
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:34,600
As Jean-Paul Sartre has proven,

1055
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:38,400
that there is no such thing, objectively speaking, as freedom.

1056
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,720
It is a pour soi illusion.

1057
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:51,160
The dreadful truth too strong for that poor little J. June caller.

1058
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,420
But others may wish to participate in this one-sided colloquy here.

1059
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,720
Hal and Doug will be glad to take your messages

1060
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:00,920
and share them with you.

1061
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,880
And answer your deepest, most heartfelt questions

1062
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:09,260
about all that may puzzle you in this rat race we laughingly call...

1063
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:10,860
Life.

1064
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,180
Life and life's effluents.

1065
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:16,520
Cloud at once and shower.

1066
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,760
Forget about mom and dad.

1067
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,260
Once and for all, leave those Nelsonite beliefs at home

1068
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:25,900
and join us on the voyage called this show.

1069
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:28,460
Relax with a hot butter or martini.

1070
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,920
Slip back into slumber as your headphones...

1071
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,280
...glare at volume 10.

1072
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:38,140
Just lull into the hot, glaucous mush of that tapioca-filled hot tub

1073
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:40,780
while you drink your hot buttered rum martini

1074
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:44,080
and experience true, squishy comfort

1075
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:48,920
on the subgenius comfort zone.

1076
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,260
View on our giant-sized roast aroma television

1077
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,720
embarrassing scenes from your enemy's life.

1078
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:58,840
Oh, my God!
