00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,880
Tonight, radio's distinguished series dedicated to man's imagination.

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,080
The Soul Genius Power of Swag.

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,760
It's our way of acknowledging our American heroes.

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,960
That's what you say.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,500
We say you could act like a jackrabbit.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
With frazzled nerves and a heart pounding like a trip hammer.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,120
You gotta keep jumping. You gotta keep punching.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,300
Punch. Punch. Punch that grandfather.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,220
Ugh.

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,700
The victim can stand only so much abuse.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,940
Too many people die because they couldn't live.

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,760
Grandfather's journey is ending.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,300
He swam from the Pacific Ocean all the way up to Mount Fuji.

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,560
That's impossible, isn't it?

15
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,340
This is beyond our present knowledge or understanding.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Bob? Bob? Bob?

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,780
Good evening, Bob.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,520
Where are you going tonight, Bob?

19
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,540
Who will you be with tonight, Bob?

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,260
Where will I find you if I need you, Bob?

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,700
And there's a joint in it.

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,460
That's good.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,440
Do you know a Bob?

24
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,220
Oh, yes.

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,420
Yes.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,360
Hurry, Michael.

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,140
Bob's cool. He takes special interest in Bob.

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,140
Bob's sensitive.

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,200
Very crabber.

30
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,660
Bob smashed people.

31
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:39,880
Bob.

32
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,440
Look here, what's this all about?

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,180
You come.

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:42,720
What?

35
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,340
You come this way, please.

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,160
No. No.

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:45,960
Oh, yes.

38
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,680
No, no. I...

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,420
You are coming.

40
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,520
Oh, oh.

41
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,840
Oh.

42
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,340
Oh.

43
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,360
Oh.

44
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,820
Oh.

45
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,680
You come.

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,760
It has been my observation that when a lady starts banging some man...

47
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,320
It's sore.

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:04,860
Hard.

49
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,940
I see.

50
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,760
Very sore.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,300
Swollen.

52
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,820
You have to shoot.

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,680
Oh.

54
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,220
Oh.

55
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,620
Helps drain all cavities.

56
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,160
Such strange jokes.

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,280
Thank you, Lemur.

58
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,900
And this is not a rerun.

59
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,320
We have some jolly stuff at first.

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,660
Then it'll get somber because I have yet more...

61
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,960
Subgenius obituaries.

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,620
Then it'll get scary.

63
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,460
But then hopefully we'll have a call-in from Dr. Philo Drummond,

64
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,780
overman first degree,

65
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,700
co-sub-founder of the Subgenius Foundation and Bob's good buddy.

66
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,000
But first, well, this piece of music is a mystery to me.

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,960
The file title was Shadow Men,

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,640
and I presume that's the band.

69
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,120
And the file also had the call letter CK,

70
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,140
which is or was a small Toronto college station

71
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,960
that once had this show on every week.

72
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,580
Shadow Men.

73
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,060
¡C Gotcha!

74
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,500
I love you.

75
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,500
I love you.

76
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,720
¡C GRACIAS POR PUMPAR!

77
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:19,720


78
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:19,720


79
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,540
¡C GRACIAS POR PUMPAR!

80
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,320
I love you.

81
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,820

Hi, you old scutter.

195
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,980
My family has left for the day.

196
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,400
They've gone to get their hairs cut.

197
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:50,000
And I always thought it was funny they call it a haircut, you know, instead of a hair's cut.

198
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,760
Yeah, so if you're only going to have one special haircut.

199
00:15:52,760 --> 00:16:00,500
Or like you had just one big shaft of hair sticking out of the top of your head.

200
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,740
Boy, that would be so.

201
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,080
Like six or seven inches in diameter.

202
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,920
Right.

203
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,660
And, you know, it'd look like a horn.

204
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,460
Right.

205
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,320
It would end up looking like a big old horn, a hair horn, like a rhino.

206
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,540
It would be a lot easier to keep clean, you would think.

207
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,240
If you don't hear me talking.

208
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,440
It's because I'm propping.

209
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,200
Okay.

210
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,740
I'm trying not to waste time.

211
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,040
I was thinking about going to get a beer.

212
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,200
You should.

213
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,340
I can't hear.

214
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,060
Well, hold on.

215
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,980
I'm thinking about passing gas.

216
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,900
You can just blather.

217
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,080
The recorder is still on.

218
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,740
I'm thinking about passing gas.

219
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,740
Oops, I don't even have to think about it anymore.

220
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,220
It's actually manifested itself into reality.

221
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,820
And as a result.

222
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,240
I got to walk away for a minute.

223
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,780
Yeah.

224
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,840
This is the time.

225
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:06,540
This is the time that all men must enter their adulthood and take hold of the beer bear.

226
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,220
Beer bear.

227
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,100
A beer bear.

228
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,260
And wrangle that guy back into control.

229
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,700
Get that beer bear up with his beer belly.

230
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,020
All right.

231
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,440
Wow.

232
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,160
What's that?

233
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,140
So.

234
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,320
So, okay, Dr. Drummond.

235
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,080
I've got my.

236
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,400
I want you to fetch me a Lagunitas.

237
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,180
And.

238
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,040
Okay.

239
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,760
I've got me a Frappanitas.

240
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,960
What is that noise in the background?

241
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,060
Sounds like you're dragging a coffin across a concrete floor.

242
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,340
I was just dragging a coffin across a concrete floor.

243
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,440
Oh, okay.

244
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,680
That was a good guess on my part.

245
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,780
Yeah, very good.

246
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,220
Very good.

247
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,200
See, that's exactly.

248
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,340
Exactly what it sounds like.

249
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:53,800
Yeah.

250
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:00,700
To have drawn a carpet of concrete often across a carpeted floor.

251
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,960
It's heavy.

252
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,300
Oh, I had it backwards.

253
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,860
Anyway.

254
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,460
Anyway.

255
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,400
But we got.

256
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,160
So now it's the hour of slack number 1889.

257
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,360
Wow.

258
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,520
And I can't believe it.

259
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,140
That's.

260
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,000
That's a.

261
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,720
That's definitely a milestone.

262
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
A milestone.

263
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,100
A milestone.

264
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,140


265
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,140


266
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,140


267
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,140


268
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,140


269
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,140


270
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,140


271
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,140


272
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,140


273
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,140


274
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,540
A magnificent proportion.

275
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:23,960
Huge.

276
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,560
Huge.

277
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,480
Well.

278
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,120
Yeah.

279
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,260
Who else has done almost 2000 subgenius radio shows?

280
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,700
Well, puzzling evidence has been on since 1982 and still is.

281
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,080
And our slack started in October 1985.

282
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,240
Wow.

283
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,840
Yeah.

284
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,020
So it's been.

285
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,060
It's been.

286
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,600
I don't want to think about the math.

287
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:03,940
It's how jealous we were when Doug Wellman had his own radio show and he was doing stuff

288
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,740
and sending his tapes.

289
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,920
Man, we had to do that.

290
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,740
It's amazing how competitive we were back then with our friends.

291
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, yeah.

292
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,740
But once once I finally got a show.

293
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,420
I played a whole lot of their their show, you know.

294
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:21,800
Yeah.

295
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,280
Because.

296
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,760
Oh, yeah.

297
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,060
It was so, so great.

298
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,880
The parts that you could hear were really great.

299
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,780
Then there were the other parts.

300
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,540
Yeah.

301
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,820
That you no one would want to hear.

302
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,640
Except puzzling evidence in headphones.

303
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,060
Right.

304
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,580
Well, I wanted to hear them.

305
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,480
You know, I like to hear all the bad and the good.

306
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,880
The good and the bad.

307
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,880
That's very.

308
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,560
Noble.

309
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,720
Yeah.

310
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,280
Noble of me.

311
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:46,700
Yeah.

312
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:46,980
Yeah.

313
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,900
I like that.

314
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,680
Well, OK.

315
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,000
To listeners who don't know anything, we're the two original cool guys that Bob first

316
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,620
recruited.

317
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:05,900
And we we we allow a small group of other almost as cool guys to hang out.

318
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,880
We shouldn't talk that way.

319
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,480
They get real mad when we do that.

320
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,000
You better cut this part out of the show.

321
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,660
That's right.

322
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,060
But it's true, though.

323
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,900
There's the handsome and mature.

324
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,300
Gents are few and far between.

325
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,020
But we're especially lead squad of subgenius hierarchites.

326
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,120
Right.

327
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:26,480
Yeah.

328
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,320
We make big decisions in the background.

329
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,780
So, OK.

330
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,620
OK.

331
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,020
Onan sent me this letter.

332
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,460
And when he wants to tell me something real, I mean, we talk all the time and text and

333
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:40,820
stuff.

334
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,580
But when he wants me to take something real seriously, he'll actually send it by mail.

335
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,800
You know, I was dragging my feet.

336
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,860
I'm getting that agent and Mr. Dobbs book out, which bothered him because he had actually

337
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,760
done all the layout and work himself.

338
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,840
Yeah.

339
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,460
And he's waiting for you to put your imprimatur on it.

340
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,340
Your imprimatur.

341
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:10,140
I got this immensely heavy box in the mail that probably cost 50 bucks to mail from him.

342
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:17,440
And inside was a brick with the word agent and Mr. Dobbs written in charcoal on it.

343
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,360
And basically, I had to carry that brick around until I got that job done.

344
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,760
And we did get the hardcover.

345
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,480
We got the $50 hardcover edition is out and all sold out.

346
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,820
And then I dragged my feet on the paperback.

347
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:39,900
But by the time people hear this tonight, I'll have that purchase button on subgenius.com

348
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,820
in the book section.

349
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,960
And people can buy the agent and Mr. Dobbs, which is hilarious.

350
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,700
It is hilarious.

351
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,160
Yes.

352
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,400
I've got my actually have my copy here.

353
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,660
Yeah.

354
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,800
Right here in front of me.

355
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,160
It's very much like a cross between H.P.

356
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,780
Lovecraft and the Three Stooges.

357
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,260
Yeah.

358
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,420
Right.

359
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,840
It is.

360
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,600
And that could be done.

361
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,720
That could be done.

362
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,700
It captures what does it.

363
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,660
It captures the essence of Bob better than just about anything else.

364
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,200
Anybody's done, including me.

365
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,360
It's amazing.

366
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah.

367
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,140
Yeah.

368
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,380
Yeah.

369
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:17,420
Yeah.

370
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


371
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


372
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


373
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


374
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


375
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


376
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


377
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


378
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


379
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


380
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


381
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,420


382
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,700
People would be, you know, if they I could just say that, you know, that that particular

383
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,180
line about any H.P.

384
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:31,500
Lovecraft fan or and any three Stooges fan, you don't have to be both.

385
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:39,780
You could just be one or the other and still find this to be a very interesting and revealing,

386
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,260
if not enlightening book.

387
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,460
Yeah.

388
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,840
Mainly, it's just really funny.

389
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,200
Yeah, it's funny.

390
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,020
You know, here's here's the weird thing.

391
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:54,920
I have not heard back from Teeters Laverge since I sent him the first copies of the hardcover.

392
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,580
Maybe he got drunk in celebration and is still celebrating.

393
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,000
Well, another thing.

394
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,200
He was still on Facebook, but he was talking about Ukraine.

395
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,080
I think he's, you know, from a Ukrainian background.

396
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,580
Oh, despite the name fighter Laverge.

397
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,060
Yeah, right.

398
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,680
I don't know.

399
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,500
You know, it could be.

400
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,960
I don't know.

401
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,660
But it could be that Laverge may be a subgenius name.

402
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,960
It may not be actually a birth name.

403
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,840
Teeters Laverge.

404
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,580
It might not be his conspiracy name.

405
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,520
He might have some real dull name like.

406
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,480
Yeah.

407
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,100
Bill Smith or.

408
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,900
No, it's going to be.

409
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,920
It's going to be a Ukrainian name.

410
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:46,640
It's going to be like, you know, Vladimir Shmugmoid or whatever they have over there.

411
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,480
Mm hmm.

412
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:56,740
OK, well, anyway, here's this letter that Onan sent and it's kind of the first page is pretty short.

413
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,480
Then there's a short story, a true story about P.T.

414
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,460
Barnum and Grizzly Adams.

415
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,400
Oh, but get this.

416
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,220
Please stop hour of slack.

417
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,900
Please stop at any day at any time unannounced or no.

418
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,460
Stop.

419
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,160
Lots of work.

420
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,000
Lots of time.

421
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,960
Little pay.

422
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,300
Much complaining.

423
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,980
And, you know, you guys and my wife hear the complaining.

424
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:39,240
In fact, Princess Wee said that I'd been complaining about having to do this stupid show as long as she knew me, which was 1990 or something.

425
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,680
Anyway, Onan says, you won.

426
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,760
You outlasted most paid career DJs.

427
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,880
And it's true.

428
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:54,780
Hour of Slack has been on longer than than Johnny Carson or what's his name?

429
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,000
Or we ought to work on like a Wikipedia page just for our slack.

430
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:07,180
Well, there is there is one book, a groundbreaking show that lasted longer than everything else.

431
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,920
You know, yeah, but all the ground was totally broken afterwards.

432
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,980
It's completely broken.

433
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,660
Yes.

434
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,320
Soft.

435
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,280
It's completely soft and mushy now.

436
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:16,820
Can't even.

437
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,520
You can't repair it.

438
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,440
You can't.

439
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,240
You can't grow anything in it.

440
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,800
No.

441
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,080
Anyway, he says, free up that complaining for something else.

442
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,820
Permission granted.

443
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:34,380
The listeners don't know this, but I really I really do complain because it's a routine.

444
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,600
It's not just.

445
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:42,660
There's all this other stuff I have to do that a nutless chimpanzee could do my job.

446
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,480
If only I could train him to read numbers.

447
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,940
He says.

448
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,580
He might.

449
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,060
He might need one.

450
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,280
He says every X day.

451
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,180
Oh, yeah.

452
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,600
That's not funny.

453
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:53,900
Dr.

454
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,300
Drummond.

455
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,260
Every X day and revival has a curtain.

456
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,560
Every book has a back cover.

457
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,280
And yet subgenius rolls on and you roll on.

458
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,520
I am specifically not saying to switch to any other anything.

459
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,880
Not web, not books, not dogs, not anything.

460
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,740
Just stop doing the one thing over and over as if there will be a different result.

461
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,460
Whatever it is, are you making it better or are you making it worse?

462
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:28,860
And, you know, I've been I've sort of been begging for permission to quit this weekly routine for a long time.

463
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,140
And, you know, let's face it.

464
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,240
There's 2000 shows that anybody can listen to any time, any time or play on their own station or podcast.

465
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,220
That's right.

466
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,280
I even call them up there.

467
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,900
They're retrievable.

468
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,720
They're like archived and all ready to go.

469
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,500
Anybody could even mechanize that process if they wanted to.

470
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,100
Actually, some stations did.

471
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,240
I think already.

472
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,740
But it's simple.

473
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:02,820
You know, it's like I'm I'm one hundred and sixty eight years old.

474
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,420
And I'm I'm everything's taken longer.

475
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,820
It takes you were that sacred scribe for that other religion before this one.

476
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:12,960
Why?

477
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,060
We don't talk about that.

478
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,760
But there's you know, there.

479
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,240
I'm still sacred scribe number two hundred and seventy three.

480
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,460
But there's there's going to be a number two hundred and seventy four.

481
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,880
Yeah.

482
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,420
And I think he's all I think he's all.

483
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,780
I think it's probably going to be.

484
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah, he's probably already.

485
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,260
I think he's like in his, you know, journeyman phase.

486
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,220
Yeah.

487
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,680
You know, he's more than an apprentice now.

488
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,240
He's actually graduated up almost to yeoman.

489
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,500
Well.

490
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,460
Right.

491
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,560
Right.

492
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,760
Well, he.

493
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,560
Well, and he's done his own.

494
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:57,300
He did the man of books and his own podcast and things.

495
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,060
He's done.

496
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,920
He actually at one point offered a man of letters.

497
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,040
He he offered to take over the show at one point.

498
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,740
But, you know, I don't want to do that.

499
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,580
It'd be it would be a different show.

500
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,280
Wouldn't be the hour.

501
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,540
Yeah, that's right.

502
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,900
And and we're not getting the contributions.

503
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,540
You know, there's no lemur.

504
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,280
We're not making out new stuff anymore.

505
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,380
Yeah.

506
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,720
That's all from the olden days.

507
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,920
Yeah.

508
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:28,400
So the content is, you know, the content is harder to come by and not just.

509
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,620
But that's not really.

510
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,520
It's not that.

511
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,880
And here's another thing.

512
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,280
I'm not an angry young man anymore.

513
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,180
Right.

514
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,220
I'm angry.

515
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:36,880
Old man.

516
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,180
Yeah.

517
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,360
Well, I'm angry at chronic diseases and and aches and pains and that kind of.

518
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,820
Who isn't angry at that, though?

519
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,200
I mean, that's everybody's anger.

520
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,660
You know.

521
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,480
No, not everybody.

522
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,000
Everybody.

523
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,000


524
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,000


525
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,000


526
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,720
It's chronic pain.

527
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,460
Believe me.

528
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,120
Not like you.

529
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,960
Not like you.

530
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:56,920
Hey, we remember a long time ago we needed units of measurement for things like pain

531
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,500
and slack and confusion.

532
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,280
Yeah.

533
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,500
And inebriation.

534
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:08,920
And the first we most immediately landed on drummonds of or was it phylos of slack and

535
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,620
phylos of slack and stangs of pain.

536
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,860
And that may have been a self-fulfilling prophecy.

537
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,060
Man, we should have been given.

538
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,140
We should have given old Stang some upside.

539
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,140
Well, there was Jane's of confusion.

540
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,640
And I think sternos of inebriation.

541
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,960
And I forget what some of the other ones were.

542
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,440
But I don't remember.

543
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,240
That may have all been cut from Revelation X.

544
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,260
Yeah.

545
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,980
Just think about all the stuff that got cut.

546
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,240
Well, that see, there's another whole half a book right there.

547
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:51,520
And I'd like to be scanning old things that were never published that happened before

548
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,020
the Internet.

549
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:58,020
But after we quit publishing because the postage cost too much and it was too hard.

550
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,400
And I always lost my shirt.

551
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,420
Yeah.

552
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:01,940
On this.

553
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,680
Do you remember what the Reverend Stang?

554
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,820
Do you remember when the Internet was just like seven guys with tape decks?

555
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,820
Yeah.

556
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,440
Right.

557
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,060
That was our Internet.

558
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:12,820
Yeah.

559
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,280
That was the only that was the only worthwhile.

560
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,840
Part of the Internet.

561
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,420
It was very slow and it was mostly audio, but it was mobile.

562
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,420
I mean, we would record.

563
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,560
We would talk to each other and do stuff.

564
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,360
And it was fun.

565
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,360
Really fun.

566
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,020
Yeah.

567
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,260
Well, but we all had we all had horrible real life jobs then.

568
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,740
And we needed that fun.

569
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,680
We had when we managed to take a break, we didn't waste it.

570
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,040
No kidding.

571
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,820
Whereas now we're kind of jaded in that respect.

572
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,800
And both of us have.

573
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,240
We have farming chores that we.

574
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,020
Yeah.

575
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,940
I got animals to feed and.

576
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,280
Right.

577
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,980
And crops to harvest.

578
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,100
Yeah.

579
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,000
It's.

580
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,460
I got.

581
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,600
I got some crops.

582
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,680
And the squash has been coming in.

583
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,140
Whoo.

584
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:04,880
Yeah.

585
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,080
I saw those pictures.

586
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:14,440
Dr. Drummond actually has a farm and with crops and because it rains and he has dirt.

587
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,560
Yeah.

588
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:15,840
Yeah.

589
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:22,140
I have a very big garden, but it's in pots because our dirt is not really.

590
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,600
It's.

591
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:23,780
Yeah.

592
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,920
I feel sorry for your dirt, man, because our dirt is so is just like you just plant.

593
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,860
You just put seeds in it and they grow.

594
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,660
Well, you put cactus seeds in this stuff and it'll grow and see.

595
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,360
Well, that's true.

596
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,120
Yeah.

597
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,260
But yeah, it's like you put it.

598
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:40,800
You said it.

599
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,840
Well, you said it was this land had an ornamental dusting of dirt.

600
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,800
Over a foundation of solid limestone.

601
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,800
Yeah.

602
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,400
That's what it is.

603
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,060
I was just.

604
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:57,200
That's just where the limestone got worn down a little bit and turned into dirt.

605
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,300
The limestone is all made of dead sea creatures.

606
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,080
Shell.

607
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,480
Yeah.

608
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,900
It actually is.

609
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,740
I mean, if you look at it real close.

610
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,100
In a lot of areas.

611
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:15,600
If you know what you're looking at, you're looking at ancient eroded seashells that were

612
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,240
piled up for billions and billions of years.

613
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:22,920
So.

614
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,960
Oh, here's.

615
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,420
Oh, here's the rest of this letter about the quit in the hour.

616
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:26,760
Yeah.

617
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,120
And, you know, I have.

618
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,660
I hate to admit it, but I have been thinking about it for about 25 years.

619
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,300
My first wife was so happy when I got kicked off K and she thought I would stop.

620
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,580
But I just kept making tapes and sending them to the other stations.

621
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,820
Anyway, here's.

622
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,180
Here's.

623
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,360
More in.

624
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,200
In Onan's excellent handwriting.

625
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,560
One day, a man made an appointment to see P.T.

626
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,360
Barnum at his American Museum.

627
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,800
The visitor was known to Barnum.

628
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
Grizzly Adams.

629
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,980
Mr. Adams was begging for a job.

630
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,760
Barnum put him to work wrestling bears.

631
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,620
After a time, Barnum asked Adams to come to his office and say how things were going.

632
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,080
Adams had taken the job to pay for his children's education.

633
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,820
So that they did not have to wrestle bears past retirement.

634
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,960
Adams appeared in Barnum's office but left his animal skin cap on.

635
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,520
Barnum said he was accustomed to men removing their hat in his office.

636
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:34,280
Adams removed his hat and so revealed a great wound on his head.

637
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,700
Adams explained a bear had bitten him, removing flesh and part of his skull.

638
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,500
But he didn't want to quit for his children.

639
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,960
Barnum wrote out a check.

640
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,660
He was asked to pay for his children's education and fired him on the spot.

641
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,360
Don't be Grizzly Adams.

642
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,060
So I think what Onan is saying is that, you know, I've been bitten by the bear enough times.

643
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,520
And my children are past the age of education.

644
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,380
And it is getting.

645
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,660
That is frightening.

646
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,840
Doing those links every week.

647
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,500
It's the linking and the, you know, and you have to write a blurb.

648
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,120
You have to write a little blurb about it.

649
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,440
Yeah, that's the blurb always got me.

650
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,980
I could do all the mechanical stuff, but the blurb, man, you had to take time.

651
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,840
You actually had to listen to the show and make.

652
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah.

653
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,820
Oh, yeah.

654
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,160
My website has logs.

655
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:34,820
Blurbing.

656
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,240
Of just about everything.

657
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,520
You know, any show that has less than 100 cuts, I'll usually have a log of it.

658
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,220
Yeah.

659
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,740
It's really just the file names.

660
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,680
Yeah.

661
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,660
They were played.

662
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,080
But, you know, it's a lot of stuff and it's all still there.

663
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:56,700
And, you know, if I get a wild hair, we do something that's really amazing.

664
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,540
Yeah, a special show.

665
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:04,080
You know, I can always tack it on as, you know, here's an hour of like annual special.

666
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,740
It'd be like the Ewok special for Steven Spielberg, you know?

667
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,120
That was George Lucas.

668
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,200
The Christmas, the Star Wars.

669
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,520
Yeah, the Star Wars.

670
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,440
Christmas special.

671
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:15,600
Christmas special.

672
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,040
You need a, you'll have an hour of that Christmas special.

673
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,160
That's so bad that people can't, that it's a collector's item.

674
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,780
It becomes a cult classic because it's just whole total badness.

675
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,640
You know?

676
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,540
People have to seek it out.

677
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,660
Well, that would.

678
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,260
Artificially restricted supply.

679
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:41,080
That would be when Princess Wee and I finally record our 17-minute rock dog opera, Buddy,

680
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,800
based on Tommy.

681
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,880
You read the lyrics.

682
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,020
You thought they were hilarious.

683
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,140
Yeah.

684
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,560
We're ready to go.

685
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:54,760
I actually have, I found a website that pulls the vocals out of sound.

686
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,180
Wow.

687
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:03,060
And I used the Live at Leeds version of Tommy and removed the vocals.

688
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,320
It sounds a little weird.

689
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,140
And, of course, Princess Wee is almost a professional singer.

690
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,300
Yeah, she can actually sing, but you are different.

691
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,040
Yeah, I'm a little different.

692
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:14,960


693
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:22,280
Dave, Reverend Angry Larry said, I want to help you do that just so you won't be the

694
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,840
one singing.

695
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,560
Yeah, you know, I miss him.

696
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,960
I used to get to see him every year, and at least once a year, and now I don't get to

697
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,680
see him anymore.

698
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,140
So that's the bad, sad thing about X Day being a do-it-yourself thing.

699
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,320
Oh, Reverend Angry Larry.

700
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,220
Yeah.

701
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

702
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,580
I mean, well, here at my house for some, like, for five people.

703
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,220
Yeah.

704
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,040
But it's too late now.

705
00:36:52,700 --> 00:37:00,000
Well, I mean, no, you know, Reverend Zanthia is going to start her resort up again.

706
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,600
She's got new land, and she's moving the weird domes and buildings and all of her stuff.

707
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,580
I don't know where she gets the energy.

708
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,600
Oh, now I remember.

709
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,460
She's never done, she doesn't do drugs.

710
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,440
Oh.

711
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,300
She didn't really drink or frop or anything.

712
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,580
Man, I don't know if I like people like that.

713
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,040
Oh, she's wonderful, actually.

714
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,920
She's great, but she's an overachiever.

715
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,440
She always looks like she's kind of in pain in those pictures.

716
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:38,940
I think it's just the artificial irises.

717
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
The irises, that's what does it.

718
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,080
Oh, the contact lenses?

719
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,260
Yeah.

720
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,500
Yeah.

721
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:50,040
Well, she sure does work hard in her skimpy, skimpy costumes.

722
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,540
You sure can tell that, for sure.

723
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,500
A lot of subgeniuses went, I don't know, how can she be a subgenius?

724
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,220
She's too beautiful and too, I don't know.

725
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,420
Right.

726
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,520
She's too, I don't know.

727
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,940
She's actually come to this house and was really cool.

728
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,260
I've stayed at her house, but she's moving.

729
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,560
But we still might have ex-days in Florida.

730
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,960
However, right now, because of my situation, I can't leave.

731
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:24,700
We're going to have an ex-day here, just me and Princess Wee and Wee Mama,

732
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:31,320
who is mostly pretty out of it because she's heading for the saucers.

733
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,820
That's why I can't go anywhere.

734
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,040
Yeah.

735
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:42,540
And so I would love to do that stuff again, but I'm not ever going to go.

736
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,780
I'm going to go back to Ohio.

737
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:44,980
Oh, no.

738
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:50,140
I don't want to get on airplanes, and I can't carry luggage anymore.

739
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,800
That's what broke my back was all those ex-days, packing the car, unpacking it in a big hurry.

740
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:03,540
I can remember every time I picked up a case wrong and went, oh, that was a mistake.

741
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,000
You had a pinched nerve recently, right?

742
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,280
Yeah.

743
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,240
I got over my pinched nerve.

744
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,540
That's something that I would get almost every day.

745
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,360
Every ex-day and suffer through it.

746
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,360
Oh, man.

747
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,740
That's why you mentioned that I grunted incessantly.

748
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,020
Yeah.

749
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,760
My grunting has only gotten more constant and louder.

750
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,820
Yeah, and it drives people.

751
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,320
It actually makes people feel sorry for you.

752
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,240
I know, because I'm always going, ah.

753
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,060
But then the other day, not too long ago, actually, maybe a little while ago,

754
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,460
I noticed I was grunting a lot more.

755
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,440
Like, wait, why am I grunting?

756
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:54,740
Well, folks, it's just a sign that happens that you're transitioning into a different phase of existence.

757
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,800
Yeah, a skeleton.

758
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
One that you need to maximize.

759
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,140
You know, it's like I was telling somebody the other day,

760
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:06,660
is that every age of man has its advantages and disadvantages.

761
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:11,820
And you don't want to get all bogged down in the disadvantages of being an old man.

762
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,540
Right.

763
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


764
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


765
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


766
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


767
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


768
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


769
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


770
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


771
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


772
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


773
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:12,540


774
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,080
That you forget about the advantages.

775
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,400
It's great.

776
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,820
If you look around, you know, you're always getting a discount on a buffet somewhere.

777
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,940
That's true.

778
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,060
That's true.

779
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,560
Princess, we go shopping on Tuesdays and Thursdays because that's old folks' 5% off day.

780
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,120
Yeah, see, people always want to go to McDonald's.

781
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,300
They give me coffee for like 70 cents.

782
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,480
Yeah, the first time that happened, I didn't ask, and I didn't understand.

783
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,860
I looked at it and went, oh, man.

784
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,240
They can.

785
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,960
They did that.

786
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,040
I didn't even ask.

787
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,760
You know, they gave me a senior discount.

788
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,880
And that was 15 years ago.

789
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,240
So my point is just don't forget.

790
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,760
You know, every age is a special time, and you got to live it.

791
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,040
Live it.

792
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,760
Live it or lose it.

793
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:07,460
Dolomite said something about when I get old, Dolomite's not going to lay around and feel sad.

794
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,420
He's going to get his kicks thinking about all the swinging times that he's had.

795
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,180
That's exactly right.

796
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,920
Dolomite was, you know, he was a great philosopher.

797
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,840
Yeah, but he's dead.

798
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,000
Yeah.

799
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,780
Well, nobody lasts forever.

800
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,600
That's for sure.

801
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,880
Some of us are lucky if we make it to, you know, 70, 80, 90.

802
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,900
Well, that's the thing.

803
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,480
We're lucky.

804
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,660
We're already lucky.

805
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,580
Yeah.

806
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:41,680
I mean, I think 73 is the average age of a white man in America.

807
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,280
Yeah.

808
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,600
It's about that.

809
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,600
It's a good lifespan.

810
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:50,880
If you're a 73-year-old subgenius right now, you're a lucky son of a buck.

811
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,620
Yeah.

812
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,720
Think how many are dead.

813
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,360
Son of a mother buck.

814
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,140
I read the list earlier before you were on.

815
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:05,620
It's a long list of people who are already on the saucers.

816
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,340
Oh, well.

817
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,880
Already made it up there.

818
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,460
They're reading their old comic book collection right now.

819
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:10,600
Yeah.

820
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,040
And all good things must come to an end.

821
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:21,960
And we're thinking maybe show number 2,000, which is 10 shows from now, maybe that, we

822
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,940
can say, will be the last show.

823
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:24,940
But wait.

824
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,660
What symbology does 2,000 have?

825
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,360
Nothing.

826
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,320
I mean-

827
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,820
Doesn't 1998 have a much better symbology?

828
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,140
Yeah, that would only be eight more shows.

829
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,560
Eight more shows.

830
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,060
I like that.

831
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,340
Yeah.

832
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,020
1998.

833
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,120
That's it.

834
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,540
Yeah.

835
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,240
2,000.

836
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,520
Anybody would end their career at 2,000.

837
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,080
Anybody can end there because it's round.

838
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,340
You know, the first thing somebody said is, oh, you're going to be 2,000.

839
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,400
You're going to stop it at 2,000.

840
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:50,840
Oh, wait a minute.

841
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,780
I just thought about something.

842
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,620
That's another 100 shows from now.

843
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,960
I would actually have to stop at 1,900 because we're at 1,889.

844
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,980
Yeah, that's-

845
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,720
Oh, damn.

846
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:02,580
Yes.

847
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,000
That wrecks the whole thing.

848
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:04,760
1,900.

849
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,820
Who cares about that?

850
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:06,780
Yeah.

851
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,780
Who cares about that?

852
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,580
You know what?

853
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,320
What would Onan would say?

854
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,320
Onan would say, 1,889.

855
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:10,440
Onan would say, 1,889.

856
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:10,440


857
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,560
We'll just end it right now.

858
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,420
That's it.

859
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,480
And we could just turn the recorders off right now and say, okay.

860
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:16,940
Yeah.

861
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,220
And that'd be it.

862
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,940
I'm not going to do that, though.

863
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:27,440
I'm going to play Doc Stock Mountain, High on Doc Stock Mountain from the Soak Your

864
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,220
Butt album by the Swinging Love Corpses.

865
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,420
Why does this one sound so much better than the one I've played?

866
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,780
Because this one was actually recorded in our little basement studio, you know, when

867
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:40,440
we were-

868
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


869
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


870
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


871
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


872
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


873
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


874
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


875
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


876
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


877
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


878
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


879
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


880
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


881
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


882
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


883
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


884
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,440


885
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,000
We were trying to practice and do things well.

886
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,400
We weren't actually in a-

887
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,180
Not that we weren't trying to do things well in a show.

888
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,380
It wasn't in that-

889
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:48,900
Right.

890
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,700
It's just harder to get a good recording.

891
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:51,640
Yeah.

892
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,640
And we never had good mics or good recording attempts.

893
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,480
We were too worried about doing a show.

894
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,140
Right.

895
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,140
And unfortunately, never had really good live recordings.

896
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,040
Well, there's some.

897
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:09,120
I think some of my best of Swinging Love Corpses is live, but it was just, you know, it was

898
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,940
collected from-

899
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,000
Old tapes.

900
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,640
So anyway, this is about the Doc Stocks that we used to-

901
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,660
Actually, Sterno, you might say, was the host of those in Arkansas.

902
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,640
Yeah.

903
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,880
They were secret subgenius gatherings that only like 20 or 30 people and maybe their

904
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,880
spouses and kids would even be invited to.

905
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,560
And they were pretty wild.

906
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:39,620
And everybody would jam and rant and swim in the lake.

907
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,100
Sometimes.

908
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:40,500
Yeah.

909
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,480
Those were great.

910
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,200
So anyway, here's a song about it.

911
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,840
High on Doc Stock Mountain.

912
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:50,660
Okay.

913
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,980
That's where we play the song.

914
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,140
Howdy Mopter.

915
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,060
That's right.

916
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,400
Several mountains, many close to us you may be so far to where I live.

917
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,040
By the way, that's a local bass track band.

918
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


919
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,120
You debt.

920
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,440
Let's take a a deep breath.

921
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,800
retour to the we識

922
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,200
This is a soft ska-

923
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,320
I like this.

924
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:39,320


925
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,100
Can I make a love song here?

926
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:40,440
I know the blues.

927
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,040
awakening and talk, talk and talk.

928
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,200
They shared peace and love and great times.

929
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,060
The journey was there and they were feeling fine.

930
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,060
Bobby was there, but they weren't you.

931
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,200
There was mostly cool guys like me and you.

932
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,900
And we got high, so high, talk, talk, talk, how's it?

933
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:13,060
Yeah, we got high, so high, talk, talk, talk, how's it?

934
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,660
We ate lots of mushrooms to commune with nature.

935
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,640
How are we to know we got to move our shit later?

936
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,660
500 colors flashed into my brain.

937
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,620
My cell division occurred in three or four planes.

938
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,020
My brain was blasted.

939
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,880
My head was blown.

940
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:34,880


941
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,680
I was feeling thick.

942
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,500
My eyeballs protruded, but I didn't get sick.

943
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,780
We packed up my tips, but we kept seeing dots.

944
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,860
Then we found that the peaks had gotten all the best spots.

945
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:53,560
So we got high, so high, talk, talk, talk, how's it?

946
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:01,640
Yeah, we got high, so high, talk, talk, talk, how's it?

947
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,820
Yeah, we got high, so high, talk, talk, how's it?

948
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:08,100
People were happy, they were all having fun.

949
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,200
While Dr. Sir Bob was farming skulls in the sun.

950
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,180
The corpses were swinging, their love did abound.

951
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,300
The average corpse floated a foot off the ground.

952
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:24,380
The band that they're not was speaking its name.

953
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,460
While half-doctors on the glam show was claiming their fame.

954
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,560
Farthog explosion and comedy.

955
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,760
The cocaine fudge.

956
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,420
Finish this sin.

957
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,380
Just in time for life.

958
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:42,060
Then we got high, so high, talk, talk, talk, how's it?

959
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:50,580
Then we got high, so high, talk, talk, talk, how's it?

960
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:55,940
How's it?

961
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,440
Goodness.

962
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,700
Hey!

963
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,900
äs

964
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,840
Was legend of an funk rock if it didn't start now…

965
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:19,840


966
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:25,060
Well, I'llanamoo-

967
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,440
We've got high tamon on the peck.

968
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,600
That gr ella!

969
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,200
I'm gonna go back there

970
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,060
I'll even meet the Pope

971
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,120
Better make it to Doc Doc

972
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,040
Or just give up hope

973
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,160
The dead will be walking

974
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,900
Maybe Bob will appear

975
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,440
The sound of chainsaws

976
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,100
Will be all that you hear

977
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,140
Now I'm gonna go back

978
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,140
And I won't be stopped

979
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,100
I'm gonna go back

980
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,300
To smoke the ultimate frown

981
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,180
You just can't imagine

982
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,200
What it's like to you go

983
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,520
When reality's on hold

984
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,520
And Doc Doc's the show

985
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,860
We got high

986
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,060
High

987
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,280
On Doc Doc

988
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,060
We got high

989
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,160
High

990
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,560
On Doc Doc

991
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,120
We got high

992
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:30,120


993
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,000
Oh yeah

994
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,420
I was way up high on Doc Doc Mountain

995
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,020
I climbed down

996
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,340
I climbed up all the way to the top

997
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,900
I took everything you could think of

998
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,240
I shot beer

999
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,840
I smoked heroin

1000
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,860
I started marijuana

1001
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,840
I stuck

1002
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,980
I stuck

1003
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,400
I slipped glue

1004
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,320
I put

1005
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,120
I put

1006
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,460
I got them drops

1007
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:03,940
Baravor

1008
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,020
ının

1009
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,040
I got stuck up there on top of Doc's talk partir

1010
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,920
because the song was over before I could ever come down.

1011
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,280
So now I'm lost in a dog-stalk,

1012
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,280
frolopulated, hell-neither-world

1013
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,220
in the song.

1014
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,300
Man, okay, tell me when you're going to go back into the show

1015
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,160
and we can talk about how awesome that was.

1016
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:49,900
Okay.

1017
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,840
Because, you know, that particular one,

1018
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,120
I really dragged out.

1019
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,820
Yeah, okay, one, two,

1020
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,520
one, two, three, go.

1021
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,800
Man, that was so awesome.

1022
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,120
Yeah, that was a great version.

1023
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,060
I think we were probably a little bit inebriated

1024
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,140
or something during that one.

1025
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,500
That's you singing mostly, not your brother, isn't it?

1026
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,060
Yeah, that's my brother, my cousin,

1027
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,200
singing in the background vocals.

1028
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,020
And I was singing lead there.

1029
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:23,320
Yeah, and Colonel Sphinx Drummond traded off a lot.

1030
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:24,980
Right.

1031
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,480
We traded songs.

1032
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,940
Generally, we didn't trade in a song.

1033
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,740
You know, he'd do one or I'd do another,

1034
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,840
and then we'd trade backup parts,

1035
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,260
things like that.

1036
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,360
Every now and then, my cousin, my brother-cousin,

1037
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,020
would do some vocals.

1038
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,120
Dr. Ray Hay.

1039
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,900
Dr. Ray Hay, right.

1040
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,840
And, yeah, I'm actually in the process right now

1041
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,100
of getting all of the,

1042
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,800
all of the,

1043
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:54,800


1044
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:54,800


1045
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:54,800


1046
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:54,800


1047
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:54,800


1048
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:54,800


1049
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:54,800


1050
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,440
all of the live footage in one place.

1051
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,280
So I can,

1052
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,760
my plan is to make this little bit of a playlist

1053
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,240
kind of a thing that anybody that wanted it

1054
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,420
could easily watch all of the live footage

1055
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:12,800
that I have of Swingin' Love Corpses.

1056
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,180
Listeners, the Swingin' Love Corpses

1057
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,700
were long before Spinal Tap.

1058
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,740
And yet, there's a lot of similarities.

1059
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,120
Sure.

1060
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,920
There's a lot of differences, too.

1061
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,460
There's a whole lot of differences, but...

1062
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,560
We played a role.

1063
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,300
You know, we were a band that was a famous touring band

1064
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,700
that had met harder times

1065
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,180
and was doing local shows again.

1066
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,880
And our tours may have only been like two stops

1067
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,220
in the U.S. that year.

1068
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,520
Yeah, like the Subgenius World tours.

1069
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,580
Yeah.

1070
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:51,980
Yeah.

1071
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,780
And so,

1072
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,780
but yeah, we played that role

1073
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,280
and it was a lot of fun.

1074
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,720
And we all had wigs.

1075
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,700
In fact, that was one of our few rules

1076
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,520
is that you could not appear on stage

1077
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,980
without your wig on.

1078
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,080
Yeah, they had,

1079
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,880
and wild costumes,

1080
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,220
very tasteless

1081
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,060
and crazy outfits.

1082
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:17,140
Yeah, our outfits were based on some hippie's nightmare.

1083
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,020
Yeah.

1084
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,940
A bad trip.

1085
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,260
A bad trip.

1086
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:21,440
Yeah.

1087
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,740
A hippie's bad trip.

1088
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,260
Yeah.

1089
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,780
And there was great spazz dancing

1090
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,340
during the instrumental parts.

1091
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:31,440
Yeah, we had, in fact, we talked about just recently

1092
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,940
how we had a character named Beetle Bob

1093
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:38,560
who would show up at our shows and he was really tall

1094
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,660
and he would stand right in front

1095
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:44,240
and do the craziest dancing right in the middle.

1096
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:44,780
Right.

1097
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,940
Now, unfortunately, people couldn't see me as well

1098
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:52,800
when Beetle Bob was there, even though I admired his dancing

1099
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,320
and didn't want to lose his draw appeal.

1100
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,400
So what we did is we would prepare,

1101
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,320
because Beetle Bob came to every show,

1102
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,760
we got some, like, that kind of tape

1103
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,440
that they tape off where, you know,

1104
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,660
where the bottom fell.

1105
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,060
Crime scene.

1106
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:09,720
Crime scene tape.

1107
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,380
And we taped off an area

1108
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,320
and then designated it Beetle Bob only.

1109
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,660
Over on the side, right?

1110
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,020
Oh, it was on the side.

1111
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:20,320
Yeah.

1112
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,520
But up front, right up front next to the stage.

1113
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:22,760
Yeah.

1114
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,700
A little over to the side

1115
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:28,020
so that he wouldn't obscure the audience's view of me.

1116
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:33,480
I always used to videotape my favorite bands like yours

1117
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:38,160
and the Amino Acids from the side of the stage.

1118
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:41,800
So my right ear was pointing directly at the main speakers

1119
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,440
and that's why I can't hear anything in my right ear.

1120
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:44,820
Yeah.

1121
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,060
Yeah.

1122
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:46,860
Isn't that funny?

1123
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,460
It'll do it to you.

1124
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,940
It's funny, but only in an ironic sense.

1125
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,460
So anyway, let's play one more Swingin' Love Corpses song.

1126
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,620
And this one's an instrumental

1127
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:59,500
that you just posted recently I'd never heard.

1128
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,640
And the title of this one is

1129
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:07,460
Rock Roll Led Zepp with Rubbit Planet Voice Horn Parts.

1130
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,720
All one word.

1131
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,040
There you go.

1132
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,040
That's pretty much a good description.

1133
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,620
Dot wave.

1134
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,380
We can climb up on Doc's Doc Mountain

1135
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,420
while that song plays.

1136
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:19,680
Yeah, okay.

1137
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,300
We know what that means.

1138
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,140
Okay, here goes.

1139
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:23,340
Yeah.

1140
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,500
Yeah.

1141
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:32,840
Yeah.

1142
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:42,980
Yeah.

1143
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:43,740
Yeah.

1144
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:45,320


1145
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:45,600
Yeah.

1146
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,340
Yeah.

1147
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:46,340


1148
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:46,720
Yeah.

1149
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:46,900
Yeah.

1150
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,400
Yeah.

1151
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,620
Thank you.

1152
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,340
Thank you.

1153
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,000
Thank you.

1154
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,680
Thank you.

1155
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,120
Thank you.

1156
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,580
Thank you.

1157
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,940
Thank you.

1158
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,800
Thank you.

1159
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,960
Thank you.

1160
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,300
Thank you.
