1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,020
well

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:07,780
yep

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,800
going some cowboy days

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,400
trying to get here

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,540
good night boys and girls

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,920
good night

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,680
look out for them gopher holes Dave

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,180
good night Austin Texas wherever you are

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,000
oh Dave

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,240
Dave look out for that bog water

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,780
look at that look out for those mud puddles

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,920
made of sulfuric acid Dave don't put your foot in there

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,300
Dave look out for that nuclear testing range

14
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:32,880
Dave

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,360
don't drive too close to the

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,000
perinuclear power plant

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,140
we've told you that over

18
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,440
and over Dave look out for that

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,260
canyon Dave look out for that mountain

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,500
oops a cactus oh a heel monster

21
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,380
oh a giant tarantula crawling

22
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,120
out from behind that butte

23
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,880
hour of slack

24
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,860
sponsored by the church of the subgenius

25
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,000
the subgenius hour of slack

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,120
that you are about to do is specially designed only to be made

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,700
on real social media and only

28
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,400
for the public

29
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,160
the audience is listening

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,740
the audience is never

31
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,420
listening

32
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,900
those days were so so

33
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,000
so happy for all of us but now

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
there is no joy no one listens

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,820
the audience is

36
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,360
talking and chatting

37
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,860
yakking and critiquing

38
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:20,900
gossiping

39
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,500
they're picking apart our every trigger word

40
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,460
oh they're not even doing that much

41
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,580
they're talking about their boyfriends and girlfriends

42
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,140
they're picking their noses

43
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,120
then there are half triggers

44
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,680
and three quarters

45
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,240
to fuel their conversation

46
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,540
it's so foolish

47
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,460
there's nothing for you to say

48
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,160
just sit down on the diva

49
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,840
just sit there

50
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,640
sit down on this

51
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,100
diva

52
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,520
have a seat on this

53
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,720
have a seat on this

54
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,240
that's you isn't it there

55
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
on the top of page 26

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,100
embracing the squid

57
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,680
you've seen this before haven't you?

58
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,860
you were there weren't you?

59
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,680
please enjoy your journey

60
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,780
the company wishes you an entertaining experience

61
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,080
that's not me man

62
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm glad I work for the company

63
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,640
and the company

64
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,980
is glad it works for you

65
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,740
now don't you sleep you little bastards

66
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,580
yes

67
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,660
people who are disgruntled

68
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,700
with the company often say things like that

69
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,580
especially when they're

70
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,720
stuck in a labyrinth beneath Langley

71
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,960
Virginia for hours and hours

72
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,380
Maurice

73
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:27,460
Maurice

74
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,820
Maurice

75
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,200
Maurice

76
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,360
Maurice

77
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,020
innych

78
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,400
Maurice

79
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,480
bringing along the

80
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,360
cochrane

81
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,760
hello

82
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,720
hello

83
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,320
hello

84
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,560
What's my baby?

85
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,000
What's my baby?

86
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,140
My baby?

87
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,440
You've got to believe me.

88
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,760
I have to believe it.

89
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,300
You've got to believe me.

90
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,620
You've got to believe me.

91
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,600
I don't want to be a slave.

92
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,220
You've got to believe me.

93
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,840
You've got to believe me.

94
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,520
Doc, this is one of the finest specimens we've ever found, but it doesn't usually grow around here.

95
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,640
As you know, it's part animal and part bitch.

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,780
Wow, it's like Hendrix, man.

97
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,600
Doctors took off.

98
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,200
Huh? What?

99
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,360
Are you being serious right now, or are you just on the show?

100
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,620
The doctors are always on the show seriously. What do you mean?

101
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,080
I don't know what I mean.

102
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,140
I don't want to hear anymore.

103
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,100
Well, I don't know what I mean either.

104
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
He took the form and the...

105
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,100
He pulled it out and tore it up on the floor.

106
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,400
And you said, are you serious or are you just being on the show?

107
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,480
And I said, at the same time...

108
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,880
There's many, many things happening.

109
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,020
I did get a request at the same time.

110
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,280
Oh, Bob, turn down the sound effects, too.

111
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,800
I've got to get the directions to my house.

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,180
Okay, listener, now, where is it that we live?

113
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,340
How do I get there?

114
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,940
I guess you drive down one of the main streets until you hit Berkeley.

115
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,600
Wow.

116
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,160
Got it. Dead center.

117
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,680
Those primitive peasants didn't believe our story,

118
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,460
but they believed it when the mushroom cloud blasted them off the island.

119
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,460
And we've got to ask you about that.

120
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,620
By the time I got to Dockstock...

121
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,880
Tell me that Bob may rip.

122
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,480
I asked him, why are you alive?

123
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,460
Hey, Dock.

124
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:19,520
Hey, Dock.

125
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:19,920
Dead center.

126
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,600
Hey, Dock.

127
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,260
What are those orange lights on the inside of the helmet?

128
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,000
That's because you pissed in the suit, remember, at the beginning of the flight?

129
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,300
Oh, no, that was at the beginning of the movie, and everybody moved away from me in the seat.

130
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,020
Yeah, I know.

131
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,420
Well, remember that whole thing where you're riding on the horse and you see the jet and you get sucked in the front?

132
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,180
Oh, yeah.

133
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,480
Right, okay, well, that's...

134
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,180
We've got to keep them in house.

135
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,840
I don't like this movie.

136
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,340
Yes, there's the director.

137
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay, hold on.

138
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,000
Hold on, you guys.

139
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,380
What's up, genius?

140
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,460
Let's let the caller decide who will live.

141
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:44,840
And who dies?

142
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,300
Shall we put little greetings to death in the space capsule,

143
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,540
or puzzling evidence down in the control room?

144
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,040
Shall he suffer the same?

145
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,660
We'll ask you, our caller.

146
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,320
Now, hold on to the phone.

147
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,240
Okay, they're very far.

148
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,700
Ah!

149
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,180
Ah!

150
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,280
Scared away by the light.

151
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,560
Okay, that caller.

152
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,040
Come on, guys, let's drive down Shattuck Avenue real fast.

153
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,720
This station's hard to steer.

154
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:07,760
Okay.

155
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,300
It's space war at last.

156
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,720
Listen to those particle beams.

157
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,180
They're sweeping the skies.

158
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,960
Yeah, we'll find a parking place for sure now.

159
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,340
Ah, yes, dear friends.

160
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,840
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack,

161
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,800
and in this case, possibly one of the most disconnected,

162
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,840
weirdest,

163
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,880
most unplanned and disorganized shows ever in subgenius history.

164
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,460
And who knows?

165
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,140
That may make it one of the greatest.

166
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,500
It certainly makes it one of the holiest and most divine,

167
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,680
even if it's sort of terrible,

168
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,920
which it probably won't be.

169
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,360
Although this show is actually composed of outtakes, dear friends,

170
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,220
not necessarily things that were too godawful to use on the hour of slack,

171
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,960
things that we were about to use.

172
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,500
But for whatever reason,

173
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,340
they didn't fit into that particular show we'd been looking at using them for,

174
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,660
and so they got shuffled off into these folders here.

175
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,020
These are computer files now, you see, instead of little cassette tapes.

176
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,780
And I've got a folder on my screen here marked holding.

177
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,180
Why, it's got a bunch of Einstein Secret Orchestra Swamp Radio,

178
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,960
but it's special sections with Bleepo Abernathy and Popes Lilith.

179
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:36,540
We also have another section of bleeding head of Arnold Palmer oriented stuff

180
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:44,100
from the old KNON subgenius show with G. Gordon Gordon and Dr. Philodrummond

181
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:50,280
and puzzling evidence on a special last show of the millennium on KPFA, Berkeley.

182
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,880
And yet in this other folder called Miscellaneous Outs, I have...

183
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,460
Well, no, those are X-rated and I can't play them.

184
00:06:59,560 --> 00:06:59,980
But...

185
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,940
I know that there's some pretty weird in-betweens there.

186
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,580
And then yet there's this other folder marked,

187
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,620
Don't ever play this on the air.

188
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,200
And that's the one I'm most excited about.

189
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,580
I have no idea what's in it,

190
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:20,320
although it appears to have some ancient KPFA puzzling evidence

191
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,000
and Dr. Howell dinosaur oriented slack material.

192
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,940
Hmm.

193
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,420
So I guess this will be...

194
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,120
The...

195
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:40,380
Arnold Palmer-saurus miscellaneous show of gas music from Jupiter.

196
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,780
We literally have some of that.

197
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,240
And I've got some Nazi band music here.

198
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,000
We've got some trance weirdness by Zeeza.

199
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,740
We've got part of Susie the floozy's rant in Tampa and God only knows what other.

200
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,960
Friends, I don't know.

201
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,720
I don't know.

202
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,240
I'm doing all of this talking ahead of time.

203
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,000
And after this, we'll just dive right in and see what happens.

204
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,600
Your guest is as good as mine.

205
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,460
Praise Bob and hail Connie.

206
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,600
You are listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

207
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,880
And if you need more information about this show and the word of Bob

208
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,180
or the artists involved who are torturing themselves for Bob,

209
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,700
check out our website.

210
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,020
www.subgenius.com

211
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,420
Or write with an actual pen and paper and a stamp.

212
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:44,260
Use the post office and write to Bob himself at post office box 140306.

213
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:55,900
That's box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

214
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,940
75214.

215
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,320
And that's where Jesus lives.

216
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,040
Jesus and his beautiful wife, Mary Magdalene and their little child, Conbo.

217
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,160
And they process your orders after they've been pre-processed by Reverend Nikki Death Chick.

218
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,960
And then parts of your orders are actually filled by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Sang.

219
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,880
I pray over those people.

220
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
I pray over love offerings that you send in, friends.

221
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,700
I'll sleep...

222
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,380
I spread them across my bed and I sleep on them and I know them.

223
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,260
I know them.

224
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:40,040
I think you know me when you know what I'm saying.

225
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,880
This music in the background is Einstein Secret Orchestra with Ron Slabe

226
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,120
performing at a Winter Star Symposium in February.

227
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,240
Sponsored by ACE.

228
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,780
You might check their website. It's really interesting.

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,220

245
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,120
I'm by the barbecue.

246
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:49,780
Hello.

247
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:50,620
Hello.

248
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,760
Good place.

249
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,180
I told you the next time I caught you and your son dynamite fishing,

250
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,740
I'd throw your sorry ass in jail.

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,140
And I meant it.

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,260
And now McGraw-Hill has printed 15,000 copies of the collected teachings of Bob.

253
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,700
Many times have I said that, yes, you may spend $20 to join the Church of Bob,

254
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,480
and you may be staggered at the enormity of this sum,

255
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,020
or you might spend $9.95 for the book or buy the book.

256
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,860
I'll just subgeniusly go on McGraw-Hill and better books for everywhere.

257
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,280
But the $9.95 you spend for that book,

258
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,280
you'll get so much more for your money than you would get if you spent $9.95

259
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,320
in any other pink conspiracy meaningless book, record, movie.

260
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,900
You will be ashamed of yourself.

261
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,060
Why, children, you go out and put that $4.95 down for a copy of Hollywood Wives.

262
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,000
You read it, and you are ashamed of yourself,

263
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,240
and you go,

264
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,500
You're being that sick pink conspiracy juicing.

265
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,440
But you put $9.95 down for the book of the subgenius,

266
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,320
and I defy you, children, to finish that book.

267
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,300
I defy you to read every word and absorb every illustration of that book.

268
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,520
I've had my copy for nine on ten months, and I haven't done it yet.

269
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,840
It sold 50,000 copies on publication day.

270
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,800
Over a century later, it became the phenomenon of the London and New York states.

271
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,600
Perhaps we ought to clear up something about the book.

272
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,420
You might find it in the humor section,

273
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,920
and this is just completely wrong.

274
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,560
It's the conspiracy.

275
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,000
It's the conspiracy in action.

276
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,800
It should be in the religion section.

277
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,760
I found my copy in the religion section in the Golden Butts downtown.

278
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,720
It should be in the cooking section.

279
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,760
It should be in the home building section.

280
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,680
It should be in the pet section.

281
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,260
I mean, there's nothing funny about that book.

282
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,100
There's nothing untrue about that.

283
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,940
There's nothing funny about it either.

284
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,920
I mean, it's all true.

285
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,800
It's all funny, right?

286
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,020
Pick up all of the many copies there, or a few, hopefully,

287
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,140
and move them to the really bad part.

288
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,900
It just might just save your brain and your soul and your mental life for the next ten years.

289
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,620
Ten million years.

290
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,940
It might just make you aware of the fact that you're a human being instead of a little meat machine.

291
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,060
We don't even want to talk about that, right?

292
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,420
We don't want to talk about expanding your imagination.

293
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,780
You're thinking for yourself.

294
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,800
God forbid.

295
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,840
You're not asleep.

296
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
You're perfectly awake.

297
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,360
No, you haven't been programmed.

298
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:01,920
No.

299
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,020
This whole stuff isn't confusing to you at all, right?

300
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,120
No, that's the way it goes.

301
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,560
It's just a big joke.

302
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,380
It only takes a few seconds to stare at the fabulous mystic diagram on the back of the book of the subgenius,

303
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,440
but once you stare...

304
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,220
I'm already...

305
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,280
You will be transformed into another world.

306
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,260
Yes, Jehovah One has yet two other books that are coming out.

307
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,500
And they'll sometimes pelt the earth with strangeness.

308
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,080
His angels are eons of the green energy art demons.

309
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,980
Yes, the art demons scribble stuff all over the pages

310
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,280
and spread it all over the airwaves and media waves.

311
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,420
But we must do more.

312
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,160
We need money for ammo, coaching, housing, and surgery

313
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,040
for the gifted young and old ministers who have sworn to protect America

314
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,700
against the conspiracy machine throughout the 1980s.

315
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,860
Yes, that was Nemoji the Malay.

316
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,800
He's an Asian, telling you about the short-term effects of membership in the church

317
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,460
or foundation of the subgenius.

318
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,140
Thank you, Sahib.

319
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,960
And I would also like to say, buy the book of the subgenius from McGraw Hill.

320
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,740
Yes, ten times his normal size, he runs around from radio station to radio station

321
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,500
trying to show you what it is to talk about the tilting boxcar of Dobbs.

322
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,000
Bob is the real thing.

323
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,700
He came to re-fertilize your sexual preconceptions

324
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,200
to make us all relieve our reincarnality in the million polyverse combinations we once enjoyed.

325
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,380
Sure, this church drips with...

326
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,400
There's no irony with insanely overblown cajones.

327
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,140
This religion isn't for the amalgamation of the sexes.

328
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,040
No, but it sure is as hell for the divine union of them.

329
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,860
And so, as you can see from this model here,

330
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,800
the eyeballs actually do pop out of the skull.

331
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,160
And then you swallow each eyeball.

332
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,360
It's a clip to the camera.

333
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,520
It's what's called the abugada.

334
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,680
And it enables you to look inside your own esophagus.

335
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,400
Here, check this out.

336
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,520
Check out the skull.

337
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,860
Pop the eyeball.

338
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,300
Now, you can thoroughly examine the soul after popping the eyeball of each one of these delightful eyeballs.

339
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
Harry, what color is this one right here?

340
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,820
Well, this one's modeled after the Campbell's Soup children of the 1950s.

341
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,380
I noticed that they had that kind of like Warholish look to them,

342
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,920
that sunshine and goober's face, the brown hair and purple eyes.

343
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,100
They have the red rosy cheeks.

344
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,440
I noticed...

345
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,700
And, well, okay, and we basically made them this way to make them seem safe.

346
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,940
Well, they are definitely not safe, though.

347
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,220
I mean, that's the thing that's important to remember.

348
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,360
Don't really have to come to the...

349
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,860
It spins, too.

350
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,500
Yes, it does, Popas.

351
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:24,960
Whee!

352
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,280
It spins because we felt it was safer that the consumer would be able to use something that rotated on its axis

353
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,020
rather than have sharp edges like the other objects.

354
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:40,040
Well, hopefully some of these objects can kill, kill, kill children with a single...

355
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,140
But what good is removing the sharp object?

356
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,240
I mean...

357
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,660
Well...

358
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,020
Wow.

359
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:44,720
Wow.

360
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:44,880
Wow.

361
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,160
Wow.

362
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,520
The other, you know, the cameras that you can swallow,

363
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,260
did you see this on television perhaps recently that there are small cameras,

364
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,640
capsule cameras you can swallow to guide scientists through the开始 track?

365
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:05,320
So you're saying that for humans we should have smooth cameras as well as smooth cameras for Fimmins,

366
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,960
for women, for Germans, for really all the races.

367
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,260
We want to embrace all races.

368
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,660
At one time?

369
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,340
Wow.

370
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,900
I think you just want to embrace everything that moves at one time.

371
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,900
You sound like a fornicator in disguise.

372
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,140
And it's a very thin disguise.

373
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:28,740
Many people, that's because of the bad reputation that was set up by the scientific community

374
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,300
that was in our office before from the other administration.

375
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,200
But we assure you, none of our members fornicated any time.

376
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,880
Now, has science given fornication a bad name or is this just another administration ploy?

377
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,500
Well, it's in my...

378
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,580
Damn, the drawer is glued shut.

379
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,540
I was going to show you this file here, but someone glued the drawer shut from the previous administration.

380
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,140
Don't worry.

381
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,820
Well, I think...

382
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,380
Okay, oh, thank you.

383
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,260
That should work quite well.

384
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,620
That should come right out.

385
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,800
It smells horrible, too.

386
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,720
Don't look into the flame.

387
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,760
And now, can you get in there now?

388
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,620
I noticed you're...

389
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,300
Okay.

390
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:05,760
All right.

391
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,640
You haven't suffered any major burning or anything?

392
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,060
You're just...

393
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,280
No.

394
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,800
Okay, what's...

395
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,900
Okay, the metal just evaporated.

396
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,480
It's cool.

397
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,000
Hey, hey, listen to me.

398
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,700
Yes, we're listening to you right now.

399
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes.

400
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,360
Does it hurt?

401
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:19,920
What?

402
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,280
When you pee, does it hurt?

403
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,060
Well, doesn't...

404
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,300
Well...

405
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,060
Of course it hurts.

406
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,140
It's supposed to hurt.

407
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,780
That's a very colloquial way of putting it, sir.

408
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,480
My friend, if you pee the way I pee, you will always hurt.

409
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,040
The previous administration peed regularly, and that's why we closed off the toilet.

410
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,820
Because we don't want people doing dirty things like going to the bathroom.

411
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,640
Yeah, can we just say pee on the radio?

412
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,480
Well, can you...

413
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,160
This is a safe space.

414
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,040
It's a great office.

415
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,020
It's a great space.

416
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,020


417
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,620
Everybody wins.

418
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:46,900
Pay!

419
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,460
No, I see all this.

420
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:48,880
They've got...

421
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,620
No, I am really fed up.

422
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,740
I close my eyes and get in very friendly.

423
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,460
It's your own fault.

424
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:00,460
My thoughts have wings, and these winging thoughts can take me away any time I want.

425
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:00,980
I'm sorry.

426
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,680
These rumors about the administration peeing freely throughout the halls of Congress

427
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,140
are in some other way lubricating the gears,

428
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,920
and letting off rich folk who don't need to be get off in the fix.

429
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,440
We just will listen to you, but we embrace you.

430
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,740
Is that all right?

431
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
What a soft, sweet embrace.

432
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
I can feel the large need.

433
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,860
People who say that we're not compassionate or open-minded,

434
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:33,680
they're just uncompassionate, open-minded people without a faith.

435
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,640
It's not pornography, officer.

436
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,420
It's empowerment.

437
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,880
Officer, dang.

438
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,120
As Bleepo Abernathy once put it,

439
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,720
D-Mitarian Betilla don't see any grandämäしま

440
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,020
Well dit.

441
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,240
They can see me you going around pickled.

442
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
Wish you, your imperial presence,

443
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:02,620
mayatus et Road!!!

444
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,200

446
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,440
And to everyone who answers

447
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,620
Solely

448
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,120
Omn mastodon

449
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,060
Yeah, I am the river, man

450
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,740
Lookin' for females of American style, yeah

451
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,920
I am the next in line

452
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,860
I'm all for that fuckin' idea, yeah

453
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,880
One, two, three, four

454
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,380
One, two, three, four

455
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:11,120
One, two, three, four

456
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,400
One, two, three, four

457
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,380
But that's old age thinking.

458
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,640
What we need in the book is music like this, scary.

459
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,480
Yeah!

460
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,700
Music like this, happy.

461
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,540
Wow!

462
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,480
Music like this, crowd offense.

463
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,820
I haven't been so high since 1969.

464
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,080
Hey, I don't know, it's, uh, look, everything's slanting down to a...

465
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,440
Melting!

466
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,340
Oh, they're all on the floor.

467
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,340
Yes, the 60s are just a pile on the floor now.

468
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,540
But fortunately,

469
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,980
we've been able to piece them together.

470
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,820
You see, they ask us,

471
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,480
how we manage to make these reconstructions using just one bone?

472
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,360
Well, the answer is that even on your body,

473
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,120
muscles make deep spasms or scars in the bone.

474
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,580
And from these, we're able to distinguish the amount of flexion

475
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,120
that might exist beneath the skin.

476
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,340
Now, as for the skin,

477
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,900
we know these creatures have an integument of feathers

478
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,120
or of cheese or scaly rind,

479
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,620
an outer epiphropulodermis, as one might call it.

480
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,200
How exactly does this all fit into the scary part?

481
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,520
Well, I'm sure you know.

482
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,020
I'm afraid to tell you that these creatures,

483
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,120
as we call them, are not dead.

484
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,120
They live no longer in the faith of reason,

485
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,080
but they lurk outside our universe,

486
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,560
waiting always to enter and reclaim their former domain.

487
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,060
Sure are weird-looking.

488
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,580
This is classified information.

489
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,960
Do you want to let this out on the air?

490
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,680
Take the sludge and turn it into a sloth.

491
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,740
Speak to me of sludge!

492
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,940
I'm a no-go!

493
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,320
Slit the throat rather than mention sludge.

494
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,500
Sludge.

495
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:40,500


496
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:40,500


497
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:40,760
Sludge.

498
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:41,700
Sludge.

499
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,060
Yuck, it's cinema!

500
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,040
Shoot up in the little magic machine here.

501
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,560
This is the part where the tape is placed in here

502
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,920
and it's going backwards through the heads

503
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,060
and it's all twisted up and stretched around the ceiling.

504
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,380
Hard for the signal to be okay on here,

505
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,220
but even the TV's hard to make it through.

506
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,820
Don't look down!

507
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,860
Don't look down!

508
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,980
Don't go upstairs.

509
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,880
Don't go out of the house.

510
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,280
It's only a movie.

511
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,940
It's not real.

512
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,780
It's Yard Man.

513
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,400
Don't go in the waiting pool.

514
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,180
Yard Man cuts off your toe with a lawnmower.

515
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,460
Sorry, ma'am.

516
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,260
Sorry, yes, ma'am.

517
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,420
No.

518
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,100
Don't look in the woodpile.

519
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,000
Stay out of the forest.

520
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,480
Keep away from the junkyard.

521
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,640
Don't look in the scrap heap.

522
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,780
Stay away from the gazebo.

523
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,560
It's only a movie.

524
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,980
Keep telling yourself it's not real.

525
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,460
It's not really happening.

526
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,020
You won't believe the horror.

527
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,860
You won't believe the terror.

528
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,920
But it's all real.

529
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,600
Even the records try to escape this show.

530
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,140
Oh, yes, they try to roll out the door, but we catch them.

531
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,400
Force them back on the turntables.

532
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,500
Actually, there's a copy of this show.

533
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,640
Let's go smurfing, okay?

534
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,520
Yeah.

535
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,260
Hey, pass me that fin.

536
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,460
Hey, I'm going to find some ketchup on my smurf.

537
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,140
Hey, the original smurfers were...

538
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,380
Well, if you can't disprove them, then I'm going to be forced to take them to court.

539
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,400
...eight legs and no harassment.

540
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:58,120
But you know, over the millennia of time, they evolved into the cross-opterygiites and double-tray fish.

541
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,900
Yes, and those were used for food by higher-ups.

542
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,560
And baits to catch the large pig smurfs, which basked unknowing in the Cenozoic seas.

543
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:06,880
Unknowing?

544
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,460
Listen to those poor souls yowling in the...

545
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:09,980
Hell of a...

546
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,700
Let's go back to the beach for a while.

547
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,500
Yes.

548
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:12,860
There we go.

549
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,040
Don't you wish you knew how to get to the subgenius beach party?

550
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,580
Don't you wish you could paddle with those useless legs now that you're a dinosaur in the wrong world?

551
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,440
While out to sea, the gigantic Archelon and Fastotoclonosaurus, mentioned in official subgenius literature,

552
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,320
cavorts with beach bunnies on sandy shores.

553
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,760
Where is this beach party? Is it in Santa Cruz?

554
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,900
Well, it was in Houston last week, and this morning it'll be in San Francisco.

555
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,700
San Francisco.

556
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,500
Near Fort Mason.

557
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,760
Ah, what time?

558
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,100
About nine o'clock.

559
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,780
It starts tonight.

560
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,060
Hey, listen, don't release this valuable information on the air.

561
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,220
We don't want every poll bucket down on our...

562
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,860
Well, the thing is, there are only probably 11 people listening right now.

563
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,920
Should I bring my hat and my gun?

564
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,560
Two of them are about ready to turn their radios off.

565
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,680
The other five will about get something to eat.

566
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,700
Well, I'll tell you, we're down to have a bottle of Irish rum right now.

567
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,620
That's disgusting.

568
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,800
The young dinosaurs today...

569
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,360
The young dinosaurs, as we all know, perish from an excess or effluent of Yakima chismo.

570
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,680
Well, actually, I believe in living and let live and leaving these...

571
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,900
Marvelous beasts alone.

572
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,640
Their chicken-like skin is too hard for the standard taxidermic application.

573
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,680
Calm down now.

574
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,360
You'll be all right.

575
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,780
Your phone's just taking control of you, but if you...

576
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,260
It's all right.

577
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,420
If you sit down, you'll be better.

578
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,780
Are you going to ban this and going to mate it up with an elephant?

579
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,220
Hey, that wouldn't work.

580
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,420
That would not work.

581
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,400
That's a rather perverse and disgusting suggestion, and I'm rather surprised that you would order it over the radio.

582
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,200
Remember, there are...

583
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,280
This is a family broadcast.

584
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,500
We have people listening whose patronage we'd like to cultivate.

585
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,440
Is this a joke?

586
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,380
You can take your indecent sexual bestial suggestions, mister, and just pack them off to Poughkeepsie.

587
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,700

magazines and the tapes and so forth, half of them out there aren't really sub-GNI at all.

615
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,960
Listen to those phones.

616
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,380
They're pathetically trying to reach us.

617
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,040
They have things they have to tell us.

618
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,660
They want to be healed.

619
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,800
They hate us.

620
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,620
They want to kill us.

621
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,600
They want to love us.

622
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,100
They want to ask us how we do it.

623
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,860
Mostly they want us to loan them money, which is...

624
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,120
And they want us to shut up about Prairie Squid because they're embarrassed.

625
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,140
Oh, they turn so red.

626
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,500
This is the Prairie Squid show tonight, and we're dedicating...

627
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:03,560
We are taking this valuable church time to inform you about this very, very, very clear and present danger.

628
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,540
That is to say, the extinction of the Prairie Squid.

629
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,300
Oh, the demon's back.

630
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,120
Oh, daddy, oh.

631
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:33,460
We understand the black sky and it's dying.

632
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,040
No, daddy, no.

633
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,280
The last of the threatened child is ending time.

634
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,020
No, daddy, no.

635
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,440
It's a dream, it's a dream.

636
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,880
It's a dream, it's a dream.

637
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,320
It's a dream, it's a dream.

638
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,040
It's a dream from the past.

639
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,260
We are brakes.

640
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,400
The covered into sand.

641
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,020
The chain cuts us back into our scales.

642
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:37,280
We live our lives to ride the mud wave.

643
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:45,240
We live our lives to ride the mud wave.

644
00:32:47,060 --> 00:33:14,240
We live our lives to ride the mud wave.

645
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,180
They had Confederate flags on their bikes.

646
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,700
Wow.

647
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,140
And all this weird shit.

648
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,880
That was me.

649
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,640
That was me and my buddies.

650
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
And you were in blackface.

651
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,560
You were that wimp.

652
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:30,820
He was that tall, skinny kid that was just, he was scared just because there was ten of us and we were rednecks.

653
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeah, just because there was ten of them.

654
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,460
That's nice.

655
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,060
And they talked real funny and they were Yankee this and Yankee that.

656
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,760
That's right, Yankee.

657
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,300
I said I hadn't Yanked a tinge the earlier part after.

658
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,680
What the hell were you doing in Texas?

659
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,100
Don't let the sun set on you here, boss.

660
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,400
Why?

661
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,600
No, they were a bunch of Mississippi boys that got a hold of me.

662
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,780
Yeah, Yankee ain't home.

663
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,020
And scared the dogs right off of me.

664
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,580
And the boys, if the idiots would just read it.

665
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,620
Yes, Lord, I bought us a vacation home in Florida.

666
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,320
We sure did.

667
00:33:59,340 --> 00:33:59,960
A big home.

668
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,920
It's 30 feet wide.

669
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,480
And I don't like golf because of the heck of every taste of that golf ball all over the golf course.

670
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,620
And trying to get it straight.

671
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,660
And it stresses me more out than it does when I don't play it.

672
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,560
So I just lose it.

673
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,620
Where's the rock?

674
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,480
It's here.

675
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:14,980
It's over.

676
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,240
I'm making people go to golf.

677
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,740
And I'm making famous on the house.

678
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,000
And that information was stolen out the bank.

679
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,400
Thought you would be doing this.

680
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,820
Whatever $3 gesture poverty to you, I said, the movie returns you a new best.

681
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,880
And I'm out the more stuff for $3.

682
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,680
But you were more than rich.

683
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:37,120
The Bible with work, to rampc rasp was running, that was before you.

684
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,680
knitting fire, what do you know how it my name

685
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,400
Half of the N smaller Corona Alex

686
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,180
short month

687
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:45,180


688
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:45,180


689
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,680
4

690
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,320
And I showed him the ticket.

691
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,700
That's what we wanted.

692
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,880
We bought those tickets first for ourselves and upgraded them with our advantageous miles.

693
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,080
He didn't say none of that stuff.

694
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:56,820
What did they do?

695
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,280
They got a hidden camera on the airplane.

696
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,740
He came and posed to me.

697
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,880
I said, he's right.

698
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,540
I'm kidding.

699
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,420
Are you off your shit?

700
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,360
Can they talk about those two dogs we know of?

701
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,260
Oh, no, no.

702
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,140
Can't talk about them either.

703
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,120
But, you know, and they're saying, oh, well, it's a land where we have free discussions.

704
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,520
Yeah, but it's a democracy.

705
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:21,440
But you can only launch a bleeding head of Arnold Palmer on a Thursday night.

706
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,840
And not if it's a public holiday.

707
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:34,620
Yeah, a golfer head can only be launched on Thursdays in your own, you know, in the home of a consenting person.

708
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,340
You can't just go next door to your neighbors and launch a head if you feel like it.

709
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:42,160
And, God forbid, you launch a head in public like downtown on the main square or something like that.

710
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:42,840
Friends, I want.

711
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,560
North Little Rock.

712
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:43,960
You find.

713
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,700
You find yourself in trouble with the county law, boy.

714
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,900
Yeah, you can tell them.

715
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,600
You can tell them.

716
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,680
Oh, but officer, like doctors for Bob did.

717
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,720
You can say, oh, officer, but.

718
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,340
But.

719
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,860
But I'm a bold surrealist, sir.

720
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,960
I'm a bold surrealist.

721
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,380
Oh, yeah.

722
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:57,760
Oh, yeah.

723
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,320
We got bold surrealist.

724
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,840
We got.

725
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:06,400
We got 40 men hanging them from telephone poles up in Tucker that like to say they were

726
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,200
as bold surrealists.

727
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,040
Yes, friend.

728
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,420
Yeah.

729
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,140
Oh, they'll.

730
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,780
Oh, yeah.

731
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,420
They'll tell you.

732
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,040
Every kind of head.

733
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:12,520
Yeah.

734
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,820
They'll launch a sneed head.

735
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,580
Oh, yeah.

736
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,540
They'll launch a Trevino forearm.

737
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,700
If you aren't careful.

738
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,340
Green straps the whole time.

739
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,740
The whole time, friends.

740
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,840
Friends, I want you to listen to this tape and I want you to meditate.

741
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,560
Meditate on this message.

742
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,160
Close your eyes and think about Prairie Squid and listen to this tape.

743
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,480
That's true.

744
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,640
They did.

745
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,740
But the head moved up or down.

746
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:42,700
And I can recall not too long ago, my father said to me, while playing around at home,

747
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,100
you're moving your head.

748
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,460
And I said, I don't think so.

749
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,000
I said, I'm keeping my eye on the ball.

750
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,160
And he said, well, you're keeping your eye on the ball.

751
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,460
Yes.

752
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:59,100
But your head is moving up and down, which I had worked into this unconsciously.

753
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,520
See, Arnold Palmer unconsciously knew that his.

754
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:02,980
I realized.

755
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,420
And knew his head had to be launched.

756
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,020
Yeah.

757
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,900
But that's not the real.

758
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,440
That's not the Arnold Palmer that you're thinking of, friend.

759
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,080
No, no, no.

760
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,760
It's not the guy that drives a tractor.

761
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,240
Uh-uh.

762
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:12,640
Uh-uh.

763
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:12,920
Uh-uh.

764
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,020
No.

765
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,440
No.

766
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,260
It's the guy who sells, you know, oil-based petroleum products.

767
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,100
This is the.

768
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,780
Oh, forget it.

769
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,400
You don't even want to.

770
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,160
There's no way they can.

771
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,500
There's no way they can understand it.

772
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,080
They really couldn't.

773
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,760
Just write to that box number.

774
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,320
Yeah, that box number, friends, for the Church of the Subgenius.

775
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:33,720
And we'll send you plenty of information about prairie squids, golfer head launch-ins, slack,

776
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,280
slack, how to make.

777
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,960
And Reverend Stang.

778
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,480
How to get free sex all the time.

779
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,500
Yeah, the good sex for a mutant's dating league, I believe.

780
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,360
Oh, that's right.

781
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:42,660
Yeah.

782
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,720
That's another church.

783
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,280
That's another church service.

784
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:44,920
It's been a while since.

785
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,180
Yeah, since Buck sold the good sex for mutants dating league.

786
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:49,980
Well, he had to.

787
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,520
He was just getting worn out.

788
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,600
You know what he sold it for?

789
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,700
It was getting worn out.

790
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,760
It was wearing him out.

791
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,400
But you know what he sold it for?

792
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,580
Oh, when the hot mutants come.

793
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:57,820
You know what he sold it for?

794
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,160
A franchise?

795
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,620
No.

796
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,860
What did he sell a franchise for?

797
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,620
A bottle of Ripple.

798
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,060
And I was just mentioning that.

799
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,180
And I think they're in dispute now about who has the head.

800
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,660
Yeah.

801
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,620
And there's lawsuits.

802
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,340
Well, I have.

803
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,600
Yeah, I have one of the heads.

804
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,700
I have the head from the 84 show, which, of course, I shot Bob.

805
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,200
That's.

806
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,160
So where do these heads come from?

807
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,280
They were made.

808
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,260
There were probably about 10 of them made.

809
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,180
They're talking about head.

810
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,900
I think you better.

811
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,300
What's a guy show?

812
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,920
Now, where's the head giver, though?

813
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,880
The head giver's supposed to be here by now.

814
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,980
Hey, we don't do head anymore.

815
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,540
The head giver, though.

816
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,760
We don't do it.

817
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,980
That's Ivan Stang is the head giver of the church, as I thought.

818
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,120
That's what everybody tells me.

819
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,660
Receive and to give.

820
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Just like Mama taught me.

821
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,860
Kill myself.

822
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,820
I'm receiving it right now.

823
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,820
Oh, I see.

824
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,380
Oh, hi, Janer.

825
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,240
Oh, no.

826
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,080
So.

827
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,240
He was an invincible villain.

828
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,020
Now.

829
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,040
Where'd he go from there?

830
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,040
Some of the callers who think we're talking about some other kind of head.

831
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,860
They don't know we're talking about the bleeding head.

832
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,940
Yeah, that's the thing.

833
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,320
I mean, people jump to the conclusion that you're talking about some sexual thing just because you, you know.

834
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,300
Just because you like and worship the bloody head.

835
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,560
Well, it is slightly sexual.

836
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,060
Yeah, it's slightly.

837
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,380
But that's only because of his overtone in the society.

838
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,280
It's not us talking about anything like that.

839
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,620
It's that.

840
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,080
It's the society picks up that in a twisted way.

841
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,840
Now, just because you may have sex with the head doesn't mean there's sexuality involved.

842
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,260
It's just a ritual that's involved in the worship process.

843
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,580
Phineas is one of the last people to see the head in one piece.

844
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,400
That's right.

845
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,100
Which head?

846
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,300
You're saying you have a piece of head?

847
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,060
The true bleeding head of Arnold Palmer was blown to smithereens.

848
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,080
Oh, are you getting a piece?

849
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,120
Are you getting blown?

850
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,520
Are you getting a piece of head or are you getting blown by the head?

851
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,180
The plaster head?

852
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,500
The original plaster head?

853
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:53,620
No, actually, the true plaster head, of course, can't be destroyed as long as Janer doesn't get a hold of it.

854
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:53,980
Right.

855
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,320
And as far as I know, it is not in Janer's hand.

856
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,300
So tell me about this explosion of head.

857
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,920
Well, there was going to be a firework show at X Day, of course, you know, I mean, before the...

858
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,080
But the head blew up, man.

859
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,460
Okay, just make a long story short.

860
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,360
The head blew up, right?

861
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:22,000
Well, it didn't just blow up with fireworks because Ed Strange and Dr. Mojo were using actually very illegal explosives.

862
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,340
Now, did that mess up the cottage cheese?

863
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,460
Oh, that one, yeah.

864
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,740
It was a great big rubber head.

865
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,020
It was the same head that had its nose bitten off the previous day.

866
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,300
Yes, yeah, right, right.

867
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,420
Who bit it?

868
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,880
The redneck Jesus.

869
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,180
No, you know, I...

870
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,980
The redneck Jesus got real upset.

871
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,680
Yeah, I mean...

872
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,080
Wonderful.

873
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:48,120
Because you could only have a good show, you could only have a good show with an upset soul there to complain about it.

874
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,760
I, you know, did you crucify the redneck Jesus for that?

875
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,900
No, we crucified the real Jesus.

876
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,500
But now, what type of revenge did you get to vindicate yourself with the redneck Jesus?

877
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,440
You know, all I did was say, man, why'd you do that?

878
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,700
Spit that nose out into my hand, please.

879
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,960
Did he do it?

880
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,320
He did.

881
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,920
He felt bad about what he'd done.

882
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,640
He spit the nose into my hand.

883
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,080
You know what?

884
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,160
I lost the nose.

885
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,180
Did he go off and flagellate himself?

886
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:23,680
Did he perform any kind of act of pittance or sacrificial mortification of any kind?

887
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,800
And now, the redneck Jesus performs an act of self-immolation.

888
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,880
And don't forget the date rapers who defecated in the hot tub.

889
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,440
And then, Ivan Stang is in the whirlpool with you.

890
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:40,440


891
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:40,440


892
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:40,440


893
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,000
And don't forget the date defecators who raped the hot tub.

894
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,280
And don't forget the prairie squeal.

895
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,720
And don't forget the hot tubs that took the defecators out on a date.

896
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,300
And don't forget the defecators who, yeah.

897
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,120
And don't forget the 7-Elevens who look like defecators that have Arnold Palmer heads.

898
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,220
Oh!

899
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,680
Oh!

900
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,340
Oh!

901
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:06,960
Oh!

902
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:07,940
Oh!

903
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:08,680
Oh!

904
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,200
Oh!

905
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,300
Oh!

906
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:09,620
Oh!

907
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,420
Oh!

908
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:10,420


909
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:10,420


910
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:10,420


911
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,340
Hey, what ever happened to Billy James Hargis?

912
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,900
He died.

913
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:15,680
He did?

914
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,540
Yeah, he died.

915
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,840
When did he die?

916
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,420
Hey, give me some of that show, man.

917
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:19,900
Oh, thanks.

918
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,800
When did Billy James Hargis die?

919
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,240
Why didn't somebody tell me?

920
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,920
I guess you're going to tell me next that the Reverend Ike has died too, right?

921
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,840
Somebody, please, out there, anybody.

922
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,500
I think you're going to say Father Divine is dead.

923
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:45,580
Now you're going to tell me that Billy James Hargis has actually killed Reverend Ike.

924
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,700
Then you're going to say Bill Hicks is dead.

925
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,100
Bill Barty died.

926
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,600
Didn't Billy Barty die recently?

927
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,380
Yes, he did, Saturday.

928
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:52,980
Who?

929
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,600
Billy Barty.

930
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,320
That's tomorrow, but yeah, Billy Barty died 48 hours ago.

931
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,980
I guess you're going to tell me Andy Kaufman's dead next, right?

932
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,540
No, he's not.

933
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,020
No.

934
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:00,580
Okay.

935
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,840
So, um...

936
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,240
Hey, wait a minute.

937
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,240
Who is dead?

938
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,480
They're doing...

939
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,380
We're doing it on the show there.

940
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,760
If Billy James Hargis is dead, now what about Oral Roberts?

941
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,200
I'm trying to think of modern day prophets and how many of them are dead.

942
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,380
Oral Roberts, that's where the head comes from.

943
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,980
I didn't think it was that funny.

944
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,300
Sure.

945
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,440
Last show of the millennium.

946
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,760
Hey, Doug, quit tickling her.

947
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,560
It's the...

948
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,820
Oh, okay.

949
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,080
Quit tickling her, man.

950
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,140
It's just the antenna, see?

951
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,920
No one ever talks about his twin brother, Anal Roberts.

952
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,720
No, because that guy didn't start a university.

953
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,420
His twin brother, Anal Roberts, yeah.

954
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,620
Anal, Oral's lesser known brother.

955
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,220
Yeah, he sort of took the southern route, you know?

956
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,440
Yeah.

957
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,060
He's been in the back, kind of at the back door ever since then.

958
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,020
So, hey, Phineas, are you doing your show?

959
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,440
Yeah, it's on every week.

960
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,140
Up and running?

961
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,620
Yeah.

962
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,740
On what?

963
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,700
You must have a .org address.

964
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,360
Well, I mean, you can...

965
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:24,900
If you want to listen to it, it's on listen.to, T-O, word T-O.

966
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,860
Look, there's Anal...

967
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,200
I know how to spell T-O.

968
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,960
There's Anal Roberts again coming in the back door.

969
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,040
Listen.to slash voice jail, and then I'll take you to it.

970
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,280
Voice J-O?

971
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,160
J-O?

972
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,380
J-O, like as in J-O?

973
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:38,820
No.

974
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:39,920
Jail.

975
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,380
Jail.

976
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,160
Oh, voice jail.

977
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,160
It's just the way he says it.

978
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,380
It makes you sound like J-O.

979
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,820
I thought you were talking about like a J-O posse.

980
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:48,520
I think it looks like Ivan Stang is now holding his landlady at gunpoint.

981
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,700
No, no, no.

982
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,100
I'm trying to check him.

983
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,220
Damn, the landlady's still here.

984
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,560
She doesn't think we're...

985
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,240
Oh, my God.

986
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,260
Oh, my God.

987
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:06,860
Oh, my God.

988
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:07,680
Oh, my God.

989
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,200
Oh, my God.

990
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:08,280
Oh, my God.

991
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:08,360
Oh, my God.

992
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:08,900
Oh, my God.

993
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:09,480
Oh, my God.

994
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:09,480


995
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:09,480


996
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:09,480


997
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:09,480


998
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:09,480


999
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:09,480


1000
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,020
Oh, my God.

1001
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,440
Oh, my God.

1002
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,760
Oh, my God.

1003
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:35,080
Oh, my God.

1004
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,020
Oh, my God.

1005
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,200
Oh, my God.

1006
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,340
Oh, my God.

1007
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:49,700
Two by two, four by four, obey in instructions given by the Lord.

1008
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:55,800
Go on to the ark where you'll be safe.

1009
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:02,420
As soon as they'd gone in there, it began to rain.

1010
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:18,400
Two by two, four by four, obey in instructions given by the Lord.

1011
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:24,660
Go on to the ark where you'll be safe.

1012
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:31,080
As soon as they'd gone in there, it began to rain.

1013
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:40,980
As soon as they'd gone in there, it began to rain.

1014
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,020
I think so.

1015
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,380
What are you saying about the Queen of Norway?

1016
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,500
I would do anything to protect a Norwegian royal family. Anything.

1017
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,940
I'm saying she's my favorite gay job.

1018
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,840
I would step in in a moment to save the Queen of Norway.

1019
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:22,680
I will throw in my shoes and my false hand and my liquid one good eye to protect her.

1020
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:27,320
I would never leave my kitchen table as a human shield for the Queen of Norway.

1021
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:31,920
Look, it's King Bullock. He's coming to me with the Queen.

1022
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:38,340
I would fornicate safely and without the administration with the Queen and King of Norwegians.

1023
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:44,800
I would keep the King and Queen of Norway in my own garage if necessary to protect them from harm.

1024
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:52,600
Norway itself may have to be bombed to protect the King and Queen of that selfsame land.

1025
00:48:52,820 --> 00:49:00,180
I would fill my freezer with brand spanking new ice trays for the King and Queen of Norway.

1026
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,460
I would burn all my

1027
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:20,580
in my own

1028
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:32,400


1029
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:32,400


1030
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:32,400


1031
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:31,940
on.

1032
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:32,400
the

1033
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,840
We'll be back.

1034
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,300
We'll be back.

1035
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,380
We'll be back.

1036
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,680
We'll be back.

1037
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,180
We'll be back.

1038
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,020
We'll be back.

1039
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:49,100
We'll be back.

1040
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,140
We'll be back.

1041
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,180
We'll be back.

1042
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:02,840
We'll be back.

1043
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,480
We'll be back.

1044
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,020
We'll be back.

1045
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,280
We'll be back.

1046
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,360
We'll be back.

1047
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,280
We'll be back.

1048
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,720
We'll be back.

1049
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,140
We'll be back.

1050
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,040
We'll be back.

1051
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,140
Oh, God.

1052
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,920
Oh, God.

1053
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:30,040


1054
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,600
I had no cause to die

1055
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:53,600
play it baby

1056
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,620
ok

1057
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,840
tell me dude

1058
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,160
are you lost

1059
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,360
is your heart

1060
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,900
still pained

1061
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,800
shall I come back

1062
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,060
again

1063
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,160
tell me dude

1064
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,600
are you lost

1065
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,580
are you lost

1066
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:22,580


1067
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:31,640
are you lost

1068
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,580
are you lost

1069
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,640
are you lost

1070
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,620
are you lost

1071
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,340
14 years just shot right there man

1072
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,400
I tell you

1073
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,300
huh

1074
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,400
praise Bob

1075
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,420
huh

1076
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,020
is that the end

1077
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,280
is it all done

1078
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,620
I'm so sorry

1079
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


1080
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


1081
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


1082
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


1083
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


1084
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


1085
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


1086
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


1087
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


1088
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


1089
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:01,620


1090
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,700
Is there no more?

1091
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,520
Did you box up the spinach?

1092
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,500
Is it without a towel or a trouser?

1093
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,620
To be continued...
