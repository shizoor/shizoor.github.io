1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
I'm from under the walls, this is the sun from where the wall is cracked.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:22,580
My voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice.

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,640
Yes, dear friends.

4
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,000
Am I really coming in?

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,160
Crank my voice.

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,700
Yes, there we go.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,280
Oh, praise Elvis, dear friends.

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,140
And praise George.

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,280
More sugar, dear friends.

10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,960
We're really going to miss George and those mellow oldies.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,540
You know, after a couple of weeks when he goes on to New York City.

12
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,940
Because we needed that softer sort of carpet underfoot.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,440
It's a slackless environment.

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:12,200
Before we, you know, we needed that before it got trod upon by the sheer ugliness.

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,160
The ugliness, dear friends, of the arrr slack.

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:18,720
Slack.

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,180
The horror of Bob.

18
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:22,900
Pity.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,500
Oh, pity the subgeniuses.

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,120
They deserve to be treated with respect.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,140
Right?

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,340
Right?

23
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,260
Right?

24
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,300
Right?

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,800
Right?

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,300
Right?

27
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:40,460
Right?

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,020
Right?

29
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,800
Right?

30
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,320
Right?

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:42,620
Right?

32
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,260
Right?

33
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:44,420


34
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,720
Right?

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,060
Right?

36
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:46,360
Right?

37
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,040
Right?

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,220
Right?

39
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,300
Right?

Thank you.

57
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,240
Wait, Dad!

61
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,440
Oh, no!

62
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,500
I can take you here in Hunger City.

63
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,720
Nothing's gonna stop me.

64
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,940
I know I'll survive.

65
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,320
I can take you here in Hunger City.

66
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,180
What?

67
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,660
What?

68
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,200
What?

69
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,900
What?

70
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,380
What?

71
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:37,700
What?

72
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:37,860
What?

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,320
What?

74
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,620
What?

75
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:38,760
What?

76
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,060
What?

77
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,260
What?

78
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,420
What?

79
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:39,780
What?

80
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,120
What?

81
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,140
What?

82
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:40,520
What?

83
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:40,920
What?

84
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,300
What?

85
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:41,680
What?

86
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,180
What?

87
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:42,900


88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,600
What?

89
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:45,600


90
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:45,600


91
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:45,600


92
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,500
Slut.

93
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,020
Wow!

94
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,020


95
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,500
Slow.

96
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,780
Slow.

97
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:48,980
Slow.

98
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,960
Slow.

99
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,020
Praise God.

100
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,980
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Gordon Truby.

101
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:08,960
The end times are near, but there's nothing to fear.

102
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:17,220
If you just send us a dollar, we get set.

103
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:26,300
Prepare for the launch of the bleeding head of a pulver.

104
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,780
Remember the motto, perform the salute.

105
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,900
Smack off and study the pamphlets.

106
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,300
And if you should falter, then look to the sky.

107
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,020
Cause Bob's...

108
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,880
Bob's always somewhere nearby.

109
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,060
There's a pipe in the sky.

110
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,640
And I'll follow him anywhere.

111
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,840
Through the sun, there's no money.

112
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,100
Through a hurricane tide.

113
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,200
There's a pipe in the sky.

114
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,380
Some people wipe their

115
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,640
31st numbers in the New York Times.

116
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,020
Everysein then says,

117
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,960
This is a great program.

118
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,160
If you would like to rub elbows with us.

119
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,140
Well, I'd like to rub salt.

120
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:37,820
Euh.

121
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,140
What?

122
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,220
helping women with these kinds of problems.

123
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,980
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen.

124
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,200
Don't talk of musicians for a moment.

125
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,140
salt to rub it between the forefinger and the thumb walk with the shins around the burning

126
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:58,300
decapitated child's head and then jump into the grave and say hop on my thumb hop on my thumb

127
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:06,540
this is a problem i must overcome play in a dead cat or a live cat that's not feeling well

128
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,380
then cover with the sod and when the birds chirp on the third saturday after mickle mass take a

129
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:21,520
large deal of pickle and then the surface i'm gonna start all over again i've got to start this

130
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:33,220
damn show all over again god i'm so sick and tired of having to start this stupid show over and over

131
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:40,240
and over again this show never seems to go anywhere it's nothing but an endless beginning

132
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,880
a thousand beginning sequences

133
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,100
it seems like

134
00:08:44,100 --> 00:09:01,220
oh yes dear friends

135
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,600
you're listening to the ivan stang theme by nina rota by way of snake finger

136
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,240
we got some uh a whole bunch of stuff from ralph records oh it praised bob

137
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,560
the wonderful reverend shena over there at ralph records has converted to bob into the hour of

138
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,060
slack and so i've got an infinite supply of all the material from ralph records and i'll be playing

139
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:42,340
some of the new oh a little bit of new residents new negative land and snake finger but but anyway

140
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,840
here we go

141
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,000
here we go

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,580
But you know, those things pale in comparison to that which has been sanctified by Bob.

143
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,360
Because, dear friends, which came first, really?

144
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,820
The mistake or the excuse?

145
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:07,400
You know, the astounding power of the human mind is nowhere better illustrated than in its ability to rationalize its own mistakes.

146
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:16,440
Oh, yes, yes, yes, it can devise wonderful machines and soaring concertos.

147
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:23,400
But those wilt, dear friends, besides the inventiveness of its excuses.

148
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:32,280
After all, must we not survive before we can afford to indulge in such pleasantries as culture and science?

149
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,420
The alcoholic, for instance, or the yogi.

150
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,380
Or the...

151
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:43,340
Any cult member or subgenius, by intuitively recognizing this, can bypass it.

152
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,780
And even in that, find excuses to bypass survival itself.

153
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:56,580
Yes, alcohol or Bob, in other words, can be more seductive than life itself.

154
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
Ah, yes, praise Bob.

155
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,360
This is your friend, Reverend Ivan Stank.

156
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,980
And you're listening to The Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 FM.

157
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,300
And...

158
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:07,980
Dallas, Texas.

159
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,780
Oh, yeah.

160
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,800
The Hour of Slack.

161
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,440
The Hour of Slack.

162
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:30,320
The Hour of Slack.

163
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,380
And so, Bob Dobbs founded his church upon a...

164
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,860
On a sandy beach of common sense, sense of humor, and...

165
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,120
Dollars and cents.

166
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,420
A likely story, you say.

167
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,140
But it's simple, really.

168
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,720
Bob is lucky, not smart.

169
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:59,080
In fact, by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence, he's gifted with incredible stupidity.

170
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,920
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness.

171
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,360
This enables him to act without thinking.

172
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,680
To effortlessly surf the luck plane.

173
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,240
To float down the fabled path of least resistance.

174
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,680
To, in fact, make a million dollars each time he screws up.

175
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,100
Thus, it is not his wisdom, but his divine follies.

176
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,220
His holy blunders which we emulate.

177
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,720
The miracle is not in what Bob does to you, but in what he allows you to do to yourself.

178
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,360
He brings the student to life.

179
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,720
The realization that everything you know is true.

180
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,140
Pull the wool over your own eyes, he admonishes.

181
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,960
And you may finally relax in the safety of your own delusions.

182
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,700
Under the conspiracy, you're being ripped off every day.

183
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,820
But you can learn to enjoy it.

184
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,280
You can choose the way you're gonna get screwed.

185
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,180
Some ways are fun.

186
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,300
Some ways are not.

187
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,300


188
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:14,300
Dobbs journeyed to Tibet, and under ancient holy men, he perfected the arts of glanscaping and acubating.

189
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,220
He also began modeling for hundreds of magazine ads, leaving early clues of his presence.

190
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:27,700
These old ads are the only known photos of Dobbs, for he otherwise remains elusive.

191
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,580
Shunning both the spotlight and the authorities.

192
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,160
In 1979, he was the first person in the world to be called the god of the universe.

193
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:44,600
He recruited two randomly selected nobodies, Dr. Philo Drummond and Ivan Stang, to begin a public outreach arm and spread his seed word of slag.

194
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The church is now subjected to constant harassment and attacks from every corner, which only serves to illustrate how much they fear his message.

195
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:01,060
Some call us Satanists, or the mockers prophesied in the Bible as harbingers of the end times.

196
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,160
Still others, deem the gospel to be a false gospel.

197
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,160


198
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,160


199
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,160


200
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,160


201
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,160


202
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,160


203
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,160


204
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,460
dare to deny that Bob exists at all.

205
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,320
But if that were so,

206
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,980
who posed for all those magazine ads in the 50s?

207
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,200
The feminist dupes of the conspiracy charge

208
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,960
that not enough members are women.

209
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,940
Bob would agree to that.

210
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,240
Indeed, he would say,

211
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
there will never be enough women,

212
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,440
but at least the ones we have are all women.

213
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,160
And Bob?

214
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,940
Bob is all men.

215
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,120
Man.

216
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,560
The James Bond of Zen masters,

217
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,400
the most dashing religious leader of his time.

218
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,560
Yes, Bob Dobbs is a sex god.

219
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,900
He has come and keeps coming again and again

220
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,540
not to forgive your sins,

221
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,760
but to rationalize them,

222
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,000
to justify your sins.

223
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,040
Let me tell you the story

224
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,620
of James.

225
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,820
He was an arm of God's

226
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,140
bread of men

227
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,280
and yet he

228
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,980
he walked with the gods.

229
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,580
He wore a silly grin

230
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,620
and he smoked a stupid pipe.

231
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,480
He fought the conspiracy

232
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,720
every day of his life.

233
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,660
He lit the stench

234
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,240
of many a man.

235
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,320
Father men,

236
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:30,920
it should be said,

237
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:39,620
With his mighty glance, he founded the religion in which we all believe.

238
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,620
Brought us all the slack that everybody needs.

239
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,740
Puff was the greatest salesman the world had ever seen.

240
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,640
He could sell the farms after he ate all the beans.

241
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,400
He could sell a pile of bad stuff to a lonely fly.

242
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,500
All of us who knew him figured he would never die.

243
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,080
Bob Dawes, Bob Dawes.

244
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,720
He was a great man.

245
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,940
He was a real man and brave.

246
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,340
Bob Dawes, Bob Dawes.

247
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,740
He's lying dead in his grave.

248
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,040
Without Bob, what are we gonna do?

249
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,780
With a man from Planet X go marching through.

250
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,820
The horrible racist stuck in jail.

251
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,720
The old man from the old school.

252
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,940
Bob Dawes, Bob Dawes.

253
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,080
Bob Dawes was bailed, but now he's dead.

254
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,540
So we're doomed.

255
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,740
What to do?

256
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,080
What to do?

257
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:03,820


258
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,780
He founded the city known as Top Town.

259
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,320
Deep within Malaysia, it was rarely found.

260
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,840
There he studied forbidden science until that fateful day.

261
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:28,660
When he came unto his flock in the city by the bay.

262
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,880
Few had ever seen him.

263
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,180
Few had ever dared.

264
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,100
Most had no occasion.

265
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,020
Others just plain scared.

266
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,760
The rudiments came to Frisco for the event of the age.

267
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,440
When the only smiling one would step out on the stage.

268
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,660
He walked up to the left and he looked to the right.

269
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:08,360
They stepped out with confidence in two eyes.

270
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,620
All the cheering fans as he strode up to the mic.

271
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,660
He would put his assassin's bullets into his breast.

272
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:29,060
Bob Dawes, Bob Dawes.

273
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,680
Bob Dawes, Bob Dawes.

274
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,180
The crowd saw their saviour had come.

275
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:40,080
Bob Dawes, Bob Dawes.

276
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,540
Was greeted by the fatherhood home.

277
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,640
Without Bob we have no need of him.

278
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,460
As we swiftly approach that middle year

279
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,300
For in 1998 he would have set the record straight

280
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,340
But now he's dead so we're due to a deer

281
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:17,000
Well this has been the story of J.R. Bob Dobbs

282
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,220
Some call him Messiah, others call him fraud

283
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,980
I hope that before 98 that the word gets out

284
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,340
That Bob Dobbs was the only guy we couldn't do without

285
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:42,060
The end times are upon us and things don't look so good

286
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,860
Bob Dobbs had the answer but was seldom heard

287
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,640
Understood, worthy to heap up trouble

288
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,280
Our books are in the red

289
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,540
There is no joy in Budville

290
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,200
Now that Bob is dead

291
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,560
So we pray to God and Jesus

292
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,700
To do battle for Bob's soul

293
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,380
With a dog and a peanut

294
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,400
For strength that they all rule

295
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,800
We pray to he who needs no name

296
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,140
That we may need no slack

297
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,220
And if Rachel won't hand

298
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,680
Please send our money back

299
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,460
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs

300
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,240
Our lives are worth shit without you

301
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,960
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs

302
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,420
Oh dear

303
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,980
What will we do?

304
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,440
Without Bob we are in a time fix

305
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,080
When the Axis come to kill us just for kicks

306
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,160
If they were not in his grave

307
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,180
All these sub-geni would be saved

308
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,400
But it is so our chances are nicks

309
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:16,060
But it is so our chances are nicks

310
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:31,240
And it was

311
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,540
Needless to say

312
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:40,680
We failed

313
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:40,680


314
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,000
But this is

315
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,600
Situation

316
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,740
There is no hope

317
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,300
In ourini

318
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,940
And ever

319
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,540
of JR Bob Dobbs.

320
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,000
I've been working on that video all week, you know?

321
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,920
And then along came this guy.

322
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,420
Bob Dobbs.

323
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,320
Oh, listen to that.

324
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,360
Now see, if this was another...

325
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,900
If this was any other radio show,

326
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,920
I would pull this off.

327
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,380
I would pull the tape out of this cassette deck.

328
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:46,840
You see?

329
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,240
On upper deck, cassette deck number one,

330
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,420
we're hearing this otherwise lovely Snakefinger song.

331
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,260
Oh, well, we were.

332
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,920
But it was running at the wrong speed.

333
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,600
God, I wish I hadn't been talking over it.

334
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,520
It's just kind of like jammed up.

335
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,220
Oh, there we go.

336
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,360
Here, it's coming back.

337
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,040
Oh, listen to that.

338
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,180
Isn't that beautiful?

339
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,540
George warned me about this earlier tonight.

340
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,100
He said,

341
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,460
Doug,

342
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,700
he called me by that name for some reason.

343
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,780
He said,

344
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,600
there's something wrong with cassette deck number one there.

345
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,120
Let's try it again.

346
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,920
One more.

347
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,420
No.

348
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,980
Ain't gonna do it, friends.

349
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,480
Well, I know.

350
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,120
We'll have to call in the healer of appliances.

351
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,240
Yes, I'm sure that Dr. Philodrumon

352
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,360
can do something about that horrible situation.

353
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,400
Yes.

354
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,240
Yeah, we're back to normal.

355
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,400
Let's see what's on TV tonight.

356
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,580
There's a special on one of the,

357
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,080
well, let's see, it's channel 38 if you get cable.

358
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,920
Frappa Billy live in Nashville.

359
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,820
On channel 27 tonight,

360
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,900
the man from Planet X.

361
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,180
And if you tune in right now,

362
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,760
you can catch the very end of

363
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,360
Our Squirting Universe on PBS.

364
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,920
See, 39, I think, has 20 million miles,

365
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,760
and Mars Needs Women right after that.

366
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,900
Both of those feature cameo appearances

367
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,180
by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

368
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,360
On CBN, the Christian Broadcasting Network,

369
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,900
we've got Love That Bob.

370
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,800
And after that, Bob and Connie and Jim and Tammy.

371
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,240
I can't wait.

372
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,980
That's like a soft core porno.

373
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,920
And then Fort Dobbs.

374
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,940
What is Fort Dobbs about?

375
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,460
Apaches try to regain their sacred pipe

376
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,320
from a mad Caucasian plunderer.

377
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,320
And, oh, that's with John Wayne.

378
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,740
And then at midnight,

379
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,120
Dante's Inferno with Spencer Tracy,

380
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,980
which also has an amazing appearance by Bob Dobbs.

381
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,360
But, oh, let's see,

382
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,260
if I can just get my technical act together here, friends.

383
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,220
And I think I can.

384
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,620
I want to play,

385
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,200
this song I'd like to,

386
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,900
I'm serious here,

387
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,200
it's a quiet moment.

388
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,400
I'd like to dedicate this to those,

389
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,780
the kids that were lost in the Guadalupe River this weekend.

390
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,120
Oh, Jesus gave me water.

391
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,460
Jesus gave me water.

392
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,820
Jesus gave me water.

393
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,280
He gave me water.

394
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,800
He gave me water.

395
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,620
Jesus gave that woman.

396
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,960
He gave me water.

397
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,140


398
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,240
Gave her their living last day.

399
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,860
He gave me water.

400
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,340
He gave me water.

401
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:47,460
He gave me water.

402
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,080
What a loving water.

403
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,860
And there was none in the well.

404
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,780
There was a woman from Samaria,

405
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,520
came to the well to get some water.

406
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,580
It was there she met our savior.

407
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
So the story tell,

408
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,320
how that woman dropped her pitcher,

409
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,120
but her drinking was made richer

410
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,240
by the water he gave her.

411
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,940
She saw there came,

412
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:22,220
she saw parts of her well.

413
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,060
When her bloodflow was split in half,

414
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,060


415
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,480
when our girl crossed the seabrook.

416
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:25,540


417
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:25,540


418
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,920
She intensively kept a hat,

419
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:27,980


420
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:27,980


421
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:27,980


422
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,420
Mary do not drive a woman away.

423
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:28,680
He said,

424
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:28,720


425
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:28,720


426
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:28,720


427
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:28,740
our best friends in good faith,

428
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:28,800
They should know why I give them water.

429
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,480
My God I want to die for this fricking writer,

430
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,220
and he gave him the balls of his life,

431
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,860
and he gave me the water.

432
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,240
He gave me water.

433
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,340
He gave me water.

434
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:37,420


435
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:39,760
He gave me water.

436
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,100
He gave me water.

437
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,720
Yes, that was Snakefinger, also late.

438
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,320
Yes, Snakefinger's also dead.

439
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,840
Reverend Sheena Timoney down there at Ralph Records said that just about three weeks ago,

440
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,380
old Snakefinger bought it.

441
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,740
Yes, he did.

442
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,980
He's out of the way now.

443
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,860
Sad, sad.

444
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,800
But you know he's gone on to a life in Bob, a new life in Bob.

445
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,220
This is from the Potatoes album.

446
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,160
Potatoes, Volume 1 from Ralph Records.

447
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,220

448
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,440
Thank you.

449
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,160
Thank you.

450
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,280
Like this.

451
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,820
Like this.

452
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,680
Alright.

453
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,480
We don't need this, right?

454
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,220
We don't need this.

455
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,700
We don't need this.

456
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,660
We don't need this.

457
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:33,720
We don't need this.

Working on a chain gang for Bob

477

modern day subgenius a go-go shows. I don't care because this is the way Dobbs has willed it

478
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:11,040
to be and everything is okay. The new Stark Fist magazine is out. Both of the X-Day video

00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,880
www.subgenius.com for details. That may be my doctor. Praise Bob.

486
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:44,360
You can say what you want. Yeah, you can put her down. But one thing you better remember.

487
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,280
You can say what you want.

488
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:56,240
You can say what you want.

489
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,920
You can say what you want.

490
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:47,640
You can say what you want.

491
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:47,640


492
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,020
I don't trust you or Norm anymore.

493
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,780
But I trust Bobby.

494
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:58,080
You fear is that you're not man enough.

495
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,380
You're not man enough, are you?

496
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,680
Are you this family?

497
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,860
Yeah.

498
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,780
Oh, Bobby.

499
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,800
Bobby.

500
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,240
Bobby.

501
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,160
Of course.

502
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,180
I'm sorry.

503
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,020
Uh-huh.

504
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,680
Uh-huh.

505
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:16,880


506
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,280
Uh-huh.

507
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,280


508
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,280


509
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,280


510
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,280


511
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,280


512
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,840
I'm sorry, Bobby.

513
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,620
Oh, Bob.

514
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,240
I'm sorry.

515
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,240


516
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,240


517
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,240


518
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,240


519
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,720
But Bob's my friend too.

520
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,560
I mean, pastor.

521
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,680
Don't make me drive across that creek.

522
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,220
Ow!

523
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,980
Not with all that heavy rain.

524
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,820
No.

525
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,660
Well, all right.

526
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,400
Like me.

527
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,580
All right.

528
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,360
If Jesus said so, I'll...

529
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,820
Let's talk about it.

530
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,380
I'll do it, Bob!

531
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,300
Oh, yeah.

532
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,500
Bravo!

533
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:45,720
We made it!

534
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:45,760


535
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:45,760


536
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,680
We made it!

537
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,040
Bravo!

538
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,120
Bravo!

539
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,120


540
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,120


541
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,120


542
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,300
Friends, you can call A...

543
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,420
No, you can't.

544
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,080
Oh, and talk to the Willa Dobbs.

545
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,880
Complain about the tasteless things that we say over the air.

546
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,080
Or you can call A...

547
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,500
No, you can't call that one either.

548
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,000
Sorry.

549
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,260
Things we say on the air.

550
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:17,900
Thank you.

551
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,300
But, you know, uh...

552
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,540
Hey.

553
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,620
One thing, friends,

554
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,420
is be sweet to your old hometown.

555
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,880
Yeah.

556
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,900
But, you know,

557
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,200
there's no excuse

558
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,380
when they tell you not to go across there.

559
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,580
It doesn't matter if Jesus says to or not.

560
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,780
I don't care.

561
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,260
As we end another broadcast,

562
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,640
let me say that you ain't got nothing

563
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,480
and he's got it all.

564
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,800
And your miserable self

565
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,780
is against the wall.

566
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,800
The only thing you have not tried

567
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,080
is the sport of chumps.

568
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,400
That's suicide.

569
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,640
That's suicide.

570
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
That's suicide.

571
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,620
There ain't no use in living.

572
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,900
It's all a waste of time.

573
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,080
And you want to throw your life away.

574
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,900
The people that you find

575
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,260
will get on and get it over with then.

576
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,200
Find you a bridge and take a jump.

577
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,860
Make sure you do it right the first time.

578
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,660
Because nothing's worse than a suicide jump.

579
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,560
Oh, yeah.

580
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,040
You see, there ain't no light to shine in

581
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,620
through the bushes up ahead.

582
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,260
And walking around in the dark.

583
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:47,260


584
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,040
You don't want to be so sorry

585
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,860
when we find out who was it.

586
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,240
Now, get on and get it over with then.

587
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,240
Find you a bridge and take a jump.

588
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,700
Just make sure you do it right the first time.

589
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,640
Because nothing's worse than a suicide jump.

590
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,460
Oh, yeah.

591
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,880
Now, maybe you're scared to jump in.

592
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,880
And poison makes you sick.

593
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,740
And you want a little attention.

594
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,980
And you need it pretty quick.

595
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,200
You don't want to mess your face up.

596
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,040
And you won't know if it's you.

597
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,360
Oh, there's just so much to worry about.

598
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,100
Now, what you gonna do?

599
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,260
Go get on and get it over with then.

600
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,220
Find you a bridge and take a jump.

601
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,740
Just make sure you do it right the first time.

602
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,620
Because nothing's worse than a suicide jump.

603
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,340
Oh, yeah.

604
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,100
Now, maybe you're scared to jump in.

605
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,100
And poison makes you sick.

606
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,000
And you want a little attention.

607
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,240
And you need it pretty quick.

608
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,540
You don't want to mess your face up.

609
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,380
And you won't know if it's you

610
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,240
Or there's something wrong.

611
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,240


612
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,240


613
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,240


614
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:43,680
Hey, tonight's hour of slack is underwritten by the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company.

615
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,120
The Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company features Dobbs-approved church wear, including T-shirts and buttons and junk.

616
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,720
And that's the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, serving the public since God knows when.

617
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,720
The post office box is...

618
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,660
Not there anymore, unfortunately.

619
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,300
753-59-5148.

620
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:09,760
Thanks, Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, for supporting K&ON.

621
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,660
K&ON.com

622
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:59,860
K&ON.com

623
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:28,960
Thanks, because even though that was 1987, here in 1998, there is a subgenius Robert Anton Wilson show coming up in Austin, Texas on December 4th and or 5th.

624
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,960
Check with www.fringeware.com

625
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,600
Mr. Robert Anton Wilson, he's a subgenius, it's okay.

626
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:43,180
And as a matter of fact, he's a subgenius without whom there would probably be no...

627
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,920
Defined subgeniuses.

628
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,900
And that's the truth.

629
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,360
I mean, had it not been for the amazing books of Robert Anton Wilson,

630
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,760
I, you know, I don't know if Bob would have gone ahead and decided to release his word to the public.

631
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,940
But when he saw that the Illuminatus Trilogy and some of those other things sold,

632
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:07,560
why, he thought, well, I guess it's about time we let at least a few of these people into it, if they can take it.

633
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,880
Eight-track stereo, colored TV.

634
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,060
The blues are the truth.

635
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:28,180
But friends, I keep having to cut in here in 1998 over this 1987 subgenius show.

636
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:35,780
If I'd known how much old specific to Dallas crap there was on here, I'd have just done an original show.

637
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,760
It's taken me so long just to cover up the old useless...

638
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,300
Well, anyway, so it looks like we're going to have some new stuff.

639
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,660
Anyway...

640
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:51,060
Anyway, here, for at least until we get to 47 on the counter, here is Bill T. Miller's beautiful piece,

641
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,800
TV Addict, from his new CD, Kings of Feedback Rules.

642
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,240
The blues are the truth.

643
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,740
Let's watch something entertaining.

644
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:24,580
You're not anybody in America unless you're on TV.

645
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:41,540
I'm alone with my machines.

646
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,660
My TV.

647
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,040
My one true friend.

648
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,160
It's my window to the world.

649
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,300
I never turn it off.

650
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,720
I don't listen to your friends.

651
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,680
Oh, yeah.

652
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,220
You have been watching way too much TV.

653
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,420
You know, I must confess, I'm a television addict.

654
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
I just need constant stimulation.

655
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,140
Too much is never enough.

656
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,340
You know I'm dreaming in color.

657
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,680
But I'm living in black and white.

658
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,820
Now I believe everything I see.

659
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,720
It's gotta be a conspiracy.

660
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:30,720
Oh, nonsense.

661
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,460
I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist.

662
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:39,460


663
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:39,460


664
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:39,540
I'm just a

00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,260
I'm just a

I'm just a

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:40,960

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,160
I'm just a

00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,200
I'm just a

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:41,200


673
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,260
I'm just a

674
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:43,260


675

676
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:43,260

00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:43,260

TV and playing my guitar.

686
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,080
Oh yeah.

687
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,020
They say if you want to make it in this world,

688
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:39,560
you need endurance and a little bit of talent

689
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,180
and a whole lot of luck.

690
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,220
I'm going with my machine.

691
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,780
My TV and my one cheap deck.

692
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,440
It's my window to the world.

693
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,400
I never turn it off.

694
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,080
There's not a place for us.

695
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,560
But time has played for us.

696
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,740
Hold my hand and we're halfway there.

697
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,580
Hold my hand and I'll take you there.

698
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:21,860
Somehow.

699
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,820
Someday.

700
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,080
Somewhere.

701
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:42,640
Someday.

702
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:42,640


703
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:43,800
Someday.

704
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,380
Someday.

705
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:51,380


706
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,340
Someday.

707
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:52,340


708
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:52,340


709
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,020
Someday.

710
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,200
Someday.

711
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:54,200


712
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:57,580
Someday.

713
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:57,600
Someday.

714
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,120
Oh yes, dear friends, that's the Deebo's.

715
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,920
Yes, those rogue subgeniuses, the Deebo's.

716
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,580
Or what do they call it?

717
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,500
Deebo, I guess.

718
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,000
I don't know.

719
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,800
Why don't you own a copy of that one?

720
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,540
Well, because you earned it.

721
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,720
You're not a subgenius yet because you haven't paid your dues.

722
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,180
I could play this song for you, but I won't.

723
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:25,520
Good by Joe, me got to go, me on my own.

724
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:31,940
Me got to go, hold the beer, roll down the button.

725
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:38,920
My Yvonne, sweet as one, me on my own.

726
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,120
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bike.

727
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,080
Jambo lie in a crawfish pie.

728
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,920
I sit around at the house and I listen to this old box,

729
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:21,280
to all kinds of weird, old, funky, old-timey music like this.

730
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,220
This is old, what's it called?

731
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,240
Old Western music, Western Germany, 1500s.

732
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,640
Ah, it feels so good.

733
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,600
Yeah, back at the house, I'm the proud owner of two little kids, believe it or not.

734
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,620
Yes, I am.

735
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,540
Both of them are old.

736
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:39,540


737
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:39,540


738
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:39,540


739
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:44,060
Old enough to read, but neither one of them is old enough yet to,

740
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,300
well, for me to break certain things to them about Santa Claus.

741
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,520
Now, it makes me mad that I can't tell them certain things,

742
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,800
but it almost shames me that I have to tell them other things at all.

743
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:02,580
Some of these monstrous truths don't slide by as easily as the one about Santa Claus.

744
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,440
One day, and this is the truth,

745
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,080
I had to warn my kids about certain grown-ups

746
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,780
who are so twisted by their own messed-up parents

747
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,040
that they want to, quote,

748
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,440
do bad things to you, unquote.

749
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,640
And it feels awful to break that kind of news to a kid,

750
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,660
and it's frightening to think what they're prompted to imagine

751
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,160
about the world they're going to grow up in,

752
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,760
no matter how you soften it up when you're telling them about it.

753
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,680
And I've never been able to tell them about the bomb,

754
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,220
or the germ, or the gas,

755
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,360
because I knew what would happen

756
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,320
if my kids started thinking about those things all the time.

757
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,500
They'd end up like me, dear friends,

758
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,480
and through all through high school,

759
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:53,180
I was dead sure the future would see us back in the caves.

760
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,800
As Einstein or some other wise guy once said,

761
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,920
quote,

762
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,500
I don't know what World War III will be fought with,

763
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:07,780
but the one after that will be fought with sticks and stones.

764
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,120
Unquote.

765
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:15,020
And now, dear friends, we don't even have that to look forward to.

766
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:21,280
That was a naive, positive thinking kind of view of the end of the world.

767
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,920
With the weapons they have now,

768
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,740
there wouldn't even be sticks and stones.

769
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,760
There'd be nothing, dear friends, nothing left

770
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,240
if the big mistake happened.

771
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,460
By the way, my kids did figure it out for themselves

772
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,900
without me having to say anything.

773
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,260
Between TV cartoons,

774
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,500
and the news,

775
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,000
and conversations on the playground,

776
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,720
they were able to put two and two together before first grade,

777
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,440
and you'll be glad to know that they did adjust a lot better than I did.

778
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:54,540
But, friends, most people cannot conceive of worldwide extinction

779
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,140
of all higher life forms.

780
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,660
Nay, they've got a lot of trouble, for that matter,

781
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,340
conceptualizing so much as a rape or a car wreck.

782
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,300
At least until it happens to them.

783
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,620
Positive thinking.

784
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,820
You know, oh, positive thinking, oh, don't you love it?

785
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,400
And that escape into affluent isolation, dear friends,

786
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,300
have become so socially desirable,

787
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,860
that the idea of preparing for the worst,

788
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,820
that's a bad habit now.

789
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,600
Only survivalists and cooks would do something like that.

790
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,440
To most Americans, friends,

791
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:35,920
a big mistake is, oh, say, forgetting to photocopy that textiles contract

792
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,040
before the board meeting, or...

793
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:42,840
burning the roast when guests are expected for dinner.

794
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,920
People nowadays, they won't build themselves a fallout shelter.

795
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:52,420
They won't even, I won't even quit smoking, myself, for that matter.

796
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,800
And yet, they'll donate to save the whales.

797
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,720
Strange paradoxes, but, uh, you see, friends,

798
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:07,020
most human beings have no idea how real they are.

799
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,380
And, for that matter, they don't know how smart they are,

800
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,040
but, at the same time, they grossly underestimate their own stupidity.

801
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,660
And, they...

802
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,360
To think about it, they could wreck,

803
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,760
permanently wreck, the rest of the planet,

804
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,380
for all of us, by just, for no other reason,

805
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,500
than not giving themselves enough credit,

806
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,160
either for brains or for the lack thereof.

807
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,780
And, if they distrust themselves so much, friends, think, how,

808
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:44,480
much they distrust you. They assume that they wouldn't be good enough at anything important,

809
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,300
like stopping the arms race to take a stab at it, and in all too few cases they're right.

810
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:56,900
So they cling to the safe and the meaningless, and they wish everyone else would too. When

811
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:01,620
somebody tries to warn them about a danger they didn't already know about, well, they

812
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:10,480
take that as an insult. Now as Bob Dobbs said to a Sunday school class in 1955, if they

813
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,820
all thought they were as great as I think I am, everybody'd get along just fine, even

814
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,980
though they'd all be wrong. That's what Bob said.

815
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:29,720
So how much do you tell your kids about the future? About pollution, about overpopulation

816
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,380
and war and crime?

817
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:38,700
And just exactly what those statistics are pointing to? When does it get past survival

818
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:45,320
training friends and start making them suicidal? For that matter, how much can you psychologically

819
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:51,460
afford to tell yourself? Maybe a lot more than you think.

820
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,740
It's a sick and perverse nation, dear friends. It is indeed.

821
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,060
You know, let me sell you this horse you coped with all those pensa you ask for.

822
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:43,500
Well, you know, you love me. Didn't you ever hear anything like that?

823
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,380
Oh god, no man, no, no man.

824
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:44,680
Oh, yeah.

825
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:54,360
How about it was this day when, what was it you forgot?

826
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:54,880
What day was it?

827
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,780
Huh, yeah.

828
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:00,900
Oh, man.

829
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,600
I don't remember these vivex stuff.

830
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:06,840
know about, you know, dozens of cheap sound effects are not going to keep these people

831
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,740
away. They're going to go right down into your back pocket, and they're going to go

832
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:17,060
right into that wallet, and they're going to pull out that card, and I'm afraid that's

833
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:17,120
it.

834
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,720
Look, look, okay, okay. I've been in the...

835
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,180
Now, Doug?

836
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,340
Just keep my daughter out of it if you possibly can.

837
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:31,540
I can't help it. I can't help it. They followed you to the boat. They got photos.

838
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,080
Very consensual.

839
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:38,700
They know that person never came back with you on the boat, even though they were seen

840
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,200
leaving.

841
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,120
Well, what are we supposed to do? Just let the older dog...

842
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:42,800
This is important.

843
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:48,780
You're going to have to come up with a better story than that when we go before those cameras

844
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,100
tomorrow.

845
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:55,660
Don't you think there's a way to convince them that these sacrifices really are necessary

846
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,220
to...

847
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:01,520
Well, I can't do it without your cooperation. What do you think you're paying me all this

848
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,140
money for?

849
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,380
Well, I'm trying to cooperate. No one believes me.

850
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:12,280
You won't even cooperate with me. I'm your own doctor lawyer. Now, what's going to happen

851
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,320
when you're up before Senator Hal?

852
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,280
Hello, you're on the air.

853
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:23,400
I stayed to watch those broken instruments, and I saw a thing so strange, I should not

854
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,420
dare to mention it without more evidence.

855
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,200
Hello?

856
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:30,820
But that my own clear conscience strengthens me, and that good companion that a hold of

857
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,860
a man with the armor of impurity, I saw it there.

858
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,100
Is this some sort of a threat?

859
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:44,140
A body without a head that moved along like all the others, that it spew and spill. I

860
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:48,700
held that severed head by its own hair, swinging like a lantern in its hand.

861
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,260
This young man sounds pathological.

862
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:56,000
And the head looked at us and wept in despair and made itself a lamp of its own head.

863
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:59,920
And they were two in one and wanted two.

864
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,700
Yes, one of today's troubled malaga going with it, Colonel.

865
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,860
It's a good thing we sealed him up here in this spaceship and shot him into a permanent

866
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:09,360
orbit.

867
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,000
We have a terrible item in this lost, dark, and permanent.

868
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:20,400
The collar drifts around the studio and is decapitated by Hal, who presses a button for

869
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,100
yet another.

870
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,440
It's hot.

871
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,300
Oh, yeah.

872
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,560
It's an amazing situation down here.

873
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,160
It's live.

874
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,120
I'll keep you awake.

875
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,360
I'll keep you awake for no reason at all.

876
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,800
No reason is right, dear friends.

877
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,000
Listen, I've got...

878
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,500
The Willa Dobbs just pointed out that, you know, the only call we've gotten down here

879
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,540
tonight was what?

880
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,040
Somebody wanting Madonna tickets?

881
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,000
Great show to call for that, friends.

882
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,960
Madonna, geez.

883
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:48,360
Unless you're thinking about Jesus' mother.

884
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,100
Now we can get you tickets for her.

885
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,540
She's meeting all the boys back in the garage after the show.

886
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:02,140
But listen, what makes us mad, what really makes us sick is that nobody has gotten

887
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,760
mad and sick at us yet.

888
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:10,840
Why is it I can get on the air and make underhanded, nasty...

889
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,900
Well, satirical, strictly satirical, and absolutely has nothing to do with this station, but nasty

890
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,940
comments about certain disasters that have happened in the Dallas area recently, and

891
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,740
nobody calls.

892
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,680
Nobody's upset about that.

893
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,060
Oh, no.

894
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,500
What if we mention one wounded animal?

895
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,580
If we say, even once, I like to kill animals.

896
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,060
Well, that, oh, then, oh, the lines light up.

897
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:45,700
You people are so, so angry and so ready to get up and fight when you hear somebody insult

898
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,280
your four-legged friends.

899
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,580
They're so poor and helpless.

900
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:54,320
But when we get on here and insult living human beings who died for nothing, oh, that

901
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,360
doesn't bother you a bit.

902
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,620
You don't care about that.

903
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:57,780
That's just people.

904
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,100
Oh, there, oh, that Nicaragua stuff, that's all just people.

905
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:01,700
I don't care.

906
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,800
Oh, Vietnam, oh, those were just humans.

907
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,780
Those were just two-legged animals.

908
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,520
Go ahead and napalm them again.

909
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,600
Do it again.

910
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,960
If you can't do it in Vietnam, go ahead and do it in, oh, El Salvador.

911
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,340
Do it in Nicaragua.

912
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,200
Do it anywhere you want.

913
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:14,700
I don't care.

914
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,880
My hero, Ali Norris, said it was okay, and he was told it was okay by somebody ahead

915
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,880
of him, but he doesn't remember who, and they certainly don't remember either.

916
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,360
Because, because that's okay.

917
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:32,840
It's okay to kill people, but it's, it's a terrible, terrible thing for us even to do

918
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:38,740
a satire of making fun of someone not liking animal liberation.

919
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,060
You new age pigs.

920
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:51,720
You pathetic, pathetic, useless excuses for human, I mean, you're useless excuses for

921
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,760
human beings, much less subjective.

922
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,360
You're just a bunch of geniuses.

923
00:58:54,360 --> 00:59:01,860
My God, by gobs, this, I mean, the whole thing, it's just, it is, no, we've been doing this

924
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:04,440
show, this is hour of slack number 88.

925
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:09,980
We've been doing this for 88 weeks, and no one has killed us yet.

926
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,280
You call this a free country?

927
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:20,540
You call this a patriotic American state of Texas where subgeniuses can get on the air,

928
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,720
or publish pamphlets and books and things?

929
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:23,740


930
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:24,900
We've been doing things out of P.O.

931
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:31,020
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214, and nobody's killed us yet.

932
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,260
Oh, no, no, that's too much trouble to go to.

933
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,800
Only if we kill somebody, or kill an animal, then you'll get upset.

934
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,820
Oh, yeah, yeah.

935
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,440
Sick!

936
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:42,180
Sick!

937
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,320
This is not the Dallas show.

938
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,960
This is, this is KNON.

939
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,320
Wait, I'm Doug Smith.

940
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,760
Come on, let me be Doug Smith.

941
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,720
No, you said it was my turn to play.

942
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:53,720


943
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:57,880
Hey, listen, you were, last time you were on the air, you got to be Buck Henry, or whatever

944
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,840
that guy's name is.

945
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:04,300
I think this confusion breaks out when Bob's re-erection is evident.

946
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,000
Bob's come back to life.

947
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,540
No, don't worry.

948
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:11,520
He's killing everybody on the list, and your name's next!

949
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:22,060
Now, listen, I know this sounds funny, but this Bob, this creature, this werewolf monster,

950
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,680
I don't know how we're going to kill him.

951
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:23,720


952
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,060
He's got to have some vulnerable spot, and all we have to do is figure this out, and

953
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:30,600
then we can, well, we can find out its weakness, and we can kill him.

954
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,340
No, we must communicate with him.

955
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,200
He has much to teach us.

956
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,280
I don't know whatever's down in that pit.

957
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:41,180
It ain't human, and it ain't an animal.

958
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,520
But it's smoking a pipe.

959
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,300
Look at the glint on its hairdo.

960
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,500
Look, it's beckoning to us.

961
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,100
They're going to open up with 20 million...

962
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,600
I almost thought it was Ronald Reagan.

963
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:52,260
...powders.

964
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,700
Go ahead down in that pit.

965
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:57,000
Go down in that pit and communicate with it there, Mr. College Professor.

966
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,140
Oh my gosh, look what it's doing.

967
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:00,840
I guess that's why it's smoking that pit.

968
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:00,980
Uh, hi!

969
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:03,100
We bring you greetings from our civilization.

970
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,640
Oh, look at the kid.

971
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,300
Good morning.

972
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,160
Get them subdemus guys out.

973
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:11,980
What's up?

974
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,120
What happened, little fella?

975
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:13,620
What happened?

976
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,980
Slimy sub-glemuses.

977
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,960
What's Reverend saying out here in the Bay Area?

978
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,680
He was caught in that love nest with Reverend Gamey, and they made him a little

979
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:23,680


980
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:23,680


981
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:23,680


982
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:23,680


983
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:23,680


984
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:23,680


985
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:23,680


986
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:23,680


987
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:23,680


988
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:23,680


989
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:23,680


990
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:23,700


991
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,500
They made him leave Dallas.

992
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,220
They made him leave the Shining Temple of Bob.

993
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,660
Dr. Stan, could you hand me that giant light right there?

994
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,900
Everything I say is a lie, including this very statement.

995
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:34,540
Wow!

996
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,220
It's a fire light!

997
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:35,920
Yes, that's a light.

998
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,720
I need that light.

999
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,700
Yeah, did you ever stop to think that this show just may be a little...

1000
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,660
A little animal show inside a larger show?

1001
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:51,500
And that somehow is inside an even larger show?

1002
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,340
Yeah, I had that same...

1003
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:53,680
I had that same...

1004
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:53,680


1005
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:53,680


1006
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:53,680


1007
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:53,680


1008
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,860
I had that same thing, too.

1009
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:55,940
Hotel accommodations, but...

1010
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,780
It's like someone's buying you out behind your back, and you don't even know it's a

1011
01:01:58,780 --> 01:01:59,380
swine.

1012
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,200
No, we're buying you out from behind your back.

1013
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:02,620
Are you really?

1014
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,540
Well, no one's behind me.

1015
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:04,340
Well...

1016
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,980
Here's your back now, being bought out.

1017
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:06,860
Well, I can't see.

1018
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:07,400
It's behind me.

1019
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,120
Well, never mind.

1020
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,040
Would you look at...

1021
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:10,820
Can someone see my back?

1022
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:11,600
Camera three, Bob.

1023
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,680
But let's leave things at that.

1024
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:23,680


1025
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:23,680


1026
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:23,680


1027
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:23,680


1028
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:23,680


1029
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:29,060
We'll leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief

1030
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:32,880
minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

1031
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,880
And we find then the family falling apart.

1032
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:43,920
Oh, they wail and gnash their teeth, our rival churches do, about how the children are getting

1033
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,220
exposed to too much this and too much that.

1034
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:50,960
What they ain't being exposed to is a little bit of mom and dad.

1035
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,700
Forget the pornography.

1036
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:53,500
I don't care.

1037
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,240
It makes me mad, my friend.

1038
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:57,500
The hypocrisy.

1039
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,520
Now, I have nothing against hypocrisy.

1040
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:02,620
Every religion must have its fair share of hypocrisy.

1041
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:06,860
As Bob Dobbs once said, I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of man I'm

1042
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:07,460
preaching to.

1043
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:12,440
But that preacher can get up there on TV and oh, he's so glad to keep you normal, keep

1044
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:15,520
you working so hard you don't even know your own wifey anymore.

1045
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:19,620
And your kids, you don't know your kids any better than your employees.

1046
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,620
So friend, let's get to work.

1047
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,560
Let there be slack.

1048
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:41,060
We love you dear friends and stay tuned for Robert Wisdom's American Music, the Muslim

1049
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:45,980
Party, coming right up in less than 30 seconds.

1050
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:52,500
I'm gonna get you in the car, I'm gonna make you a little crazy, I'm gonna make you a little

1051
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:52,500


1052
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:52,580
drive.

1053
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:52,840
Ooh.
