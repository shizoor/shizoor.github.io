1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,500
There's something school you want here.

2
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,380
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of slack.

3
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,500
All right, boys, we're sitting in the 나� эту and we'll make sure you enjoy Leggo Slug Talk byHerBuddhichilla!

4
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,500
We'll —

5
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,740
Loser's strays!

6
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,220
I'm gonna NPC stand up and start a war!

7
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,220


8
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,220


9
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,220


10
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,700
Uuhm....

11
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,260
Well, well, well.

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,600
I don't know if I should be preaching slack to you these days, my friend.

13
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,380
These short, short days.

14
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,500
Because, hell, I ain't had much slack.

15
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,920
I don't know if I'm a good example of a subgenius preacher.

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
That hammer ain't quit.

17
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,820
I've got two more hours to do three hours worth of radio show.

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,900
Busy, busy, busy we have been here, dear friends.

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,900
And, you know, that ain't right.

20
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,280
Ain't right at all.

21
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,700
I mean, this is a church dedicated to total wallowing in sheer slackdomness.

22
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,380
And it's just been wallowing in dumbness.

23
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,380
Or actually making up for the dumbness of the others.

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,480
Man.

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,700
Ain't just ain't no slack in this world.

26
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,740
That's what that old young coot used to say to me back in the day.

27
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,760
That's when I first heard the word slack.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,620
Didn't know what it meant until Phyla Drummond told me about Bob.

29
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,440
That's Bob on the little flute in the background.

30
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,680
This is a very rare recording.

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,400
I don't know who's on the sitar.

32
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,300
Anyway.

33
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,020
But.

34
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,140
But.

35
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,300
I must say, when we get busy around here, we get a lot done.

36
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,760
You ought to see the subgenius web site.

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,620
Or you amateurs may call it a home page.

38
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,020
On the internet.

39
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,080
Of course, you're sitting there going, well, if I had a damn computer, I wouldn't be listening to the radio.

40
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,840
Or I'd be listening to the radio over the computer.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,500
Which you can now do.

42
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,220
Not too many people have taken advantage of it yet.

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,380
Because most of them are not.

44
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,360
Well, most of them are pink.

45
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,900
This show, the hour of slack.

46
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,960
Well, some of you may be hearing it right now.

47
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,480
Coming out of a computer modem.

48
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,980
In fact, well, I'll give you that number.

49
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,160
Get your pencil ready and I'll give you the number.

50
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,860
The URL for that thing in a minute.

51
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,740
But, boy, you go look at the subgenius web site.

52
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:44,060
It's got not only 5,000 pages of everything that we've ever done.

53
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,580
We, including hundreds of new writers.

54
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,340
But now it's got...

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,580
It's got videos.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,580
Yes, you can download videos that will play on your little PC or your Macintosh or whatever you have.

57
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,260
Video clips.

58
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,860
I'm not talking about just dirty pictures or just soundtracks.

59
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,320
These are little videos with sound.

60
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,040
You can run...

61
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,260
You can look at Suzy the floozy preaching.

62
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:09,960
Yes.

63
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,220
You can see her now, boys.

64
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,220
Girls, you can watch Sterno or me preaching.

65
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,920
You can look at those of you in between.

66
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:26,460
Man and woman can look at porno claymation of Martian peen worms having at it.

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,720
And, of course, the MTV subgenius commercial.

68
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,840
Yes, there actually was one.

69
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,320
And now there is one again.

70
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
And MTV likes to think they own it.

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,540
We just put it on the Internet where anybody in the world can own it now.

72
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,900
Hold on just a second.

73
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,260
See, it didn't take but a split nanosecond for you.

74
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,660
I don't know.

75
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,040
It took about ten seconds for me.

76
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,520
I ran to get the address, the Internet address,

77
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,940
where you can listen to old hour of slack shows, okay?

78
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,120
And you can do it any time of the day.

79
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,700
And if you don't like what you're hearing,

80
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,280
there's a little slider bar at the bottom where you can skip ahead.

81
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,840
Say you don't like that Reverend Stang,

82
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,660
we can skip ahead to the Swingin' Love Corpses or whatnot.

83
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,160
Anyway, I'm going to do this quick because I know most of you aren't that high tech.

84
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,280
But for those who are, whoa, where is this?

85
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,080
Friends, my music mixing, it's just I have trouble with it now.

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,460
It's the equipment around here.

87
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,620
Okay, anyway, here it is.

88
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,480
It's http://.

89
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,840
That's the way all website addresses start.

90
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,060
www.upx.net.

91
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,140
That's www.upx.net.

92
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,460
U-P-X-net.

93
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,960
Little periods in between.

94
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,620
Slash subgenradio.

95
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,560
S-U-B-G-E-N-R-A-D-I-O.

96
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:58,940
Subgenradio.

97
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,760
Slash subgen.htm.

98
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,100
I know that sounds like a bunch of ridiculous code.

99
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,240
That very last thing, again, was not subgenradio.

100
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,000
The very last thing was subgen.htm.

101
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,600
That may sound...

102
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,800
Some of y'all cave people like a bunch of gibberish,

103
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,440
but those of us who look at it would go,

104
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,080
oh, that's the UPX website, and it's their subgenius radio series,

105
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,600
and it uses a program called iWave to compress and spew out that sound in real time,

106
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,060
and it's not like those other ones, man.

107
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,960
This is more advanced than the ones you may have heard.

108
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,040
Sure, you can hear those pink stations over real audio.

109
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,220
It sounds like a bunch of guys gargling,

110
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,000
and the music doesn't sound like anything.

111
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,580
On what we're using...

112
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,480
It sounds great.

113
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,020
And the videos on the subgenius website

114
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,240
at sunsight.onk.edu slash subgenius

115
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,660
sound real good, too, and look real good.

116
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,400
So anyway, there's that.

117
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,800
And I'm going to get back...

118
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,360
We're going to get into some serious tapery in a minute here.

119
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,660
I must mention that by the time you hear this,

120
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,640
I'm going to be in the middle of the GWAR tour.

121
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,460
I'm touring.

122
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,380
I'm hoping...

123
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes, your host, Reverend Ivan Stang,

124
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,480
will be running around with a bunch...

125
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,500
a bunch of guys in monster suits at nightclubs

126
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,360
night after night after night

127
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,280
from October 27th to November 5th,

128
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,700
and then later in November again.

129
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,680
The date's real quick here,

130
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,220
and you'll just have to watch your paper for where it is.

131
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,980
Opening for GWAR, Subgenius Devivals,

132
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,240
and wonderful GWAR show,

133
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,260
October 27th, Cleveland,

134
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,840
28th, Detroit,

135
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,540
30th, Milwaukee,

136
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,100
31st, Chicago, dear friends.

137
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,420
That ought to be a biggie.

138
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,360
November 1st, Cincinnati,

139
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,800
2nd, Columbus,

140
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,700
3rd, St. Louis,

141
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,920
4th, Lawrence, Kansas,

142
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,980
and November 5th, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

143
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,120
Then later on, well, you'll hear about these later,

144
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,620
Lubbock, Tulsa, Dallas, those ones I'm going to be on.

145
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,680
GWAR's going to be all over the West Coast,

146
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,760
but that's a moot point because no one on the West Coast

147
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,560
listens to this show, plays this show,

148
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,940
except through computers.

149
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,780
You see?

150
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,280
Now, do you start to see why,

151
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,120
I mean, you can listen to this show now in Australia,

152
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,140
in Antarctica,

153
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,880
and all you need is a simple little old home PC,

154
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,440
nothing fancy,

155
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,040
and a modem, doesn't have to be a fancy modem.

156
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,280
Well, enough of that stuff.

157
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,820
You know,

158
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,520
you know, I've actually gotten letters from people going,

159
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,120
well, I'm not going to mess with that internet

160
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,180
because that's just more high-tech conspiracy techno boredom.

161
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,960
Well, that may be true, friend,

162
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,000
but there's only three people now

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,660
publishing all books, radio, movies, CDs,

164
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,700
and videotapes, and nobody controls the internet.

165
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,820
So guess where you're going to find

166
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,920
the church of the subgenius for the most part, dear friend.

167
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,360
So, anyway, and I'm, but,

168
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,140
yeah, let me just quit for a second here.

169
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,600
Oh, yes, right now we subgeniuses have to stick

170
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,660
to pretty mundane sex acts like snake.

171
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,880
It's not so bad if you pull the teeth.

172
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,540
Oh, yeah.

173
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,260
Oh, and then there's that other sex act

174
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,080
that involves the carcass of a pig

175
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,140
and the motorized half of a rotisserie.

176
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,300
But only men can do that one.

177
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,380
But it doesn't matter what sex you are.

178
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,420
You can always find something to do with that snake.

179
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,560
For you women folk,

180
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,020
you get that nice squirm.

181
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,580
And for the men folk,

182
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,860
oh, yeah, that snake will swallow you down to the...

183
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,420
Sure, they eventually suffocate and choke,

184
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,920
but their death twitch is just what really gets

185
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,440
you off.

186
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,560
Oh, yeah.

187
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,340
Now, there are a lot of people out in the audience tonight

188
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,060
who are probably saying, that's cruel.

189
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,720
That's really cruel.

190
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,020
Oh, how could they do something that mean to an animal?

191
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,380
This world is here to be exploited by subgeniuses.

192
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,120
Oh, no, the snakes after 1998 will have

193
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,160
a communal intelligence.

194
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,660
Oh, yes.

195
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,880
Yes, and they shall be gigantic snakes.

196
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,540
And you shall be the rat.

197
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,520
Oh, yes.

198
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,960
And there's not much time remaining either.

199
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,500
Not much time remaining.

200
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,980
There's almost...

201
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,300
There's less than three years until July 5th, 1998.

202
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,100
Two years and 11 months.

203
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,540
Today!

204
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,460
Today, on the anniversary of the atomic age.

205
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,680
Oh, yes.

206
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,160
Hiroshima in a spray can.

207
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,500
Time is running out, brothers.

208
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,020
Time is running out.

209
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,160
You hear it?

210
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,440
Well, it's ticking.

211
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,360
Time is ticking away.

212
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,400
Three years.

213
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,020
Three years left.

214
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,840
Two years, 11 months, a couple hours.

215
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,520
Oh, yeah.

216
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, yeah.

217
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:22,060
But soon, with each tick, you are one tick closer to death.

218
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,680
One tick closer to July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.

219
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,620
Time is running out.

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,420
Time is running out.

221
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,340
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

222
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,680
However, eventually,

223
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,700
eventually,

224
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,300
eventually, time will just tick, tick, tick away.

225
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,460
And soon, when you least expect it,

226
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,560
when you're getting up to go to work,

227
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,780
you're going to walk outside your house.

228
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,440
There shall be naught but devastation.

229
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,580
But if you have your subgenius membership card,

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,600
well then, brothers and sisters,

231
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,780
if you've got that subgenius membership card,

232
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,500
you're going to be able to get out of the house.

233
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:17,500


234
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:17,500


235
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,380
And Dr. Legume then smashes,

236
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,600
takes a huge sledgehammer, an actual sledgehammer,

237
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,820
and smashes the living daylights out of that great big alarm clock he had on there.

238
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,000
And you know, the sad, sad thing is that time did run out for Dr. Legume.

239
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,760
Except, you know, I've been thinking about it.

240
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,220
I don't know if you heard the show last week.

241
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,140
Let me pull these little pots down just a bit.

242
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,320
So I can yell.

243
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,840
I have to mix these things myself, man.

244
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,200
I do all this stuff on the fly.

245
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,680
Sitting here all by myself in my room like that crazy militia radio guy.

246
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,160
Yeah, well, last week we announced that Dr. Katahdin Legume,

247
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,560
who you just heard in a horribly chopped up rant,

248
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,380
you know, and that's the sad thing about the conspiracy

249
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,400
trying to apply their rules to our radio shows.

250
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,380
I have to...

251
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,840
I have to destroy Dr. Legume's rants in order to play him because he cusses so much.

252
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,400
And the cussing is a big part of it.

253
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:21,820
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,840
That's just the way it goes.

255
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:31,020
But, you know, we got this letter after Legume died on the internet.

256
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,400
It said,

257
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,560
Hey, you crybabies, why don't you quit whining about Legume?

258
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,560
Y'all talk like he was Bob or something.

259
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,060
He wasn't all that hot of a preacher anyway.

260
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:44,360
Most of you are so namby-pamby that even a second-rate performing artist like Legume looks,

261
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:44,500
you know, like,

262
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,000
good to you.

263
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,820
You all should stop sending your money to his stupid family and go buy yourselves a life.

264
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,640
I'd rather see Reverend Stang anyway.

265
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,740
Now, there's a preacher.

266
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,600
He knows not to cross the line.

267
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,020
Well, I took that as an insult.

268
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,300
And to tell the truth, friends,

269
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,360
after giving it a certain amount of thought, I've changed my mind.

270
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,660
I'm glad Legume bought it.

271
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,840
He was nothing but bad news, really, to tell the truth.

272
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,060
I mean, the world...

273
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,900
The world's gonna be a much better place without him.

274
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,320
He was a basic.

275
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,640
Basically.

276
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,780
Evil man.

277
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,060
His heart was not really so much in slack, but in torture.

278
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,540
And he smelled bad.

279
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,100
He probably smells better now than he did while he was alive.

280
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,180
Did I ever mention his looks?

281
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,340
He's a great big ugly guy.

282
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,780
His face was like an infant's, blasphemously stuck onto this freakish mutated body.

283
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,920
And, well, his rants were kinda long.

284
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,140
I just about fell asleep during that last one.

285
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,220
You know, at first I thought he had some kind of potential.

286
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,300
You know, at first I thought he had some kind of potential.

287
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,740
As an idiot savant.

288
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,160
But I learned too late that he was faking even that.

289
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,800
You know, thank God I didn't send any money to his sister.

290
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:58,300
What I should do is send her one of those little plastic toy boxes that makes a laughing sound when you jostle it.

291
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,160
I mean, he was a jerk, friends.

292
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,900
He was a bully.

293
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,940
He was a big fat guy that could intimidate little skinny B-spectacle nerds.

294
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,740
And that's pretty much his claim to fame.

295
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,980
I'm ashamed of myself for my knee-jerk, sad reaction to his death.

296
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,280
If he was a true subject of the world, I would have been a little more upset.

297
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,080
If it was a true subject of the world, I would have been a little more upset.

298
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,840
If it were a true subject of the world, I would have been a little more upset.

299
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,640
I mean this whole deal is screwy.

300
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:25,600
I can't believe how he blubbered over this jerk who was just a slack vampire to begin with.

301
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,280
I, for one, have had enough of it!

302
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,080
If there is still a body, I'd say dig it up and abuse it!

303
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:38,000
But he's been rendered into an ash tray-like essence and that's kind of what he was in real life.

304
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,280
Snorting his ashes would be a good idea, except that I happen to know that he was carrying a stick instead.

305
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,960
and several diseases that would have killed him

306
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,920
and anyone who shared a prop stick with him within a year.

307
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,140
I promise.

308
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,960
You think I'm kidding?

309
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,640
You think this is just one of those silly bulldada statements

310
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,320
in deliberate bad taste?

311
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,100
I'm serious.

312
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,560
He was bad seed, my friends.

313
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,140
The very thought of his nasty gray matter

314
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,760
spread like jelly on I-95 in Pennsylvania

315
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,260
gives me a regular arousal.

316
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,900
I've touched myself to the mental picture

317
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,680
of his thick skull hitting the pavement hard enough

318
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,020
for even it to be squashed like an eggshell.

319
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,740
That's the fate of sinners.

320
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,640
I hope he wasn't killed instantly.

321
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,500
I hope he laid there on the asphalt

322
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,880
under some seamy streetlight

323
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,940
feeling pain and panic

324
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,000
as it finally sunk in that he had screwed up big time.

325
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,400
I hope, friends, that in the last few seconds

326
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,240
before his death,

327
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,160
the candle went out,

328
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,240
that he got to see that anonymous drunk driver

329
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,920
lurch over to him and spit on him.

330
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,100
I hope he laid there thinking,

331
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,380
oh God, oh God,

332
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,640
this is worse than being crippled for life.

333
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,240
I think I'm really gonna die.

334
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
I only wish that drunk driver

335
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,040
had had all of Legume's girlfriends there to have

336
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,360
right in front of his eyes

337
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,140
as the light left his shattered brain.

338
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,720
I would love to have seen the look on Legume's face

339
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,240
while he gazed through an almost distant,

340
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,440
disconnected eyeball at his own other eyeball

341
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,280
laying there in a pool of blood

342
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,740
in the forepart of his own brain.

343
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,300
I hope he felt the last threads of life

344
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,780
flitting irrevocably away

345
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,020
and knew just what it meant.

346
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,520
Okay?

347
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,080
Okay?

348
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,320
Well, I posted that little sentiment.

349
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,200
You may think I sound a little bit bitter.

350
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,960
That's not it at all.

351
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,240
I posted that sentiment,

352
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,480
out on the internet,

353
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,900
and people got real upset.

354
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,100
Pastor X here said,

355
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,420
isn't it a little too soon to be starting

356
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,180
with the sick joke stang?

357
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,340
I mean, I wouldn't expect you to have this kind of attitude

358
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,140
about Dr. Legume's death.

359
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,500
He's not even a cool vapor in the atmosphere yet,

360
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,040
and yet you're mocking him already.

361
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,480
I know that Dr. Legume spoke very highly of you.

362
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,340
He thought you were a fine preacher back in those days.

363
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,300
I'm sure you,

364
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,240
I'm sure you thought that.

365
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,680
I'm sure you thought you were.

366
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,900
He told me about your struggle with recurring syphilis,

367
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,860
it was herpes, friends,

368
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,860
and those nightmares from your days at Diebenwald.

369
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,300
He said you were the only Jew on earth worth a puddle,

370
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,960
and he would tolerate no bad talk of you.

371
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,840
You badmouth his memory,

372
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,320
but the life he lost on that cursed highway,

373
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,500
he would gladly have sacrificed to protect you.

374
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,220
Yeah, right.

375
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,140
He always had a soft spot for the small and sickly.

376
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,980
He told me about the Atlanta revival,

377
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,960
how he carried you to your hotel room

378
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,740
when you're gnarled,

379
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,880
polio-ridden legs gave out after 10 minutes of trying to preach.

380
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,280
Yeah, well, he goes,

381
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,400
I figured that losing as good a friend of the church that Legume was,

382
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,620
you'd be moping around humming that old Roy Acuff tune.

383
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,620
Okay.

384
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,420
I heard the crash on the highway,

385
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,680
but I didn't hear nobody pray.

386
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,420
There, how's that?

387
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,280
Yeah.

388
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,220
I'll tell you what, friends.

389
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,720
The final spasm,

390
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:09,900
the last spasm,

391
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,060
are the best.

392
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,080
You know, it's a good thing that some of you people aren't running this church.

393
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,500
One dead guy, a case of butt cancer,

394
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,960
and a missing radio show,

395
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,100
and you cave in.

396
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Hey, Grockett dude,

397
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,320
if any subgenius ever displays even the slightest signs of abject horror,

398
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,420
depression, and overwork-induced stress,

399
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,880
it only means that that's what Bob required.

400
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,820
If Legume buys the big one,

401
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,720
it's because Dobbs said so.

402
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,000
If the subgenius foundation is shut down by the Attorney General of Texas,

403
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,940
well, that just indicates that Dobbs didn't care if anything bad happens.

404
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,400
It was within his slack.

405
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,740
So...

406
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,080
As Dr. Dinosaur said,

407
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,780
Jerry Garcia is dead.

408
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,240
Katahdin Legume is dead.

409
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,560
Therefore,

410
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,100
Jerry Garcia

411
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,320
is

412
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,700
Katahdin Legume.

413
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,300
Uh, yep, I'm dead too.

414
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
Some drunk hit me in a truck while I was driving home.

415
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,140
It slowed me down a bit, but I'm going to, you know, go out again.

416
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,180
I'll tell you what really happened.

417
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,380
Dr. Legume was sitting on the toilet, when all of a sudden, he slipped off.

418
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,180
He fell out the window, and dropped 36 stories down into a manhole.

419
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,260
He was found the next day in the sewer, with a rat in his mouth.

420
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,680
He apparently lost it.

421
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:39,680


422
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,360
suffered from rat poisoning.

423
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,780
Yep.

424
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,680
I'll tell you, we could sit around and mope about old Dr. Le Guin

425
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,780
being cold in the grave.

426
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,460
But we're not.

427
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,000
Actually, we're going to have a wake.

428
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,140
By the time you hear this, the wake will have already happened.

429
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,680
Yes, a wake.

430
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,060
Hear that?

431
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,180
A wake.

432
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,980
A wake.

433
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,240
A wake.

434
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,640
A wake.

435
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,080
A wake.

436
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,740
A wake.

437
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,000
A wake.

438
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,740
Yeah, we're going to summon them.

439
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,180
We're going to summon them up.

440
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,720
We're going to get you, man.

441
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,380
You think that Gwar stuff is scary.

442
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,020
You think that Bob stuff is scary.

443
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,100
You think a hundred legions of dead legume skeletons

444
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,320
all eight feet tall and smelling to high heaven is bad.

445
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,400
You don't know what bad is.

446
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,920
You don't know what bad is.

447
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,660
Well, you think the shit...

448
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,240
The show is bad.

449
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,700
Fine.

450
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,920
Fine.

451
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,360
This show has an off button, my friend.

452
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,980
There are things in this world, in this universe,

453
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,080
that have no off button.

454
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,940
And I hope you...

455
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,700
I wish you the best of luck finding it

456
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,260
when you find yourself in that show.

457
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,320
Yes, that show that will not die.

458
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,360
And they just about killed this show.

459
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,780
I just about killed this show.

460
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,640
From getting so dang distracted.

461
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,900
They've been hammering on me.

462
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,480
But...

463
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,020
And I really do have to whip a bunch of material out

464
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,660
in the next couple hours.

465
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,780
Because then I've got to leave.

466
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,660
Actually, I've got to leave right now.

467
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,260
Pick up my daughter.

468
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,420
Well, luckily, while I was being hammered on the last trip,

469
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,640
we recorded quite a bit of material

470
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,180
at Susie the Floozy and Dr. Nolan Void's

471
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,660
Bob Slack Talk.

472
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,180
And I'm going to be doing a full-time fun house radio show

473
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,780
in Atlanta, in this case,

474
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,600
with, yes, Dr. Legume,

475
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,880
but mostly Jane or Hyperclete

476
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,000
and Father Joe Mama.

477
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,780
We've got that radio stuff coming up.

478
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,360
And also, I sat in on a nice, long

479
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,240
Einstein Secret Orchestra radio syndrome

480
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,860
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz.

481
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,220
And because of that,

482
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,420
I hopefully can just whip out

483
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,700
a whole bunch of old tapes.

484
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,180
Thank you.

485
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,320
Hey, wait a minute.

486
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,880
You guys, listen.

487
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,540
Lanson has said he's creature.

488
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:12,900
Oh.

489
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,600
Oh, my goodness.

490
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,220
Just like the old man in the show.

491
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,360
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

492
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,940
That's the old man in the mountain.

493
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,040
Too bad the listeners can't see

494
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,820
some of the more adult portions of tonight's show.

495
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,040
Yes, I was just trading my pet

496
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,460
brine shrimp sea monkeys this morning

497
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,980
to go leaping through hoops.

498
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,700
They keep me very happy.

499
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,980
Why, life was so plain

500
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,540
without my brine shrimp sea monkeys,

501
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,300
who love me.

502
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,120
They love to be watched.

503
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,120
I like to watch them with my x-ray specs.

504
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,620
They can be traded many stunts.

505
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,080
Mine know several different positions.

506
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,880
I do brine shrimp sea monkey porno movies.

507
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,800
I have several very good brine shrimp actors.

508
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,780
They look just like the ones in the comic books.

509
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,100
They have little human faces,

510
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,340
and they just walk along.

511
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,040
I have a brine shrimp sea monkey

512
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,220
that looks just like Seika.

513
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,200
I have a dad and a mom sea monkey

514
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,320
and a little boy sea monkey.

515
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,300
I feel kind of guilty because one of my friends,

516
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,020
my star porno brine shrimp,

517
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,840
was actually under 18 years of age.

518
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,960
That's the Tracy Lord's brine shrimp sea monkey.

519
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,300
So all the porno films that we did

520
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,540
featuring that brine shrimp sea monkey are illegal.

521
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,080
They must be destroyed.

522
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,040
Not just taken out of distribution,

523
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,780
but destroyed.

524
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,580
Well, they were destroyed,

525
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,620
but only because I...

526
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,680
All the relatives of that brine shrimp.

527
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,860
That's because the maid came in

528
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,140
and didn't know that they were my brine shrimp sea monkeys.

529
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,700
Oh, you're referring to the films.

530
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,000
No, all of the brine shrimp sea monkeys.

531
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,180
All who are related to the Tracy Lord's...

532
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,060
Well, they were destroyed,

533
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,700
but fortunately a new batch has been hatched.

534
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,120
The public must be protected.

535
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,560
Thank you, Pappy.

536
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,800
You know, it sounds like Reverend Legume

537
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,340
is still inhaling that church air

538
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,680
that we hear so much about.

539
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,540
The public must be protected from this filth.

540
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,560
This is destroying our great country.

541
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,760
This is going to drive America

542
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,240
into a sea of fetid bodily fluids.

543
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,500
I'm going to sue...

544
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,000
Whoa!

545
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,320
Whoa!

546
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:08,540
Whoa!

547
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:08,920
Whoa!

548
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,240
Whoa!

549
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


550
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


551
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


552
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


553
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


554
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


555
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


556
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


557
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


558
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


559
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


560
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


561
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


562
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


563
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


564
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


565
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,260


566
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,220
I'm going to sue Honor House.

567
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,980
...pervert subgeniuses.

568
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,560
Praise the fetidness.

569
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,540
I'm suing Honor House for the cancer of the eyes

570
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,160
from using the x-ray sunglasses too much

571
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,640
and getting the cardiacs and cataracts

572
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,260
and cadillacs on my eyeballs.

573
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,100
I know it's related.

574
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,300
...insane being able to see other people's thoughts.

575
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,500
Just close your eyes and it'll be okay.

576
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,420
I went to shake the hand of the president

577
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,600
and realized that he was a mass murderer.

578
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,620
I had to kill him for the good of the public.

579
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,800
It looks like the thought has been thrown down the stairs.

580
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,680
There are cuts and bruises all over her face.

581
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,200
It looks like there are cigarette burns

582
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,600
on her breasts and near her thighs.

583
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,400
It's a good thing I came along to help her.

584
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,800
I think you are laboring under misapprehension.

585
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,220
You sick bastard.

586
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,680
Do you have the letters of transit?

587
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm searching her...

588
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,400
You poor delinquent.

589
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,260
...soul.

590
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,640
I'm seeking a certain blackbird.

591
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,440
I represent a certain moneyed interest

592
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,120
who would be very...

593
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,780
...is very interested in obtaining the blackbird.

594
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,040
How many people could have been helped

595
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,400
if you had only used your maniacal, sinister brilliance for good?

596
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,720
If only they had allowed me to finish my experiments in peace.

597
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,080
But they had to know what their prying minds...

598
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,380
They had to know just who I am.

599
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,660
And what I am.

600
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,860
Well, I'll show them.

601
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,620
I'll show them all.

602
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,000
They laughed at my face.

603
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,480
They did not realize that the information that I was ascertaining was actually worth

604
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,680
the forfeiture of few human lives.

605
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,360
But one is always considered to be mad when one is perfect at something that others cannot

606
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:51,360


607
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:51,540
Quip them.

608
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,300
Quip them.

609
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,720
To make them understand.

610
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,180
We must burn the intolerance out of them.

611
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,240
With them good.

612
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,040
One is always considered to be mad when one is perfect at something that others cannot

613
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,420
understand.

614
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,460
Fela Lugosi brought it from Montemarie, produced and written by Ed Wood Jr.

615
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,380
But they have to understand that the blackbird is a monster.

616
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,380


617
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,380


618
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,380


619
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,380


620
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,040
They laughed at me.

621
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:09,840
No.

622
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,560
Nice.

623
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,400
Nice.

624
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,180
Janeer.

625
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,740
Does it hurt?

626
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,620
Yes.

627
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,780
But not enough to kill.

628
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,560
Like Bob said, it is better to...

629
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,820
They laughed at my face.

630
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,780
But then I...

631
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,000
Thank you.

632
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,260
Thank you.

633
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,720
That is why I got this...

634
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,020
Thank you, Susie.

635
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,480
That is why I got this lead mask.

636
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,840
200 pound mask to hide my face from the world.

637
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,320
But they...

638
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,000
They laughed at my mask.

639
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,460
I had to...

640
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,480
They laughed at my mask.

641
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,460
The horrifying new film.

642
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,460
The spine tingling horror of They Laughed at My Mask.

643
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,280
With brilliant acting directing by Ed Wood Jr.

644
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,280
The Mask of Sanity.

645
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,380
Starring Criswell.

646
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:03,220
I predict in the year 1993 that human beings will be cannibals and half of the race will

647
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,020
eat the other half.

648
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,320
I predict in the year 1994 that humanity will be overpopulated.

649
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,980
It will drive itself into the sea.

650
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:16,520
I predict in the year 1995 that all of humanity will leave this planet on flying trotters.

651
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,040
I predict in the year 1996 that humanity will go back to its primitive ways and reenter

652
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,640
the caves.

653
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,860
I predict that in the year 1997 Dragon Con will force people to dress like Vulcans and

654
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,980
Romulans and that they will be invaded by sinister outside forces which will think they are beyond

655
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,100
their technological means because they will see that they have been infiltrated previously

656
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,560
by Vulcans and Romulans.

657
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,960
All your stupid, stupid minds.

658
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:52,100
I predict that in the year 1998 the men from Planet X will come down to rupture up the subgeniuses

659
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,520
and destroy the predicable boys forever.

660
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,640
But why do you want to contact the leaders of Earth?

661
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:07,080
Because of death, for extermination, you must make the decision to join the army.

662
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:14,020
All subgeniuses please report that it was more important to equip the white men than

663
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,320
the...

664
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,000
It would please me to see the slave girl and her tortures.

665
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,880
Torture, torture, it pleasures me.

666
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:29,240
Yes, we once laughed at the horseless carriage, the airplane, radio, television, and even vitamins.

667
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,480
Now today some people laugh at outer space.

668
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,320
My friends, can you prove it didn't happen?

669
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,780
Can you?

670
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:45,820
We challenge each and every listener within our listening range now to prove that it didn't happen.

671
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,240
It can't happen here.

672
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,880
It can't happen here.

673
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,060
Just go get a TV dinner and cook it up.

674
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,960
Cook it up.

675
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,600
No, and it won't happen here.

676
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,140
No, no, no, no, no.

677
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,660
And Bob said half of nothing is better than nothing at all.

678
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,260
And he was right.

679
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,980
And on the third day Bob said, slack.

680
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,080
It can be sold, but it cannot be bought.

681
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,440
Here's another Criswell rant.

682
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,160
Monsters to be pitied.

683
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,000
Monsters to be despised.

684
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,800
What's human?

685
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,600
Well, I can't put it all together.

686
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,420
What's human?

687
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,540
Now monster, they live in the twilight period.

688
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,900
Monsters to be pitied.

689
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,400
Monsters to be despised.

690
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,040
A night with the ghouls.

691
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,400
What is it?

692
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:44,940
Come here.

693
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,240
I'm coming, Aladdin.

694
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,160
I've got two of these.

695
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,620
I've got two of these.

696
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,120
One is yours.

697
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,800
You got one for me?

698
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,840
No, I got one for you.

699
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,140
Did you get the Bob GT train with the Gwanda Dark Eyes from the Raven's tank?

700
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,460
No?

701
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,000
This is an invisible space maker time.

702
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,360
Morph V coffee maker.

703
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,580
or dual massage vibrator with 75 attachments and all kinds of things that you don't know.

704
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,380
Oh, nanotech, it's for time control. The nanoseconds go backwards?

705
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,480
No!

706
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,900
No, forget it, man. You don't want this.

707
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,180
No, you don't want this.

708
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,180
No, I took my words on mail, command.

709
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,180
I'm bleeding!

710
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,860
I took a picture of the voodoo place and now I'm bleeding.

711
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,020
I smell sausage.

712
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,940
I smell Bob.

713
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,160
The rich fragrance of Bob Dove.

714
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,440
Merring Dove.

715
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,380
I think I've got you.

716
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,040
Brad!

717
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,320
Brad!

718
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,500
Paper!

719
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,900
What happens when you stay?

720
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,520
I'm asking boys in my head.

721
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,340
So many miles it takes.

722
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,260
What happens when we perish and pass on?

723
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,660
Do we go to Sogina's Hell?

724
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,120
Or do we go to Pink Heaven?

725
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,840
You go to Echo Hell.

726
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,860
Where everything sounds like you're on drugs.

727
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,380
Drugs.

728
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,720
Drugs.

729
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:34,840
Does the soul go on and on and on like a broken record?

730
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,220
And on and on and on.

731
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,880
Eternity is a big place, Brad.

732
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,700
You might as well get used to it.

733
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,560
Been lost in eternity?

734
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,440
And then once you die you're more lost-er?

735
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,460
Well, you already have been lost in eternity for a long time, Dave.

736
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,920
Well, why am I lost in eternity?

737
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,120
I'm lost in this flabby body of all them dog-wee-fees.

738
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,280
Well, that's the way it goes.

739
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
I wish you would stop going.

740
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,820
You start going backwards.

741
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,620
Well, you can spit in one hand and wish in the other and see which one gets full first.

742
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:19,240
But what about my short-term personal savior Bob Dove?

743
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,880
Bob won't help you now.

744
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,380
It's too late, Dave.

745
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,360
You backslid.

746
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,180
You showed a lack of faith for half a second.

747
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,060
Not just one second.

748
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,500
No, no, no.

749
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,200
Play the tapes.

750
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:47,680
Show Dave what he did over and over and over and over and over again and again and again.

751
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,900
Uh, gee, Bob, Tom's, uh, disappointed because he's been denied.

752
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,340
World saving isn't exactly, uh, a holy-gallon experience.

753
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,220
But Jesse's death was sales.

754
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,660
Or something.

755
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,540
I dreamed I was a suffragette queen one time.

756
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,380
One time.

757
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,960
Another time I dreamed of the green demons from the shadows.

758
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,160
Another time.

759
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,920
And then I dreamed I dreamed which never must be said more than once.

760
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,780
And time again.

761
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,240
Hey.

762
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:27,900
Hey.

763
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:27,900


764
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,160
I'm gonna, uh, spell the fun guy or something.

765
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,560
I still get used to it.

766
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,200
Don't talk about the fungus.

767
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,920
Don't talk about the fungus.

768
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,820
Don't talk about the fungus.

769
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,020
It will find you.

770
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,420
It will find you.

771
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,160
If you think about it, it will find you and seek you out.

772
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,400
You mean just simple, in-deterior knowledge of the fungus causes it to grow on you?

773
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,320
Well, then we're all cooked in hell anyway.

774
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,300
Is it me, or does it sound kind of weird in this radio station?

775
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,820
It's the demons, you see.

776
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,940
It's the demons

777
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,360
It first appeared as a nauseous...

778
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,540
...shape of the consequence.

779
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,480
Then three days later, men with Gulf War masks came and degauched the entire building.

780
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,460
It was about that time that Kaz...

781
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:27,880
...ירчт-

782
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:27,880


783
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:27,880


784
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:27,880


785
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:27,880


786
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:27,880


787
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:27,880


788
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,740
disappears. Sucked right

789
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,820
into his own head and bones.

790
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,040
When the demons come,

791
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,520
listen.

792
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,980
You do as they say.

793
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,100
You don't.

794
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,940
You do as they say.

795
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,600
Do as the demons

796
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,760
say. What choice

797
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,720
do you have? You did

798
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,260
sign the application.

799
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
You've been

800
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,580
standing in line all

801
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,920
this eternity. This is what you've been

802
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,180
waiting for, Dave.

803
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,740
Aren't you going to do what

804
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,180
the demon voices

805
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,640
tell you?

806
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,700
It's for your own

807
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,100
good, Dave.

808
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,860
It won't hurt them.

809
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,020
They won't know what

810
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,640
hit them.

811
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,940
Just do what Bob

812
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,060
told you to do.

813
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,140
You remember.

814
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,400
I think he's more than

815
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,480
ever now. Could Bob be one

816
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,480
of them demons? Of course

817
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,020
Bob would have been

818
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,460
demons. What do you think

819
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,280
this is all about from the beginning?

820
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,500
Oh, you thought you were going to get

821
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,260
something for nothing,

822
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:43,860
eh?

823
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,640
It's like a booning ritual.

824
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,400
You didn't think you were going to get all those

825
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,320
pills for free.

826
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,260
You basically stated

827
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,220
clearly in the contract which I don't sign

828
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,100
in blood that all of Bob's

829
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,080
pills would go into me absolutely

830
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,340
free to do as I will

831
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,360
on Foolberry Hill

832
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,180
if I don't want to kill

833
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,380
him.

834
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,580
Take another pill, Dave,

835
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,880
and do what the demons

836
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,940
tell you.

837
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,600
Don't worry. They're all

838
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,900
working for Bob. We're all

839
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,980
working for

840
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,240
Bob.

841
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,700
And you look

842
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,380
for Bob. Here, have another

843
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,540
frock stick, Dave, and just

844
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,640
don't worry about it.

845
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,620
You don't have to make

846
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,560
decisions anymore. That's the

847
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,300
whole point, isn't it?

848
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,600
Isn't that the whole point of joining

849
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,340
Bob's church?

850
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,880
No longer having to

851
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,300
make those painful

852
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,560
decisions. No more

853
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,720
responsibility.

854
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,660
That's what I'm doing.

855
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,320
No more choices.

856
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,560
No more responsibilities.

857
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,640
This is the life I've been

858
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,600
dreaming of for a long time.

859
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,880
You wanted slack, didn't

860
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,420
you, Dave?

861
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,160
Sweet, sweet, sweet

862
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,580
slack.

863
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,700
And you've got slack forever

864
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,960
and ever and ever

865
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,360
as long as you do

866
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,660
what we tell you.

867
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,680
We're not going to tell you what

868
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,680
to do. We're only going to

869
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,720
tell you what to think.

870
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,680
I don't know what's so good about you.

871
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,100
I don't think it's a good idea about that.

872
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,520
I don't think about what I bring to begin

873
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:28,960
with.

874
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,600
No, just think

875
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,320
good thoughts, Dave.

876
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,600
Okay. I'm in a beautiful

877
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,140
field of flowers right now.

878
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,160
The sun is shining, but

879
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,740
it ain't too hot.

880
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,580
Yeah. And I'm putting

881
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,720
my feet in a cool spring of water.

882
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,700
And I'm just going to lay there

883
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,720
and piddle in my pants and stare at the clouds

884
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,340
going by.

885
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,260
Ah, that

886
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,960
slack.

887
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,980
Isn't it, Dave? Yeah.

888
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,580
And that can all be yours as

889
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,380
soon as you finish

890
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,800
your assignment.

891
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,800
I gotta

892
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,220
remember, yeah, I gotta remember

893
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,640
I like

894
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,400
slack. Oh, yes.

895
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,620
You don't need to worry about the details

896
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,760
of the assignment. You don't have to

897
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,500
worry about any of that dirty work.

898
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,380
We'll take care of most of that.

899
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,060
I was doing something there.

900
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,580
You'll know what to do

901
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,460
as soon as you hear the trigger.

902
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,200
Trigger phrase.

903
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,540
Trigger phrase?

904
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,820
Lick my boots.

905
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,720
Lick my boots.

906
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,840
Now you know what to do.

907
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,620
Lick my boots.

908
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,240
Lick my boots.

909
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,400
Lick my boots.

910
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,960
Lick my boots.

911
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,440
Hey, you know,

912
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,640
I got a strange sensational urge

913
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,740
for a hamburger. It may be

914
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,880
surprise and don't urge.

915
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,840
It's never forgetting

916
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,980
someday, kid.

917
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,320
My mind is gone.

918
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,520
Did you say you wanted a hang-a-burger?

919
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,360
Oh, here's your hang-a-burger.

920
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,460
Oh, precious.

921
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,440
You did a wonderful job

922
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,780
on your assignment, Dave.

923
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,860
Oh, that's right. You probably don't remember

924
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,960
doing it. You probably only remember

925
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,300
lying by that stream,

926
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,780
wetting yourself and looking at clouds

927
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,320
and so forth. Slack.

928
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,060
Well, rest assured, you did a very good

929
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,520
job.

930
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,140
You did a very good job on that

931
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,100
government building while

932
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,480
you were out, so to speak.

933
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,020
I wonder why I got this

934
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,720
receipt for first.

935
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,680
Why is it in my pocket?

936
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,700
Just get in here.

937
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,720
My socks smell like a morning soul flame.

938
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,580
Well, don't worry about that. You've earned your reward.

939
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,960
I'm in deserving for something

940
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,940
for sure now. I know I done good

941
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,980
because the real voice is telling me.

942
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,740
You can always

943
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,080
trust the voices.

944
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,540
Especially the ones with

945
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,460
a little echo.

946
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,660
Turned up on them.

947
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,280
They're much more impressive that way,

948
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,900
don't you think?

949
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,960
Translator turned around here.

950
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,180
See if I can figure out a way of

951
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,920
creating some new tunes.

952
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,580
Shona, she left.

953
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,360
Shona, she left me one day.

954
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,080
But I need Slack.

955
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,000
I need Slack more than I need to say.

956
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,660
Slack.

957
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,180
Slack.

958
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,720
Slack.

959
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,060
Slack.

960
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,600
Oh, baby, I need Slack.

961
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,800
Slack.

962
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,240
Slack.

963
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,360
Oh, baby,

964
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,060
Bob gives Slack.

965
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,040
Slack.

966
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,200
Ha!

967
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,300
Bob gives good Slack jobs.

968
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,720
For a good time, call Bob Dove.

969
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,880
5-9-3-6-7-0-2.

970
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,280
It's written on every urinal wall.

971
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,980
I need Slack.

972
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,820
I need Slack.

973
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,680
It's written in a darn old tenement hall.

974
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,580
I need Slack.

975
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,440
Give me some Slack, baby.

976
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:14,080
The words of the prophet are written on the tenement walls

977
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,460
in urine.

978
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,240
Slack.

979
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:19,600
Slack.

980
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,600
Slack.

981
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,120
Slack.

982
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,900
Slack.

983
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,860
Oh, I'm working in the city, Bob!

984
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,060
So, you got any, any bitch, like, maybe.

985
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,260
Slack.

986
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,360
Slack.

987
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:34,360


988
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,060
You like me?

989
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:36,780
Slack.

990
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,160
What?

991
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,340
What do I do?

992
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:38,780
Slack.

993
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,300
You know, there just ain't enough Slack in this world.

994
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,200
Hey, Bob!

995
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,480
Hi.

996
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,320
Slack.

997
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,760
Slack.

998
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:46,720
Slack.

999
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:47,840
Slack.

1000
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:52,780
You know, the problem is we pay the conspiracy to take our money away.

1001
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,640
I mean, that's basically what we do.

1002
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,720
do? We pay them to take our money away, friends. That's their job. It's what they're there for.

1003
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,980
That's what Onan said. We pay them to take our money away. They take our money away,

1004
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:12,300
and not only do we pay them, we pay them at 20% interest and are happy to do it.

1005
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,840
What has this country come to?

1006
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:29,760
And that slack is available here in Cleveland, August 5th, Saturday night at Peabody's Down

1007
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:37,420
Under. An amazing, incredible subgenius revival. Yes, a subgenius beach party right on the

1008
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:44,820
edge of the hideous Cuyahoga River, as it once again bursts into fervor.

1009
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:52,740
The river, the mayor's hair, the stage, the preachers, and the bleeding head of Arnold

1010
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:59,480
Palmer, all bursting into flame. Before your very eyes, you won't believe what you see,

1011
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:06,960
dear friends. You will, your money back if you don't throw up when you see the man sewing

1012
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,960
his lips shut with piano wire.

1013
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,720
You really actually will see a man.

1014
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:20,880
And sew his lips shut with piano wire Saturday night at the subgenius diva.

1015
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:29,620
I'm not going to sew my lips together with piano wire. Bob handled that quite well with

1016
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,380
the fungus.

1017
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,940
You boot-licking, coke-flavid, demon boy.

1018
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:42,820
But those fine lads, those Boy Scouts from Circus Apocalypse, will sew their lips shut

1019
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,680
with piano wire for your edification.

1020
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:51,600
And entertainment. You won't believe your eyes. You'll crawl on your belly like a reptile.

1021
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:59,320
Step right up. Free slack right here. Only a dollar. Free slack. Only one dollar.

1022
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:07,140
From Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1023
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:12,220
Or free at Peabody's Down Under.

1024
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,300
Slack.

1025
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,680
August 5th.

1026
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,980
Well, not free.

1027
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:16,880
Slack.

1028
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,760
Slack.

1029
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:19,680
Free pills?

1030
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,620
Sure, pills are free.

1031
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,840
Slack.

1032
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,640
Slack.

1033
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,900
The slack is free.

1034
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:26,600
Slack.

1035
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,740
The only thing you'll have to pay for is to know what you really think.

1036
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,460
Slack.

1037
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,380
Slack.

1038
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,180
And then...

1039
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,560
It's like a comet.

1040
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,500
It sounds like a star.

1041
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,820
I said my children and dogs sound really good.

1042
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,060
And I hope they never come back.

1043
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,340
You gotta slow down.

1044
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,380
You're moving too fast.

1045
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,180
You gotta make the morning last.

1046
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,800
Just kick around the cobblestone.

1047
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,060
Look for fun and feel it moving.

1048
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,980
Look at my bob.

1049
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,380
My special bob keychain.

1050
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,620
And my wallet ring.

1051
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,100
And my hand in my first year.

1052
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,220
Fetching my first year pocketbook.

1053
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,000
And I have one of them decals.

1054
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,100
And I put it in my guitar case.

1055
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,500
With a smiley face.

1056
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,560
And I also have my little booties.

1057
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,600
With the turned up toes.

1058
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,700
With the little bells on them.

1059
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,980
Much like Bob's smoking slippers.

1060
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,920
When he does smoke.

1061
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,520
And my little smoking jacket.

1062
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,860
That looks so much like Bob's smoking jacket.

1063
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,800
And he's also a trade partner.

1064
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,300
Corporate by the church of the subdues.

1065
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,580
Oh just tripping down the cobblestone.

1066
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,860
I'm not slacking off.

1067
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,100
I'm feeling groovy.

1068
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,520
Feeling groovy.

1069
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,520
Cause I got my slack.

1070
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,460
I got a nigga urinating in my pants.

1071
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,840
And fumbling and faking.

1072
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,480
And crying in class.

1073
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,480
I got unfelting groovy.

1074
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,340
Unfeeling groovy.

1075
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,260
Got no decent dude.

1076
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,140
No promises to keep.

1077
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,040
I'm dappled and drowsy and slack.

1078
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,860
I'm asleep where the morning sun drops.

1079
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,760
Balls pedal on eight.

1080
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,920
The wife I love you always groovy.

1081
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,060
I'm always groovy.

1082
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,040
Bang.

1083
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,440
Oh, it's groovy, baby.

1084
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,860
Oh, baby.

1085
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,560
You look so groovy to me, baby.

1086
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,060
I'm grooving out on it.

1087
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,680
Oh, I'm getting real groovy now.

1088
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,280
I'm grooving.

1089
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:00,600
This is my happening, and it's freaking me out.

1090
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,040
And it's in a groove, baby.

1091
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,440
Baby, can you groove to this?

1092
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,220
Yeah.

1093
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,680
I'm dropping a groove go on this logo band.

1094
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,460
And the audio is groovy.

1095
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,320
Feeling groovy.

1096
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,420
OK, now I'm going to ride this thing.

1097
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,040
Feeling groovy.

1098
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,500
Feeling groovy.

1099
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:39,640
Feeling groovy.

1100
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,660
Feeling groovy.

1120
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:08,200
that was uh taped off of wcsb cleveland on thursday night at 9 a.m which is when you hear

1121
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,660
the lonesome cowboy

1122
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:18,000
boy dave and chas and einstein secret orchestra live just about my very favorite radio show

1123
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,200
i i'm i really must say and you know i was listening back at bat and thinking to myself

1124
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:30,840
you know now that i recall the whole reason that i called steve bevilacqua up and said

1125
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,640
hey let's do another show in cleveland do you think we could you know make enough to

1126
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,420
pay for the plane ticket what prompted me to do that was i was just i had a big hankering

1127
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,660
to do more recordings as you know and when you know on youtube and you know i misjudged

1128
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:40,660


1129
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,800
with Dave and Chaz and the band,

1130
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,940
the Secret Orchestra of Einstein,

1131
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,320
because somehow it always works.

1132
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,960
We don't even have to write a script,

1133
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,440
and yet we descend into a veritable tormenting hell,

1134
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,740
an audio hell.

1135
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,860
And I don't know about you,

1136
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:04,140
but I just kind of dig doing that, you know?

1137
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,560
Yep.

1138
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,280
So, friends, you know,

1139
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,140
that's it.

1140
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,120
Just before that on side one,

1141
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,700
we were hearing some WREK recordings

1142
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,240
at the weekend at yours truly

1143
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,860
and Dr. Legume, the still-living Dr. Legume,

1144
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,980
the Papa Joe Mama,

1145
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:26,060
and the St. Jane or Hyperclades,

1146
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,680
and Reverend Microphone,

1147
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,860
and all those people were all in the studio at once

1148
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,540
at WREK on Bob's Slight Time Funhouse.

1149
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,680
And, of course, for more information

1150
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,260
on the Church of the Subgenius,

1151
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,880
from whence these terrible

1152
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,880
and yet oh-so-homespun and lovely,

1153
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,320
like an old sunset over West Texas,

1154
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,520
a real old sunset,

1155
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,020
you can get all that stuff from,

1156
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,140
you got that pencil-ready, friends?

1157
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,480
From J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1158
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,960
But just address that to Bob.

1159
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,680
You ought to be able to handle that.

1160
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,060
At Post Office Box,

1161
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,640
just at P.O. Box.

1162
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,980
See, so far, we've got a pattern set up.

1163
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:06,840
B.O.B.

1164
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,580
P.O.B.

1165
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:14,140
P.O. Box 140306.

1166
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,760
140306 that number is.

1167
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:18,900
Six numbers.

1168
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,400
In Dallas, there's six more.

1169
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:23,720
Texas.

1170
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,200
Oh, whew, I thought we were about to have 666.

1171
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:28,960
75214.

1172
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,300
Another five for you Discordians out there.

1173
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,880
You see, we're up on the numerology

1174
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,260
of the 23s and the 5s and all that stuff.

1175
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,040
All that corny stuff.

1176
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,100
You know, well, actually, it's not that corny

1177
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,860
when you run into somebody who really is afflicted

1178
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,720
with the 23s.

1179
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,120
But what's truly rare are the 273s.

1180
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,320
Yes, 273.

1181
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,620
The holy, sacred number of the Church of the Subgenius,

1182
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,300
far less likely to come up than 23.

1183
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,840
And yet, when it does, boy, is it a doozy.

1184
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,840
Last time, it was how much the Subgenius Foundation

1185
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,320
had to pay the government,

1186
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,040
and it was how much Reverend Ivan Stang got back.

1187
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:09,660
From the government, in his personal taxes.

1188
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,760
That's Bob at Box 14306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1189
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:20,000
Email address is i.stang at metronet.com.

1190
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,080
And for those of you with tape recorders,

1191
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,640
the really happening Subgenius place to go

1192
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,780
is alt.slack, News Group, or the World Wide Web,

1193
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,940
http://sunsight.unk.edu.

1194
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:35,960


1195
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,780
Subgenius, thank you.

1196
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,860
Let's go back just a minute now

1197
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,720
to hear some more of the jolly shenanigans

1198
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,060
and wacky whacking of St. Jane or Hyperclades

1199
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,200
and Father Joe Mama on Susie's show.

1200
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,760
And Leguim was there too, but it was mostly those guys.

1201
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:57,780
And, oh man, I love those nights.

1202
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,700
You know, it's worth it doing the flying,

1203
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,560
doing all the packing of goods to sell,

1204
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,700
all the panicky last-minute stuff,

1205
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,060
which I...

1206
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,460
Just like I am right now.

1207
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,840
And going to...

1208
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,680
And working all through the revival,

1209
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,120
setting it up, schmoozing,

1210
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,700
talking yourself hoarse,

1211
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,180
being polite to total strangers,

1212
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,520
and screaming and yelling at them.

1213
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,300
You know, that's what they pay you for.

1214
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,640
And then...

1215
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,620
And that's a lot of work.

1216
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,360
It really is.

1217
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:30,180
But it's worth it when you get to cooking

1218
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,200
there at the radio station

1219
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,680
with a fine mixing music master,

1220
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,460
like Chaz, and a spouting buddy,

1221
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,560
like Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1222
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,500
Somebody you can really torture.

1223
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:48,460
And the most wonderful backup musicians,

1224
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,980
sound effects crews, and laughers,

1225
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,940
and princesses, and, you know, it's just...

1226
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,720
That guitar player, man, he's really good.

1227
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,560
I can't remember his name.

1228
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,860
Anyway, friends, thank y'all.

1229
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,940
He's running out of dicketeen, Fred.

1230
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,220
Here on WREK, you heard it here first,

1231
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,940
the beginning of the end for Jaina Hyperclete,

1232
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,120
the man who lives in a perpetual

1233
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,840
stasis of nervous breakdowns.

1234
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,840
It is only through this means that we can bring you

1235
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,960
unabridged and unadulterated Jaina Hyperclete,

1236
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,940
here on WREK.

1237
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,060
I've only had one nervous breakdown.

1238
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,800
Only one? No, when I said one, I meant this week.

1239
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:31,260
Take your pills, Jaina.

1240
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,520
Jaina, take your pills.

1241
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,380
Jaina, swallow. Swallow.

1242
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:35,660
Good.

1243
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,360
Good Jaina.

1244
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,140
Check his mouth.

1245
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:37,900
Make sure he's taking them.

1246
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:39,940
Check under his tongue.

1247
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,260
Check in his ears.

1248
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah, we might have.

1249
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,060
We might have silenced him.

1250
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,040
It might be a subgenius.

1251
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,500
Silence?

1252
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,220
Silence?

1253
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,920
We're not gonna say anything else, okay?

1254
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,760
Let's just have silence.

1255
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:51,180
If anyone else said another thing, it could be the end of the universe.

1256
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,220
It could destroy the whole world.

1257
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,960
It's just silence, nothing but silence.

1258
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,440
It's a subgenius silence period.

1259
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,860
It's the period that is the most worrisome,

1260
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:01,140
because when they are silent, they are doing mischief.

1261
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,940
Okay, let's have the silence now.

1262
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,620
Okay, are we ready?

1263
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,940
Is it time for the silence?

1264
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,240
Is this the silence?

1265
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,800
Wait, can you hear me over the silence?

1266
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,960
I just want to check, make sure you're having it now,

1267
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,100
so I make sure not to disturb it.

1268
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,380
I didn't want to interrupt the silence.

1269
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,020
Is everything okay in there?

1270
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:21,580
Here.

1271
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,380
Here.

1272
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,340
Here's the speeding of this speediest car.

1273
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,320
That's why it's a subgenius silence, you know,

1274
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,840
because everyone just starts screaming as loud as they can,

1275
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,700
because it's a subgenius silence.

1276
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,620
It's kind of paradoxical, I guess, because they can call it a silence,

1277
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,320
but this one guy was sounding like a redneck,

1278
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,240
and he just kept talking on and on louder and louder.

1279
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,300
It's, you know, like a silence, subgenius silence.

1280
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:44,500
Silence.

1281
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,140
It's a silence approved by Dobbs.

1282
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,680
It's a subgenius silence.

1283
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,360
Dobbs approved.

1284
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,140
Dobbs approved.

1285
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,240
Dobbs approved.

1286
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,140
Silence.

1287
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,100
It would be idiotic if he just kept repeating the word silence

1288
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,900
while all the time speaking, even speaking the very word silence,

1289
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,680
was breaking what he was, was shattering the context.

1290
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,940
The concept that it was silence would create an ongoing paradox.

1291
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:06,800
Silence.

1292
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:12,120
We are all carrying our subgenius concealed weapons permits

1293
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:16,260
where our bleeding heads are loaded and ready for action.

1294
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,840
Now Palmer and...

1295
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,720
They are spitting forth the dreaded droplets of slack

1296
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:26,220
which only the official Palmer heads can eject like machine guns.

1297
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:32,200
They even have banana clips of these projectiles that you would certainly ears.

1298
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,940
They alternate from one nostril to another.

1299
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,900
If they took their head back in just such a way,

1300
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:41,420
they could be sent forth in the nasal cavity as well.

1301
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:44,860
Now Arnold Palmer and Lee Trevino, they are both golfers.

1302
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,640
Well, the federal government is trying to outlaw the rapid fire bleeding heads.

1303
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:53,340
They feel that these are improper, that they could only be used to kill.

1304
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,220
You cannot hunt with these.

1305
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,900
Now I think that's what's important about the whole thing,

1306
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:58,840
and I think I want the kids out in the audience to understand this too,

1307
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,140
that they are both golfers.

1308
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,780
And Arnold Palmer is a golfer.

1309
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,440
Well, see, Arnold Palmer was the good golfer,

1310
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,700
whereas Lee Trevino is more like the Tonya Harding golfer.

1311
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:14,580
But it's all just a plot to distract you from the one true liver of Mickey Mantle.

1312
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,620
And it is working.

1313
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:21,280
Even while we stand here, we can watch the true liver of Mickey Mantle dissolve before our eyes.

1314
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,660
Could you go down and pick me up a couple Palmer heads?

1315
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,980
You know, I can't understand that.

1316
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,880
They say that this liver was destroyed by alcohol,

1317
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,120
and yet they take it out.

1318
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,480
And they stick it in a jar of alcohol.

1319
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:36,460
Now that, that seems to me to just be a little messed up.

1320
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,920
I mean, what is this?

1321
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:41,940
It looks like, it looks like someone cut off your daughter's arms and legs.

1322
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,300
It is a good thing I came along to, to help her.

1323
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,860
I thought that maybe I would put them back and sew them together.

1324
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,040
I did, I was in such a hurry, I did not realize I had them mixed up.

1325
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,920
Now she's left-handed, where before she was right-footed.

1326
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,220
Your daughter seems to have a hard time dressing herself.

1327
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,100
It looks like her dress is pulled out.

1328
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:00,820
It's pulled over her head.

1329
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,320
If you can only get dresses that were made for males,

1330
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,400
she will get used to the fact that the zipper is now on the other side.

1331
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,600
You are laboring on a misapprehension again.

1332
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,060
That time has passed.

1333
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,100
There seems to, there seems to be a stain on her blouse.

1334
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,100
I, I've been trying to rub it off for the past 45 minutes.

1335
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,840
The blood will not leave my hands.

1336
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,680
I keep looking at my hands, but they bleed more.

1337
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:29,040
Perhaps it is the little razor blades that have been physically implanted in my hand.

1338
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,820
I was only trying to help.

1339
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,760
It's a very stubborn stain.

1340
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:37,380
I would like to remind you, however, that this state is protected by a good Samaritan law,

1341
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,940
which forbids you from being able to sue me for my malpractice.

1342
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:46,240
After all, my experiments were done solely to protect your young daughter.

1343
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,420
A nice, slimy vampire lawyer can prove this in court.

1344
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,440
It looks like someone walled your daughter, ripped your daughter into the wall.

1345
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,520
It's a good thing I came along.

1346
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,020
I discovered this.

1347
01:00:59,040 --> 01:00:59,340
The body.

1348
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,940
It is a good thing indeed.

1349
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,760
Why, why it looks like she was so hungry that she tried to consume herself.

1350
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:11,080
Why else would she have these bite marks all up and down her back?

1351
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,800
It looks almost as if she were clawing the bite.

1352
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:21,940
I think that she was trying to, to relieve herself of the itch from underneath her fingernails.

1353
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:28,240
Why else would she claw so madly at the brakes, which she could not possibly have removed from the mortar,

1354
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,640
which was surgically implanted on the outside with sledgehammers of my special design.
