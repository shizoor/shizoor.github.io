1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,500
This is Dr. Howell,

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,720
railing in the night for that which lived, which is dead,

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,000
and for that which is dead, was dead, and in fact was never alive.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,820
So we're moving.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,620
We get back to that.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,020
Thickering of the...

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,980
We'll just turn that down.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,460
We don't want any of that stuff happening here.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,460
In the swamp bongs the gongs of a throng of frogs,

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,300
while a knee-deep sheep bleats in a slippery stream

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,500
where slimy snakes whisper sinful secrets.

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,660
Let's go back to the knee-deep sheep dip, okay?

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,380
The knee-deep sheep dip dipped deep down below

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,800
the steep and chilly waters of the deep stream

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,900
floats on the surface

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,220
like the ancient Egyptians floated on the current of their belief,

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,140
for they thought they would never die,

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,340
but be reborn as gargling sarcophagi,

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,100
horrible mummies to march across the earth

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,240
and wreak and spew vengeance.

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,220
Give me the pyroflagellator.

22
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,560
All of the little tiny...

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:56,880
Yes.

24
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,560
...deities march down the side of the subgenius church

25
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,320
and now...

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,060
See it at last.

27
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,400
Within the great pyramid,

28
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,900
the secret chamber of the subgenius...

29
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:04,920
My God.

30
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,960
What light and steam come from the special effects department

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,260
located below the pyramid?

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,080
I hate Bob.

33
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,520
Bob made my daddy go crazy.

34
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,400
My daddy used to make money,

35
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,520
but now he just sits around all day.

36
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,900
I hate Bob.

37
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,960
He's a bad man.

38
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,160
I wish he would die.

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,540
He's part of the conspiracy.

40
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,620
I can't live this.

41
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,640
You've just been being...

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,380
Oh, I can't help myself.

43
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,380
My kids need black poop.

44
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,220
Eternal salvation

45
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,780
or triple your money back.

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,000
The Church of the Subgenius

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,320
bring you another 33 minutes

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,560
of condensed gargling function.

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,420
Over the quality audio-visual techniques

50
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,660
exacerbated and complicated

51
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,720

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,140
Oh, Dr. Sprit.

54
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,480
She said,

55
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,760
cutting her own legs off

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,840
in what was to be the foment

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,900
of a startling new trend

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,600
among the so-called...

59
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:26,860
...so-called...

in the course of this show,

64
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,320
the listener is advised

65
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,200
to remain calm

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,340

being inhaled during broadcast.

72
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,680
Small animals or other children

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,380
becoming exposed

74
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,560
to the ultra-high

75
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,340
or ultra-low shocks

76
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,060

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,020
throughout our program

79
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,980
should seek shelter

80
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,420
in an approved safety unit only.

81
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,000
This is Walter Teasdale

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,660
reminding you

83
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,860
that it's often a photon

84
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,660
that light releases,

85
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
but truth is,

86
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,740
not everyone gets the picture.

87
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,540
Hoping your time is all time

88
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,100
and all your unpervisable truths

89
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,820
are happy truths.

90
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,440
Happy truths.

91
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,360
Here is your host,

92
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,080
Reverend Ivan Stang here,

93
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,000
dear friends,

94
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,360
and let's sort out

95
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,700
all these little wellman heads

96
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,920
and cassettes and things

97
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,880
so that we know

98
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,180
what's up and what's about.

99
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,040
And friends,

100
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,700
it's about New Year's Eve.

101
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,260
Not when you hear this,

102
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,780
I'm sure.

103
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,400
But tonight,

104
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,680
as I record this show

105
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,620
in the offices here,

106
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,200
it is indeed

107
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,760
New Year's Eve.

108
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,740
And actually,

109
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,220
for us, friends,

110
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,220
it is not a new year,

111
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,200
but a last,

112
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,740
the last year.

113
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,000
Happy last year.

114
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,560
Happy, happy, happy last year.

115
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,620
All you good subgeniuses.

116
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,500
Actually, I guess for the,

117
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,920
those of us who are saved,

118
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,820
dues-paying subgenius ministers,

119
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,580
we will be lifted up

120
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,540
aboard the escape vessels

121
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,680
of the sex goddesses

122
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,820
on July 5th, 1998.

123
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,040
And everything will be cool.

124
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,920
But,

125
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,120
for the rest of you,

126
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,160
why I just,

127
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,040
I just don't know.

128
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,100
I don't know what to tell you.

129
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,500
Enjoy this January.

130
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,460
It'll be your last January.

131
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,240
Enjoy February.

132
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,140
Enjoy Easter.

133
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,880
This will be the last time

134
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,760
that funny little Easter bunny

135
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,360
comes hip-hop-hopping

136
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,740
down that bunny trail,

137
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:16,760
friends.

138
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,860
And the 4th of July,

139
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,580
you better enjoy

140
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,600
those nice, pretty fireworks

141
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,760
because there'll be

142
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,020
even prettier fireworks

143
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,180
fireworks.

144
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,940
So, mayhaps,

145
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,300
mayhaps, perhaps,

146
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,000
not,

147
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,600
yay, so nice.

148
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,280
Ehh, we'll see.

149
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:35,920
We don't know.

150
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,700
We just don't know.

151
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,640
But let's see what,

152
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,480
what we said the last time.

153
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,060
I, I can scarcely remember myself.

154
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,060
200 days, huh?

155
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,040
A form of confusion.

156
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,340
290 days.

157
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:47,980
200 days.

158
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,640
200 days from today.

159
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,280
200 more?

160
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:51,760
Mm.

161
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,500
That's all.

162
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,080
200 rock-solid days

163
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,140
of expectation and angst, nausea.

164
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,980
You just waiting for them

165
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,040
little babies to come down

166
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,020
and pull us out of here.

167
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,880
So there ain't really much

168
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,180
more to do, huh, Ivan?

169
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,420
We just sort of, you know,

170
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,740
we've, we've told all the jokes

171
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,560
we know to tell.

172
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,460
We've, you know.

173
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,300
Vestnary age.

174
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,060
Well, at this point, it's,

175
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,860
it's like if we, if we really

176
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,540
wanted to impress Bob,

177
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,900
we might, uh, try to take

178
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,700
over the world and, you know,

179
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,640
make the new world order

180
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,380
ourselves instead of letting

181
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,640
the pinks do it and so forth,

182
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,520
you know, but generally, as it,

183
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,240
as predicted in Book of the

184
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,200
Subgenius, we would go out and

185
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,200
recruit half of the globe and so

186
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,960
forth, but, you know, really,

187
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,520
with only 200 days left, I, I

188
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,840
don't see much point in

189
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,200
bothering with it.

190
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:40,900
It seems to be,

191
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Yeah, it's kind of, it's kind

192
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:41,920
of.

193
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,780
that at this point, we can

194
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,240
just sit back and wait for the

195
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,740
exes.

196
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,540
Right.

197
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,360
To get here and go ahead

198
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,480
and, oh, they're gonna do,

199
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,620
they're gonna do a better job

200
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,180
of it, of the genociding and,

201
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,940
and so forth that, that we could

202
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,440
ever do.

203
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:54,800
Right.

204
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,480
That's what we're

205
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,480


206
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,480


207
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,500
Well, that's what we're

208
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,680
gonna do.

209
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,420
The Church of the Subgenius.

210
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,560
Normals are our competitors,

211
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,520
only until they become our

212
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,680
customers.

213
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,040
All right.

214
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,440
This is my story.

215
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,820
It's sad and long, involving

216
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,400
Naugahyde, sawdust, six guns,

217
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,380
and whiskey, but I ain't got

218
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,240
time to tell it to you now.

219
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,420
Well, I was driving in my

220
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,220
pickup truck when I looked up

221
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,080
and saw some lights.

222
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,720
There were thousands of flying

223
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,440
saucers destroying everything

224
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,340
in sight.

225
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,200
And the next thing I knew, I

226
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,720
was barbecuing, screaming

227
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
wouldn't help at all.

228
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,100
I was gonna send $30 to Bob,

229
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,080
but I just didn't have the balls.

230
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,300
But now, X Day is here.

231
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,660
You're being lynched by a mob.

232
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,260
X Day is here.

233
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,860
Don't you wish you'd sent a

234
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,980
check to Bob?

235
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,060
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

236
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,260
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

237
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,400


238
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,400


239
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,400


240
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,400


241
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,120
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

242
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Ruby, has one of those

243
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,180
subscribers with that

244
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,240
nasty hair style.

245
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,420
I thought, is that baby

246
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:14,520
needy?

247
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:14,520


248
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,180
Hit 911, or

249
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,180


250
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,520
did your sidemiego go?

251
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:16,760
What did he come by

252
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:16,760


253
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:16,760


254
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:16,760


255
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:16,760


256
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:16,760


257
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:16,760


258
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,580
Louder, that's my man,

259
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,960
Louderly.

260
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,660
I had to go down to

261
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:22,660


262
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,180
the tune Allahu

263
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,360
Ku, they bring my

264
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,380
switch, I'll just

265
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,380


266
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,380


267
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,680
I thought they were pretty funny, but deep down I thought I was gonna have the last laugh because I wouldn't send Bob any money

268
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,320
But now they're off somewhere in those pleasure crafts

269
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:40,720
And I've been reduced to cosmic feces and it's much much too late to understand that they are the chosen species

270
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,760
Cuz X-Day is here, you're looking mighty glum

271
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:52,900
X-Day is here, don't you wish your daddy had more Yeti in his car

272
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

273
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,660
Oh, they hail from Lafayette, LA

274
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,460
they don't even hear this show

275
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,700
and yet they sent this tag Maybe they hear it on the internet or something

276
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,680
You can hear it anytime on the Internet

277
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,260
or on Sunday nights at 9 o'clock EST

278
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,080
on WC. s B dot or

279
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,220
WW WCSB

280
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,360
dot org.

281
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,400
And that's in audio active.

282
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,000
We have it on the sub site

283
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,620
in real audio.

284
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,540
Friends,

285
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:04,960
1998.

286
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,960
I can't believe it.

287
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,740
I can barely believe

288
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,140
that I lived to 1998.

289
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,020
I used to think of 1970

290
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,660
as the future.

291
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,240
Damn, yeah, back in the day.

292
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,660
Oh, by the way,

293
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,120
this music in the background is by

294
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,840
Seva.

295
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,660
The artist formerly known as Commander Dave,

296
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,920
now he's called Seva.

297
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,000
Oral surrealisms

298
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,520
in this CD

299
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,720
called Gravity Is My

300
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,340
Favorite Drug.

301
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,680
And it was sent to us

302
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,700
by Reverend Preacher in Knoxville,

303
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,660
Tennessee, but I don't know any real

304
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,180
details about it. So quality,

305
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,600
you have weird

306
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,520
freak out acid jazz background

307
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,140
music.

308
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,840
Dear friends, there's been,

309
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,020
these are the end times

310
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,560
and we're not the only cult,

311
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,680
so to, as they

312
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,920
say, we're a lot bigger than a cult

313
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,940
now, you know, friends.

314
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,920
There are a lot more

315
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,940
subgeniuses than there ever were

316
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,640
Branch Davidians or

317
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,940
members of the People's Temple.

318
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,080
How's that?

319
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,160
We got some records

320
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,120
to break. I understand that.

321
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,700
It ain't gonna be easy, but

322
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,740
well, it will be easy.

323
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,180
It'll be real easy come July 5th, 1998.

324
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,440
But there are others, friends, other cults

325
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,140
out there that, you know,

326
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,080
this millennialism is coming on

327
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,360
and I don't know about you,

328
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,440
but I've been boning up

329
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,060
on millennialism since,

330
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,760
well, for 20 years.

331
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,440
And now every time I open a magazine

332
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,620
or look at the newspaper, there's an article

333
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,440
about the turn of

334
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,640
the millennium.

335
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,620
Weird. End of the world cults.

336
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,640
How correct are their prophecies?

337
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,600
Will the Earth really be destroyed

338
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,700
by asteroids, tornadoes,

339
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,340
or giant Gila monsters?

340
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,560
On March 25th

341
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,660
of 1998,

342
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,560
God will appear on Channel

343
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,800
18 all over

344
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,620
the contiguous United

345
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,440
States. Every city,

346
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,620
no matter whether you have a Channel 18

347
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,240
or not, turn to Channel 18. It's called

348
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,460
Dead Series, by the way.

349
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,660
God will

350
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,420
appear and will announce

351
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,580
and as this man,

352
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,340
has already announced, that

353
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,440
God will come to Earth

354
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,480
in Dallas, Texas at

355
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,780
10 a.m.

356
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,000
March 31st.

357
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,720
God will appear and if he doesn't,

358
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,640
this preacher, this Chinese preacher

359
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,600
will kill himself.

360
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,460
Then he's saying the appearance of God will take time

361
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,520
at the appearance of the sign of the Ramses.

362
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,520
And I'm surprised

363
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,000
this hasn't made national news.

364
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,240
I first heard of it on the internet

365
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,440
and then the local news

366
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,360
people pounced on it.

367
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,600
Going, oh, great, another

368
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,080
saucer cult

369
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,240
dropped the body.

370
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,060
Yes, dear friends, there was, yes, the other

371
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,360
saucer cult here in Dallas that made

372
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,320
the news. Here's from the Dallas Morning News.

373
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,840
The white-clothed

374
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,360
cowboy-hatted people

375
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,500
have been good neighbors, area residents

376
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,480
say. They drive nice cars,

377
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,200
including Lexuses and

378
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,480
Mercedes-Eazys, keep their homes

379
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,320
and yards neat and cause no

380
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,040
trouble.

381
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,060
Their beliefs are unconventional.

382
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,180
At a news conference Tuesday,

383
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
they introduced two young boys as

384
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,540
the reincarnations of Jesus Christ

385
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,220
and Buddha. But

386
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,640
neighbors say that hasn't bothered them either.

387
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,480
Actually, there were some fun

388
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,440
clips on the local news

389
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,100
of these old po-buckers going,

390
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,760
well, you know,

391
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,440
maybe they're right. If they're right,

392
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,420
then I guess they're gonna have the

393
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,300
last laugh.

394
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,220
In the last week, however,

395
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,920
the group of 160

396
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,760
believers that calls itself

397
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,080
Chen Dao, or the True Way,

398
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,240
has been besieged by media attention

399
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
after rumors spread that its members might

400
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,180
commit mass suicide

401
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,480
in the manner

402
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,400
of the Heaven's Gate cult in San

403
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,280
Diego earlier this year, and the

404
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,100
Church of the Subgenius later on.

405
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,360
What? We're not... But subgenius members

406
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
say that isn't true. They do not plan to

407
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,560
kill themselves, and in fact, so revere

408
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,460
life that they are vegetarians

409
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,820
who only eat frop,

410
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,440
which grows on the droppings

411
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,540
of their abominable

412
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,340
snowman ancestors, they claim.

413
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,720
They say they have come to Garland.

414
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,140
This is where King of the Hill is based

415
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,680
on, friends. Garland,

416
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,060
which is where I live, which

417
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,660
their leader calls Godland,

418
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,060
to watch God come

419
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,920
to Earth and turn into a human being.

420
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,980
This, they say, will happen at exactly

421
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,260
10 a.m., March 31st,

422
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,180
at the home of

423
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,880
the crazy

424
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,540
old Chinese feller,

425
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,160
their Taiwanese guy.

426
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,220
And, uh,

427
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,200
their teacher, Hou Ming Chen,

428
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,680
a former college social sciences

429
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,700
professor from southern Taiwan.

430
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,700
So, friends, we are

431
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,380
just so full of

432
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,040
saucer calls and...

433
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,620
Let's see. We'll pull down the

434
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,700
save here a little bit in the background.

435
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,760
And, uh,

436
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,580
the...

437
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,060
Mr. Chen said, uh...

438
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,580
Oh, he introduced these two boys. He had a big

439
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,600
press conference in the driveway of his big

440
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,660
house, and he introduced these two

441
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,960
little chubby boys. One is,

442
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,320
uh, ages 10 and 9, and one is

443
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,280
Jesus, and one is Buddha. Now, I know,

444
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
I mean, needless to say,

445
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,140
this is a false Jesus, and probably

446
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,500
a false Buddha. We've got a Jesus,

447
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,440
and I've been thinking, maybe we ought to get

448
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,260
a Buddha, too, but, uh, they

449
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,300
say here, um,

450
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:38,700
uh,

451
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,400
the next-door neighbor, Charles

452
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,440
Amix, asked whether he should worry

453
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,540
that his life was in danger, since he doesn't

454
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,640
believe in Chen Dao.

455
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,220
You have the right to express yourself, Mr.

456
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,060
Chen replied. It doesn't matter.

457
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,860
Whether you believe or not.

458
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,240
The TV coverage is worse than these

459
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,560
nice neighbors.

460
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,360
They're lovely people.

461
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,380
Um, they're not

462
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,460
a whole lot different from any Christian belief

463
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,380
as far as God returning to Earth.

464
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,340
If they're right, we're all gonna look like

465
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,320
fools, now, ain't we?

466
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,020
So, Garland,

467
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,060
Texas, is the land of

468
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,280
God, because it sounds like

469
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:20,880
Godland.

470
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,760
And...

471
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,740
Come on, come on.

472
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,640
Come on, come on.

473
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,480
Come on, come on.

474
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,800
She may or might not love Santa.

475
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,220
Yeah, is that part of the subject? You got, like,

476
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,800
he's She-male Santa's going around? We've been seeing him in the malls.

477
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,280
She-male Santa?

478
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,200
No, he's She-male Santa.

479
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,460
She-male Santa.

480
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,380
She-male Santa.

481
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,140
She-Man.

482
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh man, chicks with...

483
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,600
Yeah, right, you got it.

484
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:01,260
You get to, you know, impress a hot, jolly elf, and at the same time you're thinking about Pop-Tarts.

485
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,960
If you alone just get naked to make a sexy surprise,

486
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,000
don't say it's not so wrong.

487
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,560
To the girls who turn you down,

488
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:19,000
it always feels better, especially if you squeeze your stomach in with straps and don't...

489
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,900
Get out of the way!

490
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,420
Yeah.

491
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,600
Could you describe that? What happens to Timmy? We won't tell about Billy.

492
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,840
Well, it all started when Timmy had to tinkle.

493
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,840
He was visiting Niagara Falls and he felt an overwhelming urge.

494
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,080
Unfortunately, he didn't realize he was near a giant hydroelectric power box.

495
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:41,320
And the droplets connected him with the cosmic pulse which surges through the universe.

496
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,540
For a brief moment, Billy, or rather Timmy, was one with the stuff of the cosmos.

497
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,880
All the force of an exploding stuff.

498
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,200
And all of a sudden, Billy becomes the cosmos.

499
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,580
Yep, he became all over the cosmos. It was one titanic blast.

500
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,360
Oh, there it is.

501
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,540
A blast of the past.

502
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,280
It shook the whole station. Did you feel it?

503
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,440
And the entire state went into a...

504
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,180
Got a little one there.

505
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,500
I think we had an earthquake.

506
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,360
Four to five, it's a little earthquake.

507
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,140
A earthquake?

508
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,720
Gotta go check for sheer bolts.

509
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,080
I'm going to.

510
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,200
Hey, I'm not joking. It really did happen because we talked about a forbidden thing,

511
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,060
and our elders warned us not to bring that up on the show.

512
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,500
I think we're gonna have an...

513
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,360
Actually, you know, what's that next to the war starting right now, across to the other side of the world?

514
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,360
Did you feel that little temblor that we just experienced?

515
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,820
No, I didn't feel anything at all.

516
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,460
You know, that's something we've often discussed.

517
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,940
What if we're here doing our usual line of bibble babble that we like to bibble babble,

518
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:40,640
and something does happen, you know, we'll be the only people on the air who have to report to the world the onset of World War III.

519
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,240
It'll be perfectly evident as dream come true because we'll have it all on tape.

520
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,660
Yes, but only until the next EMP, the big electromagnetic pulse...

521
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:47,960
That's right.

522
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,880
...wipes the slate clean once we're gone.

523
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,020
Yeah, that's right.

524
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,940
And it's all just so much blank tape.

525
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,400
That's where I was talking to Trevor about that today, a couple days ago.

526
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,180
Now let's have less name dropping, please.

527
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,400
That's puzzling evidence. He's not worried about the heat blast or the radiation or anything.

528
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,360
It's the EMP that's gonna really screw him up.

529
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,020
Just the MPs. The MPs that are coming to screw him up.

530
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,260
Oh yeah, the MPs will come trotting in and confiscate all those blank tapes, yeah.

531
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,240
Listen, Parliament can't do that unless it's approved by two-thirds of the majority.

532
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,920
Yeah, Parliament gives you extra margin.

533
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,940
Good evening. You're on the air.

534
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,220
I'm on KBFA with Frank Zappa.

535
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,600
Uh, yeah, hi Frank. Greetings from the subgenius church.

536
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,720
Oh yeah, good.

537
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,060
Thanks for holding me.

538
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,760
How is old Bob?

539
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,100
Oh, he's doing good. He sends his regards.

540
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,960
You know one of the best things about Bob?

541
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,780
What's that?

542
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,540
He's a smoker.

543
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,380
Yeah. Yeah, a frop all the way.

544
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,360
Well, not really, but...

545
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,020
Brothers and sisters, this has been Prozac Free Radio.

No animals were harmed during the taping of this show.

549
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,620
And it was a stray and it didn't have a collar on it.

550
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,660
It was a little black and white dog.

551
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,760
And so I threw it in the trunk of the car.

552
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,420
And I brought it home and I've been feeding it only the best food so it'll get fattened up real good.

553
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:10,100
So come this Thanksgiving, well, we can take it out to that old stump in the backyard and take out the hatchet.

554
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:16,680
Was that that thing that you had in the little crate that you wouldn't even allow to move around so that it wouldn't build up any muscle?

555
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,580
It'd just build up nice big dog fat?

556
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,240
That's right. That's the one, man. The one I keep in the dark, cold room.

557
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,720
Oh, the dog veal.

558
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,400
Yes.

559
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,100
It kind of smells because I never clean up after it or anything.

560
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,560
Well, we took the dog tags off of this fine specimen that we gave the roadkill to.

561
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,780
And we're trying to track down the owner so that we can sue for, you know, the damages they did to our car and the others.

562
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,660
So far we know it's someone named Ronnie.

563
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,820
But we haven't got the last name yet.

564
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,280
It's one of those vet numbers.

565
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,200
And the vet says his records are incomplete.

566
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,160
And he was angry that we called this late at night.

567
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,840
Yeah, he has better things to do.

568
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,740
But we'll get hold of this Ronnie character to make sure that we settle up our accounts.

569
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,860
Oh, yeah, we'll settle up accounts with old Ronnie.

570
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,100
Yeah, we hate a budget deficit with anyone named Ronnie.

571
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,940
We hate to leave it hanging.

572
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,300
Much like the carcass will be hanging out on my porch so that the blood drains from it real good.

573
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,960
So when I can take it in and dress it up and...

574
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,880
Make them little sausages out of it.

575
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,160
We'll see whose bark is worse than their bite when we meet up with Ronnie.

576
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,500
Yeah, I've been slaughtering my own animals since I was 12.

577
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,660
Used to be I did it for food, but now I just do it for fun.

578
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,560
Well, you know, at the Papa Joe Mama Risk-Free Wildlife Hunting Service Reserve,

579
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:40,820
we basically are trying to also recycle the animals that we use in the experimentation.

580
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,440
But you kind of forget that the animals are better for health.

581
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:02,440


582
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:02,460
And I'll say truthfully, all my works were for washing,

583
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:02,520
a year days .

584
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:02,520


585
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:02,520


586
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:02,520


587
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:02,520


588
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:02,520


589
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:02,520


590
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:02,540
Is it the same thing you do in the 2020s?

591
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,500
Yup, yeah.

592
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,580
Is it the same thing you do in the 2020s?

593
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:07,580


594
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,420
See?

595
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:35,780
We'll be right back.

596
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,640
So it is all colors.

597
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,700
How about a hot tamale?

598
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,360
Warm and good.

599
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,940
How about hot buttered rum cake?

600
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,940
Taste a piece of pizza pizza.

601
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,220
Ten minutes till showtime.

602
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,000
Checking Bozo Boost.

603
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,300
Actually, yeah, Bozo Boost.

604
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:03,660
All right.

605
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,300
Check up Bozo Boost.

606
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,760
Here we go.

607
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,720
Old Father Time is giving back to his guy.

608
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,780
0-3-0-0.

609
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,300
53 minutes till showtime.

610
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,580
This is Boost.

611
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,040
Okay.

612
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,860
Now hold Boost off until.

613
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,540
0-3-0-0 off.

614
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,140
I'll boost you, young man.

615
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,200
Okay.

616
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,380
We need the Bozo Boost.

617
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,140
At that point, we will launch Bozo Boost.

618
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:22,620
Okay.

619
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,340
Say, I noticed you had kind of big shoes.

620
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:24,780
Yeah.

621
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,840
Those are Dr. Spob shoes.

622
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,680
Now, Changer, didn't you go into space once?

623
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,640
I am in space.

624
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,440
Using Bozo Boost?

625
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:33,900
Oh, okay.

626
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,120
Man, that cat's so far out, he's going to need a space cat to get back.

627
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,300
Man, you are way over the top.

628
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,400
Yeah, he's from All Right Village, I think.

629
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:42,920
Man.

630
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,860
You haven't seen the top, baby.

631
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,880
He's using the little Bozo Boost nose horn.

632
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,000
Are you looking for Boscus?

633
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,680
I'm a juice dog, Daddy.

634
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,420
Make me tingle.

635
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,880
I think you got that from St. Stupid.

636
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,480
Ground Control to Major Tom.

637
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,980
You really made the grade, and the papers want to know whose shirt you're wearing.

638
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,240
Over.

639
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,260
Do you copy?

640
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,740
Are you looking for Boscus?

641
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,500
Uh-oh.

642
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:02,920
There we go.

643
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,040
Cheap radio effects.

644
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,700
We've contacted space.

645
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,380
And we're flying high.

646
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,160
Music from the hearts of space.

647
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,740
This show is going to be beamed out into outer space.

648
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,520
Down.

649
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,600
We're having the hearts of.

650
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,180
Let us say.

651
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:15,440
Salad.

652
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,500
And of course, we're having iceberg lettuce for record.

653
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,160
We're scaring the UFOs away from invading us.

654
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,140
98% of the iceberg lettuce is below the surface.

655
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,380
We realize there's no intelligent life on the planet.

656
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:33,240
Well, they said that Chuck Berry, and both Chuck Berry and Johnny Cash, both shared the

657
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,760
mystic delights of a spastic colon over many a hardcore Pepsi and a Moon Pie.

658
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:43,240
And Brother Dave Gardner, who I say used to sleep in Stan's basement, also used to.

659
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,480
Oh yeah.

660
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,600
He was doing these damned verloren

661
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:55,600


662
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,720
Justifying one another.

663
00:23:59,840 --> 00:23:59,920
All right.

664
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:01,740


665
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,120

668
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,300
misocular that's my new religion in the darkest parts of military intelligence and all these

669
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:38,200
other things who wanted to break this space and head off somewhere where we can't really go

670
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,820

732
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,260
Yeah, but he jumped out the window.

733
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,120
Yeah, you said Dave, you took the butt farmer

734
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,540
and he's eating a chip out of Dave.

735
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,080
And that white horse.

736
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:29,760
Yes.

737
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,440
We'll do credits, dear friends.

738
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:32,800
Let's see.

739
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,080
Starting from the beginning.

740
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Well, we've had a bunch of Einstein's Secret Orchestra

741
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,460
from WCSB in Cleveland.

742
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,680
That's Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz Smith

743
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:52,080
and in this case, Princess We Are Doe

744
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

745
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,840
We've heard lots of bits and pieces

746
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,180
out of KPFA subgenius show from Berkeley,

747
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,220
the best of the sub G show,

748
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,260
number five, the Phineas Narco edit,

749
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,120
with Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence.

750
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,460
And we also heard KPFA show with Janer Hypercleets

751
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:19,520
from August 8th, no, 889, 97.

752
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,720
I have trouble with human dates.

753
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,860
This is, it's 880BX, okay?

754
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,980
Janer Hypercleets in space.

755
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,920
We heard some Prozac free radio with Dr. Legume

756
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,760
and Papa Joe Mama special guest and Reverend Ed Strange.

757
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,240
We heard some,

758
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,520
Frank Zappa, Salute Bob.

759
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,820
We heard about the occult in Garland

760
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,760
and in the background here, we have a saver,

761
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,420
formerly Commander Dave,

762
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,360
and the Gravity is a Drug CD.

763
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,040
Thank y'all.

764
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,000
The Church of the Subgenius

765
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,560
will sleep for you when you're too tired.

766
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,100
We'll be right back.

767
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,520
We'll be right back.

768
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:18,420
We'll be right back.

769
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,460
We'll be right back.

770
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,640
We'll be right back.

771
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:47,640
We'll be right back.

772
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,160
We'll be right back.

773
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,160


774
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,160


775
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,160


776
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,160


777
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,160


778
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,580
Y'all be driving around

779
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,060
these big expensive pink Cadillacs.

780
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,400
I know somehow you've been supplementing your income

781
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,060
by what y'all been growing in your backyard.

782
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,260
Now, those of you that want to contribute to the Church,

783
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,320
wrap up some of that in a plastic bag

784
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,280
and send it on up here to the pool pit.

785
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,040
Praise Bob.

786
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,680
Brother Tyrone.

787
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,200
I wandered around in Bulldada.

788
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,380
Not knowing just what it was, it was.

789
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,200
Then in a dream I seen Bobby.

790
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,220
And he cast out the prophets that are false.

791
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,000
And now I'm sleeping with Bobby.

792
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,920
Sleeping with Bobby.

793
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,800
Sleeping with Bobby by my side.

794
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,480
Sleeping with Bobby.

795
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,540
Sleeping with Bobby.

796
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,200
Sleeping with Bobby, baby, bye.

797
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,280
Yes, I've been sleeping with Bobby.

798
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,140
Sleeping with Bobby.

799
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,920
Sleeping with Bobby by my side.

800
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,800
Sleeping with Bobby.

801
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,640
Sleeping with Bobby.

802
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,200
Sleeping with Bobby, baby, bye.

803
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,960
Sleeping with Bobby, baby, bye.

804
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,720
Thank you.

805
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,380
Be seated, everybody.

806
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,560
Now, we has got a problem with the church across the street.

807
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,140
The Church of the Divine Christian Licking Saints of Science.

808
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,080
The preacher called me last week.

809
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,180
He said they had purchased a brand new manger scene from the Walmart.

810
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,640
They put it on the front of the church there.

811
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,820
And our own sister, my hair, your hump dog, Rover,

812
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,180
keep going over there urinating on it.

813
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,660
I told them to slack off.

814
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,600
Brother Tyrone.

815
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,500
I thought that all dogs went to heaven.

816
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,420
Until I looked out at the manger scene.

817
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,780
There's a bulldog a sniffing at the wise man.

818
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,140
And next I'll tell you what it was I seen.

819
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,460
I seen Rover pissing on Jesus.

820
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,460
Marking his turf everywhere he pleases.

821
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,560
Reckon that dog is heading for doggy hell.

822
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,960
Get my gun and I'll kill Rover.

823
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,900
Can't be pissing up on my savior.

824
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,100
In the name of Bobby, pass the slack.

825
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,680
Sing one more time.

826
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,440
I seen Rover pissing on Jesus.

827
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,260
Marking his turf everywhere he pleases.

828
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,480
Reckon that dog is heading for doggy hell.

829
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,840
Get my gun and I'll kill Rover.

830
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,720
Can't be pissing up on my savior.

831
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,960
In the name of Bobby, pass the slack.

832
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,700
In the name of Bobby, pass the slack.

833
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,120
Well, it's bigger than me.

834
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,640
It's bigger than you.

835
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,160
It ain't bigger than Bobby.

836
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,480
Yes, it's bigger than me.

837
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,920
It's bigger than you.

838
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,020
But it ain't bigger than Bob Dog's.

839
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,360
Nothing's bigger than Bob Dog.

840
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,460
Just fireball power.

841
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,120
Sweet hour of slack.

842
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:27,780
How great it is to become one with Bob.

843
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,900
So quit your job and get in line.

844
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:43,220
For divine immaculation, J.R. Bob Dogg.

845
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,580
Praise be to God.

846
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,360
His divine immaculation, J.R. Bob Dogg.

847
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,860
Praise be to God.

848
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,020
Praise be to God.

849
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,960
Praise be to God.

850
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,400
Thank you.

851
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:57,700
Thank you.

852
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,460
Thank you.

853
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,160
Now some of y'all in here be pornicating and pornicating and pornicating.

854
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,940
I like that pornicate.

855
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,620
guitar solo

856
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,800
guitar solo

857
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,380
guitar solo

858
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,480
guitar solo

859
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,140
guitar solo

860
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,140
guitar solo

861
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,300
guitar solo

862
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:51,560
guitar solo

863
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,900
guitar solo

864
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,000
guitar solo

865
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,000


866
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,000


867
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,000


868
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,000


869
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,560
Sometimes I'm here on the show, other times I'm just flying over the mountain.

870
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,980
But I'm always spiritually present, Jayner.

871
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,400
You are a spirit in your present.

872
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,000
Therefore, your presence

873
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,600
is a spirit in me.

874
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,620
Remember that time I did that thing?

875
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,100
Oh, that was great when you did that thing.

876
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,600
Life is nothing but a river.

877
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,880
Everyone was just patting me on the back,

878
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,460
and it was me. And I was just so successful,

879
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,520
and I did so many neat things, and it was me.

880
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,040
But it's just life is just a river, Jayner.

881
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,560
Life is just a river, and if you're gonna enjoy life,

882
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,260
you gotta just sit back and float on by

883
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,120
like a cadaver floating down that wonderful river.

884
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,800
Like my daddy used to say, it's yellow.

885
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,960
That's why it's in the water.

886
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,760
Anyone who doesn't understand that joke will be put to death

887
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,140
because they're only normal.

888
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,480
I love that humor.

889
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,040
It's really an easy joke.

890
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,280
Listen to him, it's really an easy joke.

891
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,720
Now, when you tell this joke, I want you to explain it

892
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,600
so everyone real understands it,

893
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,020
and then tell it over again in slow motion

894
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,900
so we can understand every bit of it.

895
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,040
Okay, he'll explain what he meant.

896
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,140
Then we'll decide whether it's funny or not.

897
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,500
Okay, what I really meant

898
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,020
when I said,

899
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,160
actually, okay, I'll clarify this for you.

900
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,100
Is that the funny part?

901
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,240
.

902
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:00,840
.

903
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,300
.

904
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,220
.

905
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,360
.

906
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,360


907
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,560
.

908
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:14,660
.

909
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:14,680
.

910
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:14,900
.

911
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,620
.

912
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:15,680
.

913
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,360
.

914
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:16,420
.

915
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,360
.

916
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:19,500
.

917
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:19,860
.

918
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,520
.

919
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,600
.

920
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:28,600


921
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,500
.

922
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:29,580
.

923
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:29,680
.

924
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,560
.

925
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:30,620
.

926
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:30,620


927
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,420
.

928
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:48,940
.

929
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,000
.

930
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,040
.

931
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:49,940
.

932
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,280
.

933
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:01,860
.

934
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:01,900
.

935
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:01,920
.

936
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:01,940
.

937
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:01,940


938
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,100
And we found all sorts of amazing things.

939
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,400
For instance, did you realize that a gunshot wound to the pelvis area of a dog,

940
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:16,980
that causes almost 530 degrees on the Mingler pain scale.

941
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,560
530 degrees!

942
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,500
Why, that's astounding, Dr. Malmo.

943
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,340
But we can reduce those degrees of pain by almost 10%

944
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,900
if we administer what we call an acupuncture wound to the forehead.

945
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:29,980
Go ahead.

946
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,020
This can be used with a blunt instrument.

947
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,680
It doesn't have to be anything really sophisticated.

948
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,440
But, you know, basically you're distracting the canine from its other injury.

949
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,520
Yes.

950
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,500
Tell me more, Papa Joe.

951
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,060
Well, I could get into the cat research, but right now that's kind of classified.

952
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,420
Oh, you can tell us about it.

953
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,980
Well, the only thing we can't tell you about it...

954
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,020
How many watts is the station?

955
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:54,720
400.

956
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,440
400.

957
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,840
Well, that's under 500 watts.

958
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,200
That passes the, what we call the classification...

959
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,480
Threshold.

960
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,000
Threshold.

961
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,060
I think that would be safe.

962
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,820
Well, we discovered that, you know, amazingly, I mean, we had all grown up with popular myths.

963
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,640
For instance, a lot of people believe that cats will always land on their feet.

964
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,280
Well, we at the Mingler Research Center for Humane Population Control

965
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,940
can assure you that that is not always the case.

966
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:19,680
Yes.

967
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,320
Always is a very strong word.

968
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,380
And what we basically did was we started taking the cats up, you know,

969
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,400
first one story on the building and dropping them off, and he would land on his feet.

970
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,600
We'd take out two stories.

971
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:29,880
He'd land on his feet.

972
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,480
He'd land on three stories.

973
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,000
After a while, we said, this is ridiculous.

974
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,560
Let's at least find if there is a point somewhere where they don't land on their feet.

975
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,900
So we took them up in a small craft, dropped them out of the airplane,

976
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,900
and they did not land on their feet.

977
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:44,320
So then the question was, where between six miles altitude

978
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:49,160
and the third story of a building does the cat actually stop landing on his feet?

979
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,300
Now, I won't give you that actual answer because that is classified,

980
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:57,500
but I will say that it is somewhere between the third story and the six-mile altitude.

981
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,220
Yes.

982
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,500
And as for the last one,

983
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,280
when we tossed off the third story window,

984
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:06,180
if anyone finds a shaven cat with a number tattooed on its front foreleg,

985
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,400
please return it to the Papa Joe Mama.

986
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,980
Mingler Research for Humane Population Control.

987
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,460
I'm sorry.

988
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,500
I couldn't get that out.

989
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,600
I had a mouthful of veal.

990
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,640
Of course, there is a lot of positive research that comes out of this, too.

991
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,240
After all, many people say, well, you know,

992
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,380
how do we keep the population down in a humane way?

993
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,120
Well, some of our earlier experiments,

994
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,520
like, say, AIDS, which was intended to be a painless disease, by the way.

995
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,380
It got mutated over years.

996
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,780
We initially started a polio vaccine in Angola on the chimpanzees there,

997
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,480
knowing that it would eventually, you know, work its way into the population.

998
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,580
I won't get into the motivations of that experiment.

999
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:45,520
We're going to...

1000
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,180
All right.

1001
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,220
And, uh...

1002
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:58,760
I think...

1003
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,680
I think we're going to have to do something about it.

1004
00:45:59,680 --> 00:45:59,980
I think we're going to have to do something about it.

1005
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,460
It's one of the damn Martian tripods in Akron.

1006
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,220
And the people in Cleveland don't even know that we had a war with Mars.

1007
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,460
It was...

1008
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,340
Admittedly, it was 90 years ago.

1009
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:09,920
90...

1010
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,100
Exactly.

1011
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,160
97 years ago, praise Bob, that we defeated...

1012
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,640
And there's a crashed pyramidal spaceship in Mississippi,

1013
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,160
and nobody talks about that, either.

1014
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,840
Oh, they don't pay any damn attention to it at all.

1015
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,560
They don't know that there are still Martians living up in the Arctic Circle.

1016
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:28,640
So...

1017
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,340
You know, it's...

1018
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,720
There are some kids...

1019
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,040
I talk to kids nowadays, they go,

1020
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,800
you know, we had a war with Mars in 1900,

1021
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,780
and the Martians all died of a virus, thanks to God's wisdom.

1022
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,780
Well, great.

1023
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,180
But they didn't all die.

1024
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,360
The Martians up in the North Pole and the South Pole

1025
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,880
are still there with their giant cities

1026
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,840
walking around on huge tripod traps.

1027
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,040
And, you know, any minute now, they're going to...

1028
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,640
I don't know.

1029
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,200
Only go by the conspiracy media.

1030
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,420
Okay, Chaz?

1031
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,860
If you only go by the radio,

1032
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,320
you would think there had never been a war against Mars.

1033
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,700
You would think that the war in Vietnam

1034
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,920
was something that had ended 20 years ago.

1035
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,660
You would think that World War II,

1036
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,620
against the...

1037
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,700
The Germans and the Japanese

1038
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,280
was all cleaned up and just all taken care of

1039
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,060
back in the 1940s.

1040
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,520
Oh, yes, we don't have to worry about the Germans.

1041
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,860
You would think that the Tunguska event

1042
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,880
was just a vaporized meteorite.

1043
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,920
Yeah, meteorite.

1044
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:45,720
I wish.

1045
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,040
We all wish.

1046
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,500
Flattened out the trees in a spiral motion

1047
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,160
for 4,800 miles.

1048
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,740
Well, when they Tunguska the...

1049
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,280
You know, when they Tunguska I-90

1050
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,480
just outside of Cleveland...

1051
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,420
Then maybe...

1052
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:03,100
Maybe the students there at the universities

1053
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,540
will get some kind of a clue

1054
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,420
that maybe there's something they haven't been told.

1055
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,040
Well, these freshwater lakes

1056
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,900
that we're sitting on up here in Cleveland is...

1057
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,160
The freshwater...

1058
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:11,720
I mean, it's just...

1059
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,580
There's pods down there that nobody knows about.

1060
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,260
It's like, you know,

1061
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,680
kind of like Invasion of the Body Snatchers,

1062
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,200
only not really.

1063
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,220
They're not snatching the bodies.

1064
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:18,860
Oh, no.

1065
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,840
There's not really any terrible monsters

1066
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,060
controlling people's minds

1067
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,640
and causing them to serve the alien overlords.

1068
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:28,620
Oh, no.

1069
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,280
Oh, there's no government conspiracy

1070
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,760
to suppress all dissent

1071
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,680
and kill any religious nuts

1072
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,380
like in Waco and Ruby Ridge.

1073
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:38,920
Oh, no.

1074
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,800
There's never been a war against Mars.

1075
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:41,760
Oh, no.

1076
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,300
No, none of that stuff ever happened.

1077
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,980
Oh, no.

1078
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:51,460
Oh, no.

1079
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,280
Oh, no.

1080
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,380


1081
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,380


1082
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,380


1083
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,380


1084
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,380


1085
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,380


1086
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,380


1087
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,380


1088
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,380


1089
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,380


1090
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,380


1091
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,380


1092
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,100
Oh, no.

1093
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,060
Oh, no.

1094
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:17,220
Oh, no.

1095
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,440
Oh, no.

1096
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,180
Oh, no.

1097
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:20,220
Oh, no.

1098
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:21,880
Oh, no.

1099
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:21,960


1100
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:21,960


1101
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:21,960


1102
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,260
Oh, no.

1103
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:22,260


1104
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:22,480
Oh, no.

1105
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:22,480


1106
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:22,480


1107
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:22,480


1108
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,880
Oh, no.

1109
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,680
Oh, no.

1110
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,840
Gulf War.

1111
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:01,920
Yeah, Saddam Hussein and those people were just a bunch of losers.

1112
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,700
We've won that war.

1113
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:04,920
We even fought it.

1114
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,640
Oh, people just don't believe anything.

1115
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,280
God, it's sickening.

1116
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,940
It's sickening and sad, but, you know, at the same time, it's kind of reassuring.

1117
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:20,420
It means that those with a good agenda, proper vision of the future,

1118
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:25,320
could wrench control of the mass mind

1119
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,100
and the world.

1120
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,920
From the conspiracy, those with good enough showbiz sense

1121
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,340
could probably convince them of anything.

1122
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,740
Because God knows they believe now.

1123
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1124
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,660
Mudder on, Stang, you poor old sap.

1125
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,440
Poor pathetic old...

1126
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,640
God, it's cold here in the office, friends.

1127
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,180
Oh, I suppose...

1128
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,520
Oh, my ears.

1129
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,560
These cheap headphones, I'm sorry.

1130
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,360
Everything's all just leaking in here.

1131
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,560
I'll tell you what you've been listening to.

1132
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:08,160
The music, for the most part, there has been by Seva,

1133
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,540
an artist formerly known as Commander Dave.

1134
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:17,400
I can't find an address anywhere on this album or this CD.

1135
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,960
It's called Gravity Is My Favorite Drug,

1136
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,920
and it was sent by Reverend Preacher.

1137
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,700
But I can't even tell you what label.

1138
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,500
It is that mysterious.

1139
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,400
We heard some WCSB, Einstein Secret Radio, of course.

1140
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,640
Prozac Free Radio, Papa Joe Mama,

1141
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,880
talking about the pain of the kitty cats.

1142
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:46,340
Janer on KPFA back in the day of 1997.

1143
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,520
And also some Janer from years, years before

1144
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,420
on KPFA Best of Tape.

1145
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,060
And a special thanks, of course, there to

1146
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,820
the First Church of the United States,

1147
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


1148
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


1149
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


1150
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:56,820


1151
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,080
of Elvis in Bob.

1152
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,700
That long sermon and song,

1153
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,140
Sleeping with Bobby,

1154
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,960
a sweet hour of slack,

1155
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,320
and the hardcore Bob sample mix dub

1156
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,200
are from the folks at Die Music

1157
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,400
and First Church of Elvis in Bob,

1158
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:17,480
right over there in Warren, Texas.

1159
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,820
Oh, yes.

1160
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,760
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1161
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,560
I noticed about the stuff, Bob.

1162
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:25,820
Me too.

1163
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:26,400
It's Thanksgiving.

1164
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,280
Coming up.

1165
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,120
How do I roast my Thanksgiving baby?

1166
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,560
You just tie it up, stick it in the oven.

1167
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:34,780
About eight hours.

1168
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,440
350 should do it.

1169
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,600
Don't worry about the little eyes bugging out.

1170
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,300
Just think about the theme song.

1171
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,300
The show staff finally shows.

1172
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,520
And, and, and, Leepo Abernathy.

1173
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,140
All of the ones before

1174
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:53,780
are be able to all better now on you.

1175
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,240
That grinning man with the pipe.

1176
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,560
The hail fellow that the dust spills.

1177
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,860
And what they claim does not even exist.

1178
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,140
People who deny the reality of Bob,

1179
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,440
who is lower than that?

1180
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:08,580
It's just like those wretches who would claim that Tarzan,

1181
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,600
Sherlock Holmes, and Robin Hood are fictitious characters.

1182
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,120
For surely our Bob is in their company.

1183
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,340
A heroic, happy madman who won't quit fighting

1184
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:20,140
until all humanity achieves slack,

1185
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,300
or at least that portion of humanity which is tired.

1186
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,420
Untrue Bob.

1187
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,440
That which is Bob.

1188
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:25,860
True.

1189
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,480
So I'm going to turn you over now to our master of ceremonies

1190
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,700
as the nobles of the Mystic Shrine perform their obeisance

1191
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,320
before the glittering white throne.

1192
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,900
What have you seen that compares with that, Ed?

1193
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:42,080
Oh, I thought, I thought, I thought you were going to play the Eraserhead soundtrack.

1194
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,960
I'm talking about this beautiful float that was sponsored by

1195
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,440
the Golden Knights of the Silver Pestle and the Green Protector.

1196
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,420
The prophylaxis of the lower Balaponga Canal.

1197
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:02,560
And you can get more information about that from the address I'm about to give, dear friends.

1198
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,380
Oh yes, just write for free information.

1199
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:23,440
That's free information you understand from Bob at Post Office Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1200
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:25,660
Ugh.

1201
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,300
That's really distracting actually.

1202
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:37,000
Just write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1203
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:42,820
Or you can, of course, the self-addressed stamped envelope will help and so forth.

1204
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:53,260
And www.subgenius.com and slack at subgenius.com.

1205
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:00,380
And we, we'd love to tell you more.

1206
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,840
You just ask.

1207
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,360
You'd be surprised.

1208
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:04,960
We're not going to kill anybody.

1209
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,880
Alone in dark spotted mist.

1210
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,960
Companion and pilot.

1211
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,920
Embraced in a kiss.

1212
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:15,240
She loves him and he needs to see her lightless.

1213
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:19,640
To know that the shadows hide all that he is.

1214
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,600
In time that means nothing at all.

1215
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,400
In space.

1216
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,580
Being her.

1217
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,120
Yes.

1218
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,540
Quiet and smart.

1219
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,620
Then I thought I caught a glimpse of you.

1220
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,160
Hiding somewhere in Eurasia.

1221
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,440
Eurasia.

1222
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,400
Eurasia.

1223
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,520
Eurasia.

1224
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,380
Eurasia.

1225
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:53,740
Eurasia.

1226
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:53,900
Eurasia.

1227
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:54,060
Eurasia.

1228
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:54,380
Eurasia.

1229
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:54,380


1230
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:54,380


1231
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:54,380


1232
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:54,380


1233
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:54,380


1234
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,820
That's where I'd have gone.

1235
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,080
Eurasia.

1236
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,940
Eurasia.

1237
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,080
Eurasia.

1238
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,760
Eurasia.

1239
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,400
Eurasia.

1240
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:20,980
Eurasia.

1241
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,460
Eurasia.
