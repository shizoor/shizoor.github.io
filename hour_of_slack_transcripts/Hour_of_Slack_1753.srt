1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,280
You shall be put to death.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,300
You wanna try it, Poki?

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,960
We're sorry.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,840
Love me tender, love me sweet.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,660
Never let me go.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,760
Sorry.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,260
And I'll live my life clean.

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,280
And I love you so.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,320
Visit the Sack Bar now.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,900
Love me tender, love me true.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,720
Now all my dreams fulfilled.

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,480
No employees.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,200
For my darling, I love you.

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,680
No inventory.

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,560
And I always will.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,740
And no selling.

17
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,420
And I always will.

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,820
Your call cannot be completed until...

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,000
No.

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,840
No thanks.

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,140
I prefer grass.

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,340
At San Quentin.

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,620
I love you.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,820
The습니다.

25
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,640
Correct.

26
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,740
Thank you.

27
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:48,860


28
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:48,860


29
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,260


30
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,260


31
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,660
On the floor.

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,580
From PR news in Washington.

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,420
I'm provocative.

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,720
Police say I'm still being investigated.

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,720
There is good evidence of Chili, right there.

36
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,860
Northern California rolled over several times on a snow-covered mountain in Colorado.

37
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,700
Witnesses say PR's bad.

38
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,320
The White House managed to reach a phone and call for help today.

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,780
Rescue crews are en route.

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,200
The FBI says 2% by 6.5%.

41
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,800
On Wall Street, 29.

42
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,280
Six snowmobilers detonated a blast that killed personal trainers following a ski trip to Telluride.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,820
The presidential candidates from both parties injected Hillary Clinton with performance-enhancing PR news from Washington.

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,680
And thank you, Mr. Fernandanande Lee Murr.

45
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,220
Ah, yes, dear friends.

46
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,680
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1,753.

47
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,480
This time a live, or pretend live, show with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

48
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,440
Recorded November 14th, the year the conspiracy calls 2019.

49
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,000
But there'll be a lot more other stuff in between,

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,700
including some of the most important things we've covered so far.

51
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,720
Some puzzling evidence show from KPFA Berkeley.

52
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,880
And some collages featuring the idiot monster.

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,280
Not Bob, though.

54
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,880
The origins of which collages are mystery to me in many cases.

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,940
But first, or second, a little ditty from our many friends in the Rudy Schwartz Project.

56
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,840
I promise to cut taxes for the rich and use the poor as a cheap source of teeth for aquarium gravel.

57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,560
That'll show!

58
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,980
You're not rich.

59
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,520
But someday I might be rich, and then people like me better watch their step.

60
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,200
And then this Democrat mayor gets up.

61
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,960
He said, wow, I think it was Donald Trump.

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,680
The Rudy Schwartz Project.

63
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:15,640
And then John And I followed suit, I think it was the finance director.

64
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,280
Don count on you all to come back in time, like you did with 9-Eleven.

65
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,300
And then go out the meses, camp some new Robotnik,breast promoting with Max and Carl.

66
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,040
That's Nocturne.

67
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,040


68
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,260
This seems to have hella RAMPED.

69
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,260


70
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,380
It's perhaps more такая FGA..

71
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,680
We'll hop and skip and jump.

72
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,860
It's time to be a sociopath and vote for Donald Trump.

73
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:40,340
Part of the problem and part of the reason it takes so long is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore, right?

74
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,480
And they're being politically correct the way they take them out.

75
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,480
Look at my African-American over here.

76
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,320
Look at him.

77
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,860
Are you the greatest?

78
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,220
I love the old days.

79
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,560
You know, I think you should do to guys like that when they were in a place like this.

80
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,320
If you carry them on a stretcher.

81
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,940
Oh, no, no.

82
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,200
Will we dance?

83
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,020
No, we don't.

84
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,300
The ghost of less mathematics will rise up and sing the song.

85
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,720
Wompy, poodle, puddle, dumb.

86
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,340
He's completely nude.

87
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,740
Donald's got a boner.

88
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,700
That's because he's not a prude.

89
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,960
Locked from tourism, get involved.

90
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,780
Rise up and take a stand.

91
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,860
Donald Trump's the guy to make America great again.

92
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,920
All you watching Infowars are spitting on your chin.

93
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,220
Lubricate your rectum with your fist and we'll disdain.

94
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,080
Tra-la-loo.

95
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

96
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,320
He'll deport the Mexicans, the Muslims, and the Jews.

97
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,480
Tra-hit-a-lee-dum.

98
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,500
Stuck your head inside your room.

99
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,680
Join the clan, pick out your sheet, and vote for Donald Trump.

100
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,220
Hop and dance.

101
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,140
Good-bye to France.

102
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,320
It's Mussolini's second chance.

103
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,040
20 million whites.

104
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,940
So, premises can't be wrong.

105
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,860
Tra-la-loo.

106
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,280
Yuck-a-diddly-dum.

107
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,640
Donnie Trump and Vladimir Putin.

108
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,280
Walking hand-in-hand.

109
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,120
Ho-yo-yo.

110
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,360
Slippity-dippity-slump.

111
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,440
It's time for all the dead.

112
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,520
Because it's time for Donald Trump.

113
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,740
Everyone's a dumbass and their brains are full of glass.

114
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,860
It's time to be a hero.

115
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,540
It's time for Donald Trump.

116
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,100
Let's fight to punch him in the face, I beg you.

117
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,280
We having a good time?

118
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,040
USA, USA.

119
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,420
USA, USA, USA.

120
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,820
All right, yeah, get him out.

121
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Try not to hurt him.

122
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,520
If you do, I'll defend you in court.

123
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,280
Don't worry about it.

124
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,180
USA, USA, USA.

125
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,000
USA, USA, USA.

126
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,600
USA, USA, USA.

127
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:55,640
USA, USA, USA.

128
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,640


129
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,640


130
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,640


131
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,660
USA, USA.

132
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:55,660


133
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:55,660


134
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:55,660


135
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:55,660


136
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:55,660


137
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:55,840
USA, USA.

138
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,220
the life of me remember what I was going to say. I turned this thing on prematurely to talk,

139
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,180
but I guess I need to call Dave and see if all this stuff works properly.

140
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:22,680
It's some kind of hour of slack, I think. Well, let's try. Let's find out if that's what it really is.

141
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:35,780
I don't know. Dave! I'm digging it. You made it. I don't know what I made it. Is everything okay?

142
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:47,520
I mean, relatively? As well as it can be. That's not, well, it could be perfect or near perfect or

143
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:55,080
seemingly perfect anyway. Seemingly or near. I mean, it could be. Probably isn't.

144
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,820
Could be.

145
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,040
It could be a fissionable device that they're trying to relocate the Arctic Ocean on.

146
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,820
I don't know if that's a real reality or something they said from Walter Reed Hospital.

147
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,200
Well, somebody is going to have to put the Atlantic Ocean somewhere safe to keep it away from the humans.

148
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,360
Yeah, do you need to save it online somewhere in the cloud?

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,380
No, what I had in mind was, well, you know how on X-Day I have dibs on all these great things and places?

150
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:25,740
Yeah.

151
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:25,940
Yeah.

152
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:26,960
Well.

153
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,820
I've had artifacts and you sold artifacts for me, too.

154
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,820
I'm having volume problems on you.

155
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,720
Volume?

156
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,500
Yeah, yeah. Talk as loud as you can.

157
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,780
I'm talking right into it.

158
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,340
Okay, that's good.

159
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,020
Anyway, yeah, yeah, I had a brainstorm about X-Day.

160
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,460
I'd been thinking too small in that I'd been thinking, well, okay.

161
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,640
I'm going to beam up the Grand Canyon and the Salton Sea.

162
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,780
I might even fill the Grand Canyon up with the Salton Sea.

163
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,200
Yeah, that would be a good way to go.

164
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,080
You know, same way.

165
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,420
I'm kind of, we'll each have as big a an escape vessel spaceship as we want.

166
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,260
It can be planet sized.

167
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:24,220
And I was going to have one that was about the size of the Earth, maybe a little smaller, so I wouldn't weigh quite as much.

168
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,300
Yeah.

169
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:32,960
And I was going to, you know, beam up these various great museums and national monuments and stuff.

170
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,100
But lately I've been thinking, you know, it's a shame.

171
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:42,600
Even if X-Day doesn't happen, most, a whole lot of the life on Earth is about to die because of humans.

172
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:51,740
And I thought, what if I just beam up all the other life on Earth besides the humans on, you know, and have it.

173
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,400
That's silly.

174
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,340
Well, I know it sounds crazy.

175
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,500
It sounds crazy.

176
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,000
But I mean, we are talking about X-Day.

177
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,980
And in theory, it's quite possible.

178
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,660
You just have to be free to think of it.

179
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,340
Yeah, I guess that's, I had that kind of mixed up.

180
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,060
I had it backwards.

181
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,660
Like my fissionable devices I'm trying to sell.

182
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,140
It seems like the Ukrainians or the Eugenesians.

183
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,160
What's Eugeneuva?

184
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,100
I don't know.

185
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,560
But the Unarians are interested in fissionable devices.

186
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,240
Well, the ancient Sumerians, yeah, they have been for a long time.

187
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,760
No, no, the Unarians.

188
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,300
UFO cult in California.

189
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,660
Yeah.

190
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,800
They're friends of ours.

191
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:39,320
Well, I guess there are still some missionaries from San Francisco that are married after 20 years of insufferable turpitude.

192
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,560
You know what I'm saying?

193
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,360
I don't.

194
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,100
Well, now, you were talking about you have a fissionable device.

195
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,640
No, I have fissionable material.

196
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,700
Because we only have four.

197
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,940
You only have four?

198
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,880
Yeah, the Church of the Subgenius only has four nuclear weapons.

199
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
Well, I was hoping to get it up to six.

200
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,000
Right.

201
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,140
That's why I was asking, you know.

202
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,500
Because I could pretend like I have two more and we could all pretend together.

203
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,600
And that would be our six for our limit.

204
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,360
And we'd be okay as far as the instability department goes.

205
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,640
The, you know, the rug biters.

206
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,760
Yeah.

207
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:16,940
Yeah.

208
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,260
Thanks, and see you.

209
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm not currently seeking nuclear weapons.

210
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:24,860
I'm not seeking nuclear weapons.

211
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:24,860


212
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,680
Not pursuing atomic weapons does not mean pursuing atomic weapons can be eased.

213
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,300
The CIA is stepping down.

214
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,220
The CIA says it ordered the CIA to comply with PR News.

215
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:45,120
On Wall Street, 5-2-1-5-5, the Department of Education conspired to siphon off some six newspapers, coupled with higher gas prices.

216
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,600
Now the question is whether this is PR News in Washington.

217
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,540
My friend, we have traveled very far.

218
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,200
We have no food, no water.

219
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,160
Once I see my people fed, I would be honored.

220
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:00,360
No.

221
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,580
We have a serious problem with radical Islam.

222
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,080
We have a tremendous problem.

223
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,920
And we can't be the stupid country anymore.

224
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:17,740
Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates.

225
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,060
Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted.

226
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,840
The people that are...

227
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,600
The people that are with me 100% are the people.

228
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,300
What?

229
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,580
The Pope.

230
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,800
The Pope was in Mexico. Do you know that?

231
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,000
Did everybody know that? Right?

232
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,860
He said negative things about me.

233
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,880
The Pope is being told that Donald Trump is not a nice person.

234
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,060
Donald Trump is a very nice person.

235
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,180
If you do not let us in, all of us will die.

236
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,540
I said temporarily. I didn't say permanently. I said temporarily.

237
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,660
We have no border. We have no control.

238
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:54,820
We have no border. We have no control.

239
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,280
People are flooding across.

240
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,820
We need to build a wall.

241
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,200
And it has to be built quickly.

242
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,660
The greatest builder is me.

243
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,180
And I would build the greatest wall you have ever seen.

244
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:14,740
And in that wall, we're going to have a beautiful, big, fat door where people can come into the country, but they have to come in illegally.

245
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,180
I don't think they like me very much.

246
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,700
This country needs somebody.

247
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,940
That's a deal maker.

248
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,420
I'm giving you Commander Greyguard.

249
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,260
No deals. No deals.

250
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,340
We don't make deals. Not with anybody. We don't make deals.

251
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,740
You mistake me, my lord. That was a command.

252
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,780
No, no, no, no. Excuse me. Just so you understand.

253
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We need people that know what they're doing. We don't need babies.

254
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,480
Are you refusing to obey my order?

255
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,960
Yeah. By the way, I never... I think you could say that, yeah.

256
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,600
Olly, bring me my sword.

257
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,760
They laugh at us, but they say, what about it? And they chop off heads.

258
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,320
They think we are so stupid. You have no idea.

259
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,340
Much like my head. I don't want to see it removed just yet.

260
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,680
I would bring back waterboarding. And I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.

261
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,840
This is some heavy stuff.

262
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,400
What do you got going in here?

263
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,800
I think that's how the early subgenius preachers were born.

264
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,560
They multiplied like...

265
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,900
A split. Like amoebas.

266
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:40,000
Like amoebas, yeah. They would get... They'd start swelling up, look like they're going to explode, and all of a sudden they would split into two...

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,860
Horrible, pussy... Horrible preachers.

268
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,280
Yes, the trucks were filled with giant seedpods of some kind. And they're all over the highway.

269
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,820
See, this is the thing. Dr. Howe and...

270
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,420
Philo don't want to tell you about is what X-Day really is about.

271
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,620
I'm afraid the public is not ready to know.

272
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,600
What about the incredible two-headed transplant?

273
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,320
Another X-Day mistake. Yes, that one was...

274
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,340
Yeah, there's one up in the refrigerator.

275
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,680
There's, uh...

276
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,140
Nobody notices.

277
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,300
It would take an hour and a half to learn everything there is to learn about missiles. I think I know most of it anyway.

278
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,980
My wife, Ivana, is a brilliant manager.

279
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,520
I will pay her one dollar a year and all the dresses she can buy.

280
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,200
I think the only difference between me and the other candidates is...

281
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,420
I'm more honest and my women are more beautiful.

282
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,080
I build the best buildings. And I'm the biggest developer in New York by far.

283
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,440
While that's real estate and this is politics...

284
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,580
Are they really so different?

285
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,660
Usually, if I fire someone who's bad, I tell them how great they are.

286
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,840
Because I don't want to hurt people's feelings.

287
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,800
My fingers are long and beautiful. That's been well documented.

288
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,540
Along with other various parts of my body.

289
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,280
My Twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.

290
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,220
The concept of global warming was created by the Chinese.

291
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,160
Sorry losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest.

292
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,860
And you all know it.

293
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,300
Please don't feel stupid or insecure.

294
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,280
It's not your fault.

295
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,760
And it's not a wig. It's my hair.

296
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,740
Do you want to touch it?

297
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,760
McCain, he's not a war hero.

298
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,020
He's a war hero because he was captured.

299
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,360
I like people that weren't captured.

300
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,180
Okay?

301
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,480
What I say is what I say.

302
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,060
Well, I do whine because I want to win.

303
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,460
And I'm not happy about not winning.

304
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,380
I fully think apologizing is a great thing.

305
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,800
But you have to be wrong.

306
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,320
I will absolutely apologize if I'm ever wrong.

307
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,760
The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.

308
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,920
I love Hispanics.

309
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:05,540
Boy, for a minute there I thought I was hearing a strange buzz or some kind of fissionable aspect on your phone.

310
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,380
Now the buzz came.

311
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,040
Yeah, I hear the buzz.

312
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,700
Well, I had a major accident with my cell phone today.

313
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,940
And I was preparing for what to do in case this would happen.

314
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,920
Because I can't use my cell phone because I tried to download a device I shouldn't have.

315
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,040
I should have just used it for calling people.

316
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,260
Oh.

317
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,140
Instead it said, ready to download X5703.

318
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,980
Some Chinese writing.

319
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:32,900
Uh-oh.

320
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,780
And I downloaded it.

321
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,560
And now it doesn't work.

322
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,600
I accidentally pushed the wrong button.

323
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,140
Uh-oh.

324
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,460
Well, you can't call me.

325
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,600
I suppose I could call you.

326
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,680
But he said I can't speak.

327
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,460
I can't call you anymore so I believe him because I want to get out of there.

328
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,480
What?

329
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,360
Want to try and call me back?

330
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,260
Uh, yeah, sure.

331
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,200
I'll call you back.

332
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,220
Okay.

333
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:53,720
Okay.

334
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,020
Maybe it'll go away because it has done that sometimes.

335
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,560
Right.

336
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:56,840
Okay.

337
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,200
I'll just call you right back.

338
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:58,760
Okay.

339
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,100
I'll go back in and out of character.

340
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,340
Bye.

341
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:00,820
Okay.

342
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,860
In and out of character.

343
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,540
He's never out of character.

344
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,400
There's no difference between him and character.

345
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,840
What'd you say?

346
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,180
Oh, no.

347
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,920
There we go.

348
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:14,660
Okay.

349
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:14,660


350
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:14,660


351
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,120
I got a buzz on.

352
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,620
It's still there.

353
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,540
Davey, can you hear me?

354
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,520
Oh, yeah.

355
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:20,720
Yeah.

356
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,300
It's a very loud buzz.

357
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,700
I suggest that we do this on Tuesday or tomorrow.

358
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,180
Well, you know what, Dave?

359
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,660
Just leave it on.

360
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,900
Stay on for a minute because sometimes it just disappears when you spit on it or kick

361
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,860
it or lean back or something.

362
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,580
I was going to tell you.

363
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,820
I've got a buzz on, too.

364
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,700
Oh, man.

365
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:40,940
We've all got a buzz on.

366
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,560
A different kind of buzz.

367
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,660
You know, that could cost a lot of money if the state police finds out.

368
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:44,660


369
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:44,660


370
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:44,660


371
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:44,660


372
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:44,660


373
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:44,660


374
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:44,660


375
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:57,660
No, no. No, this is different. I have this electrostimulation device hooked up to my lower spine because my back's been hurting.

376
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,760
And these subgeniuses...

377
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,200
But we can work that right in there, huh?

378
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:16,420
These forbidden scientists in subgenius land sent me a TENS unit, T-E-N-S, which stands for telemagical electro...

379
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,200
Electrical...

380
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,060
Elbow fish.

381
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,080
And what's the other? Oh, neuromuscular stimulation.

382
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,400
Yeah, terrible electric neuromuscular stimulation.

383
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:39,580
And what it does is it kind of blanks out the signals from the pain nerves in your arthritic lower back.

384
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:48,360
And it replaces it with a feeling of a thousand tiny insects urging your back to let go by biting.

385
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,620
I've got it set on a program that makes it...

386
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,080
You know, it's biting real hard.

387
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,220
Then it lets off.

388
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,040
They're not biting much or barely biting.

389
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Oh, now they're biting more.

390
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,380
Oh, yeah, that feels good.

391
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:01,820
Oh, good.

392
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,800
Yeah.

393
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,620
It's like little molecules.

394
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,920
What do they call them when an atom comes up and chews up another atom?

395
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,980
Is that like nuclear science?

396
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,220
Arthritis?

397
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,680
That's what's going on in my back.

398
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,320
Anyway, hey, the buzz is gone, I think.

399
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,520
Mine is still on, but I'll keep on.

400
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,580
No, you sound fine.

401
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,320
I'm going to bring this Spongo music back up.

402
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:30,540
Oh, one of the things I was going to ask was if you could get weed ejected because you have tinnitus.

403
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,180
I didn't say that.

404
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,640
I didn't say you have breast.

405
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,120
Oh, no.

406
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,480
I have...

407
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,300
No, I've defeated the tinnitus.

408
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,080
My $10 billion hearing aids and the electro-stimulo...

409
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,140
Stimulo.

410
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,900
The electro pads and the neck bolts.

411
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,680
Oh, yeah, I love it.

412
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,380
Those have all kind of...

413
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,680
I mean, they blank the tinnitus.

414
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,440
I tried mine.

415
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,660
I can actually tell now.

416
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,940
I can't tell if...

417
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,320
It sounds good or bad, but I can tell if I can hear it.

418
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,740
And if I can hear it, anybody can hear it.

419
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,600
You can't tell if it sounds good or bad, but you can tell it sounds, right?

420
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,060
Yeah.

421
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,560
You're aware.

422
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,220
Yeah.

423
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,140
Yeah, I can...

424
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,920
Oh, I hear the buzz.

425
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,800
Yeah, the buzz is still there when I bring...

426
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,480
There's a buzz.

427
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,480
There's also a Pac-Man crunch, an old 1992 Pac-Man crunch going on there.

428
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,940
That's exactly what the pictures of my lower back look like on this CAT scan, Dave.

429
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,860
It looks like Pac-Man has been running down...

430
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:35,760
Taking bites out of the top of each of the vertebrae.

431
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,480
The bottom three or four, you can clearly see where Pac-Man or some dog has just been nibbling in the center of the backbone.

432
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,000
And then up in my neck, it's just kind of wispy.

433
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,680
Oh, well, that's a preferred position is to have a wispy neckline.

434
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,120
Oh, no.

435
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,040
No, not really.

436
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,040
No, not really.

437
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,500
No, in Paris fashion, man.

438
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,940
And I'm telling you, to have a wispy neckline and a marginal latitude...

439
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,540
Well, it's fashionable, but...

440
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:07,940
Yeah.

441
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,720
It makes it hard to drive.

442
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,880
I can't turn my head very far right or left.

443
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,920
I have to do the Batman turn.

444
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,280
My whole swivel from the waist.

445
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,500
My shoulders and everything move.

446
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,340
And oftentimes, you look out as far as you can, and you don't see anything.

447
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
You pull out, and next thing you know, something's right there.

448
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,240
Well...

449
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,140
But they eat you like a...

450
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,100
The domination of Pac-Man.

451
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,240
I'll tell you, man.

452
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,140
It's the indignities.

453
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,280
It's the indignities.

454
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,180
What can you say?

455
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,380
Shrivel up, baby.

456
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,100
We all got a few to live through.

457
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,000
I agree.

458
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,560
That's devonish logic, if you know what I don't mean, really.

459
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,860
I do know what you don't mean.

460
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,040
But, you know, at least we're not dead.

461
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,960
I think that's good.

462
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,400
So far.

463
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,160
So far, it's like you think you're dead.

464
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,100
I mean, you might not think you're dead.

465
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,480
Well, I've got these electrodes keeping me alive.

466
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,400
I've got this little terrible electro-neuromuscular stimulation here.

467
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,780
Oh, yeah.

468
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,700
Oh, yeah.

469
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,700
Oh, it hurts good.

470
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,820
It hurts better than real pain.

471
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,200
Let's put it that way.

472
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,440
That's because the Chinese made the pillows and the socks,

473
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,300
and they're trying to secretly take our subconscious.

474
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,200
They're trying to take our subconscious reflections and other stuff like that here.

475
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,260
They didn't just make the pillows and the socks.

476
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,080
They made everything.

477
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,920
They made the condoms.

478
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,980
They made, which is why there's so many humans running around still.

479
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,200
I mean, it's a plot, man.

480
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,800
It's conspiracy.

481
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,100
Yeah.

482
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,420
It is.

483
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,340
It's very, very one that no one takes seriously.

484
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,920
Like it's some kind of frumpy joke or a magazine article that nobody ever read before.

485
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,540
Right.

486
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,200
And, you know, I don't care about the buzz.

487
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,740
I say Trump the buzz.

488
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,820
See, I don't have to censor that one for broadcast.

489
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,220
Trump the buzz.

490
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,200
I don't care about it.

491
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,140
But what a name to be named for your president if you're playing this kind of hologram,

492
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,880
holster this loose game with dice you're playing.

493
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:21,220
Well, it's a perfect name for an idiot dolt, a rich kid, trust fund baby,

494
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,240
who's making a fool of himself and all of his supporters.

495
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,600
But who cares?

496
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,820
I don't care.

497
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,280
I don't care.

498
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,820
I don't care.

499
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,440
You don't care.

500
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,880
Well, I don't care.

501
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,320
That's that new bestselling book.

502
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:33,940
Other times.

503
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,360
Yeah.

504
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,420
Yeah.

505
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,240
I guess that's true if you want to be a big fat liar.

506
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,460
Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word

507
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,360
Trump.

508
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:55,620


509
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,180
Out of all of the English words that begin with a letter,

510
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,500
F Trump is the only word that is referred to as the F word.

511
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,900
It's the one magical word just by its sound can describe pain,

512
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,040
pleasure, hate and love.

513
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,740
Trump as most words in the English language is derived from German.

514
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,580
The word freaking, which means to strike in English.

515
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,720
Trump falls into many grammatical categories as a transitive verb.

516
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,720
For instance, John Trump.

517
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,260
Surely.

518
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:28,920
As an.

519
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,140
In.

520
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,920
Transitive verb.

521
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,540
Surely.

522
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,140
Trump.

523
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,860
Its meaning's not always sexual.

524
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,520
It can be used as an adjective such as John's doing all the trumping work.

525
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,680
As part of an adverb, surely talks to trumping much.

526
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,420
As an adverb enhancing an adjective, surely is trumping beautiful.

527
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,080
As a noun, I don't give a trump.

528
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,640
As part of a word, absolutely.

529
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,460
Trumping.

530
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:56,900
Lutely.

531
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,440
Or.

532
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,020
In.

533
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,800
Trumping.

534
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,300
Credible.

535
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,540
And, as almost every word in a sentence, Trump.

536
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,560
The trumping Trumpers.

537
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,340
As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility of Trump.

538
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:17,280
As in these examples describing situations such as fraud, I got trumped, that they use

539
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,860
Carlot.

540
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,720
Dismay, aw Trumped it.

541
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,360
Trouble, I guess I'm really trumped now.

542
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,040
Aggression, don't trump with me buddy.

543
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,420
Difficulty, I don't understand this trumping question.

544
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,920
Inquiry, who the Trump was that?

545
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,900
Dissatisfaction, I don't like what the Trump is going on here.

546
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,300
Incompetence, he's a Trump buff.

547
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,900
Dismissal, why don't you go outside and play hide and go Trump yourself.

548
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,500
I'm sure you can think of many more examples.

549
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,980
With all of these multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be a Trump?

550
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:57,980


551
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:57,980


552
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,020
With all of these multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be a Trump?

553
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,680
With all of these multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be a Trump?

554
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,660
With all of these multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use the

555
00:26:59,660 --> 00:26:59,980
word?

556
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,720
We say, use this unique, flexible word more often in your daily speech.

557
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,400
It will identify the quality of your character immediately.

558
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,660
Say it loudly and proudly.

559
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,180
Trump.

560
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,620
You.

561
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:24,300
Yep, I suppose if you're walking around threatening the other inmates and patients, then you've

562
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,660
got a reason to believe, you know?

563
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,940
Heck yeah.

564
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,060
Heck yeah.

565
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,560
Oh, that's the way you have to do it.

566
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,480
Hell yeah.

567
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,660
Oh, Christ, man.

568
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:40,340
You know, my sister who is in the state prison, I went to see her a couple of weeks ago.

569
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,560
She's doing okay considering.

570
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,300
It's so boring.

571
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,220
At least the weather broke.

572
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:54,620
But she has taken to, you know, her fellow offenders are curious and they want to know,

573
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,920
you know, what are you in here for?

574
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,220
And she makes up this whole story about how…

575
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,780
That's just beautiful.

576
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:07,880
Well, she has this vivid story about how she killed her ex-husband who abused her, which

577
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,300
is not true at all.

578
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,240
She never killed any ex-husbands, but she wanted to.

579
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:21,200
And so she can tell a really convincing tale about what built up to it and so forth and,

580
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,540
you know, impresses the other ladies and…

581
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,500
Oh, how cute.

582
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,340
Yeah.

583
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:30,920
And she basically wants everybody to leave her alone because they're so ignorant.

584
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,200
It drives her crazy and she'd rather read.

585
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,480
So, when they try to pester her and she doesn't want to talk to them, she has explained to

586
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,740
them that she has ass burgers, which is not true probably.

587
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,340
It's like cheeseburger, but it's not.

588
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,060
I'm sorry.

589
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,800
I have ass burgers and that's why I just don't like to, you know, socialize with people.

590
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,760
I don't do well with other human beings.

591
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,440
I basically hate them.

592
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:58,880
So, you're saying you don't want that with her?

593
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,220
It's because I have ass burgers.

594
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,400
And they say, oh, we thought you were a snob and didn't like us.

595
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,720
So, you're just mentally ill.

596
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,660
Oh, that's…

597
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,080
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.

598
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,220
Hey, everybody, she's just mentally ill.

599
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,660
That's why she's such a snob.

600
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,800
She's not really a snob.

601
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:21,600
She just has that, you know, like that boy in that show, that syndrome, that, you know,

602
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,780
breaking the business.

603
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,720
Big Bang Show or whatever it is.

604
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,120
That boy that can't relate to people.

605
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,980
She's like that.

606
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,220
Boy, he's got a cylindrical head.

607
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:38,700
And they mocked him since childhood for having a cylindrical head and being part of a fishing

608
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,100
fleet off Gulfport, Mississippi.

609
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,180
That's when they had him retired.

610
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:47,620
Like, I guess the carbonized Welsh Army or some of those crazy guys were at it again.

611
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,360
They were trying to defuse the whole concoction.

612
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,180
And all that happened was we got more trouble than ever.

613
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,800
You know?

614
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,020
Oh, I know.

615
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:03,320
And it makes people so uncomfortable when they hear the prating of someone who seems

616
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,680
like they might be really mentally ill on the radio.

617
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:08,880
Yep.

618
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:16,360
They kind of go, wow, are these guys really that messed up or is that just an act?

619
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,500
Thank goodness we don't have to deal with that kind of thing, Dave.

620
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,600
Well, we don't have to deal with it, but we have to.

621
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,160
Yeah.

622
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,820
We're forced.

623
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,460
We're actually forced by a subunit of the Army, of the military police that says in

624
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:37,580
1992, from then on until 2022, we have to obey and act like we're wearing a girdle and

625
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:44,580
take pictures of like, you know, those 1940s hot babes that you used to have in the lockers.

626
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:51,700
Well, what I'm saying is I've tried to be as kind as I can to the mentally ill people

627
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,180
that pointlessly.

628
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,560
Pointlessly try to use up our time.

629
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,960
But isn't it just as much fun to poke fun at them and make them cry?

630
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,560
You know, as Bob said, but we're only making fun of idiots.

631
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,940
Was that what he said?

632
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,820
Now I can't remember.

633
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,420
I think he was making fun of me, Dave.

634
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,420
Right.

635
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,900
Because that's not the creed.

636
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,380
It's backwards.

637
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,480
If you stop making fun of you, what will you do for a living?

638
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,000
You have to become a policeman or an archer or a...

639
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,160
Yeah.

640
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,160


641
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,160


642
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,200
Spaghetti blunder.

643
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,340
I've been thinking about being a Walmart greeter because it seems like that would be

644
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,080
sort of fun and slackful.

645
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,220
People walk in and you go, may I help you?

646
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,020
Would you like to know where anything is?

647
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,420
That's what I would like.

648
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,340
If I was one of them Walmart guys and somebody's walking in, you're supposed to greet them

649
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,640
and say, hello, welcome to Walmart and all that stuff you're supposed to say to them.

650
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,600
I'd say, I'd say spat on them.

651
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,440
And I'd say, what the hell are you doing here, you dumbass?

652
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,400
Dave.

653
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,400
Well, you've got to...

654
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,200
That's not what you...

655
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,240
You've got to cut that out.

656
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,540
That's not what greeters do.

657
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,880
I know, but that's what greeters should do.

658
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,100
Don't you think?

659
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:01,920
No.

660
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,820
We're crying out loud once in this life, we should shout back together and we'll stand

661
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:12,320
by the network window and say, I want everybody to listen or whatever he says.

662
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,820
And then just swear like a behemoth goat.

663
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,440
Well, I don't...

664
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,980
I know how a behemoth goat swears, believe it or not.

665
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,060
But, but, but...

666
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,380
But...

667
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,640
Dave, you know, I judge Walmarts by their greeters.

668
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:28,860
I've...

669
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:36,240
There's Walmarts where you walk in, the greeter's just sitting there, staring into space, doesn't...

670
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,080
Angrily looking.

671
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,500
Yeah, angry, looking angry and sullen.

672
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,720
You don't want to ask them anything.

673
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,580
I don't want to look at Walmart.

674
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,300
Well...

675
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,740
But then there's other Walmarts where you walk in, they go, welcome to Walmart, sir.

676
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,360
What a beautiful day it is outside.

677
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,360
Can I help you find anything?

678
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,960
Can we ask you a tip, Dave?

679
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:52,960


680
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:52,960


681
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:52,960


682
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,820
Notice I threw a Texas accent into that particular good Walmart.

683
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,500
Because I like the near...

684
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,180
The Walmart over to Granbury.

685
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,200
It's not...

686
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,120
They're pretty...

687
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,040
They actually walk up and go, can I help you, sir?

688
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:14,280
And they don't have everything under lock and key like the one in Cleveland Heights.

689
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,200
Because they don't have the theft problem as badly.

690
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,260
In Texas, there's good guys.

691
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,360
There's good guys with guns everywhere.

692
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:28,060
If somebody sees you shoplifting, it's legal for them to pull out a weapon and shoot you dead.

693
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,740
And so I saw him just pick up that thing and he hadn't paid for it.

694
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,400
Yeah, I saw him pick up...

695
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,560
You should write a song about that.

696
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,240
He picked up that gun and he didn't pay for it.

697
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,540
Well, sir, he hadn't gotten up to the cashier yet.

698
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,140
That's why he didn't pay for it.

699
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,860
Well, I killed him anyway because I knew he was going to steal it.

700
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,240
Well, all right.

701
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,880
Please be more careful next time, customer.

702
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,300
You two, Manuel, Pepe, drag this guy out of the...

703
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,120
Out of the...

704
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,680
Oh, God.

705
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,800
I don't know.

706
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
I think that's totally insane.

707
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,680
Well, sure.

708
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,300
Well, of course, I know it's intended to be to get some sort of reaction.

709
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,320
Yeah, well, welcome to America.

710
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:10,900
What?

711
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,320
He said his widow and her pelicans won't send him a single bill he can sign.

712
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,360
And the Democrats aren't much better.

713
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,060
Well, blind leading is stupid.

714
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,480
Doug, do you recall anything about what happened?

715
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,240
Stop reminiscing about the past and concentrate on our glorious future.

716
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,360
Just look at this.

717
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:40,520
With our glorious leader, our new leader, we can all sing songs to the glory of our new leader.

718
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,660
Hillary Clinton.

719
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,520
The elections.

720
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,320
We've been working on this plan since day one.

721
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,940
It has nothing to do with the approval ratings.

722
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,240
But as for the election, whose turn is it to ask today?

723
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,640
Is the president running in 2016?

724
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,600
Today, the priority is good government.

725
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,300
But...

726
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,580
Ask even tomorrow.

727
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,400
Thank you, everyone.

728
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:08,980
If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.

729
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,320
He's not of the temperament of the kind of stable, thoughtful person we need as leader.

730
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,740
You can see how loyal he is.

731
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,320
He was begging for my endorsement.

732
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,500
Donald Trump is a fool.

733
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,240
A fool.

734
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,400
Now, Donald Trump tells us that he is very, very smart.

735
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,620
He is very, very not smart.

736
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,080
Attacking me, as he surely will, won't prove him any less of a fool.

737
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,260
It's entirely in his hands to prove me wrong.

738
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,980
Oh, God.

739
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,660
I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.

740
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,880
He would have dropped to his knees.

741
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,260
Oh, God.

742
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,620
Oh!

743
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,500
Well, let's hear it.

744
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,400
Big Don.

745
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,140
Don't worry about it, little Mario.

746
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,280
Yeah, welcome to America.

747
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:55,940
What?

748
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,520
What?

749
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,160
Uh-oh.

750
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,280
Claudia and Buddy are upset about something.

751
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,100
I bet it's Mom coming home.

752
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,800
I bet that's what it is.

753
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:11,660
Princess Wee said, if I come, if you guys are still doing show when I come home, I'll drop in and join you.

754
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,020
So I've got her microphone set up and her little chair.

755
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah, we better drop her in.

756
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,900
Yeah, but it's going to take her a while.

757
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,780
She went to the Gypsy Market in the little convention center downtown.

758
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:24,900
Oh, I bet there are no gypsies there.

759
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,360
And when I say downtown, I'm talking about a town square.

760
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,200
And when I say convention center, it's a couple of really big rooms.

761
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,720
There's enough room for horses to buck and do rodeo in beneath.

762
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,940
Get out of here.

763
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,960
It was full of—no, no.

764
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,080
We—Glenrose, Texas has a convention center.

765
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,020
You're actually bringing horses out to dinner with you?

766
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:44,880
Yeah.

767
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,080
Have you ever taken a horse out to your favorite Thai restaurant for a boogie time and a slight marshmallow or two?

768
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:51,880
I haven't.

769
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,400
That's the way it is, sir.

770
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,600
But my brothers and my nephews have.

771
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,300
It's not a Thai restaurant.

772
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,660
My family's better than your family.

773
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,380
It's actually a Chinese restaurant.

774
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,240
We don't have a real Thai restaurant here.

775
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,660
But we do have a real Chinese restaurant in that it's—well, it's a carry—takeout place.

776
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,660
But it's run by people who look like they're probably Chinese.

777
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,940
It could very well be Mr. and Mrs. Hand People.

778
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,340
I mean, Lothar—remember Lothar and the Hand People?

779
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,440
Yes, I do.

780
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,680
I was playing Lothar and the Hand People on this show about five years ago fairly regularly.

781
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,400
And you know who the Hand People are, don't you?

782
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,920
Those are the people who started China.

783
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,320
The Hand People?

784
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,740
Oh, the Han—

785
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:33,940
Han.

786
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,200
No, you're talking about the Han.

787
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,000
H-A-N.

788
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,180
Yeah, H-A-N.

789
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:44,860
No, that's—Lothar was with the Hand People as in Five Fingers and a Thumb.

790
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:44,860


791
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,080
Something like that.

792
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,740
Oh, geez.

793
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,520
Yeah, the Han—

794
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,900
Now I'm going to be fired for sure.

795
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,920
Han are the ethnic majority in China.

796
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,640
Yeah.

797
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,520
When I first got to China, I thought they all looked alike.

798
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:12,660
But then by the time I left, not only did they not all look alike, some of them looked like my uncles, my relatives.

799
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,780
Even though they were Chinese, they still—

800
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,200
It's like, God, that's a Chinese version of my Uncle Pat.

801
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,240
Oh, that's a Chinese version of Curly over there at the dump.

802
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,240
You know?

803
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:31,660
It's like you recognize these facial types even though they were a different, you know, continent—continental appearance-wise.

804
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,360
We're all related and there are just so many genes just enough to fit into our pants.

805
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:44,840
Yeah, I wonder if the listeners can hear when my—the crunching in my back when I realize I've been slumped over in the—

806
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,700
when I sit up straight, it makes this noise.

807
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,700
It's sort of like trying to start up a lawnmower that never quite starts.

808
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,500
Yeah, on my side it sounds like an electronic carpenter or a garpenter, whatever they call it.

809
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,780
A streetcar conductor.

810
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,460
Yeah.

811
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,120
The kind that's got a little cute fish on the spare side.

812
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:07,900
Okay.

813
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,320
Okay.

814
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,600
Yeah, I can hear myself real well.

815
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,800
And actually I can—if—

816
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:14,820
Yeah.

817
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,140
I figure if I can understand what you're saying, anybody can, right?

818
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,640
Wait, the buzz just went away.

819
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,860
The buzz.

820
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,040
Buzz.

821
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,300
Don't—don't—don't—

822
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,140
There it goes.

823
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:26,860
Don't move.

824
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:34,740
Now just take those little wire cutters and clip the red wire—no, the—wait, is it the red or the green?

825
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,520
Or the white wire?

826
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,800
One is going to make us explode like a bowl full of spaghetti.

827
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,340
But let's not do anything because the buzz is gone.

828
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,200
I got it.

829
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,740
The buzz is gone away for good.

830
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:48,460
That's all we care—the harassment from the, you know, the netherworld and the armed factions.

831
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,960
The buzz is gone.

832
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,220
That sounds like a negative thing, you know?

833
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,880
Like you're telling somebody, are you having fun having a buzz?

834
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,120
And their answer is, the buzz is gone.

835
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,580
Buzz killer, man.

836
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,780
Yeah.

837
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,560
Buzz killer, Teed.

838
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:06,920
Dude.

839
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,380
What do they say now, bro?

840
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,140
Have you ever really been one—

841
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,420
Is it bro or—I mean, it hadn't been man.

842
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,140
It's Brell.

843
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,960
It's Jacques Brell.

844
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:13,460
Oh, Brell.

845
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,840
At the art center.

846
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,440
And Woody Guthrie.

847
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:27,060
And Woody Guthrie will be there and the spam units and all those cadets from the old days used to shout out their hallelujahs to Stalin.

848
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,420
Stalin was actually a Georgian, not from the United States, Georgia, but from Georgia near the Soviet Union.

849
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,660
He's not Russian at all.

850
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,940
A lot of people don't like him saying that crazed Russian Stalin.

851
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,880
Well, he'll just shoot you just like everybody else does.

852
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,040
Huh.

853
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,240
Huh.

854
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,720
That'd be like people saying, that crazed Texan, lonesome cowboy Dave.

855
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,560
What a hateful man.

856
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,040
Or that crazed—

857
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,300
The terrible things he did.

858
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,340
Yeah, or that crazed Ohioan, Reverend Ivan Stang.

859
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,480
Well, he's not in that location, but he's still, you know—

860
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:07,700
Well, I was in Ohio for 20 years, so I kind of was in a—I mean, I'm a former half-Ohioan, you know.

861
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:08,680
Yeah.

862
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,440
Something like that.

863
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,180
It may sound like it was prison.

864
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:16,840
He did five to 20 in the Ohio State Maximum Reformatory.

865
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,020
Round on the ends, high in the middle, Ohio.

866
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,000
Ohio.

867
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,940
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.

868
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,840
I tell you that.

869
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,020
Obama is going to be out playing golf.

870
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,540
He might even be on one of my courses.

871
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,400
I would invite him.

872
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,540
I actually would say, I'm not saying they're stupid.

873
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,860
I like China.

874
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,080
I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.

875
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,020
Am I supposed to dislike them?

876
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,000
But we don't know, because we have no protection.

877
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:59,300
Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East.

878
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,660
They've become rich.

879
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm in competition with them.

880
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,020
They just built a hotel in Syria.

881
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,960
Can you believe this?

882
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,400
We have losers.

883
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,480
We have losers.

884
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,140
We have people that don't have it.

885
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,220
We have people that are morally corrupt.

886
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,460
I'm really rich.

887
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,500
I'll show you that in a second.

888
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,200
I have a net worth.

889
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,000
I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what?

890
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,640
I don't have to brag.

891
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,280
I don't have to.

892
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:25,980
Believe it or not.

893
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,580
I think I am a nice person.

894
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,940
People that know me like me.

895
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,400
Yeah, that's just like, you know, the good, the bad, and the ugly, or for a fistful of

896
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,380
donuts and stuff like that, because when you get Wallace Beery saying, or, you know, you're

897
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:45,200
like Eli Wallach saying, I like big men, but they make a lot of noise when they fall

898
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,140
down, that means you can, it's easier to beat up large people if you're small.

899
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,360
Yeah, if only.

900
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:51,860
Did you know that?

901
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,560
If only.

902
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,760
If only.

903
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,760
No, the only, if you're small, take my word for it, what you do is you act like you're

904
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:06,100
completely insane and don't care what's going to happen to you, and then they back off.

905
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,360
That's like, then you're not reacting the way they expect you to.

906
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:10,360


907
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:16,880
Right, like make licky licks at the church, in the church bus, make licky licks.

908
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,900
You basically bug your eyes and say, kill me, go ahead, kill me.

909
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,980
I want to kill.

910
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,960
You puff up like a toady frog, and push all your spikes out.

911
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:37,540
People who've seen me get mad say that I kind of turn a glow with a red evil glow that's,

912
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,480
and my eyes get weird.

913
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,820
Inhuman, frightening.

914
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:50,260
That's like, good, that's exactly what keeps me from getting my butt kicked by larger people.

915
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:59,500
That's, the mask of insanity is the only way to get by in the normal world, really, among

916
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,180
the normals.

917
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:05,680
Yep, and if you have the mask of insanity, you might as well have the whole mascot and

918
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,460
take it along to Republican parties and birthday events and, you know.

919
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,320
And Yom Kippur and Sweet Sally Brown and all kinds of things.

920
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,240
And that mascot is none other than J.R. Bob Dobbs.

921
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:21,980
Hey Dave, there's a real life thing happening in Church of the Subgenius that's very exciting,

922
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,560
and I'm excited about it.

923
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:31,940
In Pasadena, every year, there's something called the Doo Dah Parade, and it's insane.

924
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:39,440
And this year, our good friend, Hel Swami Satellite Weavers, one of the co-sub-sub-families,

925
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:48,220
the founders of the church, the guy that did our best artwork, just about, he has organized

926
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,700
a subgenius parade in the Doo Dah Parade.

927
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:57,280
And there's going to be as many people as you can get, I'm guessing maybe 20 will show

928
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:06,460
up, that will all be wearing business suits and plastic Bob masks made from the Hel Swami's

929
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,580
fabulous bust of Bob.

930
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,720
That we have turned into custom masks in some cases.

931
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:19,140
But he's mass produced them and hand painted them and there will be people carrying a big

932
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:27,020
time control banner or a big prop with a huge dagger going through an hourglass with the

933
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,860
phrase time control on it.

934
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,380
And banners that say things like too much is always better than not enough, relax in

935
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,780
the safety of your own delusions, that kind of thing.

936
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,500
Any girls in ministry?

937
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:46,080
No, if I know, it's a subgenius parade so there will probably be three girls in miniskirts

938
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,760
and a bunch of sausages.

939
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,600
A bunch of boys with glasses.

940
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:52,720
Yeah.

941
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,100
You know, old, and some of them really old.

942
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,440
But some really young.

943
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,940
But there probably would be, I'm thinking if you're given 20 subgeniuses, there will

944
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,500
be three really hot young ladies that are so cool.

945
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,120
And intelligent.

946
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,740
That you can't believe, why are they even here?

947
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,120
And then you find out why they're insane.

948
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,140
It's like, oh, that's what makes them a subgenius.

949
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,200
Even though they're cute and intelligent, their insanity makes them a child of Bob.

950
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,700
So, you do have a chance.

951
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,540
They've already had little deals with family services going.

952
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,480
The program has been banned from the air.

953
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:37,480


954
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:37,480


955
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:37,480


956
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,420
You know that too.

957
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,120
I know, but it's too vital for the radio.

958
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:56,300
Not only was the ban on the program overruled, now I don't understand anything.

959
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,640
You're a mean one, Mr. Trump.

960
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,500
You really are a heel.

961
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:13,700
You're as racist as a Klansman dipped in dumb misguided zeal, Mr. Trump.

962
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:20,500
You're a rotten orange with alarmingly fascist ideas.

963
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,520
You're a monster, Mr. Trump.

964
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,500
You say Muslims are uncontrolled.

965
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,340
Claim they cheered on 9-11.

966
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,180
Now you want to ban them all, Donald Trump.

967
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,500
I wouldn't touch you, despite your 39.5% lead in the polls.

968
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,880
You hate Mexicans, Mr. Trump.

969
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,500
Say Latinos steal and rape.

970
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,300
You want to build a wall and make Hispanics pay it all.

971
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:06,480
You want to build a wall and make Hispanics pay it all.

972
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:06,480


973
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:06,920
笑

974
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:06,920


975
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:06,920


976
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:06,920


977
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,880
Ministry, Gold.

978
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:10,960
Ambassador.

979
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:20,100
2010 State of the world tomorrow, Gold Taste Bank.

980
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,160
West Coast.

981
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,480
Zilla.

982
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:47,460
You're a cow, a sexist stooge, mocking disabled reporters, calling women ugly too, Donald Trump.

983
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:55,140
The three words that best describe your lack of political experience are as follows, and I quote,

984
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:58,300
Killed, killed, killed.

985
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:07,160
You're a mean one, Mr. Trump. This campaign you have derailed.

986
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:14,020
You're an electoral fungus topped with cotton candy hair, Mr. Trump.

987
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:22,360
Your candidacy is an appalling dump heap, overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable.

988
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,520
And you probably disapprove of this song because it's about Christmas, but it's not religious enough, even though you don't really care.

989
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,020
Jesus!

990
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:28,280
Fuck!

991
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:28,640
Fucking Christ!

992
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,100
A seasick crocodile.

993
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,880
Dave, you're going to have to talk up.

994
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,020
I'm going to have to talk up more than this right now.

995
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,260
Well, because you were kind of backing off and the buzz was getting louder than you.

996
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,380
It was killing my buzz, man.

997
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,920
How about right now?

998
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,860
That's funny, just when I said that, the buzz from my TENS unit stopped.

999
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,280
It actually, something killed me.

1000
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:58,620
I'm going to have to go to my book.

1001
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,640
Princess Wee's come.

1002
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,180
Princess Wee bought a metal dinosaur.

1003
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,620
Oh, my God.

1004
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,800
We don't have any money for metal dinosaurs.

1005
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,780
You must have gotten a really good deal for that.

1006
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:13,520
It's a handmade dinosaur triceratops made out of scrap metal.

1007
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:13,900
Yeah.

1008
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,080
Oh, here, here.

1009
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,620
Okay, you should.

1010
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,400
Oh, my, my, my.

1011
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,000
There's your headphone.

1012
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,220
It's down, down there.

1013
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,820
I thought that was my headphone, but my headphone's on my head.

1014
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,280


1015
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,880
Reverend Stang's a little confused right now.

1016
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,300
It's okay.

1017
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:31,960
It'll be all right.

1018
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,240
Yeah.

1019
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,300
Can you hear Dave's buzz?

1020
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,120
Now, can you hear me buzzing on the phone?

1021
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,720
We need to know from...

1022
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,180
I can hear his buzz.

1023
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:38,680
Yeah.

1024
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,280
You can hear my buzz.

1025
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,360
He has a slight buzz.

1026
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:42,960
Yeah, it's not too bad.

1027
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,200
No, it's just a slight buzz.

1028
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,680
It sounds horrible over here.

1029
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,000
It just makes me want to throw up in my face.

1030
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,660
It makes me want to kick some pickles and titties and argue with everything in my sights.

1031
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,880
No, Dave, that's really difficult to throw up in your own face.

1032
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:58,860
My phone's...

1033
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,060
Subgenius can do it.

1034
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,320
Yeah, so...

1035
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,040
You can't throw up in your own face.

1036
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,420
But, yeah, you can.

1037
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,500
You sure as hell can.

1038
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,740
I've done it.

1039
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,520
Oh, my God.

1040
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,260
My electrodes are all...

1041
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,640
Oh, they were...

1042
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,560
What?

1043
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,220
They were stuck to my underpants.

1044
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,700
What's that, Robo-Man?

1045
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,480
I have electrodes on, Princess.

1046
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,180
Your underpants are in perfunctory mode right now.

1047
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:21,180
You're going to have to do something about that before your underpants explode.

1048
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,600
Do you know what I'm saying?

1049
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,740
Oh, I...

1050
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,220
Don't make promises you can't...

1051
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,540
What's your deal, Robo-Stang?

1052
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,500
I'm not Robo-Stang.

1053
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,680
I'm the real Stang.

1054
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,220
Oh, okay.

1055
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,360
You can tell the difference.

1056
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,920
Robo-Stang always sits up straight.

1057
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,560
But you have electrodes connected to you.

1058
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:38,900
Right.

1059
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,140
That's to remind me to sit up straight.

1060
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:41,620
I see.

1061
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,920
You got telephone poles hanging out of your neck like Frankenstein.

1062
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,100
No, that's to keep my back straight.

1063
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:50,120
The telephone pole in my pants.

1064
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,620
The back of my pants.

1065
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,140
It's like my neck and my chest are strapped to this pole.

1066
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,520
So it keeps my back straight.

1067
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,240
Well, what about this?

1068
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,240
It's a physical therapy move.

1069
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,060
I don't have to use a telephone pole.

1070
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,860
I suppose you could use a popsicle stick.

1071
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,640
I didn't have a popsicle stick.

1072
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,500
How about a yardstick?

1073
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,800
I didn't have one.

1074
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,800
I had a telephone pole.

1075
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,240
Oh, okay.

1076
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,140
The family pile of useless giant poles out in the back 40.

1077
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:18,320
Right.

1078
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:18,320


1079
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:18,820
I know that one.

1080
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,280
Yeah.

1081
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,180
You got a bunch of useless poles.

1082
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,120
There's no such thing as a useless pole.

1083
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,560
Just ask anybody who knows, man.

1084
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,520
It's a useless pole.

1085
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:27,520


1086
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:27,520


1087
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:27,520


1088
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:27,520


1089
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:27,520


1090
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:27,520


1091
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:27,520


1092
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:27,520


1093
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,000
You can get a lot out of you if you can figure it out.

1094
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,840
We should ask, we'll ask Mr. Sister.

1095
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,520
He knows a lot about poles.

1096
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,840
If they have creosote in them.

1097
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,240
If they have creosote in them.

1098
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:38,240


1099
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,160
Well, he's actually a lower Slobovian.

1100
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:47,680
They don't consider themselves poles exactly, but everybody else does.

1101
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,400
I only know one Polish swear word.

1102
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,200
Kurwa means like damn.

1103
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,000
Kurwa.

1104
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,200
Kurwa.

1105
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:55,840
Kurwa.

1106
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,760
It's a boobie, you know.

1107
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:02,100
That's what you say when you slam your foot in a tricycle, you know.

1108
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:02,700
Kurwa.

1109
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:03,680
Kurwa.

1110
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,200
In Texan, that's Kyurwa.

1111
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:07,960
Kyurwa.

1112
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:08,700
Kyurwa.

1113
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,200
Kurwa.

1114
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,400
Kurwa ye, partner.

1115
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:18,000
A Polish subgenius told me that once and I believed him forever, but I haven't seen

1116
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,260
him in 22 years, so he could've lied and just ... Well, I know better than that.

1117
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,320
It's a true thing.

1118
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,060
It's real.

1119
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:30,840
real. It's heartwarming. It's a little bit heartbreaking. It's hard for us to figure

1120
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,100
out. It makes me fidgety.

1121
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,580
Life is just an endless puzzle.

1122
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,780
It's not just a bunch of constructed fidgets.

1123
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:42,500
A conundrum.

1124
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:48,500
A spaghetti bowl of mottled up cords that you have to somehow try to straighten out

1125
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:55,220
and untangle. Or not. You could just leave it the way it is and deal with it.

1126
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,400
That's what most people do.

1127
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,520
But when you untangle them, then you find all these wonderful cords.

1128
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,240
You wouldn't believe some of the stuff I found when I started untangling in the back room

1129
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,320
there, Princess Wee.

1130
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,360
I'm afraid to find out.

1131
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,180
Well, you were gone at the gypsy market.

1132
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,540
Oh, I was really afraid.

1133
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,240
I got to cleaning up in the utility room.

1134
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:13,880
Very afraid.

1135
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:19,540
You'll see. There's some real surprises back there and some real mysteries.

1136
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:25,720
And those mysteries will have to wait until next week to be revealed, friends.

1137
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:31,540
That conversation continued for another 30 minutes, but I decided to break it up with

1138
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:36,700
the Trumpty Tumpty stuff, which I pulled mostly from a puzzling evidence episode.

1139
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,620
Although that 2016 song, You're a Mean One, Mr.

1140
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:46,900
Trump, was from the College Humor YouTube channel.

1141
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:55,140
And you too can see subgenius videos on the YouTube channel called Revstag.

1142
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,960
All one word and lowercase.

1143
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,900
R-E-V-S-T-A-N-G.

1144
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:00,680
Revstag.

1145
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,320
On YouTube.

1146
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:09,460
However, that also includes my home movies, which are mostly nature studies of tiny monsters

1147
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,700
that actually exist.

1148
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,260
But there's also a ton of subgenius stuff, especially from the olden days.

1149
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:23,460
This radio show is the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius, and you can find

1150
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,040
past episodes and tracks.

1151
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:26,040


1152
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:34,720
Transcripts and logs, and a link to the GoFundMe page to learn more about old, nearly indigent,

1153
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,400
lonesome cowboy day.

1154
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:43,660
And links to the other four subgenius-aligned radio shows that are strewn around the country,

1155
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:49,260
and to broadcast stations that might be in your town with this show.

1156
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,620
That's subgenius.com.

1157
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,740
But you have to click on the radio.

1158
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,940
Pull down at the top right.

1159
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:05,300
And remember, the Slack Friday two-for-one ordainment kit event runs from Thanksgiving

1160
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,020
to Existlessness Month.

1161
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:13,820
Yet another chance to do the righteous thing and get a killer deal at the same time.

1162
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:20,560
And now, from our friends the Psychoskeletons, an apology.

1163
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:45,440
A few weeks into this podcast, this show won two supply sets.

1164
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:45,440


1165
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:45,500
birhe and end the title of the show.

1166
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:45,500


1167
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:45,520
parents with no parent support, at least live until Manager's hour.

1168
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:45,520


1169
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,720
If you're living below Normal Yard at the rate of 50%이는 electricity.

1170
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:46,880
Meta is your first really important person at all times over compartir our FUN Κ

1171
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,040

1172
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:03,380
Thank you.

1173
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,880
Thank you.

1174
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,340
Thank you.

1175
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,800
Thank you.

1176
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,180
Thank you.

1177
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:26,800
Thank you.

1178
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,860
Thank you.

1179
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:26,360
Thank you.

1180
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,920
Thank you.

1181
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,560
Thank you.

1182
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:56,560
Thank you.

1183
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,020
Thank you.

1184
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,540
Thank you.

1185
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,280
Thank you.

1186
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,260
Thank you.

1187
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,080
And that's what you do.

1188
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,320
Yeah.

1189
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:25,940
Really nice.

1190
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:26,020


1191
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,340
I did try and fuck her.

1192
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:21,900
She was married.

1193
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,320
I moved on her like a bitch.

1194
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,100
And that's part of the game.

1195
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:26,540
Yeah.

1196
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:41,100
And that's part of the game.

1197
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,060
And that's part of the game.

1198
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,300
You guys didn't do the跳ing.
