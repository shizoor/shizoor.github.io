Bob won't solve your problems, but he will help you to blow them off!
You can't use Bob as a crutch, because he's already using you as a crutch, my friend.
This is the end of the world.
Two Bloody Marys, Deke.
What are you going to do? What is it you want of me?
I am going to remove your soul, your mind if you prefer, from your body for a time.
You mean my brain? You're going to take my brain away from me?
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.
Oh no, why don't you kill me?
Yes, presents this program.
The star of Heroes, Bob.
The face is finished.
Failure!
The face is familiar.
Made a different way.
Gosh!
Tonight, Bob, Bob, Bob.
Of course, Bob Zero is a smash in our family. What's new with the show?
We're all making a little bit of money.
And also, it's been nominated for an Emmy.
Oh.
And so is Bob.
Jack, uh, Bob will vote for you.
Bob's out.
Alright, fingers on the buzzer, get ready.
Bob. Ready.
Bob.
Horse.
Horse. Bob.
There it is. There it is.
Bob.
It's me.
It's not me at all, alright.
Well, Bob, I want to tell you something. That is not the face of Bob.
Horizon. Horizon. Horizon. Horizon.
Bob. Right. Right. Right. Right.
My stomach feels awful.

And acid. And acid.
Quick as a wind, you're in the pink.
Bob. Bob.
Bob. Back to you, Bob. This hand's on the buzzer.
Bob. Bob.
Bob. Bob.
Uh, Bob.
Bob. Bob. You did ride a mule there, Bob.
Bob. Right, Bob.
Alright, Bob. You were very good, Bob.
Except a bug.
Bob, we're looking for the $500.
Bob knows, Bob. You were very good, Bob.
Try Clark. Try Clark. Taste me. Do you love it?
Bob. Bob.
Come to where the flea is.
Come. Come.
Well, I don't know. Bob, you did quite well.
This has been a Bob production. Stay tuned.
A lot more slack.
More slack.
More slack.
Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut.
Wow.
Uh.
Eh.
Hey, didn't I bump into you at the grocery store?
Why did you follow me home to rape me?
Slack. It'll get you higher than any drug.
And it's better than any beverage.
I know that it's better than any other drug.
You know, the conspiracy will stop at nothing.
Stop the message of Bob.
And they work these, uh, time delay recording problems into recording software.
Telephones. Everything.
And it's cued to go into effect as soon as you start talking about Bob, slack, and the conspiracy.
Mechanics.
I don't know if it's one of the mechanics.
I don't know if it's one of the mechanics.
I don't know if it's one of the mechanics.
I don't know if it's one of the mechanics.
The mechanic in this little galaxy.
He wanted to keep off.
That's right.
He could, uh, take a spaceship and strip it down to the hell and parts within 27 milliseconds.
That's right.
And you couldn't tell what he was doing either.
It was either there or it wasn't there.
And that's something I just don't understand.
How could it either be there or not be there?
Why isn't there any...
Well, that's what we call escaping from those two toning laws.
Bob?
That's your key phrase.
Hi there. Welcome to episode four of Right Where You're Sitting Now.
I'm your host, Ken Eakins, and with me...
Paul Baniker.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Yeah, we're gonna need Bob's help, I think, for the sound of this episode.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're gonna do an interview with the one, the only, Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.
And, uh, this interview's gonna be, uh, a little bit less, I guess, serious than the last ones, but it's gonna be funny.
It'll be funny, yeah.
It is.
He's a funny guy.
And, uh, yeah.
To sell a religion, you don't need all the answers, my friends.
You only need one good answer, and that answer is Bob.
Bob is the answer that did not wait around for a question.
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
That's more like it. That's what I like to hear.
The key to the gateway is his pipe, as it says in God Ecclesians 3.14.
Bob is our self-fulfilling prophet.
And strange and wondrous things happened when you were around Bob.
The blind hear.
The deaf see.
False teeth get swallowed.
Uh, poor families.
Suddenly win the lottery.
And your enemies laugh themselves to death.
Praise Bob!
Praise that man, Bob.
Strange Rube Goldberg-type machinery will spring up around him, uh, for instance when he needs a shoe shine or something.
But the thing is, Bob does not plan anything.
He just automatically tunes in to the plan that's already there.
He doesn't think.
He merely knows.
But continuously forgets it.
He only sells and never buys.
He is an economic monopole.
A singularity that could power a whole universe.
But Bob himself doesn't do anything.
The universe does it for him.
Or it does him.
Or he does the wrong thing, but perfectly.
But that's none of the wiser things.
ár
that's
only
the beginning, folks.
Only the beginning.
Because next we have
The old maestro
And all the toys
So help me
Ha ha
I love you Bob Bob
I love you Bob Bob
My poor heart's in a real wing ding
What about Bob?
But Bob, what about Bob?
I love you Bob
I love you Bob
Bob
You build me up
By your love
My heart is singing
Here's what it's singing
I love you Bob
We can begin with revival friends
Roll up your sleeves
Bend over, pull out your wallets
Close your eyes
Cause here comes the word of Bob
Now can I get a praise Bob?
Praise Bob
Oh yes I'd love to hear that
That conformity of nonconformists
Isn't it beautiful?
But really, you know, the only thing
Each subgenius has in common
Is that they have nothing in common
With the conspiracy of the normal people
Which we will be getting to
In fact, I don't think we can get out of it
You make me so sick
Boing dad
Goomba
What have you been up to lately?
The Nekonomicon
Your daddy's dead
Wearing the recording studio next month
To officially record Gilmore
You make me so sick
No doubt
Kill Bob
To Bob people like you Bob
Where do you want me to come?
Like a dead animal on the side of the road
I destroyed a couple of them here
Kill Bob
I loved it, you know
Are you there?
You never know Bob
I love you and care about you
Kill Bob
Kill Bob
Like a dead animal on the side of the road
Kill Bob
Like a dead animal on the side of the road
Big deal, so what?
You've got me?
You've got me?
Kill Bob
You sound like you've been using an Halex 2
Kill Bob
With maggots creeping out of my mouth
Boombayah
Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth
Hi all
Yeah
Just wanted to talk about the, uh, church of the subgenius
Uh, Bob Dobbs
I don't know whether any of you have heard of, um, Bob Dobbs before
Church of the subgenius
If not, I've put a link, yeah, over there for you

Um, just click it, you'll see the video
Which I think is really, really funny
It's one of the best videos I've ever seen, actually
I really like it
It appeals to my comedy side
But yeah, I've been into Bob Dobbs for ages
Um, since, uh, the, uh, eighties
Uh, when I was a wee little young, like
And, uh, at the same time I was into the, uh, Screaming Lord Such
Monster Raving Loony Party
Thing
I mean, a lot of kids were
Well, obviously, you know, we were like kiddish, cartoonish sort of things
So, it appealed to us
Uh, but I think the overall message was that no matter how old your body gets
Your mind can still remain fresh
Yeah
And, um, and Bob Dobbs with his subgenius sort of thing
Which would explain, right, in the world of the subgenius, guys
I'm a sub-puncher
I'm a pop idol
Anyway, this has been the Thomas Special Television News Report
Um, about the, uh, Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius
Um, so, I'll see you, hopefully, soon
Tonight, hopefully
Uh, livevideo.com
Live show tonight at midnight and every Saturday night
So, um, links on the side, guys
Links on the side
Okay
That's been me
Uh, check out, check it out, guys
It is interesting
But it's funny, to say the least
Anyway
I'll see you in a while
Well, that one was, uh, out of the blue, huh?
I found that clip on YouTube
And it is indeed from something called The Thomas Show
Those British subgeniuses are so polite
And for this hour of Slack number 1184
We're starting to use clips from another British show
The excellent podcast called Right Where You Are Sitting Now
Of which you can find all episodes at sittingnow.co.uk
Including interviews with R.U. Sirius and Douglas Rushkoff
And we also have lots of new Norelpref collages of norelpref.com
As well as the beloved Fernanda Nandy-Lemurs
And we have some choice clips of Dr. Hal Philo
And puzzling evidence from the KPFA Berkeley sub show
As well as recordings from this year's DeVivals at Starwood Festival and in Baltimore
Actually, I'm holding off on some of the excellent Baltimore rants
Because I'm hoping to get a better recording than what I have so far
Next up is a clip from Starwood
In which I explain what I really don't believe
But first, one thing I insist upon
It's not the subgeniuses
It is mankind, rather
Who insists upon making it difficult for life to exist upon this planet
Now if it were not for birds
Mrs. Barnaby, you don't seem to understand
You don't, now friends, you won't see me dancing around the fire naked
For several reasons
But one of which is that I actually personally don't believe in most of this crap
But last year I remember a friend, Reverend Mowgli said
Reverend Stang, do you really believe in magic?
And I said no
But I was speaking too soon
Because actually I believe in Bob's five keys to magic
The first of which is get off your ass
And that key leads to magical things happening
But even the second key is to bust your ass
But you don't do that for long before you get to the third key
Which is make others bust their ass for you
The fourth one was wash your ass
And the fifth one is of course the most important
Wash your ass
And those are the five keys to magic
Otherwise I don't believe in much
I believe in me, Yoko and me
But as my friend Nuneslow said
Friends, disbelief is a belief too
So you can't get away from it
It seems to go with being a primate
And despite the fact that I'm basically a subgenius, secular, humanist, common scientist
Yet I help run registration here at Starwood
And I bust my ass on that
Because I don't practice what I preach
Because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to
That's what Bob said
You know an atheist
Well, there are many atheists
And they are writing
We have many emotions
The end of faith
The God delusion
God, the failed hypothesis
How science shows that God does not exist
If there's no God there's nothing to say about him
He's good, he's bad, he's indifferent
The God of the Old Testament is the most unpleasant character in all of fiction
He is jealous and proud of it
He's petty and vindictive
He's unjust, he's unforgiving
He's a racist
Moses is like Hitler
And so forth
This is what's true
What a story
Anyway
I was just looking at your Wikipedia page
For subgenius
And it says here that
The subgenia are not humans
But they're actually mutant offspring of forbidden sexual union
That took place millions of years ago
Is this correct?
Right
The aliens that we're concerned with
From planet X
Came to Earth
Just before the end of the age of dinosaurs
Created the Yetis in a test tube
And then the Yetis created humans
To be beasts of burden
Or lab rats
The tragedy is that
The dinosaurs were wiped out
Because of an excess picnic
And the humans escaped from that
And the Yetis' labs
And started interbreeding with
Some of the
Feeble-minded among the Yeti
And thus we see the human race today
A hodgepodge
A mishmash
That's mostly purebred human
I.e. lab rat
Or the partial Yeti genetics
And that's
Those are the weirdos
And misfits
And malformed humans
And criminals
That compose the Church of the Subgenius
And we're always looking for new ones
I hardly think that either species
Would have sufficient intelligence
To launch a mass attack
Their brainpans are not big enough
I just came from the school, madam
I don't know anything about their brainpans
But I do

His body turns into pants.
His body turns into, it morphs into pants.
It morphs into pants, and then it morphs back into monster feet.
Into body, yeah, body feet.
Yeah, that's really something.
And the pants look like they're sort of purple, and they're torn in the same spot.
Yeah, they look sort of durable, you know, work pants.
Canvas.
But the pants are part of the monster.
Obviously something he purchased through an internet mail order company.
I think they didn't quite know what they were doing when they made that monster, but that's added to it.
That strange, enigmatic nature.
The way the pants morph in and out of the body.
You know, I don't want to complain.
Or maybe it's the body morphing in and out of the pants.
It could be that the pants actually control the air.
I have that chair once.
I don't remember what that was like.
Only when it reaches the bottom.
Oh, no.
Once you reach the ground, for the most part, it stops moving.
Now, some people have actually moved toward the bottom.
My descent has been temporarily interrupted.
You realize you're telling me?
You're telling the truth.

So, file after file was brought in.
Now we don't care about the paperwork, but you must go to the shared drive and open the spreadsheet

A shiftless bum.
You got Hiram?
I'll do that.
Yeah, he, he, uh, he was.
Now what if you were a bum, but you were shifty?
He was often hired, as his name suggests, for random tasks in the shadow of the mighty armies.
Imagine.
Imagine a team made up of shiftless men and shifty men.
Well, they all wore shifts in those days, but.
Some were unable to shift while others could not stop shifting.
Some had to shift for themselves while others were unable even to paddle their own canoe.
But some men.
But this was a different world.
In their shiftiness.
A world.
Never stopped shifting.
Lit only by fire.
While others could not shift.

Because of the quindi,.

Assh.
The değildior Japanese guy gets

I just want to go back to some of the more technical details of the church, I suppose.
What is a clench?
A clench was a bad idea that Philo and I came up with.
That wasn't Bob's.
The idea was that subgeniuses who all live in the same town could get together and have regular meetings,
and strengthen the church that way.
What we did not take into account is that, by definition,
every subgenius is totally different from every other one.
And I mean really different.
The only thing we have in common is that we have nothing at all in common with the conspiracy of the normal people.
So what has happened over and over again is these subgeniuses get together and meet,
and within three or four meetings, they absolutely hate each other.
And it has even come to violence a few times.
So I wish we could remove that section out of the book of the subgenius.
That was a money-making scheme that was purely something that Philo and I came up with.
It wasn't doctrinal to Bob.
And I wish I could take it back.
Most subgeniuses work better as what you might call a solo clench.
And our political stance works the same way.
Okay.
We don't recognize the false divisions of liberal and conservative and so forth anymore.
Our political party is called patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism,
which can be summed up with the phrase,
every yard a kingdom.
Yeah.
Or a queendom.
Although usually it's the checkbooks that are the queendom.
Yeah.
In many families.
And in other...
In other words, it's a I don't care, you don't care philosophy.
As long as...
Our neighbors can do any stupid thing they want as long as they stay out of our hair.
Yeah.
Now, that's a simple way of government.
And we would...
It may be primitive, but it's fair for the strong.
So we want someday for Bob to be made world overlord.
But if Bob is everything he says,
he is...
He might already be world overlord.
We just don't know it.
So it's possible that Bob may actually be the conspiracy himself.
I'd hate to think that.
What a terrible thought.
No, no.
We don't really send all the addresses of our new members to the Homeland Security or the Illuminati.
No.
For less than top dollar.
If we sell you out, it's going to be for a lot.
A lot of money.
Let's put it that way.
Yeah.
But really, it's kind of like this is the church of the lone nuts.
You know, this is the church of all the Lee Harvey Oswalds.
So, you know, it behooves us to watch each other's backs, I suppose.
Yeah.
It's weird, man.
It's just weird thinking about it.
It's less like when you're walking on the misty moors at night under a full moon and you hear the distant howls of a...
Weird.
It's weird.
What's that?
What's that?
Maybe he's on your trail.
Maybe he's coming closer and closer, ready to sink his slavering fangs in your delicate neck.
What's that thing?
And drink your rich red blood.
As he cares, you're a broke, black jaw.
And then, to add insult to injury, he lifts his leg and marks his territory.
Boy, I really wouldn't want to be you, you know what I mean?
I mean, I'll get in the shot.
It sucks being you, dude.
I'm not a bad guy.



Chewed by a werewolf.
There's a sign you can hold that says, it sucks being me.
And here's a cup you can beg for money.
He, being chewed by a werewolf, is perceived as a loser by many in many different walks of life.
Yes.
But they might not realize.
Yes.
The hypercritical individual.
That they themselves could just as easily become the victims of a tiny, rabid vampire bat.
It creeps into your house by night, and while you're asleep, it crawls up to you and crawls on you, sucks your blood, and gives rabies to you.
Next week, the five-hour show, or the week after that?
You might not even know you had been bitten.
The week after that.
Oh, good.
Because next week, we've got to have one more.
And we promise you something that the other religions hardly ever mention.
Or if they do, they try to put a little box around it and specify what it is.
We promise you slack.
Now, sometimes I'll be, the reverend's staying.
I sent him my $30.
I was ordained as a minister, and I performed marriages and did all that, and made fun of my Baptist neighbors and had a lot of fun.
But I don't have any slack.
Where's the slack?
Friends.
You already have slack.
The greatest slogan of the church is, the subgenius must have slack.
Now, Bob didn't say you must get slack.
It means you have to have it to begin with in the first place to be a subgenius.
And the subgeniuses are the ones who are, no, they're not getting what they're due.
Somebody else has taken away your slack, and that's the conspiracy.
And the conspiracy is anybody you don't like.
And slack is anything you really, really don't like.
And slack is anything you really wanted to do.
For some people, it's working.
For the really lucky, lucky OCD folks like myself, some of us, slack is frantically working at the thing we want to work at.
They'll do it without pay.
As I did for a long, long time.
As Onan said, slack can come when you throw good money after bad and bad after bad.


It's that simple, isn't it?
Money, you know, that's just holding you down.
That's the conspiracy's handcuff.
Those fancy golden wrist, expensive wristwatches are handcuffs.
And that money is like a ball and chain.
And I will risk repeating myself and saying, yes, we can, you know, if you want to turn in your balls and chains and handcuffs, we'll see that you are saved from them.
We'll put them in the right hands.
Onan said, slack.
Slack is the oomph in comfortable.
And friends, magic, well, magic without a K.
Magic is a foot.
And slack is a shoe.
Isn't that, you can sort of think about that like tonight.
And if any of you can make sense of it, please explain it to me.
Well, maybe we're all getting a little carried away by this.
One caller.
Well, turn that caller to the cold and damp.
Hello?
Hello, caller.
Is this the show?
Yellow.
It is the show, yes.
I have a question for you.
How did you get to be so smart?
Well, when I, when you gather thistles or nettles, you must expect prickles.
And so, when I did, my hands began to tremble.
I was so smart.
Anyway, good luck on your honeymoon.
And I hope you'll consider attending the all-new, completely revised Ask Dr. Hal show beginning on the 29th of October at the Chez Poulet Gallery in San Francisco.
And continuing on into the indefinite future with no sign of cessation or any expectation of an end.
Hi, it's Dr. Hal.
Yes?
Dr. Hal, trust me, quick mind.
From where?
I know where you live.
Stop lying, Dr. Hal.
From where, did you say?
From some outlying, outlying what?
There's just a way of explaining.
Outlying province?
Well, it does sound outlandish.
But though you may be a backwoodsman geographically, there is no reason to be one mentally.
Study the basic subgenius premises and always use them.
Rely upon them in every circumstance.
Uh-huh.
And then perhaps you can avoid the gulping doom or the snatching claws of the stark fist of removal.
Okay, I'll take your advice, Dr. Hal.
You're welcome, my boy.
I'll put that good advice to work immediately.
Well, that's a good thing.
I'll deploy those concepts into a micro-extension.
You see our echoes roll from soul to soul and grow forever and forever.
And from room to room.
And from ancient to cold.
They do not die out, but rather expand to fill the universe.
They can keep going right on.
A Quincy Throckmorton production.
But as I say, the conspiracy that we're talking about, the thing that keeps us from slack, the one roadblock to actually meeting Bob and getting your full dose of Bob is, uh, it's not just joining Bob.




It's George Bush and his little HALA buddies.
We're not talking about, I have to read this part because it's new.
Um, we're not talking about the conspiracy that assassinated JFK, then assassinated the assassin of JFK, then assassinated the assassin of the assassin of JFK.
We're not talking about the conspiracy that covers up crashed UFOs, or the conspiracy of the Reptoids in public office, or the conspiracy that keeps electric cards off the road or puts fluoride in the air.

Nor the mail order clipart, internet mind control kook cult conspiracy.
And we're definitely not talking about the conspiracy of conspiracy nuts for whom the real live conspiracy of the 9-11 hijackers wasn't enough of a conspiracy.
We're talking, friends, about the conspiracy of the normal, ordinary, everyday people who do not even know.
And we're not talking about the conspiracy of the real life conspiracy of the 9-11 hijackers wasn't enough of a conspiracy.
Never in our lives do we believe that they're conspiring against the weirdos and slackers and freakazoids and misfits and disbelievers or, my favorite kind, those who will believe anything.
I don't know how to put it...
That's how I started out. I remember my first walk down the occult aisle of the used bookstore.
And I bet a lot of you do too.
I thought, my God, if any of this is for real, it's the most important thing in the world!
And I researched like crazy.
Why could any good occult and false conspiracy be a good one?
paranormal comparative religion nut for ten years and at the end of it I decided
that what I learned was there are a lot of really interesting people out there
I actually became more interested in the believers than in the beliefs because
they all start to merge together as Connie Dobbs the wife of Dobbs said I
like my religion dry with the twist of sarcasm it's the end of the world thus
that the Lord God into the mountains the hills and the rivers and the valleys

When can you take me?
Anytime.
Tonight?
Yes, if you feel up to it.
Well, here he comes now.
I don't care anymore.
But you know, the difference between our cult and almost all the other ones is
we don't know everything, and we don't mind admitting it.
What rulebook, besides Book of the Subgenius,
which has the word humor on the back and the word lies on every page,
what rulebook says we have to know why the universe exists?
Or even if it does,
you know,
those are the...
I think sometimes thinking myself,
oh,
I'm but the poor blinded cyclops stumbling towards what I think might be light.
Like the people in Plato's famous cave watching the flickering of the fire lights,
the shadows,
thinking that's the real world,
which kind of reminds me of the flickering of the TV set.
And I love everybody who...
You know,
people are paranoid about
the loss of privacy,
and there's cameras everywhere,
and there are,
you know,
and every time,
if you do something,
they'll probably have it on tape.
But really,
they don't have to put cameras on the TV
as long as you're watching TV.
Then they know what you're doing.
You're just watching TV.
The conspiracy doesn't have to be,

be smart.
It just lets people build,
as they say,
the prisoners are happiest when they build their own cages.
And turn on any cable or network TV,
and you'll see a beautiful cage built by your purchases and their advertisers.
I download everything from the internet so I don't have to watch the commercials.

Of which we've been playing a lot.
Also heard in there several collages by Norrell Preff,
and some choice puzzling evidence with Dr. Howell of AskDrHowell.com,
Philo Drummond of QuiveringBrain.com,
and puzzling evidence of YouTube's Puzzling Evidence TV.
We also heard some clips from the British podcast
Right Where You Are Sitting Now of SittingNow.co.uk,
Up next, however, is a secret recording of the pirates of Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates,
accusing each other of thievery during the time when Microsoft and Apple first started battling over stuff they'd both ripped off from Xerox.
I, by the way, am a Mac user since 1984.
Maybe a mafia family. You turn your back and you get whacked.
Our guys come back from Japan with this NEC, and it's loaded with Microsoft programs.
Your Microsoft programs.
They're almost identical to ours.
There may be some similarities, Steve.
Similarities.
Similarities.
Try theft.
Steve, all cars have steering wheels, but no one tries to claim that the steering wheel was their invention.
We have a contract. You and I.
Well, you should read it more carefully.
What is this?
This is like doing business with, um, like a praying mantis, huh?
You get seduced and then eaten alive afterwards.
Get real, will you?
You and I are both like guys that have this rich neighbor.
Xerox, that left the door open all the time.
And you go sneaking in to steal the TV set, only when you get there you realize that I got there first.
I got the loot!
Steve, you're yelling?!
that's not fair!
I wanted to try to steal it first!
Child, hey, whatизitgive reason is that you're not with them.

Too late.
We're better than you are.
We have better stuff.
You don't get it, Steve.
That doesn't matter.
Was science to become man's servant or, in the hands of the unscrupulous, his master?
But what is this? Where are we?
We enter the factory!
Hello. Hello. Yes.
I want no master. I don't want a master. I want to be free.
You're mad.
Man is becoming superfluous. This has nothing to do with the soul.
That's what he said.
Nobody can hate man more than man.
Glory to the world! The power of man has fallen!
A new world has arisen!
The world is a new world!
The world is a new world!
The world is a new world!
The world is a new world!
Friends, do you ever worry that you're a brain jackass?
Well, you can quit worrying.
We're all in this together.
God, as Bob said, God forgot to make stupidity painful.
We're here to change that.
We want to think.
Now that involves a certain amount of...
How did Professor Pressure put it?
Deniable plausibility.
If we throw out enough truths that sound like jokes, they won't kill us.
We can always say, well, we were just kidding.
Do you want to know the truth?
We were.
But still, I've been amazed at how many times my buddies and I, under the influence of Bob and sometimes alcohol,
or such like, would come up with something that was so ridiculous, we'd think, man, let's not...
That's just too silly to even publish it.
And then it's in the newspaper the next day!
I'm so jealous of those South Park guys.
We used to sit around making up the same thing they do.
Only what was so funny was the idea of it ever being allowed on television.
Now it makes millions on television.
Praise the South Park guys.
Anyway, one subgenius said,
the church of the subgenius is like a giant inverse push-me-pull-you
with a thousand assholes pointed in different directions and only a vestigial head.
And that's why I like it so much, he said.
Now in the meantime,
while it is
impossible for an individual to defeat the conspiracy of all the billions of normal people,
at the same time it's possible for every weirdo to make his or herself a little bit stronger,
and less dependent on the conspiracy.
And as horrible as this may sound, that may require getting a job and moving out of one's parents' house.
Or something equally radical.
Yeah.
Although what we shoot for, what we really want in our religion, is complete and utter slack.
We figure the world owes us a living.
Yeah.
And so it's okay to, as we say, gob on life and just soak up dull money, I suppose.
The ironic thing is that I just had to pay big taxes.
The church itself had to pay taxes.
Yeah.
Because we're the only religion in the US that openly admits that it's a complete fraud.
Which makes us the only honest religion.
Yeah.
Now is that ironic or what?
But by the same token, since we're not claiming to be saving everybody in the world,
we're considered just a joke company, and so we have to pay taxes like everybody else.
Yeah.
The government subsidizes all the other religions.
At least they do here.
By not taxing them.
And we're the one holdout.
We'll continue to pay our taxes as long as they don't expect us to act nice.
You mean to enslave the world?
Well...
I would never agree to it.
There's a simple answer to that.
There'll be no...
Well...
Are you ready to accept my domination?
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.
Good luck to you and...
God bless you.
You're a genius.
You're a genius.
Come in.
Think you're funny, huh?
Here.
Up until their birth, babies are the ultimate parasite.
Fantastic as it seems, life adapts to many different conditions.
And man has come to rule the Earth not by his strength,
but by a brain capacity that has enabled him to triumph over these powerless elements.
And he's not just a powerful, but slow-witted monsters who have become extinct everywhere,
but in this lost world of Arthur Conan Doyle.
And it makes us wonder, will man too become extinct when he fails to adapt to changing cataclysmic conditions?
.
Someday will a new species from this or another planet dig into the Earth and find the bones of our civilization.
Left as footprints on the sands of time.

Was from the ancient cartoon
Toyland
The music in the background
Is from the flying
Ryan Brothers
CD Totality
You can find that at
Ryanetics.com
Before that
The song from Mothra
Being sung by the
Tiny foot tall twins
From Monster Island
That was something
You are listening to
The Hour of Slack
From the church
Of the subgenius
I'm your host
Reverend Ivan Stang
And you can get all the information
You'd want from
Subgenius.com
We are actually best known
For our books and DVDs
I'm not sure if our radio audience
Is fully aware of that
Anyway
We will let the show
Eventually grind to a halt
With some old puzzling evidence
Some new puzzling evidence
Some cref
And some lemur
And some horror price Bob
Mmhmm
No problem
Nope
Hey you guys are great
What's going on here?
I don't know
Once you're in
You can't get out
I was not having a scary hour
What's all this stuff on the walls?
You have to close those
Now those are theme ideas
What?
We like to tack them up here
And ignore them
How long have they been here?
Two years almost
Yeah some of them
We used one once
What color were they originally?
We used one of those
I don't know






Gray
White
Gray
White
Yeah you couldn't really tell
Green, black
Blue, orange
How did they get that color?
Well somebody came along
And set the outer ones on fire
And they just kind of burned down to the wall
And that caused the symbols
Those are the ones we used right?
Yeah
And did someone draw those
Or did they just
We paid this guy from Calyx
To come over here and think them up
Yeah
Oh would you like to be killed?
Oh yeah
Okay ready?
Another 30 seconds
Here it goes
Oh
A thing called Biblis
They are called Biblis
They are called Biblis
They are called Biblis
They call him Bob
Same damn color
No no
Good morning
Bob
Bob
I'm very disappointed
Yep
Your time is up
It's time for a commercial
Oh okay go ahead do the commercial
Do something commercial
Okay let's go to the commercial now
I mean
I mean nothing
I mean this is the church of the subgenius
You don't really expect nothing from them guys
They ain't got nothing better to talk about than you
And your relationship to the subgenius church
And exactly what's gonna happen to you
When you stand up on that white stripe
And have dobs
Remove your walls
And you can't even see






Your wallet
Yes it's true
You can have your wallet
Personally removed by Bob
Although I would never ever consider it myself
I voluntarily sent mine in years ago
But you unbeliever
Can personally be defiled and demonified
And devalued by dogs
It's true
You think it sounds awful
Well it does sound awful
It sounds terrible
If I die before I wake
I know my wallet he will take
Yes even the smurfs are armed in this sector
Yes we've sold weapons to everybody
And they're ready to use them
On us
Yeah right
So I got scared
Yes little Funto had bitten the head again
And I was climbing under the table
It looks like Funto was loose
And running down the streets of the city
Yes so what
Yes so what
It's the end of the war
Nobody cares anymore
And it's the end of the world coincidentally
And we're all here to celebrate
Throw that guy an orange
As we float up into the upper atmosphere
Tiny little particles
Yes sure is plenty
Comfy too
Time it can't be as difficult as it seems





But I'm not sure what's going to happen
Hey listen don't push me around
This could be your show
It could be anybody's show
I'm not sure what's going to happen
Hey come on get out of the way Paul
I've got a few of these things
I've got a mix of stuff
Oh look out
I must have put the wrong stuff in
This is not show stopper
This is show expander
Quick close the doors
It's going to fill up the station
Quick close all the windows too
Oh look at this stuff

Yeah.
The makers of Ape Nuts bring you the first in this series of guest stars during the vacation of...
Why is here a nerd?
No.
Tonight we present Bob with yours truly.
All right.
I am happy to present to you that hillbilly comedian and musician.
That's Stokowski of the bazooka.
Didn't you ever hear of Annie Laurie?
Certainly I've heard of Annie Laurie.
What's Annie Laurie got to do with this?
Oh, nothing.
I'm just wondering what she's doing tonight.
Well, it looks like there's only one way to get this show started.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present...
No, allow me.
On the contrary, allow me.
Well, come on.
Let's all do it.
Okay.
Right-o.
One, two, three.
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the first citizen of Van Buren, Arkansas, Bob...
I want to thank you boys for that introduction.
You've done a mighty good job there.
But you boys can go now.
Well, don't you want us to stay here with you, Bob?
To help you?
I started out in the East on a program that advertises yeast.
And I worked my way up.
You know, over in the music hall, we have so many of them guest artists over there.
And opera stars and moving picture actors.
That they keep interrupting me all the time.
And I figured it'd be kind of nice to get over on this program where they ain't got no talent at all.
And I figured it'd be kind of nice to get over on this program where they ain't got no talent at all.
Oh, pardon me, Bob.
Boy, I want to tell you, you are a beautiful animal.
Well, thank you, Bob.
Doggone it, there's somebody knocking on the door.
You know, I was kind of in hope we wouldn't get all them rap, rap, rap tonight.
Well, you can't have too many rap, rap, rap, rap.
Well, anywho, Bob, I don't get it.
All right, Bob, I'd like to sing.
I don't get it.
You're just a heartbeat away from the show.
The Wobba Wobba Wob?
Keep her on the line, whatever you do.
You've got to figure out where she's calling from.
There's nothing better than a nice cup of hot coffee.
Don't go in the roof.
With the best coffee beans served up to Copy Bob.
Or Coffee Bob, as some call him because of his predilection for a manly mug.
Don't go in the closet.
Don't go in the basement.
Let's scare Jessica to death.
You know, I can't really get it.
Who slew Auntie Rue?
Whatever happened to Baby Jane?
Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte.
Turn on the radio.
Turn your radio on.
And there'll be music in the air.
But I'm called away on a matter of grave importance.
A secret.
It's the end of the world.
From PR News in Washington, I'm forced to file for bankruptcy protection.
Also over the weekend, President Bush welcomed the President of Ghana to the White House.
President Bush said Ghana has shown that disease can flourish in Africa.
And he said that Ghana has been a strong conflict on the continent.
Ghana.
A new FBI report shows that PR is bad.
Meanwhile, utility companies across Ohio have cancelled PR news.
PR news, Washington.
The jury in the trial of OJ Simpson heard PR news in Washington.
