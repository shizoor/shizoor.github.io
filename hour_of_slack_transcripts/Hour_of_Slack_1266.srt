1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
We're training them.

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:10,160
Yes, we're trying to entrain the Brushwood employees to get used to the fact that subgeniuses are not going to flush the chem toilets.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,980
Which can't be flushed anyway.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:23,140
Incidentally, and this part is serious, please don't throw tin cans or diapers or old Dobbshead t-shirts.

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:32,760
If you suddenly decide you hate the church, don't throw your hat down there in anger because that'll just hurt Mr. Honey Dipper Man's equipment.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,020
And he's the most important fellow out here at Brushwood is the Honey Dipper Man.

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:45,080
It has become more absolute that the wealth of the nation consists in the number of superior men that it harbors.

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,380
That's subgenius Howard S. Slack.

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,260
There we go.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:52,920
Oh, yes.

12
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,220
Yes, dear friends.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,560
At last we are here, settled in our place, ready to begin.

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:11,100
And so we begin the live hour of Slack at 13X Day, broadcast here from Tarzan's radio station.

15
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,640
On the Brushwood stage, near peaceful Sherman, New York.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,720
Peaceful on the surface, but simmering.

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:47,280
And bubbling beneath that placid small town facade is a subculture of crazed methamphetamine gobbling Amish people and rednecks and subgeniuses who would make the movie Blue Velvet look like an Abbott and Costello comedy.

18
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,940
Seeming with envy.

19
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,460
Envy.

20
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,880
Envy for the free-spirited.

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,340
The brushwood attendees.

22
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:01,880
And in their dark and clouded minds, they secretly hatched plots against us.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,820
Intelligence's vast, cool, and very unsympathetic regarded us from...

24
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:17,060
Yes, to whom we are as the animalcules in a drop of water, by comparison, intellectually.

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,700
Speaking of animals in a drop of water, boy, have I got some hot bugs.

26
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,820
Bug porn for everybody.

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:32,940
Ivan Stang has been investigating the micro-world assiduously in the past interval, and has made some new friends.

28
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:44,820
Well, when I found out those dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park movie were computer animated and not real, I gave up on dinosaurs and switched to monsters that I could film myself.

29
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,580
And I'm, uh...

30
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,940
Actually, is Reverend Oroboros here?

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,240
He donated us a wonderful stereo...

32
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,680
...microscope, and I'm hoping that he'll bring something even better this year.

33
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,400
Works a lot better than the Gilbert chemistry set microscope.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,580
I could never tell whether I was seeing my eyelashes with that model.

35
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:12,380
Now, Dr. Dark has a telescope, which he has stashed up the hill, that he can watch the nude bathers with.

36
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,200
From the very small...

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,860
Now, maybe we could just turn that around, and that would be a better microscope.

38
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,000
That would be one amazing.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,620
Well, that's why they built those windows.

40
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,660
They built those windows in the women's shower just before the bank of windows across the street.

41
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,780
They constructed that. It's no architectural anomaly.

42
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,300
I have a videotape of...

43
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,360
We don't need to go into that.

44
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,540
...cohlapses having sex, which is pretty interesting.

45
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,280
You can talk about it.

46
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,200
They're little swimming barrel-shaped things that put themselves...

47
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,980
I can't tell if they're butt-to-butt or mouth-to-butt or...

48
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,620
...but...

49
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,600
...or...

50
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,240
...or mouth-to-mouth.

51
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,840
They look the same. Either end looks the same.

52
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,420
But they join together and then rotate around a common center. It's very beautiful.

53
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,560
Well, you might as well...

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,380
I also have at least ten minutes of a cladocerin or water flea shitting or...

55
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,240
It has diarrhea.

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,160
...performing extra meditation every seven seconds.

57
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,040
Wow.

58
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,020
I thought that was normal until I realized that even parasites have parasites.

59
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,700
It does have a parasite, which causes this...

60
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:35,540
Every seven seconds, it shits unimaginably tiny exact duplicates of human turds, which can be seen under the microscope in the 3D.

61
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:44,280
What we're hoping for is to catch footage of the little bug that swims along behind the cladocerin eating the little turds.

62
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,120
Because God has provided, even in this situation.

63
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,940
There's always something left behind to clean up your crap.

64
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,440
God is truly a great...

65
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,580
There's always something left behind to clean up your crap.

66
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,760
...great surrealist.

67
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,180
There's always something left behind to clean up your crap.

68
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,820
I'll quote Jonathan Swift here and say,

69
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:04,520
Little fleas have lesser fleas upon their backs to bite them, and lesser fleas have lesser fleas and so ad infinitum.

70
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,940
You say that prettier than I do, Dr. Howe.

71
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,380
He's got such a pretty voice.

72
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,320
I didn't know that was Jonathan Swift that said that.

73
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:12,860
Oh, yeah.

74
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,900
But actually, it's true. I learned in my studies that the tiniest little things that make you itch and scratch,

75
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
You'll be glad to know that they're not.

76
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,100
You'll be glad to know that they have even tinier things that make them itch and scratch and have diarrhea.

77
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,960
Yes, there is revenge all the way down.

78
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:38,860
Down to the micro-molecular level, the wrath of Bob penetrates downward, even as it effulges upward.

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,440
There is no escape. None escape.

80
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,320
Who's that man, struttin' down the street?

81
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,940
Snap it, snap it, snap-chop-chatting to everyone he meets.

82
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,680
Yeah, I betcha he's out. I betcha he's out. I betcha he's out-out-out-out.

83
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:07,220
Snap it, snap it, snap it, snap it , snap it, snap it, snap it, snap it.

84
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,880
Yes, folks, there is life in outer space,

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,140
and here he comes, the life of outer space himself.

86
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,600
Let's make him feel at home.

87
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,800
Here's Bob.

88
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,780
Do you know me?

89
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,160
Often, when I enter a hotel or restaurant,

90
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,340
people fail to recognize me.

91
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,700
Thank you, thank you, you're great.

92
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,460
Let's start tonight's show with a medley of your favorites.

93
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,200
Remember this one?

94
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,460
Bulldada, Bulldada, look there.

95
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,580
Bulldada, look there.

96
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,420
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines.

97
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,120
My name is Bob.

98
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,060
Pleased to meet you.

99
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,960
Meet to please you.

100
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,000
Get it?

101
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,180
Oh, you're hungry.

102
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,200
Oh, well, I am too.

103
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,280
I didn't have time to have any breakfast this morning,

104
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,040
but I'm afraid we're not quite open yet.

105
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,960
We operate in a very different time reference.

106
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,040
You might say all this is happening

107
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,320
between the tics of your watch or the beats of your heart.

108
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,000
Every night,

109
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,400
before we lock up,

110
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,300
we've got to make sure that this room is clean.

111
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,480
You know, those tiny little germs.

112
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,800
Germs.

113
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,380
Germs that can cause colds,

114
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,220
bad breath,

115
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,240
diarrhea.

116
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,720
Germs that can flourish in your family bathroom.

117
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,840
They can be quite dangerous.

118
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,680
Every tiny scratch is a dirt trap that doubles your work.

119
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,560
Now, so,

120
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,480
everything has to go down.

121
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,720
In here.

122
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,120
In the static tank.

123
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,600
I wish to speak to the mutants.

124
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,440
In their chamber.

125
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,720
Focus them in at once.

126
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,020
The signal might be a little weak,

127
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,880
but if I could tap into the lab's transmitter,

128
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,420
and then into this.

129
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,900
You're going to try to control Bob

130
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,040
with your laptop,

131
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,420
a cell phone,

132
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,340
and a car radio?

133
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,980
You know, that's your problem, Nathan.

134
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,820
You're always so negative.

135
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,620
Hey, who was stupid enough

136
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,540
to turn on your car alarm at Brushwood?

137
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,020
I mean, seriously, are you going to worry

138
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,600
that the Amish are going to rob you?

139
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,200
Someone's molesting and pestering that car.

140
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,060
Now, speaking of the Amish,

141
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,660
I was told that there was another

142
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,460
big Amish methamphetamine bust.

143
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,860
Homage to the Amish.

144
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,060
That happened about ten years ago,

145
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,420
and I thought it was a joke.

146
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,320
And then everybody, you know,

147
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,520
the TV people were all making jokes about,

148
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,040
oh, yeah, we'll get that barn raised

149
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,840
real quick tonight.

150
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,780
But apparently,

151
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,860
they've continued.

152
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,440
They're an industrious folk, the Amish.

153
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,040
And methamphetamine is pretty easy

154
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,920
to brew up with.

155
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,280
If you've got a butter churn

156
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,380
and a hardy daughter to churn that thing,

157
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,580
you can make you some bathtub meth.

158
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, a horse.

159
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,580
Yeah, sure.

160
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,520
Donkeys, whatever.

161
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,040
Now the other subgeniuses

162
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,120
are honking their horns

163
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,060
along with the errant car alarm.

164
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,720
Is that really happening?

165
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,560
I wonder if it's a...

166
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,680
It's an automobile mating ritual thing,

167
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,580
you know, and maybe that car

168
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,940
is really horny

169
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,920
and trying to find other cars

170
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,260
who are horny like it.

171
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,460
Well, that's a typically selfless

172
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,780
and noble perspective that you have on it.

173
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,440
And now they've reached their climax

174
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,500
and finished.

175
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,580
I want to see the cars where the males

176
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,200
vie for the attention of the females

177
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,380
by head-butting.

178
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,020
Ramming into each other

179
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,240
as hard as they can, like rams

180
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,080
or paras...

181
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,260
I think that's a Taurus.

182
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,220
Pachycephalosaurus.

183
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,520
Although some people say

184
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,540
the Pachycephalosaurus

185
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,780
could not possibly have rammed

186
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,740
their heads together.

187
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,940
Yes, they say that.

188
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,460
But maybe they knocked their heads together

189
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,760
like the three stooges

190
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,940
instead of ramming them together.

191
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,420
But, you know,

192
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,220
they denounce everything

193
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,840
and then they are proved wrong.

194
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,860
How I could go into that

195
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,740
that all these anhedonic,

196
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,460
paleontologists have recently been

197
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,620
proved wrong.

198
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,620
But nobody's interested

199
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,280
in that particular subject.

200
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,700
But we do have a lot to say

201
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,240
which is of specific,

202
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,660
germane interest

203
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,360
to each and every subgenius

204
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,880
as the last hours of our survival

205
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,640
continue narrowing down

206
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,380
to the point when those

207
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,820
unbearably brilliant saucers

208
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,480
will hover over this very spot.

209
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,100
Yeah, X-Day.

210
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,520
So it's...

211
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,680
You can relax because it's X-Day.

212
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,220
You know, I'm not supposed to eat a donut.

213
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,480
Well, go ahead and eat it.

214
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,180
It's X-Day.

215
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,860
I'm so sorry, people.

216
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,940
I don't know what to say, but...

217
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,820
I know you weren't expecting this

218
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,880
and I'm sorry.

219
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,880
Today's your day.

220
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,840
Oh, don't cry.

221
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,840
It's so unbecoming.

222
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,280
You can face your death with dignity

223
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,020
or you can face it

224
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,200
screaming and running.

225
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,520
Screaming and running.

226
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,860
Screaming and running.

227
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,080
They'll be screaming and running!

228
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,160
Freeze, Bob.

229
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,780
And by the way, just a piece of advice

230
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,840
I want you to consider.

231
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,980
Boys and girls, it does get cold at night here

232
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,320
at Brushwood on occasion.

233
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,600
And when you're spooning up next to...

234
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,200
Bob to keep warm in these cold Brushwood nights...

235
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,660
Bob?

236
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,440
Make sure that you're on the right side of the spoon

237
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,240
or you're gonna become forked.

238
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,080
Bifurcated by Bob.

239
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,000
My spoon runneth over.

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,760
Speaking of getting fucked by Bob,

241
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,320
Dr. Legume is here.

242
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,540
He now sports a brilliant pink scar

243
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,420
that runs...

244
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,140
all the way down his gut.

245
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,340
And that scar covers the hole

246
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,400
where Bob fucked Dr. Legume.

247
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,940
If you want good luck

248
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,000
for a fee,

249
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,280
Dr. Legume will let you

250
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,420
lick that star for the...

251
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,340
the scar for the good luck

252
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,400
that comes from kissing

253
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,440
the hole that Bob used.

254
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,380
Some people have done this already

255
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,840
and they report miraculous results.

256
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,720
Miraculous.

257
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,320
It is a healing process.

258
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,180
He didn't get sick for one thing.

259
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:48,860
Well, yes.

260
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,140
That's always a good point.

261
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,760
So this can be done.

262
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,200
As for the interchange of money

263
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,900
that is between you and Dr. Legume,

264
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,700
he needs your donations

265
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,520
because of a recent bout with car trouble.

266
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,340
So if you're interested in licking the hole,

267
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,240
see Dr. Legume and line up.

268
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
Yeah, and he'll also will...

269
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,680
He will let Andrew the Impaled

270
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,480
sew his lips all the way shut

271
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,820
if he wants to.

272
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:14,820


273
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:14,820


274
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:14,820


275
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:14,820


276
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:14,820


277
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:14,820


278
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:14,820


279
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,040
If you give him enough money.

280
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,900
I'm not sure how much that is.

281
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,400
That's the extra bonus program.

282
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,340
Yeah.

283
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,500
I'm licking the hole that Bob came in.

284
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,020
It's been a bit...

285
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,080
10 years since Legume attempted

286
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,760
to get his lips sewn shut.

287
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,740
Like the mummy.

288
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,480
That year he was on Jagermeister

289
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,980
and used a hat pin rather than

290
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,080
the surgical needles

291
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,120
that the professional sideshow marvels use.

292
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,900
They sewed Imhotep's lips closed

293
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,920
because he had spoken blasphemies.

294
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,740
Legume's spoken quite a bit of blasphemies.

295
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,500
Over the years.

296
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,400
And then they also removed his tongue

297
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,100
and put in the sacred scarab and...

298
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,740
And all that.

299
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,140
Yeah.

300
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,540
Some of the scar books kind of look like scarab trails.

301
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,480
Yes.

302
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,180
Coincidence or conspiracy?

303
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,860
Probably a little bit of both.

304
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,420
Perhaps directed from afar,

305
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,540
from the sacred and sealed valley of Hadoff

306
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,520
by the Nile,

307
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,820
where unspeakable things still flop abroad

308
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,440
in the bright light of day.

309
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,260
Thank you.

310
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,840
You're not supposed to talk about that, Dr. Howell.

311
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,760
It's X Day.

312
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,820
I keep saying it.

313
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,700
Now it all comes out.

314
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,480
All skid marks previously hidden in the laundry

315
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,020
are exposed under the sky of heaven.

316
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,540
Yep.

317
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,980
I'm afraid that it's Bob is really Satan

318
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,820
and you're all doomed to hell.

319
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,340
But it's too late to change anything now.

320
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,960
That's in the script of the subgenius movie.

321
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:36,740
Really?

322
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,420
Of the stand going off with Satan saying,

323
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,300
fuck Bob.

324
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,960
No, that really happened.

325
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,720
Yeah, I know.

326
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,980
At X Day 1998.

327
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,680
But it's in the script.

328
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,020
But that's not a made up story.

329
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,860
But in the movie, just the same.

330
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,220
When in the conspiracy version of 1998,

331
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,820
there were actually, oddly enough,

332
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,040
there were about 10 times as many people here

333
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,880
at seven in the morning.

334
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,300
And of course the saucers appeared not to arrive.

335
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,840
And I was tarred and feathered

336
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,980
and escorted into that parasite infested pond.

337
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,560
He survived.

338
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,120
And thrown in.

339
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,660
And these redheaded bitches came in.

340
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,640
Kept me in there.

341
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,960
I was, I mean, friends, many of you have had the nightmare

342
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,980
where you're stark naked suddenly at school or work or something

343
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,620
and everybody's pointing at your nakedness and laughing.

344
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,680
And some of this has had it really happen.

345
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,760
That's just the memory of a big party here at Brushwood.

346
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,680
That really happened.

347
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,600
It was no nightmare.

348
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,340
The interesting thing was though,

349
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,400
none of the subgeniuses had the slightest sympathy.

350
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,380
They were chanting triple your money back

351
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,660
and throwing things at me and acting like I was jealous.

352
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,540
J.R. Bob Dobbs and all to blame.

353
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,300
And who came down and pushed those redheaded bitches aside

354
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,500
and led me up the hill out of that horrible pond

355
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,840
but Satan himself.

356
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,760
Or a guy in a really good devil costume.

357
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,780
Jesus was very upset by that.

358
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,480
Here's a tip.

359
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,880
I changed business partners that day.

360
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,780
If you come anywhere in a devil costume,

361
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,380
you're going to have a real good time.

362
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,700
If you come out to Brushwood and you have a good devil suit,

363
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,960
you can write your own ticket.

364
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,660
Just a word to the wise.

365
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,320
And how did that work out for you?

366
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,020
Well, I came in the devil costume and absolutely great.

367
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,320
You came in the devil costume?

368
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,420
But you washed it later, I suppose.

369
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,440
Yeah, no, I washed it.

370
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,220
Well, get a rubber devil costume, folks.

371
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,560
You know who doesn't wash their devil costume?

372
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,260
Who?

373
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,320
That band GWAR.

374
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,500
Oh, they never wash.

375
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,240
They come in those costumes and that's the way they stay.

376
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,720
And boy, you can tell.

377
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,980
We had one of them out here in 97.

378
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,440
Andrew the Impaled was the only one tough enough to wear it.

379
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,480
It was a gray alien leftover costume from GWAR tour.

380
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,500
And you may have smelled mildew.

381
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,400
You think you've smelled mildew.

382
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,980
No, you haven't smelled mildew until you've been backstage with GWAR.

383
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,920
The curdled milk of human kindness.

384
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,780
Doing the things that all groupies do.

385
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,700
Well, they don't air it.

386
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,440
They don't air condition their concerts either.

387
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:19,060
You're alike to swelter and die of human heat if you attend one of those stressful festivals.

388
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,480
It just proves who the weak are, you know?

389
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,120
I mean, it's just like X Day.

390
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:33,120
There's a lot of things that happen and it separates the weaker, not quite ready for big time bobbies from the true over men and over films.

391
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,100
Will you be a bohab when it's your turn to die?

392
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,160
This is the key, though.

393
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:45,100
I mean, this is what X Day is partially about, is taking the weaklings out of the food chain.

394
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,580
Separating the wheat from the chaff, which is burned in the furnace.

395
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,460
Well, now, be careful how you say that.

396
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:56,440
I sometimes end up looking at videotapes that other people shoot at X Day.

397
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,560
And sometimes it contains footage I probably wasn't supposed to see.

398
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,160
Once, there was this one Bobby.

399
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,500
And I don't use that term lightly.

400
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,140
This guy was fit every decision.

401
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,100
He had a description of a Bobby.

402
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,720
And yet, someone had interviewed, someone who didn't know him, had interviewed him about X Day and so forth.

403
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,680
And I saw the tape later.

404
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:25,680
And he was sitting there going, well, you know, we're like, X Day is what separates the wheat from the chaff.

405
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:33,140
And people like me, we're the people who really understand the church and run things and everything.

406
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,500
And the rest of them are just bobbies.

407
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,520
But we talked about this before.

408
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,620
Nobody thinks he is a Bobby.

409
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,700
It's always the other person.

410
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,640
It's always the next guy.

411
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,340
It's the person sitting next to you in the pew.

412
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,400
Oh, yeah.

413
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,300
Yeah, I'm not a Bobby.

414
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,760
No, sir.

415
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,280
But I'll tell you what, my friends.

416
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,520
I am a Bobby.

417
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,240
I was one of the first Bobbies.

418
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,600
Dr. Feiland showed me that picture of Bob.

419
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,800
And at that moment, I became the first Bobby.

420
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,380
And I spent five years going, Bob's slack.

421
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,000
Bob's slack.

422
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,020
Oh, Bob gave me slack.

423
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,760
Bob gave me slack.

424
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,080
It's like the dumbest Bobby in Dobstown.

425
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,500
And, friends, I don't feel bad about that.

426
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,920
I grew out of it after five or ten years.

427
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,020
It's a stage.

428
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,680
It's a phase in the development.

429
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,360
It's a stage.

430
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,120
It's a phase.

431
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,680
But if you realize how evolution works, it is never discarded.

432
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,260
It is always there.

433
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,480
The bobbies are a necessary part of the harvest.

434
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,460
Twitching and twitching.

435
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,140
It's part of the makeup.

436
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,200
Evolution adds things over other things which remain.

437
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,120
And I freely acknowledge that I am a Bobby also.

438
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,440
Slack.

439
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,540
Slack.

440
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:37,700
Slack.

441
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:37,980
Slack.

442
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,200
Bob.

443
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,560
Bob.

444
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,640
I've done so many things of which I should be ashamed.

445
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,320
That is hardly chief among them.

446
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,240
There's a good Bob and there's a bad Bob.

447
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,680
And there's good bobbies and bad bobbies.

448
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,140
Absolutely.

449
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,720
And then there's middle of the road bobbies.

450
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,820
The bland, oatmeal-like, utterly boring sludge of Bobby blandness.

451
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,280
Yeah, but they've got grits and an all night diner.

452
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,500
That's right.

453
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,240
They tend to have the 30 bucks.

454
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,540
It's the one thing that separates the Bobby from the human.

455
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,480
The Bobby spent his 30 bucks a day.

456
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,480


457
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,480


458
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,480


459
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,480


460
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,480


461
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,480


462
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,480


463
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,240
He's in the right place.

464
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,660
What the human spent his 30 bucks on.

465
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,280
Fine liquor.

466
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,100
Investments in gold.

467
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,000
Improving his life.

468
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,920
Now what kind of, oh.

469
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,000
But the true, the Bobby spends it the right way.

470
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,960
Water bears.

471
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,180
On his X Day membership pack.

472
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:25,700
Yes.

473
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:31,420
Well, X Day membership pack, that is really worth more than gold.

474
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,940
How many here have received official ordination as a subgenius minister?

475
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,220
Didn't you like the fact that you were a subgenius minister?

476
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,460
I mean, I have a lot of experience.

477
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,460


478
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,460


479
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,460


480
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,460


481
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,460


482
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,460


483
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,460


484
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:42,440
I mean, that stuff that you got in the mail, that wonderful envelope, that packet.

485
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,620
One or two years ago.

486
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,740
Bulging with surprises of various kinds.

487
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:56,020
And also the ecumenical bridge to our brethren in the Church of Universal Life, which enables

488
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:02,200
you, a subgenius minister, to perform weddings, funerals, and christenings.

489
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,800
So what's that worth, really?

490
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,140
You just have to bite.

491
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,940
Bite the proverbial bullet.

492
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,360
Biting.

493
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,740
I'm sorry, I was thinking about something else entirely.

494
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,800
Oh, that's all right.

495
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,260
To proceed with that thought.

496
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,860
No, I read.

497
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,300
We must bite off what we can, while it is available.

498
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,540
We must bite off more than we can chew.

499
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,380
And then chew in blissful solitude.

500
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,920
Good morning marijuana.

501
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,640
Yes.

502
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,580
Bacon.

503
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,320
Slap.

504
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,480
Three sausage links.

505
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,260
Potatoes.

506
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,860
Pancakes.

507
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,500
Sucker.

508
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,560
Loading up on large amounts of bacon.

509
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:36,820
Bacon.

510
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,040
Facts.

511
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,540
Weed.

512
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,340
Clam chowder.

513
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:38,820
Shrimp.

514
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,080
Pie.

515
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:39,900
Potatoes.

516
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,080
Textile crustaceans.

517
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,100
A bone shard.

518
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,640
Marijuana.

519
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,140
Coughing.

520
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,640
With pumpkin-shaped legs.

521
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,720
I haven't been baptized.

522
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,380
Inhale.

523
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,600
Salivation.

524
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,320
No.

525
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,980
You know, there's this thing that happens to certain Connieites.

526
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,360
We become sort of possessed.

527
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,180
And recently, I've been possessed by Connie a lot, actually.

528
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:03,700
As Stang has witnessed quite a few Connie possessions.

529
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,920
Yes, I know.

530
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,120
It's an amazing thing.

531
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,120


532
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,460
It's a great thing to see.

533
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,960
The writhing, the spitting, and jerking.

534
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,940
What was interesting is I, and I wrote it down because I had a possession, and sometimes

535
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,680
I'm smart enough to record them in some way.

536
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:18,700
Automatic writing.

537
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,980
It's mediumistic writing.

538
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,740
Also, like, ectoplasm can come out of her and float around while she's doing it.

539
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,800
Yeah, and again, the boobs mess up the mics, and then...

540
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,480
Says you.

541
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,300
Screaming and running.

542
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,560
Hate screaming and running.

543
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,120
Screaming and running.

544
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,120


545
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,120


546
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,120


547
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,460
May I scream again?

548
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,060
Screaming and running.

549
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,220
Screaming and running.

550
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,340
Screaming and running.

551
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,640
Screaming and running.

552
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,080
Screaming and running.

553
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,100
Screaming and running.

554
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,640
Screaming and running.

555
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:48,640


556
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,060
Screaming and running.

557
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:03,160
Screaming and running.

558
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:09,300
The subgenius tarot cards was one of those jokes that never happened.

559
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,540
It was a running gag.

560
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,560
Every Bobby would come along and go, hey, I've got an idea.

561
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,540
What if you had subgenius tarot cards?

562
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,700
Actually, Cary Thornley created subgenius tarot cards in 1983.

563
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,560
Cary Thornley, as in not you, Thornley, the Cary Thornley.

564
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,840
But we now actually have there's a Pisces card was just there.

565
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,200
Yes.

566
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:37,660
These cards are actually part of the Book of Thoth, though they do not supplant it.

567
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,340
No.

568
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,260
But we're very pleased with the way they turned out.

569
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,160
Yeah.

570
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:42,600
All right.

571
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,720
Oh, I believe we have a call coming in.

572
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,060
Let's go to that call now.

573
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,320
It would be Susie the Flusie.

574
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,060
We're hoping to hear from Susie the Flusie.

575
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:58,980
She, like many others, has had great difficulty in coming through the bombardment that surrounds Brushwood,

576
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,700
the spiritual.

577
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,880
Bombardment.

578
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:06,180
The enemy energy archons who don't want us to be together.

579
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:14,860
They disabled the car of one prominent subgenius, and they've been retarding the progress of Susie.

580
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,860
They sent radiating demons after Dr. Legume.

581
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,820
That's true.

582
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,960
They sent flat tire demons against me many times in the past and broken hose demons.

583
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,220
They mock and snicker.

584
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,060
Not to mention hangover demons and such like.

585
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,780
Satan.

586
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,340
Snickering imps.

587
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,440
Mocking and making fun.

588
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,100
But, you know, we shouldn't give the impression that we're always complaining.

589
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,400
We welcome these challenges.

590
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,200
They give richness to what we do.

591
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,820
After all, isn't life hot and merry and the devil take the hindmost?

592
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:59,480
Once we all achieve some sort of paradisical perfection, we may look back with a certain nostalgia on our time of striving.

593
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:10,700
When, like the pond animalcules under Ivan Stang's microscope, we were contending with our fellow beings for all the rewards of life.

594
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,560
Life and life's effluence clouded once and shower.

595
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:24,880
Are we really all that glad to give it up simply so we may frolic in eternal orgasm with aliens in the sky?

596
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,240
But considering the alternative, of course the answer to that is yes.

597
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,520
And the question is rhetorical.

598
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:36,420
Still, let us enjoy these final few moments in each other's company.

599
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,540
So all the alcoholics are gathered around us here.

600
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,960
Time to leave after this.

601
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,120
This is the last beer!

602
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,560
On earth!

603
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,180
This is the last beer on earth!

604
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:58,500
Before you get off this planet, you will drink and either you will have a sip of this beer or you will leave.

605
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,220
Huh?

606
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,800
With a thirsty throat.

607
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:13,340
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for the brothers at Tap House who made this evening possible.

608
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,520
Please, I want to hear some clapping and a beer tasting.

609
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,040
Praise the Lord!

610
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,340
Praise Bob!

611
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,500
Please, praise the Lord!

612
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:27,680
Praise the Lord!

613
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,600
Praise the gang!

614
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,700
Praise the God!

615
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,260
Praise the God!

616
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,240
Alright, get the fuck out!

617
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,140
Besides, the whole purpose is to get so drunk you don't know who or what you are.

618
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,240
My name's John Dietz, and what I want to know is why...

619
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,460
Son, if you want to expand your mind, the right kind of sugar cube can expand your mind.

620
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,240
You try magical cubes, boy.

621
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,620
But with marijuana, even bartenders get arrested.

622
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,320
But with marijuana, even bartenders get arrested.

623
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,100
My name's Diane.

624
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,940
I just want to say that my husband works at a supermarket.

625
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,300
That's not quite true.

626
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,900
I didn't know we had to wear makeup.

627
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,660
A little powder and some eyebrow pencil.

628
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,300
That's good.

629
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,040
I think so.

630
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,060
Ouch!

631
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:20,780
Ouch!

632
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:21,420


633
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:21,780
Ouch!

634
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,460
Ouch!

635
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,560
Ouch!

636
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,260
Ouch!

637
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,560
Ouch!

638
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,600
Ouch!

639
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:29,680


640
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,580
Ouch!

641
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:30,680
Ouch!

642
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,880
Ouch!

643
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,080
Ouch!

644
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,120
Ouch!

645
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,280
Ouch!

646
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,280


647
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,280


648
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,280


649
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,280


650
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,280


651
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:37,980
Ahem!

652
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,640
가요!

653
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,140
Diane, I can't believe I'm in here now.

654
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,820
That's not my Kellyurly photo.

655
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:44,820


656
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,120
esas.

657
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,480
Base it up.

658
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:48,480


659
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:48,480


660
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,720
Blabla is a blend of worst Android and after my enfin tutorials, I finally got shit

661
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,980
out of house.

662
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,220
So I'm going to dump this stuff away.

663
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,660
mouth hole and grind it, but I also have a little...

664
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,680
Yes, I know what you do.

665
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,640
A little grinder thing.

666
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,240
Mm-hmm.

667
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,940
The things that you do.

668
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,900
The things that one must do.

669
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,240
I only use mine for real Habifrop Zipulops, though,

670
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,380
not for common street marijuana

671
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,120
or any of these heroin crack things

672
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,340
that you see everybody else shooting up around here.

673
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,100
I'm not like that.

674
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,140
Well, surely those of us not so far advanced

675
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,000
in the deeper things of Bob

676
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,280
envy your ability to harness the power

677
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,100
of these outre substances in the proper fashion.

678
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,060
You only have to smoke real Frop once.

679
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,480
You can't get any higher than that,

680
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,420
and you'll never, ever come down.

681
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,100
Now, we are speaking of the Marifesa Luminosa,

682
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,460
which only grows on the droppings

683
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,580
of certain Tibetan holy men

684
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,860
and is the basis for the actual Habifrop Zipulops.

685
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,640
Mm-hmm.

686
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,200
Which is pretty expensive and hard to get these days,

687
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,540
especially since China has, you know, taken over Tibet.

688
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,040
Yeah.

689
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,060
But you can get...

690
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,940
All the good stuff goes to the chairman and his buddies.

691
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,380
We're getting it through Shanghai right now.

692
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,500
We used to get it from our agent in Japan,

693
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,140
but now he's in Shanghai.

694
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,500
Did he get Shanghai'd there?

695
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,600
No, he went there,

696
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,420
and he recently hosted the first Shanghai China subgenius revival.

697
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,240
Yeah.

698
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,640
And it was full of hot chicks, too.

699
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,380
It was.

700
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,520
They're really trying to break the puritanical Chinese mold there,

701
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,640
and, boy, are they succeeding.

702
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,820
Yes, initiates, fate, fate, destiny

703
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,180
has brought you into this tiny little world

704
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,060
like Shanghai for the first ever in Asia,

705
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,120
14 years in the making subgenius revival.

706
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,800
Yeah, baseball, baseball, baseball, baseball.

707
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,580
I will make you hell so loud

708
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,960
You'll all be green out on the moon

709
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,940
Oh, God, oh, God

710
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,500
But we ain't Texas now, we're in China, man.

711
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,480
China.

712
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,060
And people ask me, rap.

713
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,640
Rap, rap, rap.

714
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,180
Isn't it time for a song?

715
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
It's the...

716
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,820
Always will be Bob

717
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,440
His face is one big assembly

718
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,540
The dots that shine in the dark

719
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,320
His grin is the one that looks friendly

720
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,140
But so does the grin of a shark

721
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,180
So, people ask me, rap.

722
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:52,960
Rap.

723
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:53,700
Rap.

724
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,240
Rap.

725
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,660
Rap.

726
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,320
Rap.

727
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,820
We are descendants of the Yeti.

728
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,820
And Bob!

729
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,580
So, is there an agenda this year?

730
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,400
Yes.

731
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:04,800
The next day?

732
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,100
There's always an agenda.

733
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,540
The agenda is to slay the pinks and leave the planet.

734
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,140
Are we gonna control time and try to stretch it out to be, you know,

735
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,100
like three hours for the next 45 minutes, you know?

736
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,340
Well, we kind of do that automatically.

737
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,120
And then for the 45 minutes after that, well, like, maybe, you know,

738
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,120


739
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,260
maybe it'll be like 20 minutes, you know?

740
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,000
Well, we've got all the equipment working.

741
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,480
That's all.

742
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,680
That's the only thing that works is the equipment.

743
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,840
I'm sure not putting myself down.

744
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,520
So, these are the rules here, right?

745
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,400
Yeah, we've already read those.

746
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,520
Oh, you've already read those. Okay.

747
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:38,880
Yeah, yeah.

748
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,420
But we were killing time earlier.

749
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,780
Pisces read the entire program book.

750
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,840
But does everybody have it memorized?

751
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,240
That's the important thing.

752
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,220
Have you been reading your prescriptions?

753
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,600
You'll be tested on this later.

754
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,640
Can you recite the prescriptures all the way through?

755
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,280
Yes.

756
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,460
Here's the law.

757
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,600
But how about the outtakes to the prescriptures?

758
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:58,880
Can I, for that matter, actually know?

759
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,700
Can you recite the outtakes to the prescriptures?

760
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,740
That's the important thing.

761
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,480
God, that's right.

762
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:09,520
There's pages and pages of stuff that Bob didn't want released until the year 2009.

763
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,560
Oh, my God.

764
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,740
What is this?

765
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,300
From PR News in Washington,

766
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:21,500
I'm part of a string of attacks against the humid 10,000% blaze near Flagstaff, Arizona.

767
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,360
The hot, humid,

768
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,900
fire is said to be about 10% windy.

769
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,140
Residents of some 750 homes are said to be assassinated.

770
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,780
As PR's Niki Zajdaša reports,

771
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,420
PR is said to be bad.

772
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,860
PR News, bad.

773
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,840
PR is said to be about 10% bad.

774
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,380
It's bad.

775
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,820
Poland's acting president says this is said to be PR News.

776
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,420
Uh.

777
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,600
People are averaging 20%, according to a new survey.

778
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,620
Nearly four of every five of the roughly 14 million quarter-hours

779
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,860
of the roughly 5,000 by as much as 40%.

780
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,500
Roszko-Lekiejczyk-Szydłowiec-Kiełbski in 2012,

781
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,480
along with many other members of Poland's hot, hot brass.

782
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,020
And as PR tells us, there are also those who get their jobs.

783
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,780
Last check on Wall Street 2010, 423 and 2289.

784
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,400
This is PR News.

785
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,020
It's bad.

786
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,980
Hey, does anybody here have a taste for fresh octopus?

787
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,500
This is gonna fly.

788
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,700
So you couldn't eat all yours?

789
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,680
The masked person.

790
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,460
Yeah, I actually have some left over.

791
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,380
Yeah, last night, Stang was tearing into the octopus.

792
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,320
He couldn't get enough.

793
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,720
Now he's trying to give the rest of it away.

794
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,000
The Lucky 13 family brought a gift for me that was not canned octopus,

795
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,240
but fresh pickled octopus.

796
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,260
I ate some of it.

797
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,960
I think I ate some of the mantle and a piece of tentacle.

798
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:51,720
But the rest of it that is not consumed by the now less than completely enthusiastic Stang.

799
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,760
What parts would that be?

800
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,360
Is available.

801
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,220
What parts of the octopus would not be consumed?

802
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,200
Well, I'm not saying any parts would not be.

803
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,060
Are you talking about the beak?

804
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,720
The beak didn't seem to be there.

805
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,880
It's already chopped up.

806
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,400
They wouldn't throw the beak in.

807
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,060
That would be short-sheeting the customer.

808
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,800
You have to have the beak in there to prove that you didn't get a prairie squid by mistake.

809
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,060
Well, this isn't a prairie squid.

810
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,200
It ain't no prairie squid.

811
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,400
Some people like to say, oh, squid, octopus, what's the difference?

812
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,420
Just same thing.

813
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,540
Aside from the number of tentacles.

814
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,220
But then...

815
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,900
And the size of their hole that you use.

816
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,440
There's a great deal of difference.

817
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,060
The squid has a hard inner part.

818
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,660
The octopus is all a nice soft bag.

819
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,820
But what's really interesting as a difference is that the octopus has a soul.

820
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,120
The squid doesn't.

821
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,560
The octopus is like an intelligent being.

822
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,720
Also, the octopus is venomous, poisonous.

823
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,040
Can kill with its bite.

824
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,960
I feel a little bit bad eating something that's probably...

825
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,360
I don't want to be as intelligent as me in a different way.

826
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,700
But I don't feel bad enough not to eat it.

827
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,940
A lesson in humility.

828
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,220
You don't feel as bad as you would had they been eating you.

829
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:06,580
As you consume intelligent life, you must acknowledge that it can happen to you, too.

830
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,920
Eat or be eaten.

831
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:13,000
And then enjoy your snack of your fellow intellected creature.

832
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,900
Well, most of the time.

833
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,820
Now, I understand in Paris now you can buy bush meat.

834
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,420
There's so many Africans there.

835
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,000
That's horrible.

836
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,120
There's a massive black market.

837
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,600
I hope they stamp that out.

838
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,640
Well, of course.

839
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,060
That's just varmint.

840
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,080
They're eating anteaters.

841
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,220
I mean, you can buy anteaters at...

842
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,240
That's just nutria.

843
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,160
It's just a big rat.

844
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,120
Nutritious.

845
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,660
Short for nutritious.

846
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,760
Well, the authorities are trying to crack down on it.

847
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,780
Partly because, of course, there's the endangered species problem.

848
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,200
But also because wild animals...

849
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,980
Rats aren't endangered.

850
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,400
...have parasites that will eventually crawl out of your...

851
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,520
...body by digging a hole in your leg and slowly crawling out.

852
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,200
Ghastly.

853
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,220
Horrendous.

854
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,700
Are you talking about rats?

855
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,120
No, we're talking about everything.

856
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:58,900
No, I'm talking about guinea worms.

857
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,460
I'm talking about guinea worms, actually.

858
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,460
Talking about how anything from the tropics is suspect.

859
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:10,040
And so when you eat it, you must expect to share your own body with a large intruder.

860
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:20,380
But the same source of Reverend Stang's parasitology studies cites prehistoric parasites that are

861
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,540
the dinosaurs that the dinosauria had.

862
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,500
Ghastly tapeworms 50 feet long and other outrageous...

863
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,320
That's the kind of things they should clone.

864
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,820
Humans can get tapeworms pretty damn long.

865
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,440
Humans get tapeworms pretty damn long.

866
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,560
Think about that as a biological enemy killer.

867
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,280
You just unleash your 50-foot tapeworms on them.

868
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,080
So-called Mexican diet pills.

869
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,420
I ain't a kiddin'.

870
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,840
The unscrupulous would sell those out.

871
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,280
50-foot tapeworms.

872
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,780
Sounds like a band name.

873
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,640
50-foot tapeworms.

874
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:50,680
Yes.

875
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,300
They're supposedly not doing it anymore, but the scandal was...

876
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,660
50 feet for a tapeworm.

877
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,180
Deliberately introduced the tapeworm, and sure enough, the weight comes right off.

878
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,360
Now, if you had 50-foot wide tapeworm, that would be unusual.

879
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,040
That would be bad.

880
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:14,120
But you see, the length and vigor of the tapeworm is directly dependent upon how much of your

881
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,320
precious substance is consumed.

882
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,600
I think if you're gonna have a tapeworm that's 50 feet long...

883
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:18,600


884
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,780
50 feet wide, you need to let it go at the Super Bowl, so it's got plenty to eat.

885
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,400
So it can slither around.

886
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,700
Well, the nature of parasites is to be...

887
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,180
Tapeworms on a plane.

888
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,200
Serapicious.

889
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,120
If you have a tapeworm at a regular function, it's just not gonna get fed well.

890
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,680
You shouldn't see them, or they're not doing their job.

891
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,600
They have to make you think that they're not there.

892
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,620
Many parasites do.

893
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,380
Until it's too late.

894
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,180
There can be a part of horrified time where you do realize it's there, but you know nothing about it.

895
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,800
You see that massive tumor, you know, that's distended...

896
00:37:51,800 --> 00:38:00,000
Or when your brain expands and your skull explodes, which is not from a cheap horror movie, but actually possible.

897
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,760
Just as you said, that bot's face was like exploding.

898
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,420
The African fly that causes this.

899
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,720
It was exploding. Is that behind us?

900
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,740
Your head be exploding when that happens.

901
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,140
So never let this particular fly bite you.

902
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,400
That is, if you can do anything about it at all.

903
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,600
Stay away from the tropics. Live in a lovely temperate climate.

904
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,320
Like this one.

905
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,360
The African fly.

906
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:23,360


907
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,540
The African fly.

908
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,400
The African fly.

909
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,460
The African fly.

910
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:45,400
The African fly.

911
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,080
The African fly.

912
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,280
The African fly.

913
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,300
The African fly.

914
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:03,400
The African fly.

915
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:03,700
The African fly.

916
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,640
The African fly.

917
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,900
The African fly.

918
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:12,400
The African fly.

919
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,360
We are creating a brand new world around us.

920
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,820
We are creating a brand new world without us.

921
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,180
Maybe it really is okay.

922
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,580
Although we're digging our own graves at this moment.

923
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,120
If we should all just disappear.

924
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:50,360
The skies and waters will clear in a world without us.

925
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,880
And there's no place like home.

926
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,140
There's no place like home.

927
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:06,480
There's no place like home to return to.

928
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,560
We push against the rest of life.

929
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,340
As if we can survive without the world around us.

930
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,040
Can't have a rainbow without the rain.

931
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,680
Can't have a painting without the pain.

932
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,380
Can't have a lover without the pain.

933
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,480
Walk out without the light.

934
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,440
Living with them.

935
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,420
There's no place like home.

936
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,680
No place like home.

937
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,780
To return to.

938
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,320
And there's no place like home.

939
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,620
There's no place like home.

940
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,860
There's no place like home.

941
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,980
To return to.

942
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,380
And there's no place like home.

943
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:22,160
There's no place like home to return to.

944
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:35,260
And there's no place like home, there's no place like home, there's no place like home to return to.

945
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:54,660
To return to.

946
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,660
To return to.

947
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:39,360
We've been hearing collages and cut-ups by that cut-up Fernanda Nande-Lemur,

948
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,940
but also bits done by the good Reverend Heart Ignition, who is back.

949
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:51,400
And the Here's Bob one near the beginning was by Reverend Sweetness McGee from Ministry of Slack.

950
00:42:52,060 --> 00:43:00,340
We also heard 13X Day music from the Sunday Night Jam with Reverend Angry Larry, Philo, Pisces,

951
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:04,260
Reverend Suds, Reverend Phil, Dr. Sinister, and others.

952
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,240
And we heard...

953
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:12,580
We heard a clip from the Shanghai Devival, hosted by Reverend Shining Cat, who leads resistance in China.

954
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,400
And, uh...

955
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:23,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're now listening to the Hour of Slack number 1266 from the Church of the Subgenius.

956
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:30,300
You can find more information about our books and other audio and so on at subgenius.com.

957
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,620
Or you can write to us at P.O. Box 1814.

958
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:40,860
417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

959
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:48,300
And now back to 13X Day Drill with Dr. Howell, Pisces, and Philo.

960
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,860
This is kind of a high-tech X Day.

961
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,260
Oh, yeah, we've made some improvements since your time.

962
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,520
Yeah, it's been several years.

963
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,960
Yes, the vacuum tubes and the helicopter set are retired.

964
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,140
It's gotten a little bigger over the years.

965
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,220
Yes, that's right.

966
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,580
It's improved quite a bit.

967
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,900
You can't judge by what you can see because the vast, hidden crowd extends farther.

968
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,980
That was hard because we had to be in the audience and on stage at the same time.

969
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,220
It was better exercise.

970
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,260
You'd run down there, run up here.

971
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,620
The steps weren't even there yet.

972
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,700
No, you'd have to bound up, but we were youthful then, and we could do it.

973
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,600
We were full of sap and figure.

974
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,640
We just stood on a rock.

975
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,540
We were hard as rocks back then.

976
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,460
Yes, that was then.

977
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,060
Hard as rocks.

978
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,040
Now, elderly, palsied, blasted.

979
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,220
Blended with antiquity.

980
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,540
Oft blind and age-bent, sore, distressed.

981
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,860
But fill me with the old familiar juice.

982
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,620
I think I might recover by a lot.

983
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,920
We pause for the appropriate picture taking.

984
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,240
And station identification.

985
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:04,360
So this year, Dr. Drummond noticed we put a tablecloth in front of the picnic table

986
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,180
so that people couldn't see if I had my hand on your knee.

987
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,960
You see me fiddling with my leg on your head.

988
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,100
So they won't see you adjusting your trousers.

989
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,640
That's what they used to call it back at school when the principal did it.

990
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:22,560
Yes, we don't want to distract the flea pit down there because our message is important.

991
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,080
We've got to pound our message home.

992
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:26,980
What was our message?

993
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:31,800
We've hardly got any time to continue with this vital and essential project.

994
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,680
What was our message?

995
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,200
Something like that.

996
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:34,800
A pipe guy.

997
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,520
Yeah, a guy who wants a pipe.

998
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,640
Whose hand is that under there?

999
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,040
Your hands are on top.

1000
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,220
Well, on top for the moment.

1001
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:43,820
I'm fiddling you now.

1002
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,120
Oh, that's my hand.

1003
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,700
Oh, that's my hand.

1004
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,120
We all sit in the great hand of Bob.

1005
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,240
The over man.

1006
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,060
With cracked fingernails.

1007
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,400
Glad you got that.

1008
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,980
I didn't even know it, but I'm glad it's there now.

1009
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,520
Particularly now.

1010
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,620
The concrete face of the dam cracks and falls.

1011
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,520
Ten million tons of pressure builds toward ultimate collapse.

1012
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,220
Yeah, a little struggle.

1013
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,900
Hold it.

1014
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,120
Oh, here.

1015
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,880
Now, if you weren't of explanation regarding the being that you are all waiting to see.

1016
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,140
Hey, Bob.

1017
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,460
I'm on 50 million years.

1018
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,220
That sounds like a dolphin.

1019
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:23,500
Right.

1020
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:23,840
Yeah.

1021
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,020
I want us to touch it.

1022
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:25,980
On the stand.

1023
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:26,720
Not touch.

1024
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,560
Yes, you do.

1025
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,820
You may now take your photographs.

1026
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:30,960
Oh, oh.

1027
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:31,700
Enough.

1028
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,640
But...

1029
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,100
I'm not going to touch it.

1030
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:33,100


1031
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:34,880
Why?

1032
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:35,760
Why?

1033
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,360
He knows why.

1034
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,500
What's the deal?

1035
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,820
Let's play it by ear.

1036
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,340
The Little Pounders.

1037
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,540
You know, when...

1038
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,260
I would probably leave a radio station for equipment like this.

1039
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:51,280
No, it was even...

1040
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,080
It was before Agincourt.

1041
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,280
It was the Battle of Shrewsbury when...

1042
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,800
Now, the red light that says record is coming up.

1043
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,820
How could it be recording?

1044
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,140
Prince Henry fought that battle...

1045
00:46:59,140 --> 00:46:59,420
There's no way it could be recording.

1046
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,140
... and acquitted himself very well.

1047
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,620
But unlike in Shakespeare, the...

1048
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:02,620


1049
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:02,620


1050
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:02,620


1051
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:02,620


1052
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:02,620


1053
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:02,620


1054
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,820
I mean, in Shakespeare, he didn't kill Hotspur single-handedly, although Hotspur was killed

1055
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,560
during that battle.

1056
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:14,000
But what did happen to him is he got an arrow right in the face, which penetrated through

1057
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,120
the right side of his face and lodged the point in the back of his skull.

1058
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:22,180
And even so, he continued fighting in the battle and won the day for...

1059
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,740
Did he leave the arrow sticking out?

1060
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,400
That's what everybody wants to know.

1061
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:25,480


1062
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,560
He left the arrow sticking out, and then, this is what reminded me of the whole thing,

1063
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,520
they pulled it out with a special device which they had made for the...

1064
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,740
And now, tell us...

1065
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,020
... purpose, a special forceps which pulled it out.

1066
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,360
But...

1067
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,400
And of course, he survived to become Henry V and to win the Battle of Ashleport.

1068
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,420
But now, no, no, no, wait, when they pulled it out, what did it have on stuck to the point?

1069
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:49,240
It made a hideous sucking sound, but it had a little piece of Henry, King of England,

1070
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,060
stuck on it.

1071
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,900
A bugger.

1072
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,360
A really, really big bugger.

1073
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,160
An inside-the-skull bugger.

1074
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:01,760
And that's why all the pictures of Henry V are a profile looking to...

1075
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,060
It's true.

1076
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,080
It's true.

1077
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,020
It's a little known fact.

1078
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:10,920
... the left, because the right side had this big honking scar which is not shown in any

1079
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,080
of the official portraits.

1080
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,880
Not just that, the whole side of his face was caved in, or this bugger that had been

1081
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,360
before.

1082
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,560
Medieval miniatures, illuminated manuscripts.

1083
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,680
The removal of it.

1084
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,860
It's all a fix.

1085
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:19,720
The fix is in.

1086
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,100
Made his face cave in.

1087
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,600
One of the greatest kings, and that just shows when you've got an arrow sticking out of your

1088
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,060
face and medieval surgery to look forward to, you can still do a good job.

1089
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:38,100
If you are dedicated and motivated, can we do any less as we humbly shepherd our stumbling

1090
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,400
sheep toward the yawning portals of the space vessels?

1091
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,820
Look at that equipment Reverend Stanton has over there.

1092
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,140
That's another rhetorical question.

1093
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,020
Can we?

1094
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,400
Can we do that?

1095
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,820
There's only so much I personally...

1096
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,980
Can we just ask the question?

1097
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:50,640
Yes.

1098
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:55,640
Ask the question, at least let the question quiver unanswered in the atmosphere.

1099
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,660
That's the point, is letting it quiver.

1100
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,240
Yeah.

1101
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:58,920
It can quiver.

1102
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,980
It can quiver and we can say, well, you know, we did that at least.

1103
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,320
At least we did so much.

1104
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,220
So that quiver could occur.

1105
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,360
You like beaver.

1106
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,060
Fortunately, it's just a game.

1107
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,420
No one is, you know, and hot.

1108
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:20,520
You know, I think what's important is actually the marijuana.

1109
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:20,840
Marijuana.

1110
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:21,300
Turkey.

1111
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,480
Must be destroyed.

1112
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:22,940
What?

1113
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:23,780
Yes, I have it.

1114
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,420
No, I don't.

1115
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:24,940
Breast.

1116
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,680
Often matters.

1117
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,560
Worky art.

1118
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:26,960
Colon.

1119
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:27,340
Troll.

1120
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,720
And like, I'm pregnant.

1121
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:28,900
I'm pregnant.

1122
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:28,900


1123
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:32,900
That's it.

1124
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,280
So where are you staying here?

1125
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:39,600
Well, I'm up in the trailer, you know.

1126
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,740
Oh, the trailer.

1127
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:48,240
The trailer that's painted on the outside with woods and trees and brush but inside

1128
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,860
seeds with spiders and mice.

1129
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:51,860
That's where they put...

1130
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,060
It's camouflage.

1131
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,560
You can't see the trailer from the road because it's got trees painted...

1132
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,620
I'm so glad you said that.

1133
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,980
I thought I was going blind.

1134
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,260
That's where they put the people who snore really, really loud.

1135
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,500
I'm afraid that's so.

1136
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,520
Fortunately, I brought earplugs.

1137
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,380
But I'm not really complaining, simply observing.

1138
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,320
Observing.

1139
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:15,840
We must keep our eyes open and drink in every last detail of these final days.

1140
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:21,580
Some of you may remember that year that we had like three snoring champions in there.

1141
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,480
Five drunken subs for snoring champions.

1142
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:33,100
All of the people that had set their camps up outside the perimeter of the trailer had moved.

1143
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,380
They began snoring in unison.

1144
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:35,860
They had moved.

1145
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,660
It was like a calliope on an overdrive.

1146
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:45,340
By two or three in the morning, it was probably three or four, they had all packed up and left.

1147
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,620
There's no way they could survive.

1148
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,760
They weren't cut out for it.

1149
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,820
They weren't cut out for this kind of life.

1150
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,860
But, you know, that is part of the falling off.

1151
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,080
It's tragic.

1152
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,340
By the way.

1153
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:56,960
It's tragic.

1154
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,600
We were talking before you got here about bobbies talking about separating the wheat from the chaff.

1155
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:06,560
The chaff, of course, not being them because bobbies always think everybody else is a bobby.

1156
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:12,780
But then we kind of had to admit that we're all bobbies under our evolutionary structure.

1157
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,640
What's this we, Dr. Al?

1158
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,160
Except you.

1159
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:17,580
We acknowledge that you are not a bobby, but everybody else.

1160
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,120
Somebody has not to be, right?

1161
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:19,800
Yes, that's you.

1162
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,860
But everybody else.

1163
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:26,460
It's part of an evolutionary stage, just as the brain is constructed of different states.

1164
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,660
That's where I came in here, right?

1165
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:28,960
Yes, exactly.

1166
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,340
That's right.

1167
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,620
I was coming in at that point.

1168
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,420
Exactly.

1169
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,320
Now you're up to it.

1170
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,580
Now I'm up, caught up.

1171
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,020
Okay.

1172
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:34,540
Now you've got it, though.

1173
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,460
Now I'm caught up.

1174
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:35,960
Okay.

1175
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,520
I got it.

1176
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:43,900
And so now we're ready to continue with the next module of this historic prepared broadcast

1177
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:53,320
from the Brushwood stage at X Day 2010, a.k.a. X Day 13, here on a beautiful summer day

1178
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,440
near historic Sherman, New York.

1179
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,860
Now, what kind of sporting events are we going to have later today, Dr. Al?

1180
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,700
Oh, great sport.

1181
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,860
Great sport.

1182
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:07,680
We are going to chase the bewildered, bloody, and weeping through the trees while tormenting

1183
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:13,540
them, and this will only be the start of a long day of planned sport activities containing

1184
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,880
exercise, God's gift to the human frame.

1185
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,920
Yes, exercise.

1186
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,380
Of course.

1187
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,020
That's what made this country great.

1188
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,320
And the pain.

1189
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,060
Hard physical exercise.

1190
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,240
And the madness.

1191
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,040
And the hard physical pain, right?

1192
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:26,440
The hard physical pain.

1193
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:26,440


1194
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:26,440


1195
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:26,440


1196
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:26,440


1197
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:26,440


1198
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:26,440


1199
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:26,440


1200
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:26,820
The horror pain.

1201
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,780
Yes, the horror.

1202
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:33,100
You know, I am completely impervious to physical pain, other people's pain.

1203
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,080
It takes a long time to develop this faculty.

1204
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:45,420
But we're not here to boast and brag, but rather to be inclusive and welcome all into

1205
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,400
our world of Bob.

1206
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,580
I think Princess...

1207
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,480
Because there's still time.

1208
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,200
She's got that guilty look on her face.

1209
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,080
Come a little closer to Bob.

1210
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,040
You may think Bob is ubiquitous.

1211
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:01,260
And everywhere you may see Bob's glowing dots when you close your eyes.

1212
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,140
When you hallucinate from fatigue, you may see orbiting, flaming Bob's.

1213
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:12,620
And this is all very praiseworthy, but that doesn't mean you can't get slightly closer

1214
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:19,000
to that grinning face which appears more and more to overlie everything of substance.

1215
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,160
He's hypnotized with his rhetoric.

1216
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:25,700
And the closer you get, the more you can be shielded.

1217
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,540
And the closer you get, the more you can be shielded.

1218
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:32,340
From what otherwise would be a terrible thing.

1219
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:37,640
We rarely have more than three people talking at once.

1220
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,980
What's this whole five people talking at once thing?

1221
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,040
There ain't no five people.

1222
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,080
I don't know what he's talking about.

1223
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,220
There's no five people here.

1224
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,280
We really get into the three people talking at once.

1225
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,980
Three people talking, five guests.

1226
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:54,140
Generally, we're talking about different things so you can get three times the content that way.

1227
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,940
Or you must talk.

1228
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,160
Talk as if you were three people talking.

1229
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,580
You know, if they're not there, you gotta take up the slack.

1230
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,360
That means you have to have three or four microphones.

1231
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,980
Well, you may remember those movies where after returning from a historic trip to another planet,

1232
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:18,840
the hero is faced with a bank of microphones from all the different news agencies.

1233
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,940
And that's what we've got here.

1234
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:24,920
The world aches to hear what we are going to tell them on this occasion.

1235
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:24,940
Look at us here.

1236
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:25,320
We do.

1237
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,520
We've got four microphones between us.

1238
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,300
That's right.

1239
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,160
Like the United Nations with their banks of interpreters.

1240
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:31,360
Testing.

1241
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:36,740
Or an air traffic controller's tower where one addresses many planes at once.

1242
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,720
This one has a higher frequency response.

1243
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:49,800
And perhaps one goes to a secret aditum where those who are not allowed to crawl forth from their entombment nonetheless listen with some vestige of satisfaction.

1244
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,520
The trapped anchorite in its cell listens.

1245
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,580
Salivating with avidity.

1246
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,700
Who's this, Dr. Howell?

1247
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,560
Generally, people who write emails to me.

1248
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,160
Now, look, who am I imitating?

1249
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,640
I know what you're imitating.

1250
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:14,080
And that's why we've had these installed, these new spit guards.

1251
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,640
Yeah, Dr. Drummond's ranking on me.

1252
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:24,500
He's sat by me many times when, exhausted by too much Pedro, I've simply fallen asleep and eclipsed myオuclid.

1253
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:24,500


1254
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:24,500


1255
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:24,500


1256
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:24,500


1257
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:24,500


1258
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:24,500


1259
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:24,500


1260
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:24,500


1261
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:28,900
I had my whole head supported by my bent nose on the microphone.

1262
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,580
Usually it wakes you up.

1263
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,780
Sometimes it doesn't.

1264
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,320
So what?

1265
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,080
I've put in my hours for Bob.

1266
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,140
The microphone serves as the mooring post.

1267
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,100
Like a Zeppelin mooring mast.

1268
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,100
A Zeppelin-like nose that moors itself.

1269
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,460
Have I ever fallen sideways out of my chair with a crash?

1270
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,420
I do that at home, but I've never done it at the radio station.

1271
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,840
It's not so bad.

1272
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:53,160
It's not bad?

1273
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:53,980
No, it's not bad.

1274
00:55:53,980 --> 00:56:00,340
Dr. Philodrummond and I go through hell to get our program on the air.

1275
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,360
We labor until we sweat blood.

1276
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,520
And bullets.

1277
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:06,840
Exactly.

1278
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:07,840
Exactly.

1279
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,280
And it's 3 o'clock in the morning.

1280
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,960
We deal with horrifying subjects.

1281
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:17,320
The horrible time is the most egregious part of it.

1282
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,640
And each particular hair to stand on end.

1283
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:22,480
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.

1284
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,120
It's the toughest job I ever had.

1285
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:25,560
It's hard.

1286
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:28,100
It's worse than digging post holes in the hot sun.

1287
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:28,980
It's hard to have a job.

1288
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:29,980
Dig ditching.

1289
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,260
No, of course not.

1290
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,240
I was at work to this research laboratory.

1291
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:35,880
Some call it research.

1292
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,120
And somebody had to, like ever so often, had to go in.

1293
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,800
They had a guy whose job was, you know, it's a research lab.

1294
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,460
And sometimes you have to masturbate the monkeys, you know.

1295
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,400
Somebody's got to do it.

1296
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,680
You can use an oversized Q-tip.

1297
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,820
You never see that one on Dirty Jobs.

1298
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,660
The monkey master, the lab monkey master.

1299
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,460
No, they're not proud of having that job.

1300
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,300
They actually have to have a guy who's, you know, had at least a six-year education do that.

1301
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,600
I will say this.

1302
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,880
I'm free from many prejudices.

1303
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,320
Post high school prejudices.

1304
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,540
If not most prejudices.

1305
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:18,180
But anything having to do with monkeys is degrading for who participates.

1306
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,560
But we can learn so much about ourselves, Dr. Howell.

1307
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,640
Some knowledge.

1308
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,740
Some knowledge is not worth it.

1309
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,220
And it's I who say this.

1310
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,480
Remember, we're not monkeys, however idiots may say it.

1311
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,240
Nor did we evolve from monkeys.

1312
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,520
Yes, we're primates.

1313
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,920
But they are not us.

1314
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,820
We are apes.

1315
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:38,860
Apes are noble.

1316
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:45,360
Monkeys are the worst scum that ever chattered and flung their stinking feces from trees.

1317
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,180
That's true.

1318
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,620
Apes are individuals.

1319
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,200
Monkeys are herd followers.

1320
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:49,640
There's a lot of argument.

1321
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,420
A lot of argument that can be settled with.

1322
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,100
With proper poo flinging.

1323
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:57,140
That is, you know, it can be settled temporarily.

1324
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:00,440
But monkeys also, and this has often been said.

1325
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,920
I don't mean to be sitting that close to you.

1326
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,860
Monkeys forget the next minute.

1327
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,160
So they can't.

1328
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,260
They are incapable of being taught.

1329
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,140
No, humans are not monkey.

1330
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,120
Neither was King Kong a monkey.

1331
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,120
No one should ever refer to King Kong as a monkey.

1332
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,920
Humans and King Kong are apes.

1333
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,960
The noble apes.

1334
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,400
And this.

1335
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:29,880
This is something which we should really not be evilly traduced into forgetting or being confused.

1336
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,740
Monkeys have tails.

1337
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,080
They are unclean, filthy.

1338
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:34,720
All right.

1339
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,320
I'll get off.

1340
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,100
Let's take a second.

1341
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:36,960
Say Cheetah.

1342
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,580
There's like 50% of our audience left.

1343
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,060
We have.

1344
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,920
It's time for a break anyway.

1345
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:42,480
All right.

1346
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,420
I'll just say this.

1347
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,700
By the length of a CD recording.

1348
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,700
Cheetah could smoke and drink.

1349
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,160
Cheetah could hold his liquor.

1350
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,580
And Cheetah lived to be an extremely advanced age.

1351
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,480
Cheetah was still alive at the last time we met.

1352
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,400
I'm just telling you.

1353
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,780
Cheetah just died this year.

1354
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,380
Cheetah lived a long time.

1355
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,400
And he was an ape.

1356
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,680
He would have kept living unless.

1357
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:03,380
But Bridget Bardot made him quit having to smoke cigars and drink alcohol.

1358
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,440
But he enjoyed.

1359
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,020
If you've ever seen an ape smoking a cigar.

1360
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,780
Can you imagine that?

1361
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:08,620
He enjoyed.

1362
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:14,520
Bridget Bardot doesn't have anything better to do but make Cheetah give up alcohol and cigars.

1363
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,100
And what happens?

1364
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,500
He dies the following year.

1365
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,060
She's misguided.

1366
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,800
She thinks she's doing a big.

1367
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,780
That's tragic.

1368
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:20,300
Ungal.

1369
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:21,180
Favor.

1370
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:21,960
Now she's so happy.

1371
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,380
For animals.

1372
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,360
She made him quit smoking.

1373
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:24,840
Tarzan.

1374
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,220
Yes.

1375
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,760
Tarzan's pal Cheetah.

1376
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,900
We're not recording anymore.

1377
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:29,920
That's all right.

1378
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,220
This is not actionable.

1379
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,140
We'll never be sued.

1380
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,480
It's X Day.

1381
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:34,880
Okay.

1382
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:42,000
Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodruman can be heard on the Puzzling Evidence Show every Friday

1383
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:51,680
morning on kpfa.org or quiveringbrain.com or ask Dr. Howell.

1384
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:51,960


1385
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,320
You can find us on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram at kpfa.com.

1386
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,240
Thank you.

1387
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:53,380


1388
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:54,380
Bye.

1389
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:55,300
Bye.

1390
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:55,900
Bye.

1391
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,140
Bye.

1392
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:56,300
Bye.

1393
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:56,300


1394
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:56,300


1395
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:56,300
