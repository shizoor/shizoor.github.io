1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
I keep feeling and I hear shuffling noises all about me.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,240
Shuffling?

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,180
Well, not exactly.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,120
More like little sucking noises.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,180
You know, a...

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,100
That's great.

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,560
Look!

8
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,520
I know who it is!

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,160
I know who it is that doesn't belong among us!

10
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,200
I swear, I know who it is!

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:18,920
It's...

12
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,860
The Self Genius Hour of Slack!

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,420
Well, that's not true!

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,380
Wake up, you...

15
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:33,560
Bob?

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,100
Forsaken people, you!

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,520
The best there is, this man here that works for you!

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,280
Your government, our country, the best country there is because of me like...

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,540
Bob?

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,820
I'm proud of you.

21
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,140
Bob?

22
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,540
They're gonna hear about this, not just in the territories, but in Washington.

23
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,800
Across the length and breadth of this nation, they're gonna know that name.

24
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,160
Bob?

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,100
Now, what do you got to say about that boy?

26
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,640
I was drunk.

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,720
I didn't know what I was doing.

28
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,540
I didn't know what I was doing!

29
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,340
I didn't know what I was doing!

30
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,440
Good morning, and welcome to the Subgenius Devotional Hour here.

31
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,040
Um...

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,700
Before the normal scary time.

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,160
As the smoke of that burning goeth up forever...

34
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,760
That was a stink-o.

35
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,620
But it had lots of prophecy involved.

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,620
You heard it right here on the Subgenius Hour.

37
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,660
And lots of few words.

38
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,380
Blood belches from the earth.

39
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:29,120
My lights in the sky rebuke thee, the children of heaven.

40
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,700
And the angels from heaven are among thee, spreading lies and deception.

41
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,280
They turn not as they go.

42
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,220
Within five years, the United States, as we know it, will cease to exist.

43
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,380
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.

44
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,840
Praise the Lord.

45
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,980
And these times are not gonna get any better, my friend.

46
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,340
Amen.

47
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,880
They're gonna get worse and worse.

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,280
Amen.

49
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,140
Love...

50
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,360
Can't breathe.

51
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,180
Okay, I know you all think, uh...

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,440
You want to know what's going on.

53
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,660
That's okay.

54
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,280
So I saw this thing coming...

55
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,040
I saw this thing coming to me!

56
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,540
I didn't know what it was, but, uh...

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,380
It looked funny!

58
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,260
There were deceptions which have surrounded our space program!

59
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,680
Spacecraft entered the moon's gravitational field in the sixth segment of the flight.

60
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,880
The gravity of the moon is 1 sixth of that on earth.

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,680
The orbit around the moon was flown 66 miles above the moon's surface, at 6,000 miles an hour.

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,820
10 after nine, the beeping began.

63
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,900
Went down to the...

64
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,060
reserve fence, watched through binoculars, and we did see this thing. It's about the

65
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,700
size of the moon with a small crescent at the bottom that's well lit like

66
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,480
starlight. The top is a dark gray mass. It came down through the trees, whatever it

67
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,580
was. Have you ever heard of one? Have you ever been in one? Have you ever seen one?

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,240
Have you but television ever seen one? If you haven't, it's the greatest sight this

69
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,280
side of heaven. People from this earth have already seen some of their

70
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:40,420
spacecraft which they call flying saucers and other flying objects which

71
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:50,520
they cannot describe. These objects are real and are spacecraft. I represent a

72
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,700
group of scientists who work with but one purpose to put an end to war.

73
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,120
Naturally such a goal can't be attained

74
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,240
without experts of superior ability. Men of vision, men such as you doctor,

75
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,040
gathered here exchanging information daily, putting aside all thoughts of

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,100
personal success. We hope to achieve exciting new techniques, leap years ahead

77
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,080
of the others. I don't think I need to tell you how effective our voices will

78
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,720
be when the world learns of our achievements. Well, there you have it.

79
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,200
Nothing new perhaps, but then what is? They are friendly people.

80
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:35,300
And are by far more advanced spiritually and physically than the people of this planet.

81
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:44,860
At the present time they are observing us. They wish to help us to help ourselves to

82
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,340
attain a higher understanding of life and its meaning.

83
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,780
What do you think about Bob?

84
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,460
Who's Bob?

85
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,100
All right, well what do you think about Bob?

86
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,100


87
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,100


88
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:04,200
Well, I think about the UFOs which are presently in formation to blitz the earth and put particle

89
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,520
beams through the head of everyone that doesn't know Bob.

90
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,040
You're out of your mind.

91
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,880
And we're off this planet and out of this world soon.

92
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,560
Friends, next week, in fact July 5th, the world ends.

93
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,080
That's how we experts of science and technology will end our lives.

94
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


95
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


96
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


97
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


98
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


99
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


100
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


101
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


102
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


103
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


104
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


105
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


106
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


107
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


108
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


109
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,080


110
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,240
And we'll see you then.

111
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,180
Bye.

112
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,500
Bye.

113
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:56,600
Bye.

114
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:56,800
Bye.

115
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,080
Bye.

116
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,080


117
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,080


118
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,300
Bye.

119
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,300


120
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,300


121
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,300


122
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,640
There's really a lot of stuff on the old Media Barrage 11 explaining X-Day.

123
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,100
Later we'll have documentary sex sounds.

124
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,100
Sex sounds from...

125
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,040
No one is ever safe on this hostile planet.

126
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,120
X-Day!

127
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,880
Five X-Day, actually.

128
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,860
The last one.

129
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,920
By the way, this music in the background is The Amino Acids, who are the headlining band

130
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,120
for this X-Day.

131
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,240
Yeah-hoo!

132
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,880
The Amino Acids at aminoacids.com.

133
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:44,440
Now, friends, however, Reverend Susie the Clusie brings us some of her ex-day love and expectation.

134
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,540
Enough to get me all expectorated.

135
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:55,360
Because nobody knows how to bring in the new end of the old universe like Susie the Clusie.

136
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,720
It's getting late for the great planet Earth.

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,920
A storm of hail and fire mingled with blood is cast upon the Earth and a third of the world is burned.

138
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:21,460
A fiery mountain is hurled into the sea and a third of the sea and its creatures have perished.

139
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,980
A great star has fallen from heaven.

140
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,280
Upon a third of the Earth's rivers and springs, their waters have become polluted and bitter.

141
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,740
The sun, the moon and the stars are struck.

142
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,600
A third of the world is in darkness.

143
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,800
Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the Earth because of the risk to the trumpet blasts which the angels are about to sound.

144
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,100
It is done. The final trumpet has sounded.

145
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,820
The mighty cities of the nations.

146
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,740
Woe, woe, woe!

147
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,140
Islands disappear, mountains crumble as God's final wrath pours upon mankind.

148
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,000
As lightning flashes from the east to the west, so he comes.

149
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,800
The son of man, anointed in power, returns with majesty and glory to take his kingdom.

150
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,340
Bob, let's really have some smoke on this one, all right?

151
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,700
All right, let's go.

152
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,320
Time is running out for the human race.

153
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,920
Get ready for the judgment day.

154
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,840
The sun is shining, come on, get happy.

155
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,600
The Lord is waiting to take your hand.

156
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,480
Shout hallelujah, come on, get happy.

157
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,300
We're going to the promised land.

158
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,560
And if she wants to get some white underwear, it might be best she get them in asbestos, all right?

159
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,920
Might better get them in asbestos.

160
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
And I'm teasing now, of course.

161
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,220
Don't let her put on asbestos britches, all right?

162
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,300
It might be harmful to your breathing.

163
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,060
First, I want to remind you that in the last day,

164
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,100
there will be some scoffers who will do every wrong they can think of and laugh at the truth.

165
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,440
If you are scoffing right now, in your heart, if you are not believing...

166
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:04,540
Bob!

167
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,840
...coming back, you are one of the signs of his coming.

168
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,180
If you're going to continue to scoff, will you do me a favor?

169
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,140
Prepare for the end.

170
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,560
Oh, wow.

171
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,300
Well, there's a day soon coming when the judgment of the world will begin.

172
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,760
Oh, wow.

173
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,500
When the sky will be dark and then the mountains dance like croaking men.

174
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,780
When the people of the earth will fall like fruit from the tree.

175
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,360
Oh, I wish you'd all believe me.

176
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,900
I wish you all could see.

177
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,560
I wish you'd all believe me.

178
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,080
I wish you'd all believe me.

179
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,780
I wish you'd all believe me.

180
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,420
The truth will not hurt you.

181
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,940
Only the lie.

182
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,140
I wish you'd all believe me.

183
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,000
You don't really believe that, do you?

184
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,980
I don't know.

185
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,480
Impossible, fantastic, ridiculous, absurd, really?

186
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,040
The ambush is set.

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,680
And it's working.

188
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,540
1998, the year of fear.

189
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,560
Jack, explain it away, please.

190
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,080
No, these are not my days.

191
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,160
We don't set dates.

192
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,980
This is one of the best intelligence sources in the world,

193
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,820
along with Jane's defense out of England.

194
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,660
But let me tell you this, friend.

195
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,480
We believe things are going to come and happen sooner than we think.

196
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,900
The world must have seen it coming, right?

197
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,740
I'm afraid not.

198
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,900
Even though the technology had been around for years,

199
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,460
nobody really paid too much attention to it.

200
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,200
Almost no one saw it coming.

201
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,820
Almost no one?

202
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,200
Yeah, almost.

203
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,860
Almost.

204
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,420
And those of us who did express our concern

205
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,180
were just branded as paranoid,

206
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,940
as people who hated technology.

207
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,260
People who just weren't ready to be part of a new, united world.

208
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,160
So listen not to this child of Satan.

209
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,520
Reverend, I gotta admit, this doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated.

210
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,880
Oh, now be calm, Ned.

211
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,680
But be afraid also, tremendously afraid,

212
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,360
for the day of reckoning is upon us.

213
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,380
RECKONING IS UPON US!

214
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,080
RECKONING IS UPON US!

215
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,060
Oh, please.

216
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,720
What about tomorrow?

217
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,200
Just what lies ahead?

218
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,200
Will there be a brighter future?

219
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,120
Or just how will it go then?

220
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,360
Woo, woo, yeah!

221
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,020
Ain't gonna wait, it's getting late

222
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,040
Oh, what a horrible dream!

223
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,900
Oh, man.

224
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,080
Boy, that bitch was a real pain.

225
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,080


226
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,480
She was right.

227
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,380
I have fallen down on the job here, Seekers.

228
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,460
I've been pussyfootin' and fiddlefartin' around

229
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,420
at the most crucial juncture here of mutant existence ever.

230
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,760
Because this is a damn ministry here.

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,860
So from now until X-Day, it's no more Mr. Nice Girl.

232
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,720
Oh, I've gotta be more than just mere Reverend Susie the Floozy

233
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,280
to get this job done.

234
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,960
I gotta be the Whore of Babylon

235
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,060
on a three-year-old.

236
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,580
I gotta be the three-headed P-Dog, too.

237
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,180
Because it's time to sound the mutant's survival call.

238
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,540
Too much is hanging in the balance here.

239
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,800
Because there are still unsaved subgenius souls out there.

240
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:47,140
Mmm, I can whiff-read your stench from here, baby.

241
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:52,120
Oh, yes, it's the twilight of the Elder Gods

242
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,980
for the Yeti Uber race.

243
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,620
And praise be the holy name

244
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,840
of J.R. Bob-Dogs.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,720
Because thanks to him,

246
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,200
we're scrapin' the crappy dirt of this planet

247
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,120
off of our shoes, baby!

248
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,600
The Doomsday Clock is tickin' down the final moments.

249
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,960
We're on a drunken chicken run with the End Times,

250
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,240
and it's zoomin' up on us a lot sooner than they think.

251
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,300
Yes, X-Day is coming up July 5th.

252
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,340
This very year, Seekers.

253
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,400
It's 7 a.m.

254
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,740
Think, if you haven't thought already.

255
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,640
Have you decided how you're going to spend eternity?

256
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,720
As a human pork rind

257
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,940
screaming in the stinking wreckage of a dying planet?

258
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,300
Or as a satisfied member of the fastest-growing apocalypse

259
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:54,140
called Snuggly Asconst aboard the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

260
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,140
en route through space

261
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:01,440
and time to an idyllic future of sated lusts

262
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,640
and mind-reaming pleasures?

263
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,860
Duh.

264
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,500
Tough choice, huh?

265
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,620
Oh, but there are some among us who aren't sure yet.

266
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,460
Maybe they can't quite tell if they're pink,

267
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,000
or if they're truly a mutated son of Dobbs.

268
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,800
Hell, just send in that membership fee,

269
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,200
and whether you're pink or not,

270
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,320
chances are, everything will be fine.

271
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,120
Hell, those saucers come with airlocks and torpedo tubes,

272
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,880
so I'm sure we'll be able to do a little weeding out once we're airborne.

273
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,640
Oh, but that can come later.

274
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,860
And hopefully there won't be a lot of weeding to do,

275
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,700
because weeding's hard on a girl's knees.

276
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,980
But I don't expect a lot of the wrong kind of people to be on board

277
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,380
if you catch my drift,

278
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,740
because they're going to be misreading the flaming signs in the heavens

279
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,840
and trying their brand-X apocalyptic solutions

280
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,680
until it's too late to turn to Bob.

281
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,900
Oh, but they never have been able to figure out how to get it right anyway.

282
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,260
Oh, they screw it all up.

283
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,940
They can't tell a 999 from a 666.

284
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,700
And I can see how they could mistake our triumphant subgenius Ragnarok

285
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,540
for their cheesy bargain-based,

286
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,380
Armageddon.

287
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,920
Oh, but hey, you putzes.

288
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,280
Armageddon tired of waiting for you to get around to it.

289
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,000
Your god can't get it up to destroy the Sodom and Gomorrah

290
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,020
that it has created for itself.

291
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,580
Oh, but Bob's going to clean house on this cat box, but good.

292
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,460
And the mighty wrath of Jehovah One and Negi

293
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,260
and the elder gods and the sex goddesses are just for the overkill.

294
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,160
Oh, Bob, great is thy power.

295
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,600
Cream rinse us all in your sweet load

296
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,920
and rupture us up into the heavens.

297
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,140
Yea, we strip naked and light the sacred frop

298
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,740
and implore your mercy upon your believers.

299
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,780
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea.

300
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,740
In the days of the end,

301
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,800
there shall come from among the race of men

302
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,500
a new ruler.

303
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,580
From the chaos of the nations,

304
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,120
he will forge peace and security.

305
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,320
As one risen from the dead,

306
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,960
he will entrench the world with his sorcery.

307
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,500
And at the time appointed,

308
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,340
he will take his place in the very temple of the Lord of Hosts,

309
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,780
scattering the true children of the Father

310
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,180
over the face of the whole earth.

311
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,620
He is mobbed.

312
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,560
What makes Bob holler?

313
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,220
What makes Bob holler?

314
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,100
When I ask Bob, he explained this way.

315
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,660
And he said,

316
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,180
Well, when a little sweety pie

317
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,740
in a minskirt twirls by

318
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,480
and rolls those big blue eyes,

319
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,940
oh, I holler.

320
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,760
And when some pretty chick

321
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,960
says she loves my fiddle legs,

322
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,480
well, now then, that can do the trick.

323
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,820
Oh, I holler.

324
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,320
And, uh,

325
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,560
you know, even if X-Day doesn't work out,

326
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,580
we'll go for Sex Day!

327
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,380
Yeah!

328
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,560
We want you to have a dance into the new century!

329
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,020
Screw into the new century!

330
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,080
Sleep and eat your way into the new century!

331
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,800
And the baptism is basically to wash away that pig tank

332
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,260
from rubbing elbows with and kind of purify them.

333
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,280
The baptism is a very beautiful event

334
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,960
because most of us need a bath.

335
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,660
Okay.

336
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,240
And now I want you to gently feel

337
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,680
your neighbor's nipple to your left and to your right.

338
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,000
I love you

339
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:45,920
and she is lousy.

340
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,700
We can't not turn that off.

341
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:46,980


342
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:46,980


343
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:46,980


344
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:46,980


345
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:46,980


346
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:46,980


347
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:46,980


348
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:46,980


349
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:46,980


350
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:46,980


351
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:55,500
and bring thee not the devils, for thine spirit is locked away inside the white stone, which

352
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,620
my angels have grieved from space.

353
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,540
Where are we, Bob?

354
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,940
The code is broken.

355
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,820
Trouble?

356
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,440
Big.

357
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,400
Security.

358
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
I have the lid on tight.

359
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,300
Well, take it off for me.

360
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,560
The message is, Mars needs women.

361
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:17,800
Ah!

362
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:19,980
Ah!

363
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:21,920
Ah!

364
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,600
Ah!

365
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:24,900
Ah!

366
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:25,940
Ah!

367
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:26,300


368
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:26,960
Ah!

369
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,140
Ah!

370
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,240
This is so wrong.

371
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,200
I love it.

372
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,180
It's moments like that that make me think we're really all going to hell after all that.

373
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,620
It's a way of getting back to all the slack you had when you were a little kid.

374
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,240
Remember when you were a little kid and you'd be able to just sit there with your little

375
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,040
plastic soldiers?

376
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,300
Yeah.

377
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:46,700
Yeah.

378
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:46,940
Yeah.

379
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


380
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


381
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


382
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


383
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


384
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


385
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


386
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


387
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


388
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


389
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


390
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


391
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


392
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


393
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:46,940


394
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,260
You had a little fantasy world around you.

395
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
This is it.

396
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,660
We've created our own fantasy world around us.

397
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,740
That's what religion's for, right?

398
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
To create a fantasy world.

399
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,580
But we live our fantasy world out.

400
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,820
We don't wait until we die.

401
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,880
Oh, man.

402
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,380
John.

403
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,640
Whoop her, Andrew.

404
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,380
Whoop her real, Andrew.

405
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,420
I got exactly what I wanted!

406
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,820
All right.

407
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,800
Praise time.

408
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,580
Say yay!

409
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,140
caminhoBcom Style Swings

410
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,700
It's a Special!

411
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,100
Bob's a small guy physically, I'm pretty convinced.

412
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:29,580
Uh-huh.

413
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,060
You seen the photographs or those are the autopsy photographs that were rearranged to

414
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,960
look like quiet Air Force.

415
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,600
I never trusted autopsy.

416
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,000
Put it settle.

417
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,860
He's going to say hi.

418
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,280
Bob Bob.

419
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,740
I came as.

420
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,400
A visitor.

421
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:53,300
not an invader. I must get back to my ship, see if I can repair it. And then I must leave.

422
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,220
No, wait. What harm is there in hearing them out? Other than being a salesman, what does Bob do for

423
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,860
a living? Other than being a salesman? Bob is not, Bob is not on Route 80 with a bag full of

424
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:11,020
Who has met Bob? He seemed extremely paranoid. He believed in conspiracies.

425
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,560
He came on like a Nazi. I was afraid of him.

426
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,560
Your tricks don't frighten us, neither do you. We've come a long way in 5,000 years.

427
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,100
But you're still of the same nature. I could sweep you out of existence with a wave of my

428
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:35,360
hand and bring you back again. I can give life or death. What else does mankind demand of its gods?

429
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Mankind has no need for gods. We find the one quite adequate.

430
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,340
We shall not debate, mortal.

431
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,760
At this very moment, there have been stories filtering into the studio about other sports

432
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,260
events being kidnapped and the entire thing taken to another planet. That's right. These

433
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:31,700
are aliens from another planet kidnapping our American sports teams. It's not a legal problem.

434
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,260
It's not a political problem. It's an alien problem.

435
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,420
Oh, I've never seen one.

436
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,280
You know, the visits from aliens need not be a painful item. It can be quite an exciting time.

437
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,260
I don't personally have any desire to have it. It's like meeting Bob. I don't want to do it.

438
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,280
I just need to get you to understand exactly what's happening here at the Church of the

439
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,860
Subgenius and the organized crime fighting that we're doing here in California.

440
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,680
But as soon as we're gone, you folks who are here unsaved, you folks listening by radio,

441
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,740
you folks listening by record.

442
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,400
Once the church is gone, there's going to be a cataclysmic judgment and millions will

443
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,420
die in those next few years.

444
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:17,640
They'll be glued to their sets, watching rockets and jets, blowing up schools and factories,

445
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,840
putting an end to the birds and bees. It's worth every penny to tune in and see who wins

446
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:31,200
the Emmy at the root of the academy. Watch World War III on pay TV before your television

447
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,300
melts away.

448
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,620
It's the end of the world.

449
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,260
As we know it, it's the end of the world.

450
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,900
As we know it, it's the end of the world.

451
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,460
As we know it, I feel fine.

452
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,060
A-O, let's go.

453
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,860
Shoot them in the back now.

454
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,440
What they want, I don't know.

455
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,120
They're all revved up and ready to go.

456
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,120
Turn around.

457
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,440
Go back down.

458
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,680
Back away.

459
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,780
You came.

460
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,740
Can't you see that flash of fire?

461
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,380
Ten times brighter than the day.

462
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:22,760
And behold, a mighty city broken in the dust again.

463
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:30,320
Oh, God, proud man, broken in the dust again.

464
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,580
It's gonna be me.

465
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,280
And it's gonna be you.

466
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,340
We're gonna do everything we want to.

467
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,000
It's gotta be now.

468
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,620
And I can't wait.

469
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,820
To say goodbye to fear and all that pain at hand.

470
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,240
Oh, like a flaming baton that's ready to twirl.

471
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,260
Like George Bush on acid singing to Duke Moore.

472
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,640
Gonna be a new world.

473
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,060
Gonna be a new world.

474
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:21,320
I could say to anyone's last words.

475
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,540
There's nothing left for you to say.

476
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,900
Soon you'll pretend anyway.

477
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,180
Well, no one here is getting out alive.

478
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,440
I feel so unconsious.

479
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:33,980
It's the end of the world.

480
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:33,980


481
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:33,980


482
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,560
Lost my mind.

483
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,840
And I don't care.

484
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:35,840


485
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,020
So close your eyes and get yourself to fight

486
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,900
And think about the times we've been and what they've been

487
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,500
To me it's nothing

488
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,000
To me it's nothing

489
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,700
To me it's nothing

490
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,120
To me it's nothing

491
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,480
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance

492
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,660
That's why we might as well take our time

493
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,500
Stop the traffic, stop the clock, stop the clock

494
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:23,120
I wanna get off, I wanna get off with you

495
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,860
I wanna get off

496
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,720
I wanna get off with you

497
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,440
One more job in the supermarket

498
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,960
One more kick to get me started

499
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,240
Everyone get on board, this ship is sinking

500
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,080
Looking for a way in, searching for the way out

501
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,980
Angels ride free in your mind

502
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,460
But you're never gonna find it if you're never gonna try

503
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,600
Get your eyes on the road and

504
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,100
So close your eyes and get yourself to fight

505
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,800
So close your eyes and get yourself to fight

506
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,120
Hey man, get hip

507
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,400
Climb aboard our pleasure ship

508
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,700
Speed boy, we know

509
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,040
You're king of freedom, yeah, come and go

510
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:20,820
Go Apollo 69

511
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,440
Rock it baby, walk the line

512
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,180
We see the fire

513
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,080
Now we're on the run

514
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,960
Now's the time

515
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,600
Fly Apollo 69

516
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,780
Yeah, yeah

517
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,300
The beginning was the end

518
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,700
Of everything now

519
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,300
The ape regards his tail

520
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,360
He's stuck on it

521
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,380
Repeat until he fails

522
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,120
Have a goon and have a gun

523
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,200
A man's not made of steel

524
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:22,300
No, have the45

525
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,960
Count, añä

526
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:22,960


527
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:22,960


528
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:22,960


529
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:22,960


530
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,020
If just a shot away

531
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,060
It's just

532
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,020
It's just a shot away.

533
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,560
Oh, children.

534
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,200
It's just a shot away, shot away, shot away.

535
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,700
When we were born into this life,

536
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,060
we were destined to make it right.

537
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,080
And it's predetermined.

538
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,560
And this is our fate.

539
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,340
We're singing this song.

540
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,060
So you can read later.

541
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,400
We are going to save the universe.

542
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,120
We are going to save the universe.

543
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,920
We are going to save the universe.

544
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,000
Goodbye.

545
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,540
In England's dreaming.

546
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,360
No future.

547
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,520
No future.

548
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,840
No future for you.

549
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,080
No future.

550
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,520
No future.

551
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,860
No future for me.

552
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,320
No future.

553
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,140
No future.

554
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,600
No future for you.

555
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,320
No future.

556
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
No future for you.

557
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,920
The universe is not a grave.

558
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,840
What of the limitless?

559
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,980
Sex and violence.

560
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,560
In the wake of Ragnarok.

561
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,620
Welcome to the slaughter.

562
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,940
What are you going to do?

563
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,560
What will be your epitaph?

564
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,720
When we get done with you?

565
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,320
Are you going to cry for your mama?

566
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,700
Or are you going to have a good time?

567
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,200
Are you going to be a bohab?

568
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,380
When it's your turn to die?

569
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,280
Don't get crazy.

570
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,960
Let them all die.

571
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,480
Okay!

572
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,900
Looks more wrestling.

573
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,020
Blame us.

574
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,100
Blame other people.

575
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,100
Whatever you're going to do to us.

576
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,660
For abuse.

577
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,300
repetitions of those who talk interesting stories,

578
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:25,300


579
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:25,940
eventually build a linkage back between meat as drugs .

580
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:33,020
He said, I've never engaged in this type of thing before, but yes, I believe it can be very easily done.

581
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,940
Just put some bleachers out in the sun and have it out on Highway 61.

582
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,340
Oh, yeah!

583
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,600
It's the end of the world as we know it.

584
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,160
It's the end of the world as we know it.

585
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,120
And I feel fine.

586
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Bob?

587
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
Bob?

588
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,980
Really don't mind

589
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,480
Bob?

590
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,500
Bob?

591
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,920
An accent?

592
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:55,920


593
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:55,920


594
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:55,920


595
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:03,860
X-Day song collage there, put together by yours truly with a bazillion different commercial bands.

596
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:09,680
And before that, some old, young, glass madness and puzzling evidence on the radio.

597
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,640
And now, with amino acids in the background, me doing the credits.

598
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,280
No one is ever safe on this hostile planet!

599
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,860
No way, man! Because that's...

600
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,720
Well, obviously, just look at Pope Black here.

601
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:28,000
Pope David Lee Black preaching at the Euro-X-Day in London last year.

602
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,260
I'm gonna talk to you about the conspiracy!

603
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:33,280
Yeah!

604
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:33,580
Woo!

605
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,340
Conspiracy!

606
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,260
Yeah.

607
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:45,160
Now, the conspiracy is that one world, one government, one taco, one Pepsi, one goddamn tight Nike tight t-shirt,

608
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,640
one fucking football, one football game world...

609
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,620
That'll have a fucking Big Mac in your mouth and a gas pump in your ass,

610
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,820
begging you, and you'll beg them to give you your credit card.

611
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,260
Woo!

612
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,800
But there's only one way to get rid of this conspiracy!

613
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,440
And that is to burn money!

614
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,620
Woo!

615
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,040
Woo!

616
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,640
We gotta burn some money!

617
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,200
Woo!

618
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,280
I want you to get out your money!

619
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,720
Get out your money!

620
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,520
Who's got money to burn?

621
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,640
We got some money to burn!

622
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:20,700


623
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,140
We got more money to burn!

624
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,560
Oh, hallelujah!

625
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,480
More money!

626
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,320
We got dollars!

627
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,080
We got rupees!

628
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,200
We got euros!

629
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,700
We gonna burn some money!

630
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:29,980
Hallelujah!

631
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,280
Some of that money, brother!

632
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,720
Smoke that money!

633
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,620
Woo!

634
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,500
Burn money!

635
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,080
Burn!

636
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,340
Burn!

637
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,480
Burn!

638
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,880
Evil money!

639
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,780
Burn it!

640
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,120
Them dollars and euros!

641
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:43,960
Burn it!

642
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,920
I have a gold nose!

643
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,080
Pleased to meet you, sir.

644
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,680
They say you're a gold nose.

645
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:50,680


646
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:50,680


647
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:50,680


648
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:50,680


649
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:50,680


650
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:50,680


651
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:50,680


652
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:50,680


653
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,360
I shot him in the foot just for his boots.

654
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,160
Well...

655
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,160
Here's your gold nose.

656
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,460
Thirty dollars cash.

657
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,980
You like this model?

658
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,780
I don't know.

659
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,440
Thank you, sir.

660
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,600
Oh, Pa, thanks a lot!

661
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,600
There ain't none better.

662
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,420
Oh, come on.

663
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,760
Where's where's the range we are?

664
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,460
Mm-hmm.

665
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:05,960
Mm-hmm.

666
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but...

667
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,640
Hey, hey!

668
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,180
Hello!

669
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,560
Cash deal.

670
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,400
Cash!

671
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,900
It is better to have more and, uh, not need, than to have more and, uh, not want.

672
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,680
Mm-hmm.

673
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,360
I don't know.

674
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,120
Hey, hey, hey!

675
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,960
We were in a cattle loon on a moonlit night when a group of flying saucers came flying

676
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,580
into sight.

677
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,120
Oh, no!

678
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:27,900
Ew!

679
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,420
Ew!

680
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,640
Let's get outta here!

681
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,860
They're getting too close.

682
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,040
And they're starting to glow.

683
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,500
I'm turning up the gas!

684
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,480
Come on, let's go!

685
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,400
Oh, no!

686
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,620
Senior feathers!

687
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,760
Let's get outta here!

688
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,440
They have an anti-magnetic, hydro-supersaturated, cyclotrated, adiopated bottoms that are corrugated.

689
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,760
Electroplated gyroscopic catalytic simulator.

690
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,680
It's green light!

691
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:50,680


692
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:50,680


693
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:50,680


694
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,180
I'm turning on the fans, ready to wheel!

695
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,520
Sauces in the sky!

696
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,800
Sauces in the sea!

697
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,200
Wine and sauces everywhere!

698
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,280
Coming after me!

699
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,820
Slippin' and a-spidin'.

700
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,520
Doing a fine saucer rack!

701
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,900
Look, sittin' on top, it's a phat-photonic sight.

702
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,460
Don't worry, kids, everything's all right.

703
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,200
Oh, no!

704
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,040
Ew!

705
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,720
Get us outta here!

706
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,000
It's a rock and roll band from the back of the moon!

707
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,700
I don't think I've ever heard a prettier tune!

708
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,680
One, two, three, let's get on with the show!

709
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:20,680


710
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:20,680


711
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:20,680


712
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:20,680


713
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:20,680


714
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:20,680


715
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:20,680


716
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:20,680


717
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:20,680


718
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:27,840
show we have anti-magnetic hydrosuper saturated cyclotrated atom painted bottoms that are

719
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,820
corrugated electroplated gyroscopic catalytic simulator

720
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,000
sauces in the sky sauces in the sea

721
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,360
flying sauces everywhere

722
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,440
coming after me

723
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,860
swimming and a-sliding

724
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,680
doing the fine saucer ride

725
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,820
the mutants must appear

726
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,380
the mutants must thrive

727
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,440
the saucers will fly

728
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,720
and the darlings

729
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,340

730
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,360

744
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,120
when they finally arrive here on

745
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,120

of all

756
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,600
the UFOs

757
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,400
I'm just taking all the Bahamas in my ship

758
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,780
that's all I want

759
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,140
that's all?

760
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,060
yeah that's all I want

761
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,840
just the Bahamas

762
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,280
I'm taking all the bananas

763
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,940
the Caribbean islands

764
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,860
all the Caribbean islands

765
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,800
that's my little chunk

766
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,160
I'm just gonna take that wedge

767
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,780
I'm taking all the carob bars

768
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,060

769
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,900
all the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam

770
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,600
the Grand Canyon

771
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,680
I'm taking all the treasures of the Iraqi National Museum

772
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,560
lost in questions

773
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,220
lost in time

774
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:51,940
lost in space

775
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,020
I lost in a quest

776
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,460
for holy grails and grace

777
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,120
a wild cry cuts through

778
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,540
the night sky below

779
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:11,220
Hello, another traveler's packed and ready to go.

780
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,640
I can feel more, I can feel more down.

781
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,080
I can see more white, blue, green and brown.

782
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,520
I can hear the lights of night turn to sound.

783
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,640
I can feel I'm out of town.

784
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,920
I can stop, I'm falling down.

785
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:49,640
I can see the world spinning around and around and around.

786
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,020
Spinning around and around and around.

787
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,500
Spinning around and around and around.

788
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,560
Spinning around and around and around.

789
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,740
Spinning around and around and around.

790
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,940
Chaz Smith, a clip from his new rock opera.

791
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,640
There's more of that coming up, actually.

792
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,360
And, well, surprises in store.

793
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,260
I'm terribly sorry to intrude on your hour of slack.

794
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,740
But I eat plutonium.

795
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,220
And subsequently, I fart radiation.

796
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,380
And I thought you ought to know that.

797
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,220
Now back to the end of the world.

798
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,200
Praise Bob.

799
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,860
You take the red pill, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

800
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:15,620
This is your last chance.

801
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,940
This is your last chance.

802
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,960
After this there is no turning back.

803
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,500
You take the blue pill.

804
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,980
The story ends.

805
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,980
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

806
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,060
You take the red pill.

807
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,620
You stay in Wonderland.

808
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,240
You stay in Wonderland.

809
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,340
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

810
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,260
Goes.

811
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:51,960
Goes.

812
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,120
And you can get that red pill.

813
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,760
His hands are bloody.

814
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,980
His head is unbound.

815
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,700
For the locals.

816
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,360
I have to take a break for the locals here.

817
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,120
And his brow is furrowed.

818
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,460
For the locals, you can take that red pill.

819
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:10,860
Coming up next week, Thursday night, I will not be here because I will be at Brushwood.

820
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
Awaiting the rapture, my friends.

821
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,260
Sitting in a pile of his own pieces.

822
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,200
Hoping against hope, the X's will come down.

823
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:31,120
And Dave and Stang and Princess Wee and Legume and Ed Strange and Doc and Froppin and Sister D and the whole litany.

824
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:31,940
We'll be there.

825
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,180
Beggars and thieves.

826
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,700
We'll be there.

827
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,820
It's going to be a whole lot of the old timers and a whole lot of the new comers.

828
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,960
One big family of beggars and thieves.

829
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,500
X Day, the subgenius end of the world.

830
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,120
I'm going to grow a crab claw.

831
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,380
I'm going to grow a crab claw.

832
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,800
And you can get more information if you want to go to that there party.

833
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,720
I'm going to grab Legume's and I'm going to take Legume and grab him by the feet.

834
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,980
Then I'm going to go back to the dinosaur age in a time machine.

835
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,140
I'm going to use that thing to make love to an ankylosaur.

836
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,800
But I'm sure this talk of Legume's sex life is making us all bored.

837
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:14,260
I'm going to take that crustacean hand and reach for a star and pull it down.

838
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,460
And there's Legume's shock parts.

839
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,060
So, stuck smelling.

840
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,020
Okay, well you can get more information if you want to go to that at...

841
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,580
At www.subgenius.com or at brushwood.com.

842
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,880
Just find your way to Sherman, New York.

843
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,320
Ask the locals.

844
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,660
Ask the locals.

845
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,340
You won't even have to ask.

846
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,020
They'll take one look at you and go, oh, you're looking for that bomb thing.

847
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:41,840
Bailey Hill Road.

848
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,500
When they see those...

849
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,120
Bailey Hill Road.

850
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:43,720
Go down there.

851
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,260
Turn left.

852
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,820
The Amish guy in the cart.

853
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,700
You know, you'll see.

854
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,580
You'll know when you're there.

855
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,200
When they see...

856
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,820
You'll with it.

857
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,120
The bags on your feet.

858
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,120
When they see those polystyrene bags on your feet and this other strange hazmat uniform...

859
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,100
The boys are going to be the shirts in this game of life, my friends.

860
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,860
And we'll let you gals be the skins this time.

861
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,840
And by their dudes shall they be known as so.

862
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,020
Now we're going to have a football game.

863
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,820
Touch football.

864
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,300
It don't count unless you leave a mark.

865
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,660
Oh, there's a whole special Olympics.

866
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,940
A game of Freaks of Ministeria.

867
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,820
We're going to have a game of Touch the Donkey's Foot.

868
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,080
We've got like a, you know, a whole...

869
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,000
Oh, there's a superhero ball.

870
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,180
Jesus is coming as money, man.

871
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,220
Some extreme sports.

872
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,300
We'll be making soap out of pink rectums.

873
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,600
Dave, what extreme sport are you partaking in?

874
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,220
The blaster game.

875
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,800
It's two 300-pound howitzer or cannons placed at either end of a field, pointed directly

876
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,620
at each other with all of the pink boys and girls, all assembled right behind them.

877
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,920
And at one fell swoop...

878
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,240
They all expectorated one another.

879
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,220
Oh, there goes another one.

880
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,280
Praise God.

881
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,680
Get it again.

882
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,880
Bob escaped from hell.

883
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,120
He dug his way out using his entrenching tool.

884
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,380
He tricked the devil in a card game.

885
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,120
He cuckolded the devil.

886
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,000
He got kicked out of hell, friends.

887
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,580
Bob's still flying that jet plane overhead.

888
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,280
He's protected.

889
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,440
Your ass is you for a subgenius finish.

890
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,000
Praise God.

891
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:12,800
That's all right.

892
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,620
Sit right down here.

893
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:13,920
I'll give you a little bit of a break.

894
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:13,920


895
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:13,920


896
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:13,920


897
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:13,920


898
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:13,920


899
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:13,920


900
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:13,920


901
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,220
We won't talk petty games or unusual behavior.

902
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,180
Now your name is on the dossier.

903
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,020
Very clearly it is pronounced like this.

904
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,580
I hope you don't forget.

905
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:31,160
We will discuss how you can get out of here in the most efficacious way.

906
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,140
You don't want to pay too much.

907
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,120
You want to be safe.

908
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,300
You want to be better.

909
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,120
Not sorry.

910
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:42,820
Yeah, my pleasure vessel where it's always a stadium concert.

911
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:43,920
I'm sorry.

912
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:43,920


913
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:43,920


914
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:43,920


915
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:43,920


916
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:43,920


917
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:43,920


918
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:43,920


919
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:43,920


920
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,420
It's a never-ending party in the stadium.

921
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,200
One after another.

922
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:56,980
I don't think we could describe what our pleasure vessel would be like.

923
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,080
Could we, Princess?

924
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,860
The mind is very, very hard to describe.

925
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,940
It's kind of interdimensional in nature.

926
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,940
You take one step one way and then the next thing you know it's a dead end.

927
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,500
You could lose it there, man.

928
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,640
You know, you could lose it.

929
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,640
Actually, you know what's on it?

930
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,040
I want to play since this is the end of the world and all that.

931
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,920
Finally, we just have to do it.

932
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,820
Because they always yell it out anyway.

933
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,080
So here you go.

934
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,860
Everybody yells it out.

935
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,720
I remember when they used to yell them all the time.

936
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,900
They would hold the little frustration fingers up with the lighters in them.

937
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,700
Yeah, I remember.

938
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,040
I remember that time.

939
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,620
Do you remember when you were a little girl?

940
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:43,620


941
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:43,620


942
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:43,900
Yeah.

943
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,720
When the bird went down, it was so sad of Dave.

944
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,440
Oh, how can you forget those times?

945
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,280
How could you forget?

946
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,940
The whole band was pretty much gone in the one very small band.

947
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,320
But Dave, memory keeps going back.

948
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:55,680
Oh, yeah.

949
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,320
Bad memory keeps going back on you.

950
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,380
Oh, yeah.

951
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,440
Sometimes you...

952
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,040
Hey, Dave, be a simple kind of man, would you?

953
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,500
Stop being so oblique.

954
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,600
Be straightforward.

955
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,580
Say what you really mean, man.

956
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,280
Be a simple kind of man.

957
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:13,620
Oh, yeah.

958
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


959
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


960
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


961
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


962
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


963
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


964
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


965
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


966
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


967
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


968
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


969
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


970
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:13,620


971
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,680
I'm just trying to find out why I'm so

972
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:16,680


973
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,680
That's better.

974
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:25,420
When the trumpet calls, X day.

975
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,860
In a brother and sister band.

976
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,220
When they blow the world away.

977
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,140
We shall have paradise.

978
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,840
Subgenie of the world unite.

979
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,040
Alien sex every night.

980
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,940
Subgenie of the world.

981
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,600
Subgenie of the world.

982
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,640
Subgenie of the world unite.

983
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,160
Stand hand in hand.

984
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,040
When the trumpet calls, X day.

985
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,140
In a brother and sister band.

986
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,940
When they blow the world away.

987
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:13,020


988
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,580
We shall have paradise

989
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,880
Santini of the world, unite

990
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,440
Alien sucks everybody

991
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,040
Santini of the world, Santini of the world

992
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,000
Santini of the world, unite

993
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,240
Ah yes, spread wide for the final ride

994
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,300
Because the X's are coming fast

995
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,400
And you are too

996
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,980
They didn't take us seriously last time

997
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,140
Hell, half of you didn't take us seriously

998
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,340
Didn't take Dog's Prophecy seriously

999
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,180
But this time we've learned our lesson

1000
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:52,820
We can't rely on invisible monsters from outer space

1001
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,880
We can't even rely on Bob

1002
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,000
We have to learn how to escape Earth

1003
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,340
Without being dependent on the conspiracy

1004
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,100
Or any extraterrestrials or salesmen

1005
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,340
Sure, send in your 30 bucks

1006
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,400
But build your own

1007
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:10,960
X's

1008
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:11,420
Ship

1009
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,580
You may not have to

1010
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,120
Just recover your ass

1011
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,360
Build your own ship

1012
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,040
Even better, go buy Hangar Antenna

1013
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,700
Area 51 or Cape Canaveral

1014
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,300
Or Studio 54

1015
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,380
And steal your own ship

1016
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,340
Ah yes, excrete your own fuel

1017
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,340
And while you're at it, friends

1018
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,500
Let's swab the deck on the spaceship

1019
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,680
That we're already stuck together on

1020
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,960
We're already riding on it

1021
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,700
We're riding on the spaceship

1022
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,480
And it's in bad shape

1023
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,520
And it's high time we cleaned it up

1024
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,360
Earth, we must get off

1025
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,860
Whether we leave it or leave it a cinder

1026
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,600
Whether we blow it off or blow it up

1027
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,500
Just don't blow it, friends

1028
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,660
Have you ever stood at the water's edge?

1029
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,980
Watched the waves roll over the window ledge?

1030
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:30,340
See that city shine against a cloudy sky?

1031
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:36,860
Let the day slip by without asking why?

1032
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,940
Footprints in the sandstorm?

1033
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:40,940


1034
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,220
A stretch for a hundred miles?

1035
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,120
And every now and then they're washed away by another tide

1036
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:55,540
But the world still won't make sense for its miles to shine

1037
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,360
And the wind blows through your hair on the final ride

1038
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:07,320
And you let go of all your cares because now it's time to fly

1039
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,920
And your soul is less than a feather in the sky

1040
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:10,920


1041
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:10,920


1042
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:10,920


1043
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,620
And you're not going to be able to bear no more to hide the child

1044
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,380
No more to hide the child

1045
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:26,540
No more to hide the child

1046
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:43,860
Have you ever stood and prayed at the altar steps?

1047
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:50,140
Looking through steel eyes from an eagle's nest?

1048
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:56,520
And watched the waves roll right into the last lost soul?

1049
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:02,840
And take a breath and still your heart and just let go

1050
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,680
Footprints in the sandstretch for a hundred miles

1051
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:14,620
And every now and then they're washed away by another tide

1052
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:21,080
But the world still won't make sense for its miles to shine

1053
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,500
And the wind blows through your hair on the final ride

1054
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:26,920
And the wind blows through your hair on the final ride

1055
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,700
And you let go of all your cares because now it's time to fly

1056
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,680
And your soul is less than a feather in the sky

1057
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:36,680


1058
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,880
And your soul is left to bear no more to hide the child

1059
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,540
No more to hide the child

1060
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,520
No more to hide the child

1061
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:01,500
Fly

1062
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:02,680


1063
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,580
Fly

1064
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,960
Fly

1065
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,080
Fly

1066
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:08,080


1067
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:08,140
Fly

1068
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:08,200
Fly

1069
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,640
So fly

1070
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,140
So high

1071
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,800
Into the sun

1072
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,240
That is the most horrifying thing I've ever heard.

1073
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,440
You are trying to sterilize decent pink American human being.

1074
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:38,080
We're trying to sweep clean the filth and the trash that has ruined this planet.

1075
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,780
It's a small project compared to those of our mentors, the exes from outer space.

1076
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:51,000
They would have cleaned up the vermin, which we call humans, long, long ago.

1077
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:57,940
Thousands of years ago had Bob, the first Bob, not intervened and won his bar bet with Satan.

1078
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,440
And that's why we're here now.

1079
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,760
Bob won that bet for your sins, brother, sistress.

1080
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,400
So get in the pot.

1081
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,180
Get in the pot.

1082
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:08,180


1083
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:08,400
Get in the pot.

1084
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,880
Bob's cooking you up.

1085
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,020
Get in the pot.

1086
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,440
Don't let them sunglasses matter.

1087
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,080
The sun's dancing around.

1088
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,300
We're going to cook up the missionaries.

1089
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,980
Get in the pot.

1090
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,380
And the volunteers.

1091
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,560
July 5th, 1998.

1092
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,700
It's coming up this year.

1093
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:33,740
The DJs, the MCs are all in the giant pot being cooked as the Malaysian natives dance around the great cauldron of Dogstown.

1094
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,440
My kind of fear may fake again.

1095
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,740
I've got funny shoes.

1096
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,540
They're so well made.

1097
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,280
Do they come from the king?

1098
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,260
You can find out all you'd like to there.

1099
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,040
www.subgenius.com

1100
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:54,680
