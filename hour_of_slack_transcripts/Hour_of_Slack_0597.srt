1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
We broadcast during the hours when the mind's grip on what it knows is at its weakest.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,900
The day hours of the morning between 4.30 and 6 o'clock.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:17,220
This is the time when ancient superstitions and night fears have the greatest hold on human thoughts.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,880
The time when those who sleep are deep in their dreams.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,980
And this is the hour when on the church of the subgenius radio show the doctors of the air operate without warning.

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,420
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,840
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius hour of black.

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,120
We inhabit a twilight world.

9
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,600
A world which feels the rising sun.

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,980
Long life.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,860
After nightfall.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,960
When the witching hour has been dead for three and a half hours.

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,120
We rise from our coffins and go forth to stalk our living victims.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,380
You, our beloved audience.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,220
Good hunting brothers.

16
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,380
Howl.

17
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,000
This is Dr. Howl.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,020
Wailing in the night.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,200
For that which lived, which is dead.

20
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,420
And for that which is dead.

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:29,980
Was dead.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,620
And in fact was never alive.

23
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,440
So we're moving.

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,460
We get back to Bob.

25
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,800
Oh, hello boys and girls.

26
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,960
We're back again with the Reverend Ivan Stang.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,620
The tape will last another 45 minutes or so.

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,900
I'm Mr. Froelich and I'm your host today, boys and girls.

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:56,380
And this is the Reverend Ivan Stang to tell us about the church of the subgenius and Bob, his friend.

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,320
Before you get on to Bob.

31
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,920
Let me just do one thing.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Show up for the showdown.

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,780
You can bleep this out later.

34
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,880
I should have done this when you flipped your tape.

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,500
You're listening to...

36
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,840
It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here.

37
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,500
The secret that unlocks flavor.

38
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,700
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,740
Everybody say amen.

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,020
Amen.

41
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,720
Amen.

42
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,020
Amen.

43
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,360
It's not very...

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,940
Amen.

45
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,960
It's not very...

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,420
Easy living in here.

47
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:31,900
Remember that.

48
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:43,960
Well, in answer to your question, Chaz, the church of the subgenius was started by Bob to reveal the dangers of bug pornography.

49
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,520
And as a matter of fact, you know, I hate to harp on this subject.

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,360
But, you know, as a preacher, I have to bring this kind of thing to people's attention.

51
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,700
I feel it's my responsibility.

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,560
Now, about a year or two ago, we started making these funny jokes.

53
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,860
About bug porn.

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,440
It was actually inspired by some toasterized, psychedelicized versions.

55
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,560
Footage from an old movie called The Hellstrom Chronicle featuring really cool pictures of bugs.

56
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:23,740
Well, I thought that any, you know, healthy young subgenius would be really turned on by these cute naked, naked bugs.

57
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,880
And we...

58
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,140
It was a big funny joke.

59
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,020
But, friends, I don't know about you.

60
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,700
But I went...

61
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,440
I went to the movies for the first time in about three months tonight.

62
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,000
And, uh...

63
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:43,580
Well, there was a trailer for this one movie called Starship Troopers.

64
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:54,120
And it was nothing but ocean and a flood of giant, monstrous bugs sweeping over these soldiers in the future.

65
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,940
They were just blowing the giant ticks.

66
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,040
And so...

67
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,080
So forth with the way...

68
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,440
It was bug porn is what it was.

69
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,340
Bug death porn.

70
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,320
Same thing.

71
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,600
I mean, when you're talking bugs, sex, and death, they're about the...

72
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:17,020
You know that scene where the female praying mantis chews the head off of her mate right after he has done it with her?

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,640
And...

74
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,380
And...

75
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,060
And...

76
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,680
And...

77
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:19,760
And...

78
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,060
Investigated her eggs and so forth.

79
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,260
But, friends, that's just...

80
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,600
It's just exactly like your relationship.

81
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,480
To your boss.

82
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,840
Now, think about it, ain't it?

83
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,500
Anyway, the point is...

84
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,640
Okay, so Starship Troopers coming out.

85
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,420
Bug porn.

86
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:35,900
Right.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,900
There's another movie out now, I believe, called Mimic.

88
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:46,260
Which has something to do with the hideous monster bugs that disguise themselves as people or something like that.

89
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:54,440
And, of course, I saw all these trailers while going to see the movie Men in Black.

90
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,600
You know, it's odd how every summer...

91
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:58,680
Every summer...

92
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,300
They come out with a subgenius movie, so to speak.

93
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,760
Where the conspiracy takes what Bob's been saying all along and turns it around on his head.

94
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:16,200
All of a sudden, the men in black aren't some sort of sinister government group.

95
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,400
There are good friends that save us from knowing the terrible truth.

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,020
Because then we just wouldn't be happy if we knew about all those aliens ready to pounce on us and destroy our planet any second.

97
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:35,380
Why, if we thought the National Enquirer was more true than CNN and NPR...

98
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,700
Why, wouldn't...

99
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,360
That would just destroy our faith in reality.

100
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,600
Now, wouldn't it be?

101
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:52,160
And, of course, last summer they had to do the movie where the aliens invaded the Earth and the Earth fought back and won.

102
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,960
Well, I guess then, as Dr. Leguim was saying, next year, 1998...

103
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,860
That summer movie will show aliens that come.

104
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,360
Benevolent, wonderful aliens that come and take over the whole world.

105
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:16,080
And the only ones who fight back against the aliens will be the bad, antisocial people.

106
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,100
They'll be the bad guys in the movie.

107
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,440
Funny how they always seem to turn it around on your friends.

108
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,100
You ever notice how the people in the movies that look like you are always the bad guys?

109
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:28,520
No.

110
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,940
They're not even the main bad guys.

111
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,700
They're the bad guys' minions.

112
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,440
Right?

113
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:32,900
Right.

114
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,520
You're talking about me, man.

115
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,440
Watching, and it could be a fiction or non-fiction.

116
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:39,940
Cops.

117
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,440
It could be, you know, any cop show, any crime show, any bad guy.

118
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,300
I'm one of the guys that get roughed up for the information.

119
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,460
You know, I look at them, I guess I look at myself.

120
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,680
There's a receding hairline that kind of like, hey, maybe, like, might be Italian or something.

121
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,940
You know, it's like, you know, it's like...

122
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,880
You're the one that spills his guts.

123
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,240
Hey, man.

124
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,300
Because, like, you know, it's Batman, right?

126
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:01,700
You know?

127
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,340
You spill your guts and are left humiliated.

128
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,820
You get the bad guy that doesn't even get killed.

129
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,300
It's better than spilling your bladder all over Batman's shoes, man.

130
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:14,980
Yeah.

131
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah.

132
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,220
Yeah.

133
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,600
Yeah.

134
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,260
Yeah.

135
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,220
Yeah.

136
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,220


137
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,220


138
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,220

Him and Joe Bob and Billy Bob.

Isn't that too, Ed Bob?

166
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,540
In between the

167
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,040
Glitz band talk,

168
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,520
this is Lost Straight Jackets

169
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,080
in the background.

170
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,380
If I had a dime

171
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,740
for every time I had my face

172
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,700
buried in a big bowl of

173
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,640
killed...

174
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,640
Well, friends,

175
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,840
you know, I'd have $1.50 now.

176
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,640
Dobbs spelled backwards

177
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,660
is still

178
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,420
Spod.

179
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,540
Wow. That's cosmic.

180
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,620
That's real cosmic.

181
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,000
I can't go there.

182
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,300
That was revealed to us

183
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,140
very recently

184
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,000
that Dobbs

185
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,220
spelled backwards

186
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,080
is still

187
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,160
Spod.

188
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,960
Man.

189
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,300
Spod Bob.

190
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,960
Spod Bob.

191
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,820
Natas.

192
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,640
With

193
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,220
kids

194
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,500
and

195
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,680
tears.

196
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,540
You also heard from something

197
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,420
from a band called

198
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:44,800
We

199
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,780
from the album

200
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,640
The Mollusk.

201
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,440
Tell the golden eel.

202
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,660
Was that the back?

203
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,180
Was that the Backmaskers?

204
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,600
That was a great band.

205
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,580
The Backmaskers?

206
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:54,980
Yeah.

207
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,460
Is that anything like

208
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,240
Batmasterson?

209
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,880
No, no.

210
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,280
No?

211
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,680
Totally different, but similar.

212
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,100
They were Christian rock.

213
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,780
Christian rock.

214
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,460
The Backmaskers.

215
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,900
We like Christian rock.

216
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,860
Bob Larson and the Backmaskers,

217
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,320
I think.

218
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,320
That was a killer

219
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,040
metal band, dude.

220
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,720
Oh.

221
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,700
Oh, Bob,

222
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,660
he don't do metal

223
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,900
like he used to no more.

224
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,320
I don't know what happened

225
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,720
with that.

226
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,980
You don't have the

227
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,740
Pat Boone heavy metal album,

228
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,080
do you?

229
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,960
I've never heard that.

230
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:20,640
We have it.

231
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,720
I figured you probably

232
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,620
must have it.

233
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,400
We do have it.

234
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,360
I've never heard any

235
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,580
of that Pat Boone

236
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,140
heavy metal.

237
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,840
I understand he covers

238
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,960
Ozzy Osbourne

239
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,360
and Hendrix.

240
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,180
Yeah.

241
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,720
Unfortunately,

242
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,460
I'm not sure whether

243
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,200
it's filed under

244
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,540
pop or heavy metal.

245
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,340
Or comedy.

246
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:37,960
Comedy.

247
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,260
It's kind of one of

248
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,660
those dichotomies.

249
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,060
You don't know

250
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,760
where to put it.

251
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,700
Bulldada.

252
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,800
You put it in the

253
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,760
Bulldada section.

254
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,380
Unfortunately,

255
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,840
the station is run

256
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,560
by pinks,

257
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,020
so you don't have

258
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,560
a Bulldada.

259
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,220
It magically

260
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,900
appears

261
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,360
from nowhere.

262
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,500
I got no friends

263
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,280
cause they read

264
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,320
the papers.

265
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,580
You know

266
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,860
you can't be seen

267
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,480
with me.

268
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,940
And I'm getting

269
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,160
a shot down

270
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,940
and I'm

271
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,860
feeling mean.

272
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:08,760
So,

273
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,180
no more

274
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,740
Mr. Nice Guy.

275
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,700
No more

276
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,020
Mr. Pink.

277
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,240
No more

278
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,820
Mr. Nice Guy.

279
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,540
No more

280
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,500
Mr. Nice Guy.

281
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,960
No more

282
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:23,960


283
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:23,960


284
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:23,960


285
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:23,960


286
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:23,960


287
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:23,960


288
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:23,960


289
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,280
My dog

290
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,180
bit me on

291
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,840
the leg

292
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,260
today.

293
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:27,960
My cat

294
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,840
clawed

295
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,780
my eyes.

296
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,620
My mom's

297
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,000
been thrown

298
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,420
out of

299
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:32,960
the society

300
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,600
circle.

301
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,240
My dad

302
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,960
passed

303
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,620
a high.

304
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,780
I'm

305
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:38,920
the

306
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,260
church

307
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,040
in

308
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,600
Koran.

309
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,340
Yes, dear friends, and this music...

310
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,420
Pardon me, Cthulhu.

311
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,680
This music in the background is Hate.

312
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,840
Hate for a Pink Planet.

313
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,740
Actually, from the tape, Hate for a Pink Planet.

314
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,060
I don't know what the name of the tune is.

315
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:16,700
Cow Flesh.

316
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,920
Something about cow flesh.

317
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,680
And, friends, we've got lots of backed-up gleet and backed-up tapes

318
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,880
from WMUH in Allentown, Reverend Ed Strange's show,

319
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,560
and WCSB in Cleveland, the Einstein Secret Orchestra show

320
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,840
with Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

321
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,340
And so let's just sink right on back down

322
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,040
into...

323
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:02,900
Before the Dave Man, it was the Ur-Dave and the Ur-Bob

324
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,420
and the Ur-Urs

325
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,400
and the ancient Dave Man

326
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,320
and the Dave Bob

327
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,040
and the Ur-Bob

328
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,300
and the Dave Bob

329
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,660
and his only natural enemy...

330
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,020
The one with the pasty-pasty...

331
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,700
...would nonetheless get together

332
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,840
and strive night after night

333
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,100
to invent the pipe.

334
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,960
For in that day, man had the frop

335
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,440
but yet had not invented the pipe.

336
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,520
Now was there the knowledge to use the frop or the pipe?

337
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,740
The two were confused somehow.

338
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,840
Sometimes one would put the...

339
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,600
in the pipe, other times some would put the pipe in the frop and try to light the pipe

340
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,040
and smoke the frop, it did not work.

341
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,100
The silly, primitive, superstitious Dave men would attempt to pack the frop into openings

342
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,800
in their bodies, under their eyelids, up exit wounds and into trepanation holes.

343
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:17,120
Or, mistakenly, by the same token, the other tribe, the Dave Bobs, would pack the pipes

344
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,500
into their orifices and their trepanation holes in a silly, superstitious attempt to

345
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:32,620
see the gods, or see visions of the future, diagnose sicknesses and heal the lovely virgins

346
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,300
of the tribe.

347
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,780
One day, however, the Dave Bobs would be able to see the gods, or see visions of the future,

348
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:48,620
while blindly stumbling around in a glue-huffing haze, a stupid cave Dave, a Dave man, and a

349
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,240
Dave Bob, bumped into each other.

350
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,020
Hey, said the Dave Bob, your frop fell into my pipe.

351
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:02,400
Hey, said the Bob Dave, your pipe fell into my exit wound.

352
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,360
Say, if only it suddenly...

353
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,980
A bolt of lightning struck from the sky as a result of an alien spacecraft from Atlantis

354
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:18,580
flying overhead, and a huge, flat monolith and a bunch of apes throwing bones in slow

355
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,140
motion through the air and so forth.

356
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,380
Altogether, man was enlightened and grew a brain and a thumb.

357
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:35,120
And with the brain and the thumb, he went on to create mistakes beyond the wildest imagining.

358
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,160
He even thought of the most logical aliens.

359
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,740
And that is why this planet has been slated for extermination.

360
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,020
Or fumigation, we should say.

361
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,360
They're not really trying to exterminate.

362
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,660
They just want to run the bugs out, so to speak.

363
00:20:51,720 --> 00:21:02,700
We friends, as much as we might lust after or despise the little insects and arthropods,

364
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,760
cephalopods and so forth, that crawl beneath the surface of the planet, and that get sucked

365
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:05,760


366
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:05,760


367
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:15,140
our feet. So we too, so-called mankind, are but the bugs. In fact, not even the bugs,

368
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:24,160
the mere photos of bug pornography of some aliens whose lives and mentalities we could

369
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,300
not imagine in our wildest dreams, who in fact would be more sophisticated than what

370
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:39,400
we call God. God is a bug, and you must face it. You are his bug, and he will swat you

371
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:48,700
just as you swat that little fly. Yes, friends, God is a bug, and you are a bug, about to

372
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:55,540
be swat by a bigger bug. God, in fact, is a tarantula, a hairy-legged tarantula with

373
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,060
eight eyes and hideous drooling fangs. And a hairy appetite.

374
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:09,660
God, the tarantula, loves you. He loves you with a universal cosmic juicy

375
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:21,900
papa love. He, she loves you like a rock. He, she, he, she loves you like a rock.

376
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,460
The Dave men circle around the altar.

377
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:39,340
They have the captured Dave Bob strapped up with a cave bear skull, surrounded by cave

378
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:39,860
bear skulls.

379
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,260
I've got too many syllables in it, man.

380
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,640
Go away, boy.

381
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,120
That's how I like to run.

382
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,020
You're doing it wrong.

383
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,120
He's grinning like an idiot, happy to be sacrificed to the gods.

384
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,240
Man, this is not right. This is not right at all.

385
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,000
This was the beginning of religion, friends.

386
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,280
This is how...

387
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,740
We're morally made.

388
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,680
How it began.

389
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:10,660
Confused idiots stumbling around in the dim mists of the ancient past, bumping into trees

390
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,940
because the mist was so thick.

391
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,040
And mistaking those trees for monsters, mistaking the shiny lights up in the sky for angels.

392
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:29,120
And every time the old lady got sick and then got well again and the medicine man claimed

393
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,280
that he was the one who made her.

394
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,140
Well, everyone believed him.

395
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:38,820
And friends, you know, back in them days, back in the day, back when even old Reverend

396
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,540
Stang was young, there was hunters and there was gatherers.

397
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,180
That's right.

398
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,720
And mostly it was the men doing the hunting and there's the women doing the gathering.

399
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,200
And some, some fame men and some real horny guys hanging around the women doing the gathering.

400
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,720
Well, and then there was the subgeniuses and they were the ones who, for whatever reason,

401
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,200
sometimes it was merely nearsighted.

402
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,100
Sometimes it was a mutated brain or a lack of an opposable thumb.

403
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:05,520
Yep.

404
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,060
The subgeniuses were not as good at hunting.

405
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,360
They just couldn't hit as many rabbits with those silly little bow, birch bows.

406
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
Mutations, you know.

407
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,760
And they weren't very good warriors because they weren't stupid and they usually fled

408
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,560
from wars.

409
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,120
Yeah.

410
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:29,960
Thus, they had to, but they didn't want to be gatherers because, well,

411
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,680
it was boring, man.

412
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,380
Yeah.

413
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,620
Come on, let's just fake it.

414
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,820
It's boring to gather stuff.

415
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:42,000
So, there was nothing left for these type of Dave men but to become medicine men.

416
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:51,900
Priests, padres, you know, gurus, and mystical lawyers, doctors, you know what I mean?

417
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:59,220
The guy that doesn't have to go out rabbit hunting gets to ask the cute girls to undress

418
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,280
and then...

419
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:05,780
Has people bring him all kinds of, you know, bring him rabbits, good food, and so forth.

420
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:12,760
Never has to leave the comfort of his cave because he happened to know that if he told

421
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,200
a big enough lie, those fools would probably believe it.

422
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,280
Hey, listen to this one, buddy.

423
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,520
I was circling around the canyon a few minutes ago and there was this mastodon there, man.

424
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,880
I'm telling you, this mastodon was a mega mastodon, you know what I'm saying?

425
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,160
I mean, I'm saying this mastodon was as big as the whole canyon.

426
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,400
Right?

427
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,220
So, look up.

428
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,040
What do I do?

429
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,480
Good old yo, yo, yo, what?

430
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,180
Look up.

431
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,580
Look up.

432
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,220
Look what I do.

433
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,420
I'll get me a rock, man.

434
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,260
One little teeny old rock and I'll fling that thing as hard as I can.

435
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,860
I'll take that mastodon down and...

436
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,540
Hey, yeah, but there ain't nothing left, you see, because I was a powerful man hungry

437
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,980
and so I did that whole mastodon by myself.

438
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,700
Now, ladies, you're looking for a real hunter, man?

439
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,800
Just line up over here.

440
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

441
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,420
Oh, you think that medicine man Dave will come over today?

442
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,720
Oh, I love the way he massages me.

443
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,160
My toe.

444
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,320
Oh, it's so good.

445
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:08,460
Yeah, we must go out and get the Dave man, his special magic roots and berries that make

446
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,660
him drunk and high so that he will be able to talk to the gods and tell us what the future

447
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,060
holds.

448
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,060
Children, children, listen to me.

449
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,720
I'm the shaman, shaman.

450
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,660
I'm a guru's guru.

451
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,980
I'm a mystic mystic.

452
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,340
Look into my magic eye.

453
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,820
Boys and girls, you've been falsely led.

454
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,280
You're following that Dave.

455
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,780
You're following that stag.

456
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,820
You're following that yes, oh God.

457
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,680
Listen to me.

458
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,180
It's me.

459
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:30,620
Yeah.

460
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,860
I'm a Dave follower.

461
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,040
I'm a Dave-ophile.

462
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,520
Praise Dave.

463
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,100
Dave has the church of the lone gemus.

464
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,100
I'm a little dreamer like an umbilical needle.

465
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,920
He says cosmic stuff.

466
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,120
I do it up.

467
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,920
It, it, he, he shows us how to hate the man.

468
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,220
I watch them.

469
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,120
The big man.

470
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,280
The big man.

471
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,060
Walk funny.

472
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,260
The brain man.

473
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,420
I teach the brain who learn about the walk funny.

474
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,720
shows us how to hate and drug.

475
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,440
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm the brain man who teach the brain man how to

476
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,800
walk funny on the grid.

477
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,920
Damn predictable.

478
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,220
Yeah, burn, baby.

479
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,340
Baby.

480
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:19,720


481
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,660
boil down on abalm, abalm, abalm, abalm, abalm

482
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,680
Michael for veiled nuts and poverty even

483
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,240
ego.

484
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,160
Really?

485
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


486
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


487
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


488
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


489
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


490
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,280


491
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,000
So desperate to become a girl, he tried to castrate himself.

492
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,120
Believe it or not, mother and daughter used to be mother and son.

493
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,500
What I believe is that there is one way, God's way.

494
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,580
The soul and the mind and the heart.

495
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,140
A penis does not make a person.

496
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,700
You are so idiotic.

497
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,140
You're trying to tell us what we can and cannot do.

498
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,300
You're trying to arrest us.

499
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,060
You come to my shows and put me in jail for what people pay to see.

500
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,660
And your people are coming and locking me up.

501
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,380
You can't lock me up.

502
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,620
It was beauty who killed the beast.

503
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
And the son.

504
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,180
The son.

505
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,500
Keeping him out could make him worse.

506
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,620
After all, he is crazy.

507
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,360
And you can't get through to him.

508
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,680
This organization and the law thing.

509
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,860
The sky and the earth.

510
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,780
The sky and the earth.

511
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,260
This is not a place for a rabbi.

512
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,460
Singular and subgenius harp.

513
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,500
It's funny how they use that phrase, Jews harp.

514
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,660
Because it's here on Earth.

515
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,220
Because we know they won't be able to go to heaven and have a harp.

516
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,660
Not if the Christians have their way.

517
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,820
The Christians have their way, they'll take up where Hitler left off.

518
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,780
Oh, yes.

519
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,340
Especially those Lutherans.

520
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,160
Don't you even talk about Lutherans to me.

521
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,360
Bavarians and krauts.

522
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,560
Oh, God, I married a Lutheran.

523
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,720
My first wife was a Lutheran.

524
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,260
Oh.

525
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,320
Jesus Christ!

526
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,240
You damn Lutheran bastard.

527
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,380
Lutherans would throw you all into an oven.

528
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,700
That's right.

529
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,940
They'd throw all of you into an oven,

530
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,300
and they'd throw all of us into an oven,

531
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,640
and they'd throw those Jews into an oven,

532
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,960
the ones they couldn't make.

533
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,300
Oh, but the Papists would throw the Lutherans into the oven.

534
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:10,980
That's right.

535
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,680
And the Southern Baptists would throw the Papists

536
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,120
and the Disneyites into the oven.

537
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,840
But I, in the name of Bob,

538
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,360
would throw them all into the oven

539
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:26,100
and cook up a great batch of gingerbread men,

540
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,160
which I would then sit down and pass out to the children

541
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,300
at Halloween.

542
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,980
Ah, yes.

543
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,980
Dear little children,

544
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,520
there's a bit of God in every bite.

545
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,380
Oh.

546
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,960
But if you're lucky,

547
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,240
you won't eat that one first bite.

548
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,520
Eat of this, for this is my flesh,

549
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,980
and this is my blood.

550
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,180
Hey, kids, next time you take communion,

551
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,580
steal part of the wafer and the blood,

552
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,080
the wine that's been consecrated,

553
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,960
sneak it out,

554
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,300
and send it to us at P.O. Box 14306,

555
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,660
Dallas, Texas, 7 by 214,

556
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,260
because we have cloning devices.

557
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,700
You can't imagine how easy it is

558
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,540
for that man Bob to clone,

559
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,860
an army of Jesuses,

560
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,880
from those little communion wafers

561
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,000
and that fake blood, that wine.

562
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,040
It's not fake.

563
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,540
It really is the blood of Jesus

564
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,920
when those papists are through with it.

565
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,660
And we can take that blood

566
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,980
and make another Jesus,

567
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,780
and another, and another,

568
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,340
until a great army of Jesuses

569
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,280
is marching down I-95,

570
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,460
marching, slouching towards Bethlehem Steel,

571
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,720
and there,

572
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,520
there,

573
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,120
to, to,

574
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,760
all led by Bob,

575
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,080
blindfolded,

576
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,780
as Bob always leads,

577
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,700
he will sack his army of Jesus

578
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,600
onto all your enemies.

579
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,020
Yes, he'll do it for you.

580
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,540
And Jesus will kill for you.

581
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,960
You will have your own personal Jesus clone

582
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,800
killing for you.

583
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,960
Jesus killed for you.

584
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,520
You will be your own sin

585
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,800
if you have faith in Bob.

586
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,040
And the best part,

587
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,220
they'll clone the whole thing,

588
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,820
except for the brain.

589
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,520
We wouldn't want a million Jesuses

590
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,940
with brains.

591
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,260
No, we want the kind of,

592
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,740
we want a subgenius Jesus, friends.

593
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:36,480
Yeah.

594
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,240
Actually you don't have to.

595
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,640
We have the brainless sub-Jesus

596
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,320
already in Dallas, Texas.

597
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,660
We clone from him.

598
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,320
We don't need,

599
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,940
you don't really have to steal anything

600
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,960
from the Catholic church.

601
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,380
Because yes, friends,

602
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,820
Jesus Christ walks the earth again.

603
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,120
In Dallas, Texas, formerly of Cleveland.

604
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,560
Hi, Jesus.

605
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,340
Hope you're listening to this tape.

606
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,460
Yes.

607
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,840
People, you know, people don't,

608
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,660
they don't take us seriously.

609
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,620
A lot of Christians lately,

610
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,700
you know, it's like I'll be at some booth at a convention,

611
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,360
hawking the goods, preaching the word,

612
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,060
some nice, well-meaning, you know,

613
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,460
Christian will come by and go,

614
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,220
I'm gonna pray for you because you're going to hell.

615
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,300
That, you know, kindly way that they have.

616
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,740
And I try to tell them, it's like,

617
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,820
look, we've got Jesus, what do you mean we don't have,

618
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,180
we've got Jesus, we've got more Jesus

619
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,440
than you ever thought about.

620
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,180
I have to cook dinner for Jesus every night.

621
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,680
It's a big deal.

622
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,640
We don't pay him much else.

623
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,580
But they don't, they don't believe it.

624
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,820
How much is a Jesus really worth?

625
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,600
How much do you really believe?

626
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,700
And if they, if this Jesus came knocking at their door,

627
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,860
do you think they'd let him in?

628
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,980
Oh no, they'd demand some kind of dog and pony show for him.

629
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,260
Well, don't think high and dry.

630
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,860
See, I'm not afraid to die.

631
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,100
And I do it every time you walk by.

632
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,680
It's the power of God.

633
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:09,680


634
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:09,680


635
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,580
In the ancient times, before the world was created,

636
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:31,680
the Dave was enjoying with the gopis and the women cow herders in the lake.

637
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,780
He would bash in the blissful illumination of the Gordoba.

638
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,260
And if one day the Dave demanded,

639
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:46,920
that the river come and wash him as he enjoyed and was enjoying with the gopis.

640
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:52,520
I wish all the gopis would wash me up while I'm being engulfed by the river of life.

641
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,520
But the river of life, thinking he was drunk, ignored him and refused to do it.

642
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,960
And so he became angered at the river of life.

643
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,640
Enraged.

644
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,120
Enraged he became.

645
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,000
Enraged.

646
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,040
And he, and he.

647
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,220
He cried.

648
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,500
He pulled from his whip.

649
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:18,880
He pulled from his toga, his sacred holy toga of heads and tails.

650
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,320
He pulled his great whip of a thousand headed snake.

651
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,020
The thousand headed snake of the Dave from beneath his toga.

652
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,460
And he used it to stir the vast ocean of toxins.

653
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:38,040
Which had, and from the ocean of toxins he was able to suck one tiny drop of milk.

654
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:46,340
And when this drop of milk shriveled from his mouth, that formed all of the insects of

655
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,040
the world.

656
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,000
And that is how insects and bugs came to be.

657
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,740
Then the Dave, seeing that they were stupid and no better than a Macintosh and without

658
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:03,820
a soul, gave them sexual organs of a sort.

659
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,800
They called cloacas or something.

660
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,380
A rhino.

661
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,020
A rhino.

662
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,720
A rhino.

663
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:17,100
And so these bugs enjoyed themselves, like just as Dave had been enjoying.

664
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,740
Those tiny little bugs.

665
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:24,440
Isn't religion wonderful, friends, when we are able to explain to you in such concise

666
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:33,020
terms, the very beginning of the universe, the creation of life and so forth by this

667
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,860
purse, perfect personality of the Godhead.

668
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:54,760
And so, the Buddha, Krishna, Vishnu, Kali, Kanti, and Kunti, all at once, all mixed together,

669
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,360
personified.

670
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,260
And Reverend Sun Yung Moon.

671
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,580
And L. Ron Hubbard.

672
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,560
And L. Ron.

673
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,060
All reincarnated.

674
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,420
And Jimi Hendrix and Elvis.

675
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,840
All mixed together in one perfect body.

676
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:06,840


677
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:14,580
And the perfect Godhead, who people in this foolish world mistake for just another poor,

678
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:22,660
miserable, bald-headed, struggling writer, guitar player, musician, radio personality,

679
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,920
perfect personification of the Godhead.

680
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,940
Oh, praise the supreme Godhead of Dave!

681
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,360
Man, my mouth tastes like moldy Salisbury steak.

682
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,820
And that bottle of alcohol.

683
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:36,820


684
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:36,820


685
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:36,820


686
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:36,820


687
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,740
Oh, the Irish are keeping.

688
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,440
Ever wondered why the universe seemed kind of screwed up and imperfect, friends?

689
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,920
I don't know if I'm going to make it one more day.

690
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,080
Well, you're listening to the supreme creator, this guy standing next to me in this college

691
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,040
radio station.

692
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,020
I guess what I ought to do is create me some more worlds.

693
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,200
Now, I created enough worlds.

694
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,400
I got some perfected worlds I already created.

695
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,660
I just keep my mind off things.

696
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,800
I go boy, I'm going to go to the moon.

697
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:06,800


698
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:06,800


699
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,780
For a little while, I'll have a few more beers.

700
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,760
Now, I think you're right.

701
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,060
Lord, why don't you just ditch those worlds you've created and just start fresh?

702
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,740
Try something new.

703
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,880
Yeah, start fresh.

704
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,800
Yeah, I'm starting.

705
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,940
Try a silicon-based life form instead of carbon-based.

706
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,480
Okay.

707
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,760
Try a negative universe or something.

708
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,880
My mind is stirring in the void.

709
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,120
I've got to make a pronouncement.

710
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,960
I've got to tell everybody what is currently a carbon-based life form, which is pretty,

711
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,620
you know, kind of countable.

712
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:36,780


713
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,620
I'm going to keep things going.

714
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,940
I'm going to switch over sometime in the next six months.

715
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,940
That's a mini-cycle.

716
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,080
Okay.

717
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,140
Hey, man, I've got Kai's Power Evolution version 3.2.

718
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,720
That might help you out.

719
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:52,940
Yeah.

720
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,180
Then you won't have to read the instruction book.

721
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,300
You just push the button.

722
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,860
Yeah.

723
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,740
The button that says create cool as hell worlds.

724
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,600
Yeah.

725
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,780
I'll give them all a call and plant in each one of their minds an idea of a role game.

726
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,160


727
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,300
Yeah.

728
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,560
A role game?

729
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,180
Yeah, a role-playing game.

730
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,340
It's so that way when a transition comes and they all got to go and the new life forms

731
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:21,020
take over, they won't feel so bad about decapitating their habitations and so forth.

732
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,560
Hey, that's a great idea, Lord.

733
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,560
So when you inundate or destroy the world like you did in Noah's day, you're going to

734
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,940
give them a sort of a consolation prize?

735
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,140
That's right.

736
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,860
A subgenius role-playing game.

737
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,080
Are those rolls like sticky buns?

738
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,460
Big old fireproof boats.

739
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:36,780
Yeah.

740
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,540
Those sticky buns.

741
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,140
Yeah.

742
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,280
Yeah.

743
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,420
The purple sticky buns they call them?

744
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:41,740
Yeah.

745
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:41,960
Yeah.

746
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,640
I know what they'll do.

747
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,340
Once they all climb aboard them fireproof boats, see they get off and stuff like that,

748
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,960
I will save me a few, they'll get all the purple sticky buns.

749
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,200
Yeah, as they're kind of like reward for playing the role game right.

750
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,540
What if they don't take it right?

751
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,620
There's a lot of screwy apples out there I got to deal with.

752
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,680
90% of them look like me.

753
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,280
Hey, an afterlife.

754
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,240
Make an afterlife for them.

755
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,000
Like a big trash can for the ones that you already created.

756
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,460
Got it.

757
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,160
It's just like on your computer.

758
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,360
You still want the stuff, but you know, you're done using it right there and then, and then

759
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,520
so you get rid of the one part of it and keep the other part and encode it and stuff.

760
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,840
That's it, I'll encode all the suckers.

761
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,840
Yeah, I'll encode them.

762
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:32,480
I'll take their souls and I'll stuff them right back in, just like it was some kind

763
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,780
of bad drug for me.

764
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,880
Yeah.

765
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:41,060
That's it, I'll make them all like a, yeah, what's that one hallucinogenic that them sweetest

766
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,120
kids are getting off on that they're all committing suicide?

767
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,760
Oh, Puffer, Puffer, the Puffer Blowfish Lord.

768
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,280
Yeah, I'll have them all sucking puffer blowfish on Fugu.

769
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:58,780
And then, once they discombobulate off into them fireproof ships and they're eating all

770
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,940
the purple sticky buns, I'll have my children's back.

771
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,860
But, it will last forever.

772
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,460
What am I gonna do with them then?

773
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,780
Oh yeah, that's right, I'm gonna encode them.

774
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,140
And then the judgment.

775
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,300
Yeah.

776
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,840
At the end of time.

777
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:13,360
Yeah.

778
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,140
Remember, Lord?

779
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:14,660
Yeah.

780
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:21,960
Pity the poor fallen god who cannot remember his divinity from one minute to the next.

781
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,160
I don't even remember being there.

782
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,440
If he hadn't done so much drugs, he'd be able to remember that he was the god.

783
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,080
If you could be smart, if for once in your life you could be smart enough to remember

784
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:39,900
that you were god and all things are connected, it wouldn't be a problem.

785
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:45,260
If for once in your life you could be smart enough to figure that out, then it would all

786
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,600
be taken care of.

787
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,980
You'd have the answer.

788
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,700
Yeah, I got a better idea.

789
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,060
God?

790
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,240
I'll start a new other religion that'll be better than that religion based on encoding

791
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:55,740
them and stuff.

792
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,820
I'll tell them all somehow they're all god and I'll let them think that they're all god

793
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,200
somehow.

794
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,580
Oh, you can let them make their own religions.

795
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:03,940
Yeah.

796
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,440
That'd be better, man.

797
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,420
They'd beat you to it.

798
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,120
Oh, man.

799
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,740
Good lord, you've let your creation beat you to it.

800
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,540
Once again.

801
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,440
Once again, I'm on the backslide.

802
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,800
In fact, you're letting one of your creations be right you.

803
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,500
Wait a minute.

804
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,820
Once again, I'm on the downside of evolution.

805
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,820
Once again, I'm descending further and further and further into matter.

806
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,020
Now, wait a minute.

807
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,260
I've done 50,000, 50,000 plants this year.

808
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,060
Once again, the creation turns upon its creator.

809
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,040
And I want to Jesus, or Avatar, or someone, each one of them.

810
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,300
You still are.

811
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,840
I can't.

812
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,480
I can't.

813
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:33,620
I can't.

814
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:33,680
I can't.

815
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,040
I can't.

816
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,040


817
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,940
I can't.

818
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:36,940


819
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:36,940


820
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:36,940


821
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:36,940


822
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:36,940


823
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:36,940


824
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:36,940


825
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:43,040
Get him.

826
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,640
Get him.

827
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:48,780
All right.

828
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,120
Cool.

829
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,320
Lets run a little for the goodin' right now, man.

830
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,320


831
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,320


832
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,320


833
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,320


834
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,340
I want to, you know...

835
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,840
It's kLA competitions and I don't think we've done that well, have we, formergy bueno?

836
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:54,840


837
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,460
Did somebody have the dup plaint on it?

838
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:55,460


839
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:55,460


840
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,800
Oh, it came from my grandfather.

841
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,880
We have so many adaoth κα Kritik.

842
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,880
just don't even think about that sort of thing.

843
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,980
But we say, why not just all out declare war on God?

844
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,500
Yes, Reverend, yes.

845
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,640
Join the war on God, friends.

846
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,200
We just thought of that just now.

847
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,220
Unfortunately, God being Lonesome Cowboy Dave here,

848
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,960
it's hardly a very exciting big movement to get behind,

849
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,000
so I don't expect it to be as big as, say, Mormonism,

850
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,140
Lonesome Christianity, or Heaven's Gate.

851
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,120
He's just not nice.

852
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,080
Down with God and down with Satan.

853
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,400
Oh, needless to say.

854
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,140
Up marriage. Up marriage.

855
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,620
Both of them.

856
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,700
Down marriage.

857
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,560
Well, we...

858
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,140
Down marriage.

859
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,280
You know, I mean, if God goes down, Satan's certainly going to be...

860
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,520
I mean, that guy's just dead and no...

861
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,600
It's just one of the kids, right?

862
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,380
I don't know, Reverend. I was listening to you.

863
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,700
I thought you had all the answers.

864
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,620
Now you're telling me that...

865
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,980
Well, we're trying to get you to ask...

866
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,980
Ask the right questions.

867
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,160
...the right questions.

868
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:00,580
...the right questions.

869
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:00,980
That's all.

870
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,680
We are simply trying to train you to think for yourself.

871
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,180
That's right. Yeah, think for yourself.

872
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,520
This isn't like some mind-control cult

873
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,120
where we just feed you a bunch of gobbledygook and mumbo-jumbo.

874
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:13,760
No, we don't.

875
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,160
This is a legitimate liberation.

876
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,340
Yeah, thought liberation.

877
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,340
That's what we're doing.

878
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,220
Question authority, we say.

879
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,640
We want to help everyone.

880
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,160
Yeah, that's our motto.

881
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,540
Question authority.

882
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,700
Unless it's Bob.

883
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,980
Unless, of course, it is Bob.

884
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,240
Because Bob, as we know, is Reverend Stang.

885
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,680
Bob is.

886
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,840
Yes, that's incorrect.

887
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,840
Of course, I knew you'd move into a much more philosophical area

888
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,760
that I could probably not relate to.

889
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,420
But we have a letter here now from Mrs. Elmo Twardy.

890
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:51,020
Bob is not the answer, and neither is any.

891
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,380
He certainly is not.

892
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,040
But he could be, couldn't he?

893
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,280
I mean, if I'm taking...

894
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,760
You are your own mistake.

895
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,260
I am.

896
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,800
Listening to apologetics.

897
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,740
Plum out of luck, ain't you?

898
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,140
You're on your own, kid.

899
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,120
With a corncob in your one hand,

900
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,520
and some errant eye pointing downward.

901
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,220
But anyway, I'm sorry.

902
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,360
We do have a letter.

903
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,140
And an offering.

904
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,600
Cielo in la tierra.

905
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,320
We're again.

906
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,240
Yeah, we've had some real long talks about it.

907
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,320
But you do really feel, I mean, everything's natural and completed.

908
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,440
For a while.

909
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:28,960
We'll be right back.

910
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,220
We'll be right back.

911
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,100
Cielo in la tierra.

912
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:28,260
We'll be right back.

913
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,820
We'll be right back.

914
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:28,840
We'll be right back.

915
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,280
We're waiting for the day.

916
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,340
For the man who demands respect.

917
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,360
Cause he was great.

918
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:33,940
Come on.

919
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,360
I'm on the one mission.

920
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,460
To give a politician to honor.

921
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,800
Or he's a goner by the time I get to Arizona.

922
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,340
The Sunday night services are nearly come to an end.

923
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,320
Nearly over.

924
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,000
It is up to you to go forth and bringeth your own slack.

925
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:05,380
For me, we must wander off to our own devices.

926
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,680
Our own herbs.

927
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:10,880
Our own...

928
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,360
Gleet.

929
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,160
Oh, man.

930
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,720
I got my device all warmed up.

931
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,820
It's Gleet ready.

932
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,660
Ah, yes.

933
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,780
I love to dream of my device.

934
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,380
When I actually start to use the device, I kind of get uptight.

935
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:39,040
It's not ever as good as I thought it might be, hoped it would be.

936
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,800
But, you know, still, I love that device.

937
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:50,700
And the Gleet that it makes me feel and discharge.

938
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,260
And the offense that I feel when I Gleet.

939
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,860
In my moon pants.

940
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,960
Ah, yes.

941
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:10,580
I'm so offended that I refuse to even play the tape.

942
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:18,160
The love in the room is so thick you could almost cut it with a knife.

943
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,480
I think I cut one.

944
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:23,180
Jeez.

945
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,620
Wah, wah, bam, bam.

946
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,300
Um...

947
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:28,680
Um...

948
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:28,800
Um...

949
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:28,800


950
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:28,820
Um...

951
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:28,820


952
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:28,820


953
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,440
It has been a show.

954
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,140
It has come full circle.

955
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:32,580
Yes.

956
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,740
And we...

957
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,080
Back to a beginning that never happened.

958
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,860
We are the jerks who have brought it full circle.

959
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,500
We are the full circle jerks this evening.

960
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,620
But we are off.

961
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,180
The jerks are off.

962
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:46,380
Soon.

963
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,020
In years.

964
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:47,740
Very soon.

965
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,660
In about five minutes.

966
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,040
Buried alive.

967
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,100
Buried alive.

968
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,720
Are you buried alive, brothers and sisters?

969
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,360
Are you buried alive?

970
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:57,780
Alive.

971
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,500
In a vast desert of anti-slack.

972
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,440
We're friends.

973
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,960
Bob is the ultimate grave robber.

974
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,000
Grave digger.

975
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,940
He's gonna dig you up.

976
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,100
You know, if you are buried alive and you're listening to us right now,

977
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,740
it's real nice of someone to bury you with a radio.

978
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,540
That's all I can say about that.

979
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,520
But there are many ways of being buried alive.

980
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,800
It's not merely earth.

981
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,960
Why, you could be buried alive in your own bodily fluids.

982
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,120
You could be buried alive in that little...

983
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,280
cubicle tomb that they make you go to every Monday morning.

984
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,420
I'm the old backhoe operator.

985
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,500
And welcome, boys and ghouls, to a new grave.

986
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:46,680
We're going to backhoe you up out of your old grave and dump you into a new one.

987
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:52,380
In this creepy story of Prozac Free Radio.

988
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,340
Now, how many of those conspiracy pink stiffs who work in them little...

989
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,300
cubicles even know what the guy working in the next cubicle looks like?

990
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,060
Why, he probably wouldn't even know he was there if he didn't hear him typing eight or nine hours a day.

991
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,440
Is that the kind of life you want to live?

992
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,880
I wish I could quit.

993
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:19,540
I can't stand listening to that guy typing over in that other sacred scribe typing over in that other church cubicle.

994
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,860
I'm just a cog in a machine.

995
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:27,140
The church of the subgenius scribe cubicle is located right next to the Mormon.

996
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,300
The Mormon scribe cubicle.

997
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,800
Our listeners are wanting to remind us of that fact.

998
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,260
Yeah, the Mormons got a bigger cubicle than I do.

999
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:38,980
Yeah.

1000
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,120
Damn it.

1001
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,140
And they each get their own planet when they die.

1002
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,200
Hey, we get our own planet when we die.

1003
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,880
But as Dr. Legume pointed out recently,

1004
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:52,180
sure, on X-Day, Bob's going to protect you from the pinks,

1005
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,700
and you'll have your own planet.

1006
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,820
But who's going to protect you from your fellow subgenius?

1007
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,480
Subgeniuses and Bob.

1008
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,860
Oh, yeah.

1009
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,080
What if my planet declares war on your planet?

1010
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:05,700
Eh?

1011
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,100
It's going to be...

1012
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:08,800
That's right.

1013
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,700
Mono a mono, buddy.

1014
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,940
You might never even get the chance, Reverend Strange.

1015
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,500
You might never get the chance to have your own planet.

1016
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,520
Hell, you might be like William Burroughs.

1017
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,340
You might not be able to get all the saucers come X-Day.

1018
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,900
You never get set up.

1019
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,040
You haven't been in your 30 bucks, have you?

1020
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,500
Oh, yeah, I have.

1021
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,140
You have?

1022
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,120
Oh, you owe $30.

1023
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:28,520
Yeah, I have.

1024
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,820
Oh, praise Bob.

1025
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,400
Praise Bob, man.

1026
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,000
Hey, that $30 will protect you from the aliens.

1027
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,020
Oh, that's right.

1028
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,980
I sent the P.O. Box 1403 or 6 down to 75214.

1029
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I shouldn't have known that, because you didn't have me.

1030
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,640
I already named the rabbi here.

1031
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,680
It's all in the new...

1032
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,020
I remember you gave me yourself.

1033
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:47,360
Yeah, it's all in there in the new electronic book of life

1034
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,920
that's implanted in your skull and the chip at the base of the neck.

1035
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,420
It's all in there.

1036
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,320
Just access the segment G33 subsection rub routine 4.

1037
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,200
Lord.

1038
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:56,660
Right there.

1039
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,900
Soul of Reverend Edward Strange.

1040
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,000
Does his name appear in the book of life?

1041
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,460
Book of life won't boot up, Lord.

1042
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,780
We can't get it to boot it up.

1043
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,260
The book of life seems to have a corrupted virus or something in it.

1044
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,280
Throw them all into the lake of fire, then.

1045
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,180
And throw in the disc as well.

1046
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,580
You know, it's all well and good.

1047
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,140
Church of subgenius, Bob.

1048
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,960
Eternal salvation.

1049
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,040
Or triple your money back

1050
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,100
until you see Bob standing at the gates of hell

1051
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,340
with a $90 chip.

1052
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,160
I've got a picture of Bob standing at the gates of hell

1053
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,900
with a $90 check in his hand.

1054
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,940
I just showed Dr. Legume and Mrs. Legume just a little while ago.

1055
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:37,760
Huh? See?

1056
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,100
I wish I could whip it out right here on the radio,

1057
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,160
but I'm afraid my moon pants are stuck.

1058
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,120
You might offend someone.

1059
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,580
I might offend somebody,

1060
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,000
and I don't want them to see the tape I got in my pants.

1061
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,320
Well, at least I was...

1062
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,120
I can't.

1063
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,340
At least I was smart enough to get a pair of button flyers.

1064
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:57,960
Moon pants.

1065
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:02,520
Oh, Reverend Stang, he got those damn weld fly moon pants.

1066
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,860
Now he can't get them off.

1067
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,320
But mine have a little flap in the back.

1068
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,100
You know what that's for.

1069
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,220
Oh.

1070
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,700
Johnny pants, they call them.

1071
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,480
Johnny pants.

1072
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,380
Or can'ts.

1073
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,120
I like to call them can'ts.

1074
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,740
Why do they call them pants?

1075
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,460
It's just one pant.

1076
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,200
Or a can't.

1077
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,840
I like to call it a can't.

1078
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,980
It's the Prozac.

1079
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,200
Free radio show.

1080
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,100
Special edition on this fine, fine Sunday night.

1081
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,580
The night of the Lord.

1082
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:39,480
Signing off.

1083
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,080
Yeah, signing off for the last time

1084
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,660
because Ed Strange isn't going to be with us anymore.

1085
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,000
Oh, yeah, he doesn't know,

1086
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,520
but as he walks past the dumpster tonight,

1087
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:55,180
the Samuels brothers are going to be waiting for him.

1088
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,340
Yeah, so you won't be seeing...

1089
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1090
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,820
Red Grange.

1091
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:04,020
I mean, Reverend Ed Strange anymore.

1092
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,900
He's going to be in the dumpster instead of behind it.

1093
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,620
Thank you, Dr. Lagoon.

1094
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,780
Thank you, Reverend Stang.

1095
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,680
And we really like coming here.

1096
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,700
We thank you for having us, Reverend Strange.

1097
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,280
And good night.

1098
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,420
We like to talk about...

1099
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,600
Good night to all the listeners.

1100
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,380

Sleep well.

1103
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,100
Dream of Bob and his minions.

1104
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,160
Good night.

We're talking about...

1106
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,100
This should have been done...
