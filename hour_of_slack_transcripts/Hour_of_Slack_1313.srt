1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,800
Shane, look out!

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,700
The Self-Genius Powerhouse.

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,640
We've got entirely too many troublemakers here.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,960
You're a slacker.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,420
I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,980
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,420
Jules, I'm on the motherfucker.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,400
Go back in there and chill them niggas out.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,060
And wait for Bob to come directly.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,160
See ya, negro!

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,160
That's all you had to say!

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,600
This is it.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,840
Entirely too many.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,820
Told us about in high school where one day Bob would save our lives.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,560
Yeah, let's cut to the chase, okay?

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
What are you guys selling?

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,820
Church of the Self-Genius.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,620
All right, there.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,940
All right, there.

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,080
Look, Church, you just ran.

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,780
Don't touch that.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,260
It's dirty.

23
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,220
Because you deny something that's mean and untrue.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,060
And let me tell you something.

25
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,520
It's so bad, I can't even tell you how bad it is.

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,740
Why don't you donate $30 to the cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,140
Ah, yes, dear friends.

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,420
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, and welcome to Hour of Slack number 1313.

29
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,260
Which almost spells Bob, but it's not 13013.

30
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,400
It's Hour of Slack number 1313.

31
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:39,140
The music in the background, by the way, is by Speed Cave from the album Rocket Ships

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,440
Apple Pie.

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,680
Rocket Ships and Apple Pie by Speed Cave of speedcave.com.

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:56,980
And I should explain why we've had reruns lately with this report on our orthostatic

35
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,000
orthostom PET ró ludic Gray and read my report right here.

36
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,960
Where basically I put what's in my portfolio this week and Sin natürlich Lux Grab credibility

37
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,640
and copyright rights over the podcast post in the email said I attended this coming week

38
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:10,640


39
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,520
And while that's good I pulled out an information about the

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,380
my ramble that was.

41
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,900
You know C気

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,500
Speaker 1.

43
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:27,280
S ông n arkadaşlar n klab Katherine Andrew Leaving an application.

44
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,540
of Paralithian liaison of the son of Mysib, Anticy, and a Pruitesian sir.

45
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,820
Because we had to leave the slackiness consent and venture extramuros,

46
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,480
we obtained a new cartabla for our fetch.

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,440
Along the way, we stayed at various small but famed maths

48
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:55,820
using a g-jaw to communicate with our fras and sirs at each math to alert them of our approach.

49
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:01,120
Of course, traveling extramuros, one is forced to break the discipline,

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:08,120
and I admit we used not only g-jaws but syntactic devices at some of the inns,

51
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,460
sometimes even with the help of local itas.

52
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,760
The roads were good and our fetch was dependable enough,

53
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,400
and much of the journey was pleasurable,

54
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,860
for we passed many a productive fuel tree and page tree orchard.

55
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,920
We often had to use...

56
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,080
super all-swell and jump weed for trade,

57
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,740
and to prevent its discovery by the agents of the secular powers

58
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,580
and attendant wasted hours before the courts of dour local pangendrums,

59
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,900
we hid the all-swell and jump weed in the back of the fetch.

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,660
Also, to keep the extras from recognizing us as avout,

61
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,360
we traveled without belt, cord, or sphere,

62
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,220
wearing slimes clothing and hiding our hair beneath headgear-bearing,

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,760
好了 asked them to try us if not

64
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,260
surfaces made from the entomochormon-oh vibe.

65
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,420
That's all, vasik.

66
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,300
S toasting.

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,020
To the bow...

68
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:25,800
sadah delivery.

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:25,800


70
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:32,620
At the nearby Spenserian Souven of the Centenarians, Potter and Petal Nostril,

71
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,640
we enjoyed a traditional mess hall, as elaborate as any of legend for which this clench is known.

72
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:51,200
At the Consent of St. Sophie, Fra Frop and Sir Decadence presented us with a book of specfic entitled Anathem

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,520
by the pre-Reconstitution writer Neil Stevenson.

74
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:07,620
Fra Frop later showed us a spielie about an uncommonly young floor saunt, or a couple of saunts, entitled Kick-Ass,

75
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,740
which left an impression on yours truly.

76
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:18,860
The agrarian math of Pa Tillis likewise proved an instructive and most enjoyable hostel.

77
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,180
Pa Tillis presented...

78
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,900
...with the challenge of the vanishing cat, a calca none has yet to solve.

79
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,280
While conducting dialogues with Sont Byron Werner and Sont Sterno in the Arkansanian Consent,

80
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:41,660
new Dobbsarchian calcas involving more than one solution were developed.

81
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,820
In fact, the most recent Weardian calca goes like this.

82
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,220
Sont Neegi asks of the Dobbs,

83
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,140
Man made booze, God made pot, who do you believe in?

84
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,000
The Dobbs replies,

85
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,500
Pot.

86
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:06,520
In the Consent of the Orthostanians, we stayed with the thousander known as Pa Pappy

87
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,360
and prepared for the ought of paralithian liaison of my fid.

88
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,020
There was some suspense over this ought, as my sib's former paralithian partner,

89
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,860
who had been rejected from the mathic world in the out of Anathem,

90
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,660
nonetheless returned from a slime prison to the Orthostanian Consent for the ceremony.

91
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,740
Fra Frapp, my sibs and I feared that he would go hundreder during the out,

92
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,920
and we were prepared to employ vlore against him.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,660
Luckily, his spinal clamp prevented violence, and to his credit,

94
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,640
he left immediately upon the completion of the out.

95
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,440
We're now back inside the gates of the Northern Orthostanian Consent in my office studio,

96
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,840
replete with many memories, upsets, and confusions.

97
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,400
I must confess, a few treasured, if illicit, speely recordings

98
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,920
that later generations might hopefully use in their researches as centuries hence.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,380
And now this.

100
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,220
Woo hoo!

101
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,180
All right, soldier, just exactly what does, from your point of view, that is, a rat taste like?

102
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,900
Tastes like dark meat of chicken, sort of stringy and gummy.

103
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,420
Well, all right, now.

104
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,980
Just quit playing with your marbles there and tell me where you got the rat in the first place.

105
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,800
Well, the Montagnards stole them from rat traps.

106
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,180
We set the catch rats for our plague studies, and then they made rat for us.

107
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,340
Okay, all right, all right.

108
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,720
That's a pretty good excuse.

109
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,220
Now, how did you prepare the rat?

110
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,640
Well, that's what I'm doing here, see.

111
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,320
You cook it in a pot over an open fire with what looks like potatoes.

112
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,240
See these things here?

113
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:41,460
Ah, yeah.

114
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,460
It looked just like overdone meat, perhaps because it was.

115
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,480
Ah, all right, all right.

116
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,000
Bring it back from there.

117
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,820
Yes, okay.

118
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,020
Now, did you know...

119
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,820
Nice crispy chicken.

120
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:55,640
...did you know exactly what parts of the rat you're eating when it comes to this?

121
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,340
Oh, no, no, no.

122
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,420
See, you serve this in a bowl, and you just eat unidentified rat parts.

123
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,920
Perhaps it's best that way.

124
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,700
Yes.

125
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,160
All right, now.

126
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,400
What did you do with the rats you didn't eat?

127
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,380
That's the really important...

128
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,460
Oh, well, see, those are over there.

129
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,940
We've chloroformed them, and we're going to dissect their spleen to see if they have the plague.

130
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,340
We also combed them and counted their fleas.

131
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,920
They're for dessert.

132
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,540
Now, what we'll do...

133
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,040
Oh, no, no, no, no.

134
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,540
You know in literature thatfikim lookeme a real brain, and they carbonize themselves

135
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:42,820
and the stomach cannot properly tortured even after a 했습니다 Cristel.

136
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,520
Let's get back toл

137
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,300
Now, self-made fursuit.

138
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,300

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,300

144
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:58,360
from Reverend Taylor Jessen's MP3 collection and book entitled Duke of Madness Motors.

145
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,800
More soon.

146
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:07,200
Before that, a little homage by we and myself to Neal Stephenson's novel Anathem.

147
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,500
And the titles came from, first, Lemur, and mostly from Ministry of Slack,

148
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,700
a weekly subgenius show like this one, and Puzzling Evidence, and Bob's Slacktime Funhouse,

149
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,220
but heard only on the internet.

150
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:30,500
See subgenius.com slash radio for details.

151
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,920
This show has lots of the Ministry of Slack's best of,

152
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,580
and also some edits by Phineas Narco, who will be at 14X Day,

153
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,480
from a Puzzling Evidence show on which he guested,

154
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,240
with Dr. Howell, Philo Drummond, and Puzzling Evidence, as heard here.

155
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,060
You know, back in the day, Grandma made apple butter the old-fashioned way,

156
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,600
by squeezing the rind through her toes.

157
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,960
But today, in the technological complexity of our jet-age society,

158
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,860
when we put a man on the moon, apple butter is squirted out of enormous factories,

159
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,480
from coast to coast, from sea to sea,

160
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,840
to shining sea.

161
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,360
The breadbasket of America's sweet, natural, down-home goodness

162
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,580
drives away complaints and headaches,

163
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,880
and puts a smile on everyone's face.

164
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,760
How does America handle apple butter?

165
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,700
With apple butter, and lots of it.

166
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,320
Potions of warm, fresh, country apple butter.

167
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,700
But it's apple butter of the devil.

168
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,200
It's Satan's apple butter.

169
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,200
But you didn't...

170
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,380
That we were not supposed to get to say.

171
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,180
All right.

172
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,520
It comes from Satan.

173
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,220
That we...

174
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,060
I have to admit it.

175
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,780
But, you know, there are many things...

176
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,860
Still darn good apple butter.

177
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,380
Many things...

178
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,120
Yes, that's right.

179
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,680
Where are you going to get better apple butter than that?

180
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,340
This was...

181
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,360
Why would you be prejudiced against Satan just because he's a good cook?

182
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,620
The apple butter is so good...

183
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,440
He's always been pushing this apple.

184
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,000
He claims that by eating the butter, you can become a god, you know.

185
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,040
What he doesn't say is that...

186
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,480
That makes...

187
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,340
That makes the major kingpin god angry,

188
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,640
and you have to be a demon and suffer incredible torments for the rest of eternity.

189
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:31,780
But there's no better way to get a giant savory chunk of delicious country-style apple butter.

190
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,100
Mm-hmm.

191
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,040
Now, Lord, we await, even as you,

192
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,880
the moment when our hearts shall be kindled with the unconsuming fire

193
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,460
and shall burn brightly as the table...

194
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,420
The tale of the baboon.

195
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:51,600
But alas shall derive unutterable anguish like the hearts of all other mortals...

196
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,400
The baboon's tale?

197
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,420
...from that flame...

198
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:53,720
Burns brightly?

199
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,540
...which is the ecstasy of demons.

200
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,320
Are you saying, surely that can't be that the baboon...

201
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,840
Is that what happened to the baboon's tale?

202
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,080
No, the baboon in itself never burns its tail,

203
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,660
but a particular malignant spirit or jinn,

204
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,680
which often appears in the shape of a baboon,

205
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,460
has a tail which is eternally luminescent.

206
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,700
And that's what I was referring to.

207
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:15,820


208
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,560
Well, I'm glad for that clarification.

209
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,580
But in the afterlife, our hearts will burn in intolerable anguish,

210
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,240
which is the ecstasy of demons.

211
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:25,920
Aw.

212
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,900
Demons love it when we're in pain, don't they?

213
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,940
Well, you know, there's nothing that doesn't do somebody some good.

214
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,140
Look at it that way.

215
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,220
Why not look at it positively?

216
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,500
At least the demons will be happy.

217
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,080
We'll be in agony forever, but they'll have a good time.

218
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,760
Yes.

219
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,280
It definitely...

220
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,840
Unutterable anguish, like the hearts of all other mortals

221
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,220
from that flame in which is the ecstasy of demons.

222
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,060
You heard it right.

223
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,480
There's a movie coming out called The Right.

224
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,240
The Right.

225
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,660
The Right? R-I-T-E?

226
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,480
Yes, with Anthony Perkins as an exorcist.

227
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,960
He's still around?

228
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:10,700
Yep.

229
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,320
I'm glad he's still doing movies.

230
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,640
He's good.

231
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,660
Yeah, he is good.

232
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,660
He's the very good.

233
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,440
He was based on a real-life exorcist in San Jose in the movie.

234
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,640
In San Jose, eh?

235
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,400
Yeah.

236
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,240
Well, you know, for some reason that doesn't sound as impressive.

237
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,620
I understand the Catholic Church is revising that.

238
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,300
Vatican City.

239
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,220
The Catholic Church is revising its exorcism rights.

240
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,780
They've been doing a lot of meddling.

241
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,280
They closed the down purgatory not long ago.

242
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,060
Oh, they did?

243
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,540
You don't have to go there anymore, huh?

244
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,220
No.

245
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,560
But it was a way to get out of hell.

246
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,880
Why did they close it?

247
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,400
I know.

248
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,860
It was sort of like an intermediate zone where you get a second chance.

249
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,100
I thought it was limbo, wasn't it?

250
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,880
No, limbo is where the virtuous pagans go.

251
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,640
The babies.

252
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,820
They didn't sin, but then again, they never, you know, they're not God's.

253
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,920
They didn't know better than to sin.

254
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,180
Because if you don't know the word, then what is sin?

255
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,780
They never heard the good news about Jesus.

256
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,260
And so they're not allowed.

257
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,240
They go into heaven, but they don't get punished by being put into hell.

258
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,860
They're in their special zone called limbo.

259
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,740
That's where all the Chinese people go.

260
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,460
That's where Ling Fong, the philosopher, is.

261
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,320
And Plato and Aristotle.

262
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,600
And the Greeks.

263
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,200
And the ancient philosophers of Atlantis.

264
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,260
And Mu and Hyperborean.

265
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,680
And cavemen.

266
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,320
They were never Christianized.

267
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,640
Thousands, millions of grunting cavemen.

268
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,080
It's definitely too crowded.

269
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,340
Well, that's the way.

270
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,800
That's the way the afterlife is, you know.

271
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,760
We've got to get in there and just cull that crowd down a little bit.

272
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,640
There's no way.

273
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,520
They're immortal spirits.

274
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,020
Nations, mountains, continents, all these things are transitory things.

275
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,760
What if we merged with the phantom zone?

276
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,400
As evanescent as the lives of dragonflies.

277
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:08,020
But the human spirit being immortal thing persists unto the end of time.

278
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,460
I think there should be like a hallway between purgatory, limbo, and the phantom zone.

279
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:12,760
Or a corrupt one.

280
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,040
Give them a break, you know.

281
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,240
Let them stretch their legs a little bit.

282
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,500
Give a guy a break.

283
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,300
Let them stretch their legs, wander around down the hallway.

284
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,580
Tormented by swarms of buzzing night flies.

285
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,720
And blood-sucking, blood-engorged tits.

286
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,120
What could be so wrong with that?

287
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,120
Well, it's all part of nature's plan.

288
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,000
And there's Bob's pie.

289
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,560
Puh?

290
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,520
No, his pie has pipes on it.

291
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,860
Oh, he has a pipe pie.

292
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,460
Well, it's all stained with the smegma.

293
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,360
Of tobacco juice.

294
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,920
From the nethermost profound of slumber.

295
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,160
It just looks, it's supposed to look like it's actually made of chocolate.

296
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,860
But it looks like tobacco juice.

297
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:00,000
From a gulf beyond the sun and stars that illume the lethean shoals and the vague lands of somber and fission.

298
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,860
What is this?

299
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,460
Floating on a black, unrippling tide.

300
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,220
I don't know what it is, but it's pie.

301
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,860
Yeah, he said pie on the radio.

302
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,260
He said pie.

303
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,420
What kind of pie is it, puzzling evidence?

304
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,340
Tape pie.

305
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,020
Cassette pie.

306
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,080
Oh, it's not.

307
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,500
It's a really bad band.

308
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,480
It's a...

309
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,820
I wish it Wotan over...

310
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,060
Now, I was wishing that there was a mint or slices of cream so I could eat with a runcible...

311
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,600
Wotan man, tan man.

312
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,080
Rience previous pie.

313
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,780
Or how about a gooseberry pie?

314
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,740
What if you could smoke your pipe with your nose for a change?

315
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,360
You didn't have to use your mouth.

316
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:41,260
There was a man said, I suppose I could smoke my pipe with my nose.

317
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,840
Good evening.

318
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,260
This is a limerick in the making.

319
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,400
Here, let's finish this limerick, Dr. Howell.

320
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:58,660
With my nostril, I'll suck up the spittle and muck, which I then will eject on my clothes.

321
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,820
Very good.

322
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,240
Hey, what's this?

323
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,240
A cassette for me?

324
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,400
Very good, very good.

325
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,320
Oh, yeah, it's one of my brothers.

326
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,240
Yeah, yeah.

327
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,360
Does it have Aunt Bertha stuff in there?

328
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,000
No, it doesn't.

329
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,660
Well, unfortunately, that's a Bob show.

330
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,900
It's a Bob show.

331
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,320
A Bob show by my...

332
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:13,440
That's a really decent...

333
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,880
You need some more Aunt Bertha stuff?

334
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,700
I'll send you some more Aunt Bertha stuff.

335
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,880
You...

336
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,680
But not the Aunt Bertha stuff that Jeff and I used to listen to in Tucson.

337
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,980
That's what I'd like to get a hold of.

338
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah, you want, like...

339
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,720
Do you want the story about the dog with Timmy and...

340
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,460
Oh, yes.

341
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:37,040
Well, the one where they blow something up and then they get the lecture from her about experimenting again.

342
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,740
What about?

343
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:38,860
Experimenting.

344
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,980
My radio.

345
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,600
Every evil thing that ever happened...

346
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,380
And it was the result of experimenting.

347
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,600
Oh, yes.

348
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:59,100
So, I noticed there was a Wikipedia entry, not for Aunt Bertha, but for that shadowy, amorphous organization known as the Children's Bible House.

349
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,120
More dread than the communists, the masons, or...

350
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,640
I didn't even hear it, but it's still...

351
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,080
What about a cowboy for Jesus?

352
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,560
That might have some tangential thing.

353
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,400
Now, Uncle Charlie took over.

354
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,800
The operation when Aunt Bertha passed on.

355
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:25,640
And my brother was in correspondence with them and got a letter from Uncle Charlie as he had earlier received a package from Aunt Bertha herself.

356
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,960
This package contained chick tracts and little stickers that looked like road signs that said,

357
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,240
One way to Jesus.

358
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,920
Yield to Jesus.

359
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,340
And that sort of thing.

360
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,120
You could stick them on stuff at school and no one would know who'd done it.

361
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,500
The Agent and Mr. Dobbs, Part 6.

362
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,780
Translated by Reverend Teeters LaVerge.

363
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,720
From papers left by The Agent.

364
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,460
Well, young agent, Mr. Dobbs said to me as we got into his car,

365
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,340
Looks like we have to get you back to Washington.

366
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,440
Bob leaned against the large Cadillac and...

367
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,500
sighed.

368
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,300
I wasn't sure how to take this turn.

369
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,000
By the 블�جяд pudding...

370
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,000


371
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,040
олетican

372
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,100
Because of George Russell's

373
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,960
Progressive

374
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:39,760
рей bean

375
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,520
Dreadful

376
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,960
And sultry

377
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:47,060
sick to the stomach for even though Bob probably is insane he is our best chance

378
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:52,540
and after the strangeness and fragile nature of our powers that be that I'd

379
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:58,880
witnessed I could see that no other human savior could redeem our slack as

380
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,040
mr. Dobbs was wonk to say I felt like crying for the first time in years that

381
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,420
is until mr. Dobbs stunned me again he suddenly straightened his back and

382
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,820
became hyper alert my sense of danger ignited as I unconsciously reach for the

383
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,240
revolver that I would usually carry in a shoulder holster it of course was not

384
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,840
there Bob had sold it to some street hood in Miami for a half-eaten sandwich

385
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:31,020
at least that's what he told me my eyes darted into the still dim woods around

386
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,680
us fearing the worst when mr. Dobbs yelled in a

387
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,020
high-pitched voice I was so scared I couldn't breathe I couldn't breathe I

388
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,160
pitched voice shiny shiny and ran to the edge of the dirt parking lot to pick

389
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,400
up a small shard of glass there were hundreds of shards laying around

390
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,240
everywhere he picked it up and heard to himself as if he had found a great

391
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:56,720
treasure his smile had returned full force I could only admire and be

392
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,380
disgusted with such a man our drive back to Washington was fast and insane of

393
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,000
course we must have been so scared to be back in the city of Washington and we

394
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,780
made that drive in record time for Bob never once slowed down he breezed

395
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:15,440
through traffic lights stop signs over hillbillies and every time a patrol car

396
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,220
pulled up behind us with lights flashing it would either mysteriously lose power

397
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,880
and pull off to the side or it would suddenly veer off into a direction that

398
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,240
Bob happened to be looking sometimes up or down into the skies or the earth

399
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,840
itself he was still looking for that skunk ape

400
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,660
we only stopped once and that was to purchase some overripe peaches at a

401
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:45,480
roadside stand in Georgia these peaches Bob would throw at specific cars that

402
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,500
passed us by I could never figure out the reason but after he threw one he

403
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,420
would bounce up and down in his seat in an exaggerated glee as much as I would

404
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:59,180
beg him to stop so that I could use a restroom Bob would just scowl at me

405
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:04,860
angrily as if I were asking him to do something horrible I ended up having to

406
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,220
go in my overalls it didn't matter they stank so badly that no one would have

407
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,920
noticed the difference other than Bob that is who would punch me on the

408
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:21,380
shoulder a damn hard to and yell I spy with my third nostril excrement or urine

409
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:28,860
or weakness whenever I would make a mistake it was in a small rather

410
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,460
affluent Virginia town not too far from our capital that Bob

411
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:40,180
deigned to stop at the safe house that we employ there as ashamed as I was to

412
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:45,500
enter and see my colleagues while in such a degraded state I knew that I had

413
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,500
to I was long overdue at least it seemed that way to me once we pulled into the

414
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,980
driveway Bob graciously opened my door and threw me into the lilac bushes that

415
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,520
grow out front and sternly frighteningly told me to stay right there he had to get

416
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,160
some stuff and

417
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:09,640
the party isn't over by a long shot boy he then burned rubber pulling out of the

418
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,300
driveway my first intention was to run into the safe house and clean myself up

419
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:20,680
but I feared what Bob might do if I did so I sat in the bushes getting stung in

420
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,280
the face by bees until I saw the agents in the house peep through the windows in

421
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:33,040
obvious disapproval I suppose it was then that I realized I was a slave

422
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,680
for Bob a most horrible feeling most horrible it was not but a few shameful

423
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,240
minutes later that Bob screeched back into the driveway carrying a case of

424
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,060
cheap beer and a dirty aluminum bucket of what he called head cheese even

425
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,200
though it looked more like and smelled more like rotten fish bait to me you

426
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,820
beings like this stuff right he asked me I could only nod my head Bob beckoned me

427
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,020
out of the bushes I said thank you for what you did for Bob who is a good man and I can only say that Bob was a good man and I was a good man for him

428
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:09,860
stood there in front of him as he flicked a single mote of dust from my overalls. He then looked me

429
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:16,020
over with a discerning eye and nodded in approval, even though I stank and was completely filthy.

430
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,480
The key to the safe house, as always, was underneath the welcome mat. I braced myself

431
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,020
for all the humiliations that would be heaped upon me once this assignment was over. No one

432
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:34,260
was there to greet me, not surprisingly, so Bob, as if he knew the place, led me to the upstairs

433
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:41,880
bedroom where we keep our communications office. He banged the bucket of chum down on the desk in

434
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,840
front of Agent X. The skinny little bastard almost puked. I doubt he would have survived a weekend

435
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:55,340
with Bob. Mr. Dobbs then grabbed six of the beers from the case, and as he greasily smiled at all of

436
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,000
us, he proceeded to pull down his trash.

437
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:04,440
Bob then took off his trousers and popped the cap of each of the six beers with the power of his buttock muscles alone.

438
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:14,300
Though I was not astounded, the rest of the pinks, as Bob liked to call folks like that, in the room stood aghast in disgust and terror.

439
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:25,580
They all knew the importance of my mission, so when I discreetly nodded to them to dig into the bucket of chum and down the so-called ass beers,

440
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,960
as became agent history,

441
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,560
I was left with the worst part of the story.

442
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,080
They did as told, like damned sheep.

443
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,600
Agent X, the chubby useless one, stuttered that there had been an awful tragedy, and, uh,

444
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,840
where the hell have you been?

445
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,580
Bob's smile disappeared, and in two giant bounds he leaped over to the man, glaring,

446
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,720
Look here, little pink boy! I've been gambling with your future, and I lost that!

447
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,600
And I lost a pair of gold cufflinks that Connie's sister gave to me.

448
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,360
So what if one of the clones got damaged?

449
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,000
So what if one of the clones got damaged? So what if one of the clones got damaged? So what if one of the clones got damaged?

450
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,960
We have plenty more, and if you live long enough, you'll be wishing you had pet rats just so you can eat their crap to survive.

451
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,840
So don't whine to me, pink boy.

452
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:16,280
Mr. Dobbs then gave the man a gentle kiss on the forehead and winked at me, whispering,

453
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,820
We don't need no damn agents.

454
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,980
I understood.

455
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:29,320
And as he left the house, I noticed that somehow, as usual, Bob had made off with their wallets.

456
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:38,900
Mr. Dobbs was incredibly serene in light of his last outburst of anger as we drove through the crowded suburban streets and out into the countryside.

457
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,960
He seemed to forget everything as fast as it happened, as if he had severe brain damage.

458
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:50,120
He puffed furiously on his pipe, but with that same oblivious grin that he usually wore.

459
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,900
I popped a few.

460
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,340
I took a few of his pills that I had left over just to get rid of the shakes.

461
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:02,940
That, plus the beer I had, made the world seem all that much more intense and reasonable.

462
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:15,900
It all started to make much more sense at that point, and the drive through the countryside was lovely until Bob made a serious face again and said that we had best hang low until things blow over.

463
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,220
I know the place to go.

464
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,540
A little inn I have that I like to call...

465
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,880
Shamalot.

466
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:30,280
It took us a while to get to this Shamalot, for Mr. Dobbs seemed to always forget where we were driving.

467
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:39,060
He'd stop off at random diners, trinket shops, gas stations, etc., where he would feel impelled to make a sale.

468
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,200
Then we would drive back off in the direction we'd just come from.

469
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,260
Bob always had something in the trunk of his car to sell to these vendors.

470
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,960
It was as if he had a second sense for...

471
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,060
the sale.

472
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,700
And that was what guided him.

473
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,940
Where we ended up was exactly where he wanted to go in the first place.

474
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,480
We did indeed make it, eventually, to Shamalot.

475
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:12,500
It was simply an underground-type bomb shelter that Bob had off the main kitchen in a sprawling hotel complex in rural Virginia.

476
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,080
I followed him through the venue.

477
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,240
It was a very well-appointed hotel.

478
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,960
Yet the staff seemed lethargic and prone to bumbling and stumbling.

479
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:21,960


480
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:37,540
I thought at first that they may have all been overworked or drunk, until I noticed that most of them would shamble off into a dark corner and take a puff off a smile-pipe every chance they could get.

481
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:43,120
The tobacco they smoked smelled very much like Bob's, just not as nauseating.

482
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:50,960
We wended our way through this maze until we got to a heavy steel door, on which was messily painted a la The Little Rascals.

483
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,800
Shamalot! No pinks a loud!

484
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,060
I recognized Bob's childish scrawl and poor spelling.

485
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,400
So this, then, would be our safe haven.

486
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:16,960
Well, friends, that is the end of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs, Part 6, translated by Reverend Teeters La Verge.

487
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,160
The music in the background is by Speedy.

488
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,160


489
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,160


490
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:35,060
I believe that the correct way to reach Speed Cave is speedcave.com.

491
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:49,460
And we will continue next show, or perhaps the one after, with The Agent and Mr. Dobbs, Part 7, which will be the finale.

492
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,160
Until we get to the end of the show, I'd like to remind you that you can find us at Speed Cave, or Speed Cave, on the web site.

493
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,160


494
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,160


495
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,160


496
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,160


497
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,160


498
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,160


499
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,540
And to Book 2, The Agent Goes to Dobbs Town.

500
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:10,700
It's really an amazing amount of material that was found, shredded, pieced back together, retranslated, and then written by Teeters, Reverend Teeters, and read by myself, Reverend Ivan Stang.

501
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,880
See you on the saucers.

502
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,880
Praise Bob.

503
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,400
And now, this.

504
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,520
You've suggested making conversion to Christianity part of the war on terror. Is that right?

505
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:30,440
Well, that was how the man described it that was writing the article.

506
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:41,760
What I was saying was that I felt we should use psychological warfare with them and inform them that they don't go to heaven blowing themselves up.

507
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,080
But do you want them to convert to Christianity? Is that, we should make that part of the war on terror?

508
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,380
Well, you can't really force them to convert to Christianity.

509
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,840
But you can tell them about Jesus Christ.

510
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,080
So part of our policy in fighting the war on terror should be to tell people about Jesus Christ.

511
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,380
That would be preferable.

512
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,600
Of course, there are a lot of people in this country who don't worship Jesus Christ.

513
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:14,400
Well, if they don't worship him, and if they don't believe in him, how are they going to get to heaven? He's the only way to go to heaven.

514
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,360
But do you know that America is a country where people who are like some of them might even be Jews?

515
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,920
Well, I don't think there are Jews in America who don't worship Jesus as a deity.

516
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,540
Well, whoever doesn't, Jesus said that he is the only way.

517
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,740
I don't think you're going to get the Jewish vote, Mr. Cus.

518
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,260
Well, I'm, that's a Jews problem.

519
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,820
Well, no, it's your problem if you don't get elected.

520
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,640
Let me ask you this. You also say in an interview with the Sandusky Register,

521
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,340
you said you wouldn't be against the law.

522
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,400
You said you would not be opposed to the death penalty for homosexuality.

523
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:07,640
Well, not particularly, but one of the things government's supposed to do is restrain evil, and homosexuality is evil.

524
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,000
But you said you would not be opposed to the death penalty for homosexuality.

525
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,900
I would not be opposed to it, no.

526
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,320
You also said in an interview that I read that you did not oppose the death penalty for homosexuality.

527
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,320


528
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,660
You did, I think, for an ICANN podcast.

529
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,520
You talked about, like, Mary Cheney should get the death penalty.

530
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,080
You talked to Chad Larson, I believe, in a Page One Q.

531
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,300
Well, they're the ones that were saying that.

532
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,060
No, you said it.

533
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,180
No, I didn't.

534
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,680
Well, I have a transcript here.

535
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,180
You said, of course, in your perfect world, should Mary Cheney be killed for her being homosexual?

536
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,460
And you said if she's not going to repent.

537
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,560
Well, I would prefer that she repented.

538
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,920
And you said if she doesn't repent, she should be killed.

539
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,120
Then how would you restrain evil?

540
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,400
So, in other words, if you're homosexual and don't repent, you should be killed.

541
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,840
Well, I don't know if the term killed is correct, but...

542
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,860
What would be the correct term?

543
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,440
Put to death.

544
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,420
Wouldn't that be being killed?

545
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,560
Well, it says that if society chooses to...

546
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,420
allow that kind of stuff, then that society itself will be killed.

547
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,060
So you would put homosexuals to death?

548
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,720
Correct?

549
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,260
Well, it's what the Bible says to do.

550
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,320
I knew it. I'm surrounded by assholes.

551
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,300
All right, all right, I apologize.

552
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,240
I'm really, really sorry.

553
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,880
I apologize unreservedly.

554
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,540
I offer a complete and utter retractable...

555
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,520
The imputation was totally without basis in fact,

556
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,260
and was in no way fair comment,

557
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,000
and was motivated purely by malice,

558
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:01,920
and I deeply regret any distress that my comments may have caused you or your family,

559
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:08,400
and I hereby undertake not to repeat any such slander at any time in the future.

560
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,800
Bessels, Bessels, Bessels, Bessels, Bessels, Bessels, Bessels.

561
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,120
Ain't that a kick in the head?

562
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,620
Ain't that a hole in the bow?

563
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,200
Ain't that a kick in the bow?

564
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,560
Ain't that a hole in the head?

565
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,160
Tell me quick.

566
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,720
Boy, ain't love a kick?

567
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,240
Tell me quick.

568
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,060
Ain't love a kick in the head?

569
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:55,020
Ain't that a kick in the head?

570
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,400
Ain't love a kick in the head?

571
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,500
Ain't love a kick in the head?

572
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,840
Ain't love a kick in the...

573
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,100
In truth, Giles?

574
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,320
Ladies and gentlemen, the United States, the United States,

575
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,800
Voices Radio, Voices, Voices, Voices Radio and Television Service.

576
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,760
Service. Service. Service.

577
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,880
Those last two cuts were from Ministry of Slack,

578
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,820
the podcast that has outlasted all other subgenius podcasts so far,

579
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:52,260
thanks to Reverend Exister and Reverend Sweetness McGee and their friends.

580
00:35:52,440 --> 00:36:01,380
And now, back in time to Firesign Theater that existed long before even Reverend Exister.

581
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,880
All right, listen kids. Listen kids, a coach will be here in just a minute.

582
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,860
And then he's going to give us the plan for next week.

583
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,400
Next week is when we go up against the state.

584
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,580
You know what I mean?

585
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:18,280
I mean, as far as I see, the only thing that we're here in school to do is to...

586
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:18,820
That's right.

587
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,360
That's right. That's right.

588
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,000
You said it.

589
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,820
You said it right.

590
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,160
Archie, what's the plan for this week?

591
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,880
The plan for this week, kids, calls for a big assault against the ammunition factory in Pasternak, New Jersey.

592
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,460
Oh boy.

593
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,380
Okay.

594
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,540
It was fun last week when we blew up the airplane factory because we got to keep the glue.

595
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,860
Gee, Reverend Strugghead, that's all you ever think about.

596
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,540
That's right.

597
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,240
Well, here's the new revolutionary slogan, kids.

598
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,920
Ready? Just a second. Let me play it out.

599
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,060
This comes from little David Ostman in California.

600
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:51,940
Yes?

601
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,180
Pants the bourgeoisie.

602
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,060
Oh, that's great.

603
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,140
That's great.

604
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,600
That's great.

605
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,500
Pants the bourgeoisie.

606
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:57,800
Let's try it out.

607
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,040
Let's try it out.

608
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,320
Okay.

609
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:58,800
Let's try it out.

610
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,140
And here's the big...

611
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,280
Pants the bourgeoisie.

612
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,420
Pants the bourgeoisie.

613
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:02,700
Thanks, kids.

614
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,640
Pants the bourgeoisie.

615
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:05,640


616
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,680
Come on. Give me a T.

617
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,160
Come on, kids.

618
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:07,740
Give me an N.

619
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,440
Come on, everybody.

620
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,940
Give me an N. Give me a T. Let's have some.

621
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,120
What?

622
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,860
Pants!

623
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,060
Pants!

624
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,760
Pants!

625
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:11,760


626
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,540
Right.

627
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,120
Right.

628
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,120
That stinks.

629
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:15,980
That's the coach.

630
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,320
That's the coach.

631
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,680
Coach, what's the word for today?

632
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,520
Okay, boys.

633
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,960
The black jury fixed up the question of prizes with the government.

634
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,380
Nature falls for ourselves, not for others.

635
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,860
To be, not to seem.

636
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,320
That's the thing.

637
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,240
We just like to exchange jobs of lots of sizes varying from a quarter up.

638
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,180
Try to be as good as you would have to be...

639
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,820
Right on, coach.

640
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,320
...as you are.

641
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,640
Now, probably my oxen will haul a dozen loads of gravel just as quickly.

642
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,200
Solid, Jackson.

643
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,080
I consider the pension list of the republic a role of honor.

644
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,940
This job requires extra pluck.

645
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,100
I'm sure it's worth it.

646
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,100


647
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
boys, and zeal from every young wage earner.

648
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,180
You two girls, I've seen the day of wrong

649
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,460
to the little mole again.

650
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,960
Whatever the black fox jumped

651
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,200
to squirreled very suspiciously.

652
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,420
Liberty and union, boys, now and forever.

653
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,240
What an inseparable Webster.

654
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,140
You said it, Webster.

655
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,980
Okay, now I'd like to apply the formula to a real

656
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,900
situation. I've been doing my homework.

657
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,300
That's Betty. That's Betty Veronica.

658
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,840
The schizophrenic.

659
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,100
Right, she's the town lip.

660
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,720
Now, let's say you guys want to buy a color

661
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,480
TV set for $499.

662
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,800
I want to buy a color TV set,

663
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,960
Betty Veronica, for $499.

664
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,180
Well, that's good.

665
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,820
Do you know what they found in her locker?

666
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,300
Some Swiss cheese and groats.

667
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,380
Oh, you guys!

668
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,040
Stop it!

669
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,540
I should have seen it.

670
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,440
Now you decide to ask the Good Guy

671
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,580
loan company to lend you

672
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,740
the cash to swing the deal.

673
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,100
Now you find that the Good Guy and the Good Guy office

674
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,300
will let you have the money to be repaid monthly

675
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,120
over the next 18 months at the rate of

676
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,440
$31.85 a month.

677
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,420
Hence the bourgeoisie.

678
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,540
A little more than a buck a day.

679
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,380
Yes, mistress.

680
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,460
Right? Not bad when you consider that a color TV set

681
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,800
provides the whole family with a daily round of entertainment.

682
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,520
Oh, boy!

683
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,440
But is it such a good deal after all?

684
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,540
That's what I want to know.

685
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,260
Hence the bourgeoisie.

686
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,060
I can dig it.

687
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,540
The loan may then make of but any out today.

688
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,640
We so very leave,

689
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,240
and more see must under a hat

690
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,180
upon what into in vain great

691
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,060
shall come that our attack

692
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,220
these, if this are such,

693
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:07,800
the wise people.

694
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,260
Oh, boy!

695
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,540
Oh, you shut it, Jim!

696
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,360
Jim's the best ball in school.

697
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:12,880
Is he?

698
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,420
Yes, he is.

699
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,020
Yes, he is.

700
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,300
He's dumb, but he's consistent.

701
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,800
Well, suppose you take your VHS.

702
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,720
Yeah, okay, I got your VHS.

703
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,900
I got your VHS hanging.

704
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,680
Okay, now you take the VHS and you...

705
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,840
Wait, what happened to my audience there?

706
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,840
...transfer the information to a DVD.

707
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,520
Where'd they go?

708
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,220
It just fell off.

709
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:29,860
Is that possible?

710
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,300
Yeah.

711
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,200
Yeah, you can.

712
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:31,980
You can do that.

713
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,140
Easily.

714
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,120
How? Who can?

715
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,080
You have to rip it.

716
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,640
K-Rob was going to, but then he said he couldn't.

717
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,120
Now, what's the big...

718
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,920
Big deal.

719
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,680
Why not?

720
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,560
It just means it's a machine probably.

721
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,180
Oh.

722
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,120
It's just they make those machines...

723
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,840
Oh, it's not that hard?

724
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,400
No.

725
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,020
Because...

726
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,880
It's not that hard for an advanced...

727
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,680
Must...

728
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,760
It's not that hard for an advanced user...

729
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,120
It's not that hard for an advanced user...

730
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,580
...to have them.

731
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,380
...of various platforms.

732
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,140
Why does my audience keep sneaking away?

733
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:56,760
Well, I...

734
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,100
They keep jumping around the corner,

735
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,120
and then they jump back.

736
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,440
You know why?

737
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,700
Like, 20,000 people go,

738
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:00,920
Ah!

739
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,220
...of these things.

740
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,200
To be a broker, as it were,

741
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,620
in the creation of...

742
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,540
I wonder if that means that

743
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,100
if...

744
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,880
There they are.

745
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,180
...this machine is down or something.

746
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:10,900
Maybe.

747
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,740
That just means that 20,000 people

748
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,400
can stick their head around the corner

749
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,360
really quickly and jump back.

750
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,080
There they go.

751
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,920
They did it again.

752
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,740
That sort of freaks me out.

753
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,020
No!

754
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,080
Well, don't let it get to you.

755
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,060
Even though it might be griping in your guts,

756
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,040
you can't let anyone know how you feel.

757
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,200
I'm taking the time to keep it from getting to me.

758
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,380
That's the ticket.

759
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,080
I'm going to a training class.

760
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,140
I went to a training class last week...

761
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:36,840
You did?

762
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,980
...to teach me how to...

763
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,200
...keep it from getting to me.

764
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,120
Well, that's good.

765
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,820
I hope the drill instructor

766
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,500
barked some sense into it.

767
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,200
Oh, right, right.

768
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,580
I'm going to a class that teaches me

769
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,580
how to come off it.

770
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,640
Really?

771
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,480
How to come off it?

772
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:49,680
Yeah.

773
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,320
Like, come off it, man.

774
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,260
You know, that's...

775
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,500
I think that's a variation

776
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,420
of that old get-with-it class.

777
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,100
...going-down-to-classes

778
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,820
to learn how to climb on it...

779
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:57,980
It's a variation.

780
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,740
They just re...

781
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,400
...fly it around.

782
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,200
They took the old get-with-it class

783
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,180
and dressed it up

784
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,620
and just called it a come-off-it.

785
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,140
A comforting come-off-it.

786
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,080
These amazing radio stations

787
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,600
and radio personalities

788
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,960
will now climb on it

789
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,980
and fly it away.

790
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,300
They're going to come on it?

791
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,660
The sensation of falling

792
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,620
into a deep...

793
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:18,740
That's the...

794
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,540
...climb on it.

795
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,980
Yeah, they climb on it

796
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,520
and fly it away.

797
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,320
And then see,

798
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,260
it's for the kids.

799
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,620
And we'll put kids in here.

800
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,900
We'll get about 20 digital kids

801
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,980
and drop right in there

802
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,320
in the wings.

803
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,740
And people will go to our...

804
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,000
They're so cute sitting there.

805
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:31,960
So helpless.

806
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,920
They used to be real.

807
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,540
So...

808
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,780
So vulnerable.

809
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,100
See how we sit here at the...

810
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,480
So faint.

811
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,060
So faint.

812
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,320
So fair.

813
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,080
And Hal's writing his speech

814
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,280
for X-Day, see?

815
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,600
And then he's in the window here.

816
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,440
The problem is that...

817
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,600
So smooth, so mild,

818
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,280
so firm, so fully packed.

819
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,320
My sermons aren't necessarily

820
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,800
well-recorded for X-Day.

821
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,200
Somehow they seem to be.

822
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,840
We get lost in the shuffle.

823
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:56,560
Yeah.

824
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,800
But some of them haven't been.

825
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,280
They end up as radio fodder

826
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,720
to be chewed by thousands

827
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,320
of tiny denticles.

828
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,380
And then...

829
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,380
This is the part where

830
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,840
the American people run up

831
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,680
the big clods of dirt in the sky.

832
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,440
And each American person

833
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,640
has to go find a dragon

834
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,380
and climb on it.

835
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,280
Yes.

836
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,220
No, that's platoon, man.

837
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,600
Oh, no, I thought that was

838
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,500
Shawshank Redemption.

839
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,080
Yeah, that too.

840
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,960
I could text flying one

841
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,280
on one of those things.

842
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,020
I would get vertigo.

843
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,080
That's a visual cliche.

844
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,380
I had a little bit of acrophobia

845
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,360
when I was a kid.

846
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,780
I'm on top of one of those beasts

847
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,920
sliding around between

848
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,460
those flying islands and stuff.

849
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,820
In the halls of Iblis.

850
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,320
All Americans will have to do that now.

851
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,420
I'm afraid I'll have to sit that one out.

852
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,760
My motion sickness will get to me.

853
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,360
So what's this about this character

854
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,080
named Junior?

855
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,100
Junior was the shotgun

856
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,140
handled by G. Gordon Gordon

857
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,780
in Olivia.

858
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,320
Coming, mother.

859
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,640
Oh, no, no, no.

860
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,020
Yes.

861
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,500
You're thinking J.R. Bob Dodds.

862
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:06,900
As in...

863
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,920
J.R., like as in J.R. Ewing

864
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,600
from Dallas.

865
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,840
Who shot J.R.?

866
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,940
It's ironic that, you know,

867
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,620
they were the ones

868
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,180
who stole the name

869
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,660
from J.R. Bob Dodds.

870
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,700
Henry Aldrich.

871
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,740
Coming, mother.

872
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,220
Common Murder's High School.

873
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,120
Stealing is the sincerest

874
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,260
form of flattery.

875
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,520
Our cruel name is Junior.

876
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,740
Well, that wasn't what we were...

877
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,060
I never heard of that.

878
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,700
Well, we weren't...

879
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,440
But I tell you what's

880
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,240
another coincidence.

881
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,460
Remember back in...

882
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,100
Well, we weren't...

883
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,480
Back in...

884
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,160
1978, when they had...

885
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,560
Who shot J.R.?

886
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,240
Yes.

887
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,400
Who could forget that?

888
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,420
What happened at...

889
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,600
San Francisco?

890
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:47,500
In...

891
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,280
On January 20th, 1984?

892
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,500
Al, I think you were there,

893
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:51,900
weren't you?

894
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,920
I was there.

895
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,280
This has all been gone over

896
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,340
with a hinky-knot.

897
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,460
Right.

898
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,200
It's all ground.

899
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,840
It's been covered before.

900
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,200
I think...

901
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,720
However,

902
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,140
there are rumors

903
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,460
that Bob did not...

904
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,320
Bob died that night.

905
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,220
Now, there you're...

906
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:10,740
You're kind of...

907
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,380
There are also rumors

908
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,280
that Bob died

909
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,900
multiple times that night.

910
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,400
Well, I don't like to...

911
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,340
to shatter anyone's faith, but...

912
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,300
That just all depends on

913
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,260
what you want to believe.

914
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,360
Yes, exactly.

915
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,140
Any other questions?

916
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,940
I never asked.

917
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,760
Thank you very much.

918
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,380
You're welcome.

919
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,340
Once again...

920
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,700
I like it when the callers

921
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,760
can, like, sit in

922
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,520
when I'm not feeling

923
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,600
very talkative.

924
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,200
They can just do the show for us.

925
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:33,820
They can do everything.

926
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,000
They're judge, jury,

927
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,100
and executioner.

928
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,680
Why, I ought to...

929
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,740
You're not funny,

930
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,780
and you're not serious.

931
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,620
Just silly, Billy.

932
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,880
Hi, kids,

933
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,780
and welcome to

934
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,080
Bible Study Time.

935
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,800
I'm your host,

936
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,820
Reverend Exister.

937
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,100
This is a segment

938
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,600
where we'll take a passage

939
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,860
out of the Bible

940
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,620
and study it.

941
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,880
Today's passage

942
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,600
is from the book of Genesis,

943
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,600
verses 29 through 36.

944
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,500
And they deal with a man

945
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,880
named Lot.

946
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,760
Now, Lot was a weird little guy,

947
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,180
liked to wash people's feet,

948
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,120
eat unleavened bread,

949
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,600
and liked to give his daughters

950
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,900
up for molestation

951
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,940
instead of strangers

952
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,480
he had just recently met.

953
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,760
Boy, he sure knew

954
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,040
who ruled the roost.

955
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,540
This passage takes place

956
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,540
after his wife

957
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,540
was turned into a pillar of salt

958
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,200
by simply viewing

959
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,080
the specter of God's wrath.

960
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,260
And Lot went up

961
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,440
out of Zoar

962
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,400
and dwelt in the mountain

963
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,220
and his two daughters

964
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:05,860
with him.

965
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,760
For he feared to dwell

966
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,740
in Zoar,

967
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,140
and he dwelt in a cave,

968
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,640
he and his two daughters.

969
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,560
And the firstborn said

970
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,720
unto the younger,

971
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,240
Our father is old,

972
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,060
and there is not a man

973
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:24,820
in the earth

974
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,060
to come in unto us

975
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,520
after the manner

976
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,080
of all the earth.

977
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,480
Come,

978
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,660
let us make our father

979
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,760
drink wine,

980
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,860
and drink wine.

981
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:35,860


982
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,240
For we will lie with him,

983
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,920
that we may preserve

984
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,980
seed of our father.

985
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,040
And they made their father

986
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,420
drink wine that night,

987
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,940
and the firstborn went in

988
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,680
and lay with her father,

989
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,780
and he perceived not

990
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,920
when she lay down,

991
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,080
nor when she rose.

992
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,160
Truly a miracle.

993
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,560
And it came to pass

994
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,760
on the morrow,

995
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,640
that the firstborn said

996
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,480
unto the younger,

997
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,640
Behold,

998
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,560
I lay yesterday night

999
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,320
with my father.

1000
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,320
Let us make him drink wine

1001
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,780
this night also,

1002
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,760
and thou go in,

1003
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,460
and lie with him,

1004
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,280
that we may preserve

1005
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,460
seed of our father.

1006
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,280
And they made their father

1007
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:35,840
drink wine,

1008
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,100
that night also,

1009
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,060
and the younger arose,

1010
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,280
and lay with him,

1011
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,940
and he perceived not

1012
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,160
when she lay down,

1013
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,800
nor when she arose.

1014
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,200
Truly another miracle.

1015
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,280
Thus were both the daughters of Lot

1016
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,720
with child by their father.

1017
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,340
Let us discuss

1018
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,580
points of interest

1019
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,740
in the passage.

1020
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,880
In biblical times,

1021
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,060
wine made you so drunk

1022
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,120
that you'd sleep

1023
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,060
with your own daughters.

1024
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,880
In biblical times,

1025
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,160
hangovers seemed non-existent.

1026
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:35,780
Got so drunk

1027
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:36,340
last night

1028
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,060
that you'd sleep

1029
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,020
with your own daughter

1030
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,380
and didn't remember it?

1031
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,180
No problem.

1032
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:42,820
Next day,

1033
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,180
you won't feel a thing.

1034
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:45,520
Go ahead

1035
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,840
and do it again.

1036
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,740
The younger sibling

1037
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,380
will do anything

1038
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,920
the older ones do

1039
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,000
to look cool,

1040
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,780
even sleep

1041
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,740
with their own father.

1042
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,540
Well, that's it

1043
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:16,660
for Bible Study Time.

1044
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,240
And remember kids,

1045
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,660
it's all the Word of God.

1046
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,380
We hope you've enjoyed

1047
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,080
Bible Study Time.

1048
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:27,900
Please send all questions,

1049
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,500
comments, and lawsuits

1050
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,980
to PO Box 181417,

1051
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,620
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1052
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,440
We'll see you next time.

1053
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:44,760
Bye.

1054
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,980
down from the sky

1055
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,560
and I don't know

1056
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,040
who or why

1057
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,360
Must be those strangers

1058
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,120
that come every night

1059
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,360
With saucer-shaped lights

1060
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,300
to take the people uptight

1061
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,440
Late blue great footprints

1062
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,320
that glow in the dark

1063
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,460
And I hope they get home

1064
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,460
all right

1065
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,320
Oh, hey

1066
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,800
Mr. Spaceman

1067
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,440
Won't you please take me along?

1068
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,660
I won't do anything wrong

1069
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,500
Oh, hey

1070
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,060
Mr. Spaceman

1071
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,760
Won't you please take me along

1072
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,160
for the ride?

1073
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,920
This thing I knew

1074
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,280
I was speeding through space

1075
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,860
In an alien race

1076
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,860
I'll swallow my face

1077
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,320
And then they hit me

1078
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,120
with a hypnotic beam

1079
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,780
But it all seemed

1080
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,240
just like a dream

1081
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,120
Oh, hey

1082
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,660
Mr. Spaceman

1083
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,840
Won't you please take me along?

1084
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,480
I won't do anything wrong

1085
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,360
Oh, hey

1086
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,900
Mr. Spaceman

1087
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,520
Won't you please take me along

1088
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,680
for the ride?

1089
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,340
Oh, hey

1090
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:42,560
Mr. Spaceman

1091
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,160
Won't you please take me along?

1092
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,200
Oh, hey

1093
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,780
Mr. Spaceman

1094
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:49,780


1095
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,260
I'll swallow my face

1096
00:51:54,260 --> 00:52:01,040
In an alien race

1097
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,740
I'll swallow my face

1098
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,840
In an alien race

1099
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,360
I'll swallow my face

1100
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,380
Hey, Mr. Spaceman

1101
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,160
Won't you please take me along?

1102
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,160
I won't do anything wrong

1103
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,160
Oh, hey

1104
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,680
Mr. Spaceman

1105
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,160
Won't you please take me along

1106
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,460
for the ride?

1107
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,280
Oh, hey

1108
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,840
Mr. Spaceman

1109
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,620
Won't you please take me along?

1110
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,640
I won't do anything wrong

1111
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,800
Oh, hey

1112
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,080
Mr. Spaceman

1113
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,100
Won't you please take me along for the ride?

1114
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,240
Music

1115
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:41,580
Music

1116
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,020
Music

1117
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,740
Music

1118
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,520
Music

1119
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,260
Music

1120
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,320
Music

1121
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:08,060
Won't you please take me on for the ride?

1122
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:22,840
That song was by St. Byron Werner's new band, Mockingbird,

1123
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:27,600
after Roger McGlynn, from their album Euphoria.

1124
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:35,140
See MockingbirdHillbillyBand.com for more on that.

1125
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,620
Before that, Reverend Exister with a Bible study from Ministry of Slack.

1126
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,940
And some KPFA Berkeley puzzling evidence provided by Phineas Narco.

1127
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:51,940
Most of these people will be at X Day 14.

1128
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:57,360
Soon, some Firesign Theater rarity.

1129
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,360
And music by Sodi will be played.

1130
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,840
But first, I should mention that this Hour of Slack, number 1,313,

1131
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,660
from the Church of the Subgenius,

1132
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:14,740
with all the information about the show and that church,

1133
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,500
is available at subgenius.com.

1134
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,740
And now, the news.

1135
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,820
From PR News in Washington,

1136
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,580
I'm being blamed for more than 700 uranium-powered,

1137
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,520
uranium-enrichment facilities.

1138
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,820
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today said the Obama administration

1139
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,000
is preparing to launch an initiative to combat PR News.

1140
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,620
His administration has said PR News isn't giving any comfort.

1141
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,080
President Obama has gotten out of hand

1142
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,440
and has nearly doubled in size thanks to PR News in Washington.

1143
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,660
It's true now, you really do, you know, you are who you think you eat.

1144
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,320
You really are.

1145
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,580
I'm quite sure that if you were more careful about looking at the labels of things,

1146
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,300
of what you put inside your body,

1147
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,960
you'd be more aware of like why your dreams are what you dream.

1148
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:00,820
It's true, right?

1149
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,280
You mean food controls dreams?

1150
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,940
No, labels, well, it's like the fact that you can heal...

1151
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,200
A label!

1152
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,060
A label!

1153
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,740
You dreaded Yiddish monster!

1154
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:09,900
A label!

1155
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:10,500
A label!

1156
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,440
The label, right.

1157
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,180
The ladle!

1158
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,700
No, no, no, it's from the ladle.

1159
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,680
The griddle.

1160
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,500
The griddle!

1161
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,560
The griddle!

1162
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,600
The griddle is a ladle made entirely out of clay.

1163
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,780
You've heard of bobbling a fly.

1164
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,440
That's right.

1165
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,440
Well, ladles, no, labels.

1166
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,280
Labels are very...

1167
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,280
very important.

1168
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,180
Like, for example, let's see, think of some labels that I've had.

1169
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,400
Like, I just had some Japanese lager yesterday.

1170
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:35,620
Right?

1171
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,500
I had some Japanese lager with a big red star on it.

1172
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:43,280
And I had one, and of course, you know, beer is a psychedelic,

1173
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,180
and I always take a very heavy trip on a bottle of beer.

1174
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:45,600
Do you really?

1175
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,060
Oh, yeah.

1176
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,360
Have you ever bummed out on beer?

1177
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,840
Oh, man, I sometimes, man.

1178
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,260
I've been sitting sometimes after I've had like a whole beer,

1179
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,440
and somebody will...

1180
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:52,780
A whole beer?

1181
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:55,180
That's like about 10,000 mikes of beer.

1182
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,440
That's, well, yeah, man.

1183
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,680
That's like 16 fluid ounces of pure beer.

1184
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,780
Have you ever shot beer, man?

1185
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,640
Oh, sure, man.

1186
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,060
I missed.

1187
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,860
It's incredible, yeah.

1188
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,720
I was really in an incredible state.

1189
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,160
I took a whole bottle, and somebody came in, man,

1190
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,380
and started to play games with me.

1191
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,340
Oh, wow.

1192
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:09,500
Oh, wow.

1193
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,140
I got a breakdown, man.

1194
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:11,860
Like, oh, man.

1195
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,420
Arm games.

1196
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,120
Arm games.

1197
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:13,540
Right.

1198
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,420
Mild games.

1199
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,780
And I could see the bubbles coming up from all over them, right?

1200
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:17,400
You know, they were...

1201
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,560
I was beginning to have the vision of Burrito.

1202
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:20,920
Burrito?

1203
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:22,820
Burrito, right.

1204
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:23,260
Burrito.

1205
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,060
That's enough.

1206
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:24,860
That's enough.

1207
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,720
Also, notice...

1208
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:26,720
I'm wearing this T-shirt.

1209
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,560
Right, this T-shirt.

1210
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,260
Also known as the Schlitzer, right?

1211
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,440
Which is the person you see...

1212
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:30,940
The Schlitzer.

1213
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,360
That's right.

1214
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,640
If you drink beer near...

1215
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,760
If you drink it near where it was made, where the hops grew,

1216
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,720
if you go down, like, the Santa Ana Freeway and drink a Brew 102,

1217
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,400
you know, you'll see the Schlitzer.

1218
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:41,000
Right.

1219
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,160
He'll come to you and tell you your real name.

1220
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,460
He gets down and plays like a dog around your feet.

1221
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:46,860
Right.

1222
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:47,580
Exactly.

1223
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,160
He's got it...

1224
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,120
Throwing up wildly.

1225
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,100
The Schlitzer has got this T-shirt on with these two cams.

1226
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:52,560
Yeah.

1227
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,720
Two cams, right?

1228
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,100
And it says under it...

1229
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:55,700
What does it usually say?

1230
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,220
Something like...

1231
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:56,840
Artunians.

1232
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:57,780
Artunians.

1233
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,880
Artunians, you know, Artunians, Texaco, Elixir of Life, right?

1234
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:00,380
Yeah.

1235
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,840
Well, that's...

1236
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,380
Don't bogart that joint, my friend.

1237
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,460
Pass it over to me.

1238
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,820
Now, here's Smokey again.

1239
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,920
Hi, I'm Smokeless the Bear.

1240
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,920
Won't you please give me that rope?

1241
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,920
You don't want to start a fire, do you?

1242
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,540
Not very funny.

1243
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,740
Stopping in.

1244
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,020
Here's a department of good advice.

1245
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:23,720
Okay.

1246
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,900
Don't look behind you without turning your head.

1247
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,720
That's right.

1248
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,300
My hands are out.

1249
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,000
Oh, yeah.

1250
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,880
Running nose, tightness of chest, dimness of vision, pinpointing of eye,

1251
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,620
pupils, difficulty in breathing, drooling, excessive sweating, nausea,

1252
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,880
vomiting, cramps, involuntary defecation and urination, twitching, jerking,

1253
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,500
staggering, headache, convulsion, drowsiness, coma, convulsion,

1254
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,220
sensation of breathing, death, and death.

1255
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,980
Yes, all these things can be yours, friends.

1256
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,180
They can be yours today.

1257
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,860
All you have to do is give us a call.

1258
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,880
Pick up your phone, clear the dubby coil of dead jumpers, and let us know

1259
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,280
how many you want.

1260
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,020
We've got plenty of them.

1261
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,660
We also have acorns and sun bears.

1262
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,240
They're all free this week.

1263
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:01,620
Thank you.

1264
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,920
A price, Bob.

1265
00:58:52,920 --> 00:59:01,760
And you know who else will be at 14X Day besides Fat Free and Evolution Control Committee as seen on subgenius.com?

1266
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,780
That hoary old Ohio band Zero Defects.

1267
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,700
Their songs are short, but sweet.

1268
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,200
Drop the A-bomb on me!

1269
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,640
Drop the plan! Make it big!

1270
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,740
Put your brain in the click!

1271
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,640
Do me now! Get a plan!
