1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Quatu, Virada, Nicto

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,020
Quiet numbskulls, I'm broadcasting

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,040
My electronic signals are psychological

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,020
Ultimate destruction of the systems, purely melodic

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,100
Listening causes hypnotic

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,960
Trances to leave your thoughts clotted

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,920
Lost in a dream unspotted

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,640
Insanity from my creation, now retarded

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,840
You're all with Corky in a sitcom plotted

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,460
Oh, my friends, prepare to take the hand

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,120
Of that pipe-smoking man, Bob

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,540
And let him lead you and your ears

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,860
Down the primrose path to slack

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,780
For the subgenius radio ministry

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,580
Hour of Slack

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,500
Uh...

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,980
Yeah...

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,100
Yes...

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,220
You know, it's not nearly enough for you to believe in Bob

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,380
You must suck his entrails with your psychic firmament

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,780
You must live in Bob's own depleted spaces

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,980
In his own world

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,400
Suck with Bob's spite

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:51,620
To droplets and

25
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,700
possibilities

26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,920
What is the level of humanity such that we, as humans, might be able to tell egos,

27
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,400
able to tell

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,040
a place or a world that is asymptotically in batshells and impulse podía beijuana-drowned?

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:07,140
Soon enough, the family will change from a greasy green to a bright, beneficent blue.

30
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,540
Blue?

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,060
Blue?

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:34,440
The Assyrian army camped outside Jerusalem, ready to conquer and level it.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,400
But most of the army died in their sleep one night.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,380
But so the Lord ended that threat.

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:50,740
And there's other stories, like the prophets of Baal, Queen Jezebel, Goliath of Gath.

36
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,540
These weren't just innocent bystanders.

37
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,420
These were enemies who felt the wrath of God's backhand.

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,100
When tough love must get even tougher.

39
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,380
God's backhand.

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,440
When evil plays rough, God can play rougher.

41
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:23,540
We're not talking about tennis or ping pong or any kind of friendly sport.

42
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,900
We're talking about God fighting for his people where someone can really get hurt.

43
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,240
But that someone is your enemy.

44
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,380
Who'd have no qualms about it.

45
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,980
God's backhand.

46
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,920
God's backhand.

47
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,500
Yet as strong as it ever was.

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,220
God's backhand.

49
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,900
It will solve problems that nothing else does.

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,640
God's backhand.

51
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,380
When you need it.

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,980
When you need something more than just defense.

53
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,720
God's backhand.

54
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,500
Will send evil flying over the fence.

55
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,000
God's backhand.

56
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,100
God's backhand.

57
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,840
And this is Michael Pepe again.

58
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,220
As soon as you turn your back.

59
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,280
Everything in the universe snaps itself inside out with a hideous sucking motion.

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:54,720
The only reason you cannot call the world impossible is because it is only through the world that you know the concept of impossibility.

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,760
You have been led to believe that everyone feels he or she may be the only living consciousness.

62
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,820
But you are in fact the only one for whom this is true.

63
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,580
The fundamental structure of reality is totally transformed every instant.

64
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,660
But it provides you with a phony memory that it has always been the way it is.

65
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,220
Since you are always at the exact center of an infinity loop.

66
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,980
There is no such thing as movement, location, space, or time.

67
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,280
You are a row of electrochemical events.

68
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,040
You are a sequence of events taking place in your cerebral body.

69
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,600
Nothing has meaning in itself, but everything can support any meaning.

70
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:53,680
If you could glimpse for even a moment the real meaning of existence, your brain would be neuroanatomically destroyed.

71
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,900
You cannot conceive a thing for which you do not have a word.

72
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,460
Everyone's perception is radically unique.

73
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,000
But leads them to believe it is more or less similar for everyone else.

74
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,740
You have always been listening to this tape.

75
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:23,480
You cannot remember a time before you were born because there was no such time, nor any other.

76
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,800
It has always been this moment.

77
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,880
Death could occur inexplicably any second.

78
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,400
And there is no other chance.

79
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:33,980
But there is still a moment.

80
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,320
The moment of the world.

81
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,800
The oddness of the world exceeds the imagination by an infinity.

82
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,000
It has produced this talking about it.

83
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,520
This talker.

84
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,380
This labeling of it.

85
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,720
This labeler.

86
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,960
The concept of labeling.

87
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,460
The concept of oddness.

88
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,520
The word oddness.

89
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,360
The concept of a word.

90
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,400
The word word.

91
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,480
The word concept.

92
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,660
And the concept of a concept.

93
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:10,000
Consciousness is not a continuous state, but a momentary surfacing for variable periods at random points.

94
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,100
Your next awakening could be 20 years from now.

95
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,600
Nothing can be proven to be true.

96
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:27,720
Because reality is composed of infinitesimally small moments, there is no such thing as an event.

97
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:36,420
The reason people are untrustworthy is because their cerebral processes are fundamentally random ones.

98
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:44,500
During the night, every ego in the world changes bodies, inheriting also the memory.

99
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,980
Old age is not a gradual, but a catastrophic process, and could strike at any moment.

100
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,700
Dreams are the reality for which the real world is.

101
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,960
The real world is a dream.

102
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:09,800
There has never been a time in history when men have voluntarily used less than the greatest possible military technology against their enemy,

103
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,520
and allowed a great technology to fall into disuse and ignorance.

104
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,080
Therefore, there will be a full-scale nuclear holocaust.

105
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,960
You are dreaming this moment.

106
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:35,640
The universe will continue to expand until there is not enough matter per unit space to provide the gravity necessary for regeneration,

107
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,440
and it will slowly die out.

108
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,700
When you finish listening to this, everything will be different from the way it was when you began.

109
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,320
Again, your new memory will conceal this from you.

110
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,780
All events occur at random.

111
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,660
The universe is...

112
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,540
one of an infinite number of universes,

113
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,260
the closest of which is undetectable,

114
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,120
being a billion universe lengths away.

115
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,340
Only what you are experiencing right now exists.

116
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,500
Love is the feeling that another person is really yourself.

117
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,160
You are about to make the first conscious decision of your life.

118
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,120
Oh...

119
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,040
Moment of om

120
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,200
...

121
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,640
or Reverend Michael Pepe,

122
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,760
and you are listening to the Hour of Slack Radio Ministry.

123
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,660
Michael Pepe, dear friends, from the old hour of Slack number 106.

124
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,480
We're dredging ancient hours of Slack now.

125
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:14,380
And before that, friends, God's Backhand was by the great Richard Hackley,

126
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,180
posted to altbinaries.slack by the great New Monet.

127
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,180
We've got a lot of new stuff that was posted to that news group

128
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:29,180
by Reverend Artemiya Salina and by Reverend Why Ask Why Ask Why.

129
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,340
And because, friends, we've moved.

130
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,700
Listen, listen to the ambience in this room.

131
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,820
This is our new studio complete with everything, everything.

132
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,300
Anyone could, even a keyboard.

133
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,920
Listen to this.

134
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
I've got this keyboard.

135
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,580
I can just.

136
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,600
It is white and new.

137
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,400
And beautiful.

138
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,420
It has been painted with the sweat of Lonesome Cowboy Dave used for paint.

139
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:09,120
The subgenius storage facility in the tomb of the faceless Bobby have been done.

140
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,940
We finished the shelves.

141
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,800
We filled them halfway with the ancient crumbling subgenius tapes and video

142
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,160
and text and artwork extracted from the previous abyss.

143
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:30,120
We've lifted up the roll top desk, the rack, the hour of slack production table heard here.

144
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,920
Oops, there went my.

145
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,040
That just knocked out my.

146
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,080
Oh, there it is.

147
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,220
And we can even create.

148
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,760
Well, you know, I'm not finished moving that castle, though, Dave.

149
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,020
There's still all the boxes of souls and the canisters and stuff that are in that.

150
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,200
That basement of that dungeon of that other cast.

151
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,480
They're the special vampire.

152
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,720
I mean, it's the undead fluids you keep to keep.

153
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,180
I mean, that's not myself.

154
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,900
Well, I mean, it's firm bank.

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,860
That stuff wasn't all that complicated.

156
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,120
And what a joy to your mother.

157
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,020
It was when you took the whole sperm bank in your hands with that pair of blue sunglasses,

158
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,400
that pair of John Lennon sunglasses and paraded off down Main Street anywhere.

159
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,400
You have seen that silly day, you know, as well as anybody.

160
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,620
Wink, wink.

161
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,880
But that sperm bank is a bunch of.

162
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:30,660
Nitro frozen nitrogen containers that keep the sperms immobile and frozen from fighting.

163
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,640
Yeah, because these are super sperms.

164
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:41,200
Of course, genius little farts that can that will literally eat their way up into whatever egg female egg is nearest.

165
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,660
Well, they blind primate.

166
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,520
They blinded some.

167
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,080
Yeah, they go in the wrong way.

168
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,620
It's like a mini meteor in space.

169
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,400
You see that movie Mission to Mars.

170
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,860
They're all partying.

171
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,840
Suddenly the guy's got a.

172
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,200
Hole in his hand and there's a hole in the fuel tank.

173
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,540
Well, there's a tiny atom sized meteor going near the speed of light.

174
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,600
Just happened to intersect with their spaceship.

175
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,420
Bad luck.

176
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,180
Bad luck.

177
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,320
That's the way a subgenius sperm will just shoot right through.

178
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,540
Because it's like a piranha.

179
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,460
It's like the piranha of sperms.

180
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,600
You know what I mean?

181
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,140
It's more than just a.

182
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,360
It's like a tadpole with millions and millions.

183
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,760
It's like the fish of sperms, which it's funny.

184
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,860
That's a funny metaphor.

185
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,660
Because candura fish is a fish that swims up your urethra to eat its way into your heart.

186
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,820
Whereas the sperms usually go out the other way.

187
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,900
And so does your heart.

188
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,380
One of them canduras might, you know.

189
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,480
How often have we all fallen out of love after that final emission?

190
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,500
All of the.

191
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,800
You know, that goes out of your heart and comes back into your emissions.

192
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,020
Well, that's the problem, isn't it, Dave?

193
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,780
So often love starts out as an emission.

194
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,660
You emit love and it goes in.

195
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,940
But then it.

196
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,380
Sort of comes right back at you.

197
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,920
And it's just your own love coming back.

198
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,300
And there's.

199
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:57,860
And that's it.

200
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,340
It just went in a big circle.

201
00:13:59,420 --> 00:13:59,580
Yeah.

202
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,060
And you get left on sitting on the curb with your hat in your hand all limp.

203
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,620
Going, oh, I've been.

204
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,060
I've been dumped again.

205
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,360
Dumped again.

206
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
I'm just a sorry old.

207
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,520
But friends.

208
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,460
No matter what.

209
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,040
Sorry.

210
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,700
The deer parts and the fisheries.

211
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,680
Man eating chimes and moods.

212
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,960
What's going on, man?

213
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,140
I don't get it.

214
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,740
It's more.

215
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,180
More than a happening or something going on.

216
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,120
It's a whole.

217
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,380
It's a whole band of.

218
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,560
Things have seeped in.

219
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,400
To our psychic consciousness.

220
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,300
Yeah.

221
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,320
Are you.

222
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,460
Are you.

223
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:35,900
Right.

224
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,880
Those of you with.

225
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,640
Plural.

226
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,300
You read through.

227
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,140
Could please.

228
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,120
If you could.

229
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,660
Please.

230
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,000
Please.

231
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,360
Could you.

232
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:43,820
If you.

233
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,580
If you could.

234
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,020
Please.

235
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,420
Just remove your garments there and place them next to the vacuum cleaner.

236
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,920
And those of you with a single.

237
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,980
Single scars where the urethra is wars.

238
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,500
Please just step to the side.

239
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:57,960
And now.

240
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,400
A little.

241
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,240
Now.

242
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,680
You know.

243
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,540
You.

244
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:01,700


245
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:01,940
Your.

246
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,180
One.

247
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:02,900
Is not alone.

248
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,980
On this cosmic.

249
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,560
Meddling.

250
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,980
Earth has been inhabited.

251
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,460
Ground.

252
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,820
Stop.

253
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,040
For millions of years.

254
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,460
By hundreds of different races of aliens from space.

255
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,400
Both.

256
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,120
Benevolent.

257
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,360
And.

258
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:13,860
Hostile.

259
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,160
Have you ever noticed that no two UFO photographs show the same.

260
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,560
Hubcap.

261
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,240
Many of the saucer.

262
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,660
Jogging.

263
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,200
Are simple.

264
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,920
Humanoids.

265
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,280
Like.

266
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,580
Us.

267
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,260
Space.

268
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,020
Nazis.

269
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,920
Who do little more than freeze up car motors on lonely country roads at night.

270
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,180
And occasionally rape or mutilate humans.

271
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,740
Or.

272
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,040
They usually look like.

273
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,460
Ears.

274
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,180
Elves.

275
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,880
Or dwarves.

276
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,580
And are of relatively minor importance.

277
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,200
Since Bob himself has faster stations than they have.

278
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,240
They only frequently break the rule of don't let the earthlings see you.

279
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,560
But there are far other more confusing things.

280
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,020
Managers mass grade.

281
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,280
They pull on their kebab kits when I can't climb my heels.

282
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,280


283
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,920
Which I'd choose your hair.

284
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,700
And where have you gone to get this for us?

285
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,560
Wait.

286
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:02,580
You have got your purinder.

287
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:02,580


288
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,000
Always both of my fucking ears.

289
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,220


290
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,860
New NFL teams gecko stickies.

291
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:08,860


292
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,400
Everything else is def tectonica and-

293
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
There got to be.

294
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,600
I've got absolutely no decimals for內

295
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,700
Just do whether you're drunk or not.

296
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,620
Damn dineya name is not Michael Williams.

297
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:13,980
I believe you know of something on my top Umwelt MP3.

298
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:13,980


299
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,860
I believe your car's purel-

300
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,200
And Bob.

301
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,360
Dozens, perhaps hundreds of entities speak through Bob.

302
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,800
Many voices.

303
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,520
They also listen and see through him.

304
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,180
And many even go to him for advice on handling humans.

305
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,800
Bob is a wide open channel they can log on to for the divulging of past lives, secrets, and ground rubber.

306
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,720
Oh, here it is.

307
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,060
There's our chance.

308
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,660
Yes, friends.

309
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,820
It's incredible.

310
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,000
We even managed to move the iron lungs and maidens up here into this new studio.

311
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:05,520
And at this point, friends, I am up to my testicle in Tesla coils getting ready for the final bye-bye to Earth and the Pink Boys on that day when we are ruptured.

312
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,740
July 5th, 2001 for X-Day.

313
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,460
Incidentally, friends, I wanted to mention that I have dibs on X-Day.

314
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,820
I've got dibs on the Grand Canyon, including Flintstones Bedrock City.

I've got all the furniture in the West Wing of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

Doc Frog can have the Vermeers.

319
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,760
I don't want any violent showdowns to mar what should be our most glorious time of looting.

320
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:45,160
Remember, friends, after X-Day, anything not made by WOM will be a collectible.

321
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,180
Oh, yeah, yeah.

322
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,600

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,740
Although, really,

362
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,240
friends, I guess I don't need those,

363
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
because we'll be

364
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
able to think the movies

365
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,260
and, whoa, we'll print

366
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,460
them out in 3D Spell-O-Vision

367
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,500
and feel around!

368
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,080
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

369
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,260
Everything worked! The study

370
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,320
of mutation and the public

371
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,340
sphere of the unknown can again

372
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,140
proceed.

373
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,260
Incidentally, friends, I should mention

374
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,000
that the new subgenius address,

375
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,380
my personal post office

376
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,320
address, will be

377
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,480
given at the end of the broadcast.

378
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,880
And, although we're still,

379
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,600
the church is still working

380
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,520
out of Dallas, you send your orders to

381
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,620
Dallas, and I send my

382
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,440
orders to you from here

383
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,380
in Cleveland Heights. That's

384
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,480
post office box 181

385
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,340
417 Cleveland

386
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,480
Heights, Ohio 44118.

387
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,600
And that music there was

388
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
by The Bishop.

389
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,740
A wonderful

390
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,080
new tune called

391
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,800
Dance of the Rockets.

392
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,220
Uh,

393
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,660
yes, yes,

394
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,700
yes, yes.

395
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,480
Whew!

396
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,880
Whew!

397
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,720
Yes, it's truly

398
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,080
a cliche. It came from

399
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,040
heaven in the first shipment

400
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,240
in the Rockets.

401
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,180
If you think they'll use

402
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,240
too much, complain elsewhere.

403
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,540
They are holy

404
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,140
instruments of instruction

405
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,960
from here in the headquarters.

406
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,120
We could be what we really are.

407
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,920
Humans together,

408
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,580
subject to the trauma of birth

409
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,720
and the fear of death,

410
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,820
to pain and loneliness,

411
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,520
disease and loss,

412
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,800
ecstasy and pleasure.

413
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,160
We could accept

414
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,340
our vulnerability, which would allow us

415
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,320
to feel it and,

416
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,940
in turn, would help us to feel

417
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,580
all of what we have to deny

418
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,700
when we try to be invulnerable,

419
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,580
impregnable.

420
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,100
Consider the root of that word.

421
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,300
.

422
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,300


423
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:36,800
.

424
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:37,840
.

425
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:39,880
.

426
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,860
.

427
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,380
.

428
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,020
.

429
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,880
.

430
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,680
.

431
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,600
.

432
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,200
.

433
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,040
.

434
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,040


435
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Woo-hoo!

436
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,000
My fiery friend, are you feeling better?

437
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,440
I think a plutonium injection and a shot of steam in the right place will wake you up.

438
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,840
And we're on our way.

439
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:33,360
We're only three and one-half blocks right now from the Ericksonian Glass High Security Art Compound.

440
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,760
They have not found me yet, thank goodness.

441
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,660
I'm still just a nameless building with a cow skull and cross glass cutters over the front door

442
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,300
as far as the...

443
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,300
Local art police are concerned.

444
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,740
Oh, there's one of their cars.

445
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,540
You heard that young girl scream?

446
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,940
She was thought to be an artist also.

447
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,620
The mortar flies into a flame and instantly frizzles into a heap of protoplasmic sludge

448
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,800
so the collars are burned and seared by the blistering truth revealed over the air

449
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,360
by the doctors.

450
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,700
Oh, precision.

451
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,680
Oh, yes, dear friends.

452
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,400
I heard some puzzling evidence there and some glass madness doing that art security thing

453
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,840
and Dr. Howell ranting and some Wellman mixes from...

454
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,020
KPFA and Berklee reprinted from old hour of slack number 106.

455
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:59,040
Friends, and now the boredoms with the sound all around us.

456
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,180
Followed by G. Gordon Gordon.

457
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,080
Wellman.

458
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,640
Wellman.

459
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,740
Wellman.

460
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,660
Wellman.

461
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:11,660


462
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:11,940


463
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,280


464
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,220
Wellman.

465
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,840
Wellman.

466
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,300
Wellman.

467
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,520


468
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:14,640
Wellman.

469
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:14,960
Wellman.

470
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:14,960


471
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,580
Wellman.

472
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:29,080
Wellman We're not pissed to go back no more.

473
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,520
We are not pissed.

474
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,040
We will not name it Mr. G. G. G. G. Room Report.

475
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,560
Se 있다 lpflicht.

476
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,440
I'm here.

477
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,700
I'm here.

478
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:44,760
I'm here.

479
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:44,820
I'm here.

480
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:44,900
I'm here.

481
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:44,980
I'm here.

482
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:44,980


483
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:56,840
I'm pissing around, pissing around, pissing around, pissing around.

484
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:21,160
I'm pissing around, pissing around, pissing around, pissing around.

485
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,260
I hear puzzling evidence.

486
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,960
Don't go to him again.

487
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,240
Don't go to him again, okay?

488
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,500
So what, Mr. Dobbs? We're in shape for the finals.

489
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,460
No, really, Mr. Dobbs.

490
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,200
And by the way, Bob, just where is that long promised bucket of pills?

491
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,100
And tell me, Bob, what's this slack business?

492
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,040
Shouldn't the hierarchical slack holders be making unearthly dividends on a regular basis by now?

493
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,320
Or is it wrong?

494
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:56,640
Just.

495
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,260
It's really too much fun, Bob.

496
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,000
Is there a war on here?

497
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,160
Well, there is a war on here, Bob.

498
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,200
And whatever happened to too much is always better than not enough.

499
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,920
Has there been inside trading in the Souls repository in Dobbs Town?

500
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,380
Oh, come on, Bob. Remember us? Remember the old guys?

501
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,360
We used to sell froth mixture for you way back in the good old days.

502
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,680
We've heard the old Dobbs head snake oil routine before, Bob.

503
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,060
We know all about the bleeding head of AP.

504
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,340
But when will it come is what we want to know.

505
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,660
So when shall the fabled...

506
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,620
...flut plane tilt?

507
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,300
And when shall things at last begin to flow to all, all, all of us...

508
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:38,000
...who despite the perilous times in which we do live, plead unto you still, Bob?

509
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,700
Next day's coming closer, Dobbs.

510
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,740
You haven't got all the time to the end of the world, have you?

511
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,500
Hadn't you better just get cracking, Mr. Dobbs?

512
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,820
Don't you think it's time to get your ass out of party mode and back up the crack?

513
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,420
Hmm.

514
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,160
Mark Mothersbaugh, The Big Boss

515
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,160


516
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,820
This is Mark Mothersbaugh. Mark Mothersbaugh, The Big Boss

517
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:56,820


518
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:56,820


519
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,720
And, um...

520
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,220
Hajime Tachibana

521
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,280
Uh, and Nancy Ferguson.

522
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,480
This is a pretty unusual little, little recording here.

523
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,260
Thanks to Byron Werner.

524
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,480
Breaking citizens of the world!

525
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,700
We are so happy to be here with you today for Mr. Ituchi's NFL!

526
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,460
Mr. Ituchi's NFL

527
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,460


528
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,820
Mr. Ituchi's NFL

529
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,760
Mr. Ituchi's NFL

530
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:26,800
Mr. Ituchi's NFL

531
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:49,520
Mr. And the LA A- Thank you very much!

532
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,400
Please, everyone out there

533
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,760
Let's start off this weekend with Mark Mothersbaugh here.

534
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:50,760


535
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:50,760


536
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:50,760


537
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:50,760


538
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:50,760


539
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,420
Y'all always welcome me around

540
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,220
Living by Dr. Smith!

541
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,360
I hope to see you next week!

542
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:54,360


543
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:54,840
to me

544
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,480
it doesn't matter to me

545
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,580
cause there's something

546
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,320
bigger than what you see

547
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,960
there's something

548
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,320
important that is waiting for you

549
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,200
oh yeah

550
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,720
oh yeah

551
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,000
knock it off

552
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,980
tell a good story people

553
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,600
tell me nothing

554
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
do that's what I'm waiting for

555
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,360
it doesn't matter to me

556
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,920
it doesn't matter to me

557
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,700
oh yeah

558
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:48,700


559
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,300
cause there's a train

560
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,620
for a new destination

561
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,040
and a tenant for a new destination

562
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,140
and I tell you my friend

563
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,760
you better count the years

564
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,220
deadline coming

565
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,800
I don't care

566
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,820
if you ever change your underwear

567
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,040
it doesn't matter to me

568
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,700
cause there's something

569
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,020
bigger than what you see

570
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,720
it doesn't matter to me

571
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,320
it doesn't matter to me

572
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,660
it doesn't matter to me

573
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:39,000
oh that's

574
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,060
No Matter by Mark Mothersbaugh

575
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,420
and Nancy Ferguson

576
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:43,960
Nancy

577
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,780
Nancy Ferguson

578
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,680
and Nancy Ferguson

579
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,300
and Hachibana

580
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
what's that guy's name

581
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,380
Hajime Tachibana

582
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,780
I only know him as Tachibana

583
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,600
and the rest of this song here

584
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,740
is by Tachibana

585
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,100
a Japanese fellow

586
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,060
pretty hot stuff

587
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:48,700


588
00:30:48,700 --> 00:31:18,700


589
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,180
Hi

590
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,320
the

591
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:29,320


592
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,300
is

593
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,280
named

594
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,200
Hatchibana

595
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,880
& let's meet

596
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,740
the

597
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,560
live

598
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:56,080
You are lovely, hair like lovely glasses

599
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:10,020
Your hair is so beautiful, I can't believe it

600
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,540
Baby, baby, baby

601
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,940
Baby, baby, baby

602
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,740
From the top of the mountain

603
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,860
Good, good

604
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,940
Kill the horse

605
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,220
The horse is dead

606
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,920
Roxadam Hussein's ass

607
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,140
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow

608
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,900
That's right, that's right

609
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,240
Tomorrow, tomorrow

610
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,500
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow

611
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,660
Good night

612
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,480
Good night

613
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,260
Good night

614
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,400
Thank you

615
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,460
Good night

616
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,000
Give me the antidote or kill me

617
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,260
None are so blind as those who have no heads

618
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,700
Come on, man, spit it out

619
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,900
Don't lick the taste of that, I'm not doing that again

620
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,040
Oh no, no

621
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,200
Another insidious quote inserted here

622
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,460
Don't attempt to adjust the controls

623
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,800
We are no longer in control

624
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,040
Smaller children should ask an adult to help

625
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,560
All your space art belonged to us

626
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,280
Why does it hurt when I pee?

627
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,480
Help, help, I can't take it anymore

628
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,400
Praise Bob

629
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,320
Praise Bob

630
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,200
Praise Bob

631
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,060
Praise Bob

632
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,100
Yeah, hallelujah

633
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

634
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah

635
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah

636
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah

637
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,060
Hey, you remember the first time we raided the Bob mansion?

638
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,220
The Playboy mansion of Bob?

639
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,040
Oh man, God, you could just smell the women

640
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,560
He was roasting some over an open fire

641
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,560
Remember that?

642
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,480
Well, it wasn't a real fire

643
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,800
That's what I mean, they smelled so crisp and crackly

644
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,780
Yeah, those polyps

645
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,980
Polypurethane vinyl fires

646
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,120
They're not real but

647
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,580
Boy, they look so good with those apples in their mouths

648
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,940
And just

649
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,100
Bob caught us

650
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,760
He always does

651
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,920
I don't find I never have to do that again

652
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,240
No, you don't want to get caught in that web

653
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,300
What did they call that?

654
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,880
A job?

655
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,600
Yeah, he made us get a job

656
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
God, that was awful

657
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,520
I hated that

658
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,440
Finding in the basement

659
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,620
But there were a lot of naked female clerks to help us there

660
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,340
Remember?

661
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,620
Remember Lonnie and Jeanette?

662
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,660
Jeanette, the one with the bright red hair and the little teeny tiny sharp teeth?

663
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,340
Yeah, and who's the one from the whale farm?

664
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,200
Oh, Betty Jean.

665
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,440
Bertha?

666
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,140
Betty Jean.

667
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,080
Big Bad Bertha?

668
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,160
Big Bad.

669
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,220
Big Bad Bertha.

670
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,640
Do you remember the captain?

671
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,460
Do you remember the guy from...

672
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:41,480
Oh, yeah.

673
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,020
Arr, arr, arr.

674
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,080
Arr, Bob should be timbered.

675
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,740
He's Bob this and Bob that stupid.

676
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,040
I hate those Bobby idiots.

677
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,500
You know, 65 years old, should be someplace in Florida or Arizona, but he's still in the

678
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,580
wheelchair giving commands.

679
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,700
But he's just gotten turned on to Bob, so he was in that phase.

680
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,700
He was in that for year one phase where everybody's actually...

681
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,300
Look, there's that man Bob.

682
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,040
He found it.

683
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,420
There's another shop that's Bob's TV repair.

684
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,680
Oh, there's Bob's used car.

685
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,600
Bob's everywhere.

686
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,620
I got Bob on the brain.

687
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,420
I got Bob on the brain.

688
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,860
And there's nothing wrong with having Bob on the brain, friends.

689
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,960
As long as you can purge it.

690
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,720
Every now and then.

691
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,720
Just every now and then.

692
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:25,220
Until they were locked up with the fish, which was no mean feat.

693
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,880
The fish themselves were some 300 pounds.

694
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,940
Some of them weighed in excess of 700 pounds.

695
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,360
Each and every fish was equipped with a dynamic facial structure.

696
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,880
The kind that could tear apart pieces of rock with one grimace.

697
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,740
These were the fish that Bob had selected.

698
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,860
His mighty fighting sperm.

699
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,980
To spread like a mankind of...

700
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,100
Cardium throughout the depleted universe.

701
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,280
So you could just take it up to your room and do whatever you want with it.

702
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,860
You know what I mean?

703
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,800
Sit back in that old bungalow roll away bed and watch the subway go by.

704
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,540
Take one last drink from that bottle of port.

705
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,520
Pick up the gun.

706
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,740
Look at it.

707
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,800
Put one bullet in.

708
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,420
Spin the chamber.

709
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,440
Put the gun down.

710
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,440
Pick it up again.

711
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,660
Spin the chamber again.

712
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,440
Put it down.

713
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,360
Look out the window.

714
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,160
It's just seven trains going by.

715
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:23,900
Ah, yes.

716
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,540
Life is beautiful.

717
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,840
Maybe a few more crackers and I've got a little mustard left to put on them.

718
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,400
For a while.

719
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,480
The End

720
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:35,480


721
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,100
The End

722
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,920
The End

723
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,040
The End

724
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,260
The End

725
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:42,320
The End

726
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,420
The End

727
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,020
The End

728
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,020


729
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,020


730
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,600
The End

731
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,120
The End

732
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,500
The End

733
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:46,500


734
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:46,500


735
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:46,500


736
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,660
The End

737
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,020
The End

738
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,860
A lunatic is on the grass

739
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,860
A lunatic is on the grass

740
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,860
Remembering games and these chains and laughs

741
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,120
Got to keep the loonies on the path

742
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,360
A lunatic is in the hall

743
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,560
The lunatics are in my hall

744
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,380
The paper holds the folded faces to the floor

745
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,960
Every day in the table, every day tomorrow

746
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,880
And if the dam rings open, many years do still

747
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,300
If there is no room above the hill

748
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,280
And if your next one is on the roof still

749
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,940
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

750
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,320
The lunatic is in my head

751
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,420
It is in my head

752
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,100
You raise the blade, you make the change

753
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,580
You rearrange me till I'm sane

754
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,860
You lock the door, you lock the door

755
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,340
Throw away the key

756
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,840
There's someone in my head but it's not me

757
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,740
And if a cloud bursts up and I ring your key

758
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,100
And you shout and no one sees the key

759
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,340
And if a man or an interest plays a trick too

760
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,140
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

761
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,720
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

762
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,480
One, two, three, four

763
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,440
And if a cloud bursts thunder in your ear

764
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,780
And you shout and no one sees the key

765
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,840
And if a man or an interest plays a trick too

766
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:47,840


767
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:47,840


768
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:47,840


769
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:47,840


770
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:47,840


771
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:47,840


772
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,520
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

773
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:56,380
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

774
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,240
guitar solo

775
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,440
bass solo

776
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,200
drums solo

777
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,900
guitar solo

778
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,820
drums solo

779
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,000
bass solo

780
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,280
drums solo

781
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,080
drums solo

782
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,360
bass solo

783
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,300
drums solo

784
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,300


785
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,620
drums solo

786
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,440
drums solo

787
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,840
bass solo

788
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,680
mostly playa

789
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,040
drum solo

790
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,380
conventional jazz

791
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,380


792
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,380


793
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,380


794
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,380


795
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,380


796
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,400
drum solo

797
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,960
drums solo

798
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,480
and other instruments

799
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:47,820
zabки

800
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,440
I can't think of anything to say except

801
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,940
I think it's

802
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,760
MOLLY!

803
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,760
MOLLY!

804
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,700
MOLLY!

805
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,260
MOLLY!

806
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:49,780
MOLLY!

807
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,200
MOLLY!

808
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,420
MOLLY!

809
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,420
MOLLY!

810
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:00,680
MOLLY!

811
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:00,700
MOLLY!

812
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,060
MOLLY!

813
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,360
MOLLY!

814
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,120
MOLLY!

815
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,600
MOLLY!

816
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,840
Dear friends,

817
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,500
this music is by

818
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,420
Dr. Chris Gross

819
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,300
and

820
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,520
Men in Black.

821
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,420
But you know,

822
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,680
you know

823
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,040
an exquisitely

824
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,120
sharpened hatred

825
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,520
for the pink boy is

826
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,160
of course an emotion

827
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,800
not difficult for subgeniuses

828
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,400
to harbor.

829
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,680
If the truth be known,

830
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,720
this hatred does not abound

831
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,500
in every subgenius soul.

832
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,720
It relies upon too

833
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,520
many mysterious and hidden

834
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,420
patterns of life and

835
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,100
chance to flourish luxuriantly

836
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,640
everywhere.

837
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,700
Real hatred of the

838
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,560
sort of which I speak,

839
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,220
hatred so

840
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,220
pure and obdurate

841
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,740
that no sympathy,

842
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,060
no human warmth,

843
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,720
no flicker of compassion

844
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,260
can make the slightest nick or

845
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,300
scratch upon the stony

846
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,720
surface of its being.

847
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,340
That is, that kind of hatred

848
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,380
is not common to

849
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,680
all subgeniuses.

850
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,600
Because many conditions are

851
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,800
required for the full

852
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,720
fruition of this hatred,

853
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,220
for its ripe and malevolent

854
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,300
growth. Yet none of these

855
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,520
is as important as that at one time

856
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,900
or another that subgenius

857
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,820
must live in some degree

858
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,720
of intimacy with the

859
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,120
pink boy, the human.

860
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,760
That he may know the object

861
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,400
of his hatred, that he

862
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,320
become knowledgeable about the

863
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,260
mediocritons of wiles,

864
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,220
his pink duplicity, his

865
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,060
subgenius and his ultimate

866
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,840
depravity. For without

867
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,820
knowing the pink boy at close

868
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,660
hand, without having submitted to his

869
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,280
wanton and arrogant kindnesses,

870
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,740
without having smelt the

871
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,540
smell of his bed sheets and his dirty

872
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,480
under drawers and the inside of his privy,

873
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,660
and felt the casual yet

874
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,760
insolent touch of his women's

875
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,920
fingers upon his own yeti

876
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,900
arm, without seeing him

877
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,720
at sport and at ease

878
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,640
and at his hypocrite's worship

879
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,320
and at his drunken

880
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,440
mildness and his lustful and

881
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,520
adulterous couplings in the

882
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,600
hay fields and the condos,

883
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,600
without having known all these cozy

884
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,500
and familial truths, I say,

885
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,240
a subgenius can only

886
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,080
pretend hatred.

887
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,820
Such hatred is only an abstraction

888
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,980
and a delusion.

889
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,840
He finds himself trying to hate

890
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,740
pink boys, but he

891
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,620
will come to understand that he's hating

892
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,600
imperfectly without that calm

893
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,600
and intelligent and unrepenting

894
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,240
purity of hatred.

895
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,460
Which I have described and which is so

896
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,040
necessary in order to

897
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:51,860
murder.

898
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,920
A man's world,

899
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,120
but it wouldn't be

900
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,160
nothing without a woman

901
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,120
or a girl.

902
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,800
So,

903
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,880
remember the call

904
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,540
to take us

905
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,320
over the road.

906
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,340
So,

907
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,800


908
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,800


909
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,800


910
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,800


911
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,800


912
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,800


913
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,500
I'm going to

914
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,500


915
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,500


916
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,640
who was a

917
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,260
man made a train

918
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,160
to carry the

919
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,580
heavy load

920
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,820
man made the

921
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,380
electric light

922
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,900
to take us out

923
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,580
of the dark

924
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,640
and man made the boat

925
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,560
for the water

926
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,400
just like,

927
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,120
just like Noah

928
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,520
to take us

929
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:19,600
to the sea.

930
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:19,600


931
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,540
this is a man's world

932
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,500
but it wouldn't be

933
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
nothing

934
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,360
without a woman

935
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,660
or a girl.

936
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,380
Man thinks about

937
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,220
a little bitty

938
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,660
baby girl

939
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,120
and a baby boy

940
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,120
and man makes

941
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,820
him happy

942
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,120
cause man

943
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,040
made some toys

944
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,280
and after man

945
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,100
has made

946
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,340
everything

947
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,960
everything he can

948
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,980
you know

949
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,880
that man makes

950
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,660
the money

951
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,440
to buy

952
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,280
another man.

953
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,820
This is a man's

954
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:11,880
world

955
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,340
this is a

956
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,180
man's world

957
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,020
but it wouldn't

958
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,520
be nothing

959
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,860
nothing

960
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,320
nothing

961
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,360
without a woman

962
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,920
or a girl.

963
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:32,420
music

964
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,200
music

965
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,620
music

966
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,180
music

967
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,800
music

968
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


969
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


970
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


971
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


972
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:49,780
music

973
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:51,980
music

974
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,320
music

975
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:57,840
music

976
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:57,860
music

977
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:57,880
music

978
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:57,900
music

979
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:57,920
music

980
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:57,940
music

981
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:57,960
music

982
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:12,900
music

983
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:12,920
music

984
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:17,600
music

985
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,020
You are...

986
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,180
The Residence, dear friends.

987
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,380
Live in Chicago, 2001 from Reverend Chris Lee.

988
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:10,540
And before that, me reading from the diary of Nat Turner.

989
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,800
Braindale with music by Chris Lee.

990
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,060
I mean, no, Christopher Gross.

991
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:16,740
Chris Gross.

992
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:16,920
Chris Gross.

993
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,880
Brain Damage was that song there by The Squirrels.

994
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,800
And of course, we've been hearing some Einstein Secret Orchestra

995
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,440
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and host Chaz Smith.

996
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,800
Perhaps some Radio Patapoo from Amsterdam

997
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,480
with Reverend Yitze and Pope Black.

998
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,340
Random Speak from Or Kill Me Radio.

999
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,300
Cryptology from Stang 64, Flow Spark.

1000
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,100
This background music is called Subgenius.

1001
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,700
By the band C-Rox.

1002
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,020
And now, Doug Valentine.

1003
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,100
Now that we've gotten to this level,

1004
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,640
we're going to just go right down to the very bottom

1005
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,000
and do something, a song about something

1006
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,580
that everybody is very familiar with.

1007
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,780
It involves hair.

1008
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,280
It involves blindness.

1009
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,440
And it involves...

1010
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,460
You can figure out the rest.

1011
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:29,900
You can figure out the rest.

1012
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,400
The good times, we've had.

1013
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:56,520
Pocket billiards in the back row at the movies.

1014
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:03,500
Now people might call it a sin.

1015
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:09,100
But I'll just buy me some popcorn

1016
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,600
that I'll hold in one hand

1017
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,360
and have a date with my mom.

1018
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,020
Again.

1019
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,620
Now in the evening

1020
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:33,440
all the boys go out gambling.

1021
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,340
But I'll just stay home

1022
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,600
and say I can't go.

1023
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,820
I've got a nice paradise

1024
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,060
paradise.

1025
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,420
Here to play with.

1026
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,780
And I'll do

1027
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,880
the one hand shuffle

1028
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,840
real slow.

1029
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,200
Five fingered stud

1030
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,300
in the bedroom.

1031
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,500
Strip solitaire

1032
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,720
with my friend.

1033
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,380
Deal a jack

1034
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,420
off the bottom.

1035
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,700
My hand beats the straight.

1036
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,000
I've got a date

1037
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,900
with my mom.

1038
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,560
Again.

1039
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,720
Each goddess

1040
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,440
has brought us closer.

1041
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,400
My fingers have erected

1042
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,860
a shrine.

1043
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,000
I know

1044
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,280
you.

1045
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:50,300
Like the back of my hand.

1046
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,620
And I'll love you

1047
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,040
until I go blind.

1048
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:04,200
We've had a fistful of trouble.

1049
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,740
Your thumbs were opposed at the start.

1050
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,540
Arthritis.

1051
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,720
I'm not sure.

1052
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1053
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1054
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1055
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1056
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1057
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1058
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1059
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1060
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1061
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,360
Bursitis.

1062
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,560
And that hang down.

1063
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,860
And the time

1064
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,700
you shook hands

1065
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,760
with that tart.

1066
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,260
But then

1067
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,300
you caught me

1068
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,400
with a hoover.

1069
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,340
The cream cheese

1070
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,640
is found

1071
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,620
on my skin.

1072
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,080
I saw a mirror.

1073
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,480
But I remembered

1074
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,380
our promise.

1075
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,800
At Niagara Falls.

1076
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,920
And had a date

1077
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,120
with my mom.

1078
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:56,520
Again.

1079
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,660
Everybody sing along.

1080
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,160
Each goddess has brought us closer.

1081
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,620
Each goddess

1082
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,460
has brought

1083
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,280
us closer.

1084
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,620
My fingers have erected a shrine.

1085
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,380
My fingers

1086
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,440
have erected

1087
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,000
a shrine.

1088
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,660
I know you.

1089
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,900
Like the back of my hand.

1090
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,680
I know you.

1091
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,800
Like the back of my hand.

1092
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,900
And I'll love you

1093
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,600
until I go blind.

1094
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,980
Your pregnant paws

1095
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,120
will be showing.

1096
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,720
So soon I must ask

1097
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,720
for your hand.

1098
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:43,740
I know you.

1099
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,460
I know you.

1100
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:45,460


1101
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:45,460


1102
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:45,460


1103
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:45,460


1104
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,480
I'll just rent a tuxedo

1105
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,180
without any pants.

1106
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,220
And have a date

1107
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,420
with my mom

1108
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:57,940
again.

1109
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,160
I'll have a date

1110
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,680
with my mom

1111
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:06,560
once

1112
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,820
again.

1113
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:26,880
guess you

1114
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,080
Mr.

1115
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:27,640
achievement.

1116
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,340
And which

1117
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:45,240
Ballantyne,

1118
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:45,300
can you

1119
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:45,320
downtime

1120
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:45,440
with

1121
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:45,460
the

1122
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:46,040
and get the bong.

1123
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,620
If you were here,

1124
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,160
he'd go out and get the bong.

1125
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,100
But then I'm thinking to myself,

1126
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:50,520
I think,

1127
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,000
why do they say the thing of it?

1128
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,540
Why can't they think of the word

1129
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,040
that they're trying to think of

1130
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,160
and then not say thing of it?

1131
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,540
What do they mean by the thing of it?

1132
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,920
What is the point of the thing?

1133
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,940
What is the object being talked about?

1134
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,800
What is the true definition of thing?

1135
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,280
Is the thing an unknown

1136
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,560
or is the thing unknown

1137
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,080
that's currently just locked away?

1138
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,540
What's the deal?

1139
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,480
You ever thought about that?

1140
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,100
I don't, no.

1141
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,040
Why don't you?

1142
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,960
Because that's your show.

1143
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,280
Hey you, I really don't,

1144
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,140
except to just keep on

1145
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:29,920
trying to spread that mighty wheelbarrow

1146
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,720
full of bob across the barren plains

1147
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,580
of America.

1148
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,280
Yes, doctor.

1149
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:36,880
Ding dong.

1150
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,420
My name is Vivian Spud

1151
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:41,320
and I've got something I'd like to ask you, doctor.

1152
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,520
Well, don't just stand there, boy.

1153
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,240
Ask away and we'll try to answer your question.

1154
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,520
Well, something has always puzzled me

1155
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,780
ever since I was a bee spot

1156
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,000
back in Indiana, doctor.

1157
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,420
Why does the porcupine

1158
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,760
weigh as big as yours?

1159
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,740
Because Hoosier boys

1160
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,080
oughtn't to get off their home soil

1161
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,540
and come traipsing out where they're kind.

1162
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,540
You know, Phil used to ask us that too, but...

1163
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,740
It's not the kind of answer

1164
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,460
we can put on the air.

1165
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,060
That's the problem.

1166
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:10,480
Ooh.

1167
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:11,980
Ooh.

1168
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:13,880
Ooh.

1169
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,500
See, hear the clamoring masses here below us

1170
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,320
of sub-deans wishing for church air.

1171
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,760
Ho-hum, they say.

1172
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,320
They're looking for spiritual guidance

1173
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,660
in a time of confusion.

1174
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,940
A time of worse things than that.

1175
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,000
You know what I mean?

1176
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,160
We're back here at the studio

1177
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,360
trying to clean up the mess after the explosion,

1178
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,520
but we didn't.

1179
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,400
We did get Bob all over two billboards

1180
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,760
right by Tower Records,

1181
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,680
and we did take an authenticating photograph,

1182
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,840
which, as it comes out,

1183
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:50,520
I will send you.

1184
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,140
And you can see Bob spread out all over Berkeley.

1185
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,400
And I was relating to you on the tape

1186
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,500
and may come up later anyway

1187
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,840
that I've been putting Bob all over California.

1188
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,140
You can see those stars so clearly

1189
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:05,840
it's not ball-like on Earth.

1190
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,640
Look at that cloudy planet go by.

1191
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,020
It's really inspiring.

1192
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,080
I'm glad to be talking to you here.

1193
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,520
I heard some more puzzling evidence in there

1194
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,800
and some phylo drumming,

1195
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,960
but friends, I promise to give you the post office box,

1196
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,520
the sacred post office box,

1197
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,220
for information on the Church of the Subgeniuses.

1198
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,080
Of course, as always,

1199
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:50,060
Bob at post office box 140306.

1200
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:58,320
That's box 140306 in Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1201
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,960
If you need to send tapes and stuff to me,

1202
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:01,960
Reverend Ivan Stang,

1203
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:06,200
will you just send those to P.O. Box 181417,

1204
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,400
Cleveland Heights, Ohio,

1205
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,140
444.

1206
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,940
888.118.

1207
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:17,620
And it's all available at www.subgenius.com.

1208
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:24,600
Yeah, Bonnie Winston tastes good like a cigarette.

1209
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,700
Thank you.

1210
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,520
Yes ma'am.

1211
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,240
I don't know.

1212
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:50,520
I sit down,

1213
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,120
shut my eyes.

1214
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,740
Don't you know they're bigger than a Miz?

1215
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:55,800
No, no, no.

1216
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,540
C'mon dude.

1217
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,160
You try it.
