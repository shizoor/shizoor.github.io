1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Quatu, Virada, Nicto

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,020
Quiet numbskulls, I'm broadcasting

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,040
My electronic signals are psychological

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,020
Ultimate destruction of the systems, purely melodic

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,100
Listening causes hypnotic

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,960
Trances to leave your thoughts clotted

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,920
Lost in a dream unspotted

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,640
Insanity from my creation, now retarded

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,840
You're all with Corky in a sitcom plotted

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,460
Oh, my friends, prepare to take the hand

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,120
Of that pipe-smoking man, Bob

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,540
And let him lead you and your ears

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,860
Down the primrose path to slack

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,780
For the subgenius radio ministry

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,580
Hour of Slack

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,500
Uh...

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,980
Yeah...

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,100
Yes...

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,220
You know, it's not nearly enough for you to believe in Bob

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,380
You must suck his entrails with your psychic firmament

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,780
You must live in Bob's own depleted spaces

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,980
In his own world

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,400
Suck with Bob's spite

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:51,620
To droplets and

25
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,700
possibilities

26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,920
What is the level of humanity such that we, as humans, might be able to tell egos,

27
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,400
able to tell

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,040
a place or a world that is asymptotically in batshells and impulse podÃ­a beijuana-drowned?

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:07,140
Soon enough, the family will change from a greasy green to a bright, beneficent blue.

30
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,540
Blue?

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,060
Blue?

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:34,440
The Assyrian army camped outside Jerusalem, ready to conquer and level it.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,400
But most of the army died in their sleep one night.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,380
But so the Lord ended that threat.

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:50,740
And there's other stories, like the prophets of Baal, Queen Jezebel, Goliath of Gath.

36
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,540
These weren't just innocent bystanders.

37
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,420
These were enemies who felt the wrath of God's backhand.

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,100
When tough love must get even tougher.

39
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,380
God's backhand.

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,440
When evil plays rough, God can play rougher.

41
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:23,540
We're not talking about tennis or ping pong or any kind of friendly sport.

42
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,900
We're talking about God fighting for his people where someone can really get hurt.

43
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,240
But that someone is your enemy.

44
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,380
Who'd have no qualms about it.

45
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,980
God's backhand.

46
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,920
God's backhand.

47
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,500
Yet as strong as it ever was.

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,220
God's backhand.

49
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,900
It will solve problems that nothing else does.

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,640
God's backhand.

51
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,380
When you need it.

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,980
When you need something more than just defense.

53
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,720
God's backhand.

54
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,500
Will send evil flying over the fence.

55
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,000
God's backhand.

56
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,100
God's backhand.

57
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,840
And this is Michael Pepe again.

58
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,220
As soon as you turn your back.

59
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,280
Everything in the universe snaps itself inside out with a hideous sucking motion.

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:54,720
The only reason you cannot call the world impossible is because it is only through the world that you know the concept of impossibility.

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,760
You have been led to believe that everyone feels he or she may be the only living consciousness.

62
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,820
But you are in fact the only one for whom this is true.

63
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,580
The fundamental structure of reality is totally transformed every instant.

64
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,660
But it provides you with a phony memory that it has always been the way it is.

65
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,220
Since you are always at the exact center of an infinity loop.

66
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,980
There is no such thing as movement, location, space, or time.

67
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,280
You are a row of electrochemical events.

68
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,040
You are a sequence of events taking place in your cerebral body.

69
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,600
Nothing has meaning in itself, but everything can support any meaning.

70
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:53,680
If you could glimpse for even a moment the real meaning of existence, your brain would be neuroanatomically destroyed.

71
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,900
You cannot conceive a thing for which you do not have a word.

72
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,460
Everyone's perception is radically unique.

73
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,000
But leads them to believe it is more or less similar for everyone else.

74
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,740
You have always been listening to this tape.

75
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:23,480
You cannot remember a time before you were born because there was no such time, nor any other.

76
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,800
It has always been this moment.

77
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,880
Death could occur inexplicably any second.

78
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,400
And there is no other chance.

79
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:33,980
But there is still a moment.

80
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,320
The moment of the world.

81
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,800
The oddness of the world exceeds the imagination by an infinity.

82
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,000
It has produced this talking about it.

83
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,520
This talker.

84
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,380
This labeling of it.

85
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,720
This labeler.

86
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,960
The concept of labeling.

87
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,460
The concept of oddness.

88
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,520
The word oddness.

89
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,360
The concept of a word.

90
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,400
The word word.

91
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,480
The word concept.

92
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,660
And the concept of a concept.

93
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:10,000
Consciousness is not a continuous state, but a momentary surfacing for variable periods at random points.

94
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,100
Your next awakening could be 20 years from now.

95
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,600
Nothing can be proven to be true.

96
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:27,720
Because reality is composed of infinitesimally small moments, there is no such thing as an event.

97
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:36,420
The reason people are untrustworthy is because their cerebral processes are fundamentally random ones.

98
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:44,500
During the night, every ego in the world changes bodies, inheriting also the memory.

99
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,980
Old age is not a gradual, but a catastrophic process, and could strike at any moment.

100
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,700
Dreams are the reality for which the real world is.

101
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,960
The real world is a dream.

102
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:09,800
There has never been a time in history when men have voluntarily used less than the greatest possible military technology against their enemy,

103
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,520
and allowed a great technology to fall into disuse and ignorance.

104
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,080
Therefore, there will be a full-scale nuclear holocaust.

105
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,960
You are dreaming this moment.

106
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:35,640
The universe will continue to expand until there is not enough matter per unit space to provide the gravity necessary for regeneration,

107
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,440
and it will slowly die out.

108
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,700
When you finish listening to this, everything will be different from the way it was when you began.

109
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,320
Again, your new memory will conceal this from you.

110
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,780
All events occur at random.

111
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,660
The universe is...

112
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,540
one of an infinite number of universes,

113
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,260
the closest of which is undetectable,

114
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,120
being a billion universe lengths away.

115
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,340
Only what you are experiencing right now exists.

116
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,500
Love is the feeling that another person is really yourself.

117
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,160
You are about to make the first conscious decision of your life.

118
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,120
Oh...

119
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,040
Moment of om

120
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,200
...

121
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,640
or Reverend Michael Pepe,

122
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,760
and you are listening to the Hour of Slack Radio Ministry.

123
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,660
Michael Pepe, dear friends, from the old hour of Slack number 106.

124
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,480
We're dredging ancient hours of Slack now.

125
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:14,380
And before that, friends, God's Backhand was by the great Richard Hackley,

126
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,180
posted to altbinaries.slack by the great New Monet.

127
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,180
We've got a lot of new stuff that was posted to that news group

128
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:29,180
by Reverend Artemiya Salina and by Reverend Why Ask Why Ask Why.

129
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,340
And because, friends, we've moved.

130
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,700
Listen, listen to the ambience in this room.

131
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,820
This is our new studio complete with everything, everything.

132
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,300
Anyone could, even a keyboard.

133
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,920
Listen to this.

134
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
I've got this keyboard.

135
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,580
I can just.

136
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,600
It is white and new.

137
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,400
And beautiful.

138
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,420
It has been painted with the sweat of Lonesome Cowboy Dave used for paint.

139
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:09,120
The subgenius storage facility in the tomb of the faceless Bobby have been done.

140
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,940
We finished the shelves.

141
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,800
We filled them halfway with the ancient crumbling subgenius tapes and video

142
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,160
and text and artwork extracted from the previous abyss.

143
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:30,120
We've lifted up the roll top desk, the rack, the hour of slack production table heard here.

144
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,920
Oops, there went my.

145
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,040
That just knocked out my.

146
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,080
Oh, there it is.

147
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,220
And we can even create.

148
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,760
Well, you know, I'm not finished moving that castle, though, Dave.

149
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,020
There's still all the boxes of souls and the canisters and stuff that are in that.

150
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,200
That basement of that dungeon of that other cast.

151
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,480
They're the special vampire.

152
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,720
I mean, it's the undead fluids you keep to keep.

153
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,180
I mean, that's not myself.

154
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,900
Well, I mean, it's firm bank.

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,860
That stuff wasn't all that complicated.

156
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,120
And what a joy to your mother.

157
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,020
It was when you took the whole sperm bank in your hands with that pair of blue sunglasses,

158
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,400
that pair of John Lennon sunglasses and paraded off down Main Street anywhere.

159
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,400
You have seen that silly day, you know, as well as anybody.

160
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,620
Wink, wink.

161
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,880
But that sperm bank is a bunch of.

162
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:30,660
Nitro frozen nitrogen containers that keep the sperms immobile and frozen from fighting.

163
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,640
Yeah, because these are super sperms.

164
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:41,200
Of course, genius little farts that can that will literally eat their way up into whatever egg female egg is nearest.

165
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,660
Well, they blind primate.

166
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,520
They blinded some.

167
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,080
Yeah, they go in the wrong way.

168
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,620
It's like a mini meteor in space.

169
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,400
You see that movie Mission to Mars.

170
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,860
They're all partying.

171
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,840
Suddenly the guy's got a.

172
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,200
Hole in his hand and there's a hole in the fuel tank.

173
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,540
Well, there's a tiny atom sized meteor going near the speed of light.

174
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,600
Just happened to intersect with their spaceship.

175
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,420
Bad luck.

176
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,180
Bad luck.

177
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,320
That's the way a subgenius sperm will just shoot right through.

178
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,540
Because it's like a piranha.

179
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,460
It's like the piranha of sperms.

180
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,600
You know what I mean?

181
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,140
It's more than just a.

182
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,360
It's like a tadpole with millions and millions.

183
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,760
It's like the fish of sperms, which it's funny.

184
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,860
That's a funny metaphor.

185
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,660
Because candura fish is a fish that swims up your urethra to eat its way into your heart.

186
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,820
Whereas the sperms usually go out the other way.

187
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,900
And so does your heart.

188
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,380
One of them canduras might, you know.

189
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,480
How often have we all fallen out of love after that final emission?

190
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,500
All of the.

191
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,800
You know, that goes out of your heart and comes back into your emissions.

192
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,020
Well, that's the problem, isn't it, Dave?

193
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,780
So often love starts out as an emission.

194
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,660
You emit love and it goes in.

195
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,940
But then it.

196
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,380
Sort of comes right back at you.

197
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,920
And it's just your own love coming back.

198
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,300
And there's.

199
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:57,860
And that's it.

200
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,340
It just went in a big circle.

201
00:13:59,420 --> 00:13:59,580
Yeah.

202
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,060
And you get left on sitting on the curb with your hat in your hand all limp.

203
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,620
Going, oh, I've been.

204
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,060
I've been dumped again.

205
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,360
Dumped again.

206
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
I'm just a sorry old.

207
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,520
But friends.

208
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,460
No matter what.

209
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,040
Sorry.

210
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,700
The deer parts and the fisheries.

211
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,680
Man eating chimes and moods.

212
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,960
What's going on, man?

213
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,140
I don't get it.

214
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:22,740
It's more.

215
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,180
More than a happening or something going on.

216
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,120
It's a whole.

217
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,380
It's a whole band of.

218
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,560
Things have seeped in.

219
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,400
To our psychic consciousness.

220
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,300
Yeah.

221
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,320
Are you.

222
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,460
Are you.

223
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:35,900
Right.

224
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,880
Those of you with.

225
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,640
Plural.

226
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,300
You read through.

227
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,140
Could please.

228
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,120
If you could.

229
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,660
Please.

230
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,000
Please.

231
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,360
Could you.

232
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:43,820
If you.

233
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,580
If you could.

234
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,020
Please.

235
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,420
Just remove your garments there and place them next to the vacuum cleaner.

236
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,920
And those of you with a single.

237
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,980
Single scars where the urethra is wars.

238
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,500
Please just step to the side.

239
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:57,960
And now.

240
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,400
A little.

241
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,240
Now.

242
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,680
You know.

243
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,540
You.

244
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:01,700


245
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:01,940
Your.

246
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,180
One.

247
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:02,900
Is not alone.

248
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,980
On this cosmic.

249
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,560
Meddling.

250
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,980
Earth has been inhabited.

251
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,460
Ground.

252
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,820
Stop.

253
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,040
For millions of years.

254
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,460
By hundreds of different races of aliens from space.

255
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,400
Both.

256
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,120
Benevolent.

257
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,360
And.

258
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:13,860
Hostile.

259
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,160
Have you ever noticed that no two UFO photographs show the same.

260
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,560
Hubcap.

261
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,240
Many of the saucer.

262
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,660
Jogging.

263
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,200
Are simple.

264
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,920
Humanoids.

265
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,280
Like.

266
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,580
Us.

267
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,260
Space.

268
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,020
Nazis.

269
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,920
Who do little more than freeze up car motors on lonely country roads at night.

270
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,180
And occasionally rape or mutilate humans.

271
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,740
Or.

272
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,040
They usually look like.

273
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,460
Ears.

274
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,180
Elves.

275
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,880
Or dwarves.

276
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,580
And are of relatively minor importance.

277
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,200
Since Bob himself has faster stations than they have.

278
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,240
They only frequently break the rule of don't let the earthlings see you.

279
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,560
But there are far other more confusing things.

280
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,020
Managers mass grade.

281
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,280
They pull on their kebab kits when I can't climb my heels.

282
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,280


283
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,920
Which I'd choose your hair.

284
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,700
And where have you gone to get this for us?

285
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,560
Wait.

286
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:02,580
You have got your purinder.

287
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:02,580


288
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,000
Always both of my fucking ears.

289
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,220


290
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,860
New NFL teams gecko stickies.

291
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:08,860


292
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,400
Everything else is def tectonica and-

293
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
There got to be.

294
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,600
I've got absolutely no decimals forå§

295
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,700
Just do whether you're drunk or not.

296
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,620
Damn dineya name is not Michael Williams.

297
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:13,980
I believe you know of something on my top Umwelt MP3.

298
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:13,980


299
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,860
I believe your car's purel-

300
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,200
And Bob.

301
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,360
Dozens, perhaps hundreds of entities speak through Bob.

302
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,800
Many voices.

303
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,520
They also listen and see through him.

304
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,180
And many even go to him for advice on handling humans.

305
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,800
Bob is a wide open channel they can log on to for the divulging of past lives, secrets, and ground rubber.

306
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,720
Oh, here it is.

307
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,060
There's our chance.

308
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,660
Yes, friends.

309
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,820
It's incredible.

310
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,000
We even managed to move the iron lungs and maidens up here into this new studio.

311
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:05,520
And at this point, friends, I am up to my testicle in Tesla coils getting ready for the final bye-bye to Earth and the Pink Boys on that day when we are ruptured.

312
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,740
July 5th, 2001 for X-Day.

313
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,460
Incidentally, friends, I wanted to mention that I have dibs on X-Day.

314
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,820
I've got dibs on the Grand Canyon, including Flintstones Bedrock City.

I've got all the furniture in the West Wing of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

318
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,960
Doc Frog can have the Vermeers.

319
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,760
I don't want any violent showdowns to mar what should be our most glorious time of looting.

320
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:45,160
Remember, friends, after X-Day, anything not made by WOM will be a collectible.

321
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,180
Oh, yeah, yeah.

322
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,600

00:17:48,820 --> 00:18:00,640

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,740
Although, really,

362
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,240
friends, I guess I don't need those,

363
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
because we'll be

364
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
able to think the movies

365
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,260
and, whoa, we'll print

366
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,460
them out in 3D Spell-O-Vision

367
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,500
and feel around!

368
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,080
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

369
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,260
Everything worked! The study

370
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,320
of mutation and the public

371
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,340
sphere of the unknown can again

372
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,140
proceed.

373
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,260
Incidentally, friends, I should mention

374
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,000
that the new subgenius address,

375
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,380
my personal post office

376
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,320
address, will be

377
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,480
given at the end of the broadcast.

378
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,880
And, although we're still,

379
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,600
the church is still working

380
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,520
out of Dallas, you send your orders to

381
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,620
Dallas, and I send my

382
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,440
orders to you from here

383
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,380
in Cleveland Heights. That's

384
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,480
post office box 181

385
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,340
417 Cleveland

386
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,480
Heights, Ohio 44118.

387
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,600
And that music there was

388
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
by The Bishop.

389
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,740
A wonderful

390
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,080
new tune called

391
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,800
Dance of the Rockets.

392
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,220
Uh,

393
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,660
yes, yes,

394
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,700
yes, yes.

395
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,480
Whew!

396
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,880
Whew!

397
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,720
Yes, it's truly

398
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,080
a cliche. It came from

399
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,040
heaven in the first shipment

400
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,240
in the Rockets.

401
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,180
If you think they'll use

402
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,240
too much, complain elsewhere.

403
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,540
They are holy

404
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,140
instruments of instruction

405
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,960
from here in the headquarters.

406
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,120
We could be what we really are.

407
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,920
Humans together,

408
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,580
subject to the trauma of birth

409
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,720
and the fear of death,

410
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,820
to pain and loneliness,

411
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,520
disease and loss,

412
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,800
ecstasy and pleasure.

413
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,160
We could accept

414
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,340
our vulnerability, which would allow us

415
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,320
to feel it and,

416
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,940
in turn, would help us to feel

417
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,580
all of what we have to deny

418
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,700
when we try to be invulnerable,

419
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,580
impregnable.

420
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,100
Consider the root of that word.

421
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,300
.

422
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,300


423
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:36,800
.

424
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:37,840
.

425
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:39,880
.

426
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,860
.

427
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,380
.

428
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,020
.

429
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,880
.

430
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,680
.

431
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,600
.

432
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,200
.

433
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,040
.

434
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,040


435
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Woo-hoo!

436
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,000
My fiery friend, are you feeling better?

437
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,440
I think a plutonium injection and a shot of steam in the right place will wake you up.

438
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,840
And we're on our way.

439
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:33,360
We're only three and one-half blocks right now from the Ericksonian Glass High Security Art Compound.

440
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,760
They have not found me yet, thank goodness.

441
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,660
I'm still just a nameless building with a cow skull and cross glass cutters over the front door

442
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,300
as far as the...

443
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,300
Local art police are concerned.

444
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,740
Oh, there's one of their cars.

445
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,540
You heard that young girl scream?

446
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,940
She was thought to be an artist also.

447
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,620
The mortar flies into a flame and instantly frizzles into a heap of protoplasmic sludge

448
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,800
so the collars are burned and seared by the blistering truth revealed over the air

449
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,360
by the doctors.

450
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,700
Oh, precision.

451
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,680
Oh, yes, dear friends.

452
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,400
I heard some puzzling evidence there and some glass madness doing that art security thing

453
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,840
and Dr. Howell ranting and some Wellman mixes from...

454
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,020
KPFA and Berklee reprinted from old hour of slack number 106.

455
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:59,040
Friends, and now the boredoms with the sound all around us.

456
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,180
Followed by G. Gordon Gordon.

457
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,080
Wellman.

458
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,640
Wellman.

459
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,740
Wellman.

460
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,660
Wellman.

461
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:11,660


462
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:11,940


463
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,280


464
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,220
Wellman.

465
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,840
Wellman.

466
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,300
Wellman.

467
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:14,520


468
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:14,640
Wellman.

469
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:14,960
Wellman.

470
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:14,960


471
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,580
Wellman.

472
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:29,080
Wellman We're not pissed to go back no more.

473
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,520
We are not pissed.

474
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,040
We will not name it Mr. G. G. G. G. Room Report.

475
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,560
Se ìë¤ lpflicht.

476
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,440
I'm here.

477
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,700
I'm here.

478
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:44,760
I'm here.

479
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:44,820
I'm here.

480
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:44,900
I'm here.

481
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:44,980
I'm here.

482
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:44,980


483
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:56,840
I'm pissing around, pissing around, pissing around, pissing around.

484
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:21,160
I'm pissing around, pissing around, pissing around, pissing around.

485
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,260
I hear puzzling evidence.

486
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,960
Don't go to him again.

487
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,240
Don't go to him again, okay?

488
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,500
So what, Mr. Dobbs? We're in shape for the finals.

489
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,460
No, really, Mr. Dobbs.

490
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,200
And by the way, Bob, just where is that long promised bucket of pills?

491
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,100
And tell me, Bob, what's this slack business?

492
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,040
Shouldn't the hierarchical slack holders be making unearthly dividends on a regular basis by now?

493
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,320
Or is it wrong?

494
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:56,640
Just.

495
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,260
It's really too much fun, Bob.

496
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,000
Is there a war on here?

497
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,160
Well, there is a war on here, Bob.

498
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,200
And whatever happened to too much is always better than not enough.

499
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,920
Has there been inside trading in the Souls repository in Dobbs Town?

500
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,380
Oh, come on, Bob. Remember us? Remember the old guys?

501
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,360
We used to sell froth mixture for you way back in the good old days.

502
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,680
We've heard the old Dobbs head snake oil routine before, Bob.

503
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,060
We know all about the bleeding head of AP.

504
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,340
But when will it come is what we want to know.

505
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,660
So when shall the fabled...

506
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,620
...flut plane tilt?

507
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,300
And when shall things at last begin to flow to all, all, all of us...

508
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:38,000
...who despite the perilous times in which we do live, plead unto you still, Bob?

509
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,700
Next day's coming closer, Dobbs.

510
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,740
You haven't got all the time to the end of the world, have you?

511
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,500
Hadn't you better just get cracking, Mr. Dobbs?

512
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,820
Don't you think it's time to get your ass out of party mode and back up the crack?

513
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,420
Hmm.

514
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,160
Mark Mothersbaugh, The Big Boss

515
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,160


516
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,820
This is Mark Mothersbaugh. Mark Mothersbaugh, The Big Boss

517
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:56,820


518
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:56,820


519
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,720
And, um...

520
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,220
Hajime Tachibana

521
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,280
Uh, and Nancy Ferguson.

522
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,480
This is a pretty unusual little, little recording here.

523
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,260
Thanks to Byron Werner.

524
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,480
Breaking citizens of the world!

525
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,700
We are so happy to be here with you today for Mr. Ituchi's NFL!

526
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,460
Mr. Ituchi's NFL

527
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,460


528
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,820
Mr. Ituchi's NFL

529
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,760
Mr. Ituchi's NFL

530
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:26,800
Mr. Ituchi's NFL

531
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:49,520
Mr. And the LA A- Thank you very much!

532
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,400
Please, everyone out there

533
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,760
Let's start off this weekend with Mark Mothersbaugh here.

534
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:50,760


535
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:50,760


536
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:50,760


537
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:50,760


538
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:50,760


539
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,420
Y'all always welcome me around

540
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,220
Living by Dr. Smith!

541
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,360
I hope to see you next week!

542
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:54,360


543
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:54,840
to me

544
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,480
it doesn't matter to me

545
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,580
cause there's something

546
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,320
bigger than what you see

547
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,960
there's something

548
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,320
important that is waiting for you

549
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,200
oh yeah

550
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,720
oh yeah

551
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,000
knock it off

552
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,980
tell a good story people

553
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,600
tell me nothing

554
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
do that's what I'm waiting for

555
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,360
it doesn't matter to me

556
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,920
it doesn't matter to me

557
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,700
oh yeah

558
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:48,700


559
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,300
cause there's a train

560
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,620
for a new destination

561
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,040
and a tenant for a new destination

562
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,140
and I tell you my friend

563
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,760
you better count the years

564
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,220
deadline coming

565
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,800
I don't care

566
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,820
if you ever change your underwear

567
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,040
it doesn't matter to me

568
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,700
cause there's something

569
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,020
bigger than what you see

570
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,720
it doesn't matter to me

571
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,320
it doesn't matter to me

572
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,660
it doesn't matter to me

573
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:39,000
oh that's

574
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,060
No Matter by Mark Mothersbaugh

575
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,420
and Nancy Ferguson

576
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:43,960
Nancy

577
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,780
Nancy Ferguson

578
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,680
and Nancy Ferguson

579
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,300
and Hachibana

580
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
what's that guy's name

581
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,380
Hajime Tachibana

582
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,780
I only know him as Tachibana

583
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,600
and the rest of this song here

584
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,740
is by Tachibana

585
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,100
a Japanese fellow

586
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,060
pretty hot stuff

587
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:48,700


588
00:30:48,700 --> 00:31:18,700


589
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,180
Hi

590
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,320
the

591
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:29,320


592
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,300
is

593
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,280
named

594
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,200
Hatchibana

595
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,880
& let's meet

596
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,740
the

597
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,560
live

598
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:56,080
You are lovely, hair like lovely glasses

599
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:10,020
Your hair is so beautiful, I can't believe it

600
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,540
Baby, baby, baby

601
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,940
Baby, baby, baby

602
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,740
From the top of the mountain

603
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,860
Good, good

604
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,940
Kill the horse

605
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,220
The horse is dead

606
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,920
Roxadam Hussein's ass

607
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,140
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow

608
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,900
That's right, that's right

609
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,240
Tomorrow, tomorrow

610
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,500
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow

611
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,660
Good night

612
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,480
Good night

613
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,260
Good night

614
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,400
Thank you

615
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,460
Good night

616
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,000
Give me the antidote or kill me

617
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,260
None are so blind as those who have no heads

618
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,700
Come on, man, spit it out

619
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,900
Don't lick the taste of that, I'm not doing that again

620
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,040
Oh no, no

621
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,200
Another insidious quote inserted here

622
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,460
Don't attempt to adjust the controls

623
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,800
We are no longer in control

624
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,040
Smaller children should ask an adult to help

625
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,560
All your space art belonged to us

626
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,280
Why does it hurt when I pee?

627
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,480
Help, help, I can't take it anymore

628
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,400
Praise Bob

629
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,320
Praise Bob

630
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,200
Praise Bob

631
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,060
Praise Bob

632
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,100
Yeah, hallelujah

633
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

634
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah

635
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah

636
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah

637
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,060
Hey, you remember the first time we raided the Bob mansion?

638
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,220
The Playboy mansion of Bob?

639
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,040
Oh man, God, you could just smell the women

640
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,560
He was roasting some over an open fire

641
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,560
Remember that?

642
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,480
Well, it wasn't a real fire

643
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,800
That's what I mean, they smelled so crisp and crackly

644
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,780
Yeah, those polyps

645
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,980
Polypurethane vinyl fires

646
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,120
They're not real but

647
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,580
Boy, they look so good with those apples in their mouths

648
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,940
And just

649
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,100
Bob caught us

650
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,760
He always does

651
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,920
I don't find I never have to do that again

652
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,240
No, you don't want to get caught in that web

653
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,300
What did they call that?

654
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,880
A job?

655
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,600
Yeah, he made us get a job

656
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
God, that was awful

657
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,520
I hated that

658
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,440
Finding in the basement

659
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,620
But there were a lot of naked female clerks to help us there

660
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,340
Remember?

661
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,620
Remember Lonnie and Jeanette?

662
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,660
Jeanette, the one with the bright red hair and the little teeny tiny sharp teeth?

663
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,340
Yeah, and who's the one from the whale farm?

664
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,200
Oh, Betty Jean.

665
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,440
Bertha?

666
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,140
Betty Jean.

667
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,080
Big Bad Bertha?

668
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,160
Big Bad.

669
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,220
Big Bad Bertha.

670
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,640
Do you remember the captain?

671
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,460
Do you remember the guy from...

672
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:41,480
Oh, yeah.

673
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,020
Arr, arr, arr.

674
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,080
Arr, Bob should be timbered.

675
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,740
He's Bob this and Bob that stupid.

676
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,040
I hate those Bobby idiots.

677
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,500
You know, 65 years old, should be someplace in Florida or Arizona, but he's still in the

678
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,580
wheelchair giving commands.

679
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,700
But he's just gotten turned on to Bob, so he was in that phase.

680
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,700
He was in that for year one phase where everybody's actually...

681
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,300
Look, there's that man Bob.

682
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,040
He found it.

683
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,420
There's another shop that's Bob's TV repair.

684
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,680
Oh, there's Bob's used car.

685
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,600
Bob's everywhere.

686
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,620
I got Bob on the brain.

687
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,420
I got Bob on the brain.

688
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,860
And there's nothing wrong with having Bob on the brain, friends.

689
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,960
As long as you can purge it.

690
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,720
Every now and then.

691
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,720
Just every now and then.

692
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:25,220
Until they were locked up with the fish, which was no mean feat.

693
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,880
The fish themselves were some 300 pounds.

694
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,940
Some of them weighed in excess of 700 pounds.

695
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,360
Each and every fish was equipped with a dynamic facial structure.

696
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,880
The kind that could tear apart pieces of rock with one grimace.

697
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,740
These were the fish that Bob had selected.

698
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,860
His mighty fighting sperm.

699
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,980
To spread like a mankind of...

700
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,100
Cardium throughout the depleted universe.

701
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,280
So you could just take it up to your room and do whatever you want with it.

702
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,860
You know what I mean?

703
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,800
Sit back in that old bungalow roll away bed and watch the subway go by.

704
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,540
Take one last drink from that bottle of port.

705
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,520
Pick up the gun.

706
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,740
Look at it.

707
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,800
Put one bullet in.

708
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,420
Spin the chamber.

709
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,440
Put the gun down.

710
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,440
Pick it up again.

711
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,660
Spin the chamber again.

712
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,440
Put it down.

713
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,360
Look out the window.

714
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,160
It's just seven trains going by.

715
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:23,900
Ah, yes.

716
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,540
Life is beautiful.

717
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,840
Maybe a few more crackers and I've got a little mustard left to put on them.

718
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,400
For a while.

719
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,480
The End

720
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:35,480


721
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,100
The End

722
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,920
The End

723
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,040
The End

724
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,260
The End

725
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:42,320
The End

726
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,420
The End

727
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,020
The End

728
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,020


729
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,020


730
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,600
The End

731
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,120
The End

732
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,500
The End

733
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:46,500


734
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:46,500


735
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:46,500


736
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,660
The End

737
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,020
The End

738
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,860
A lunatic is on the grass

739
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,860
A lunatic is on the grass

740
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,860
Remembering games and these chains and laughs

741
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,120
Got to keep the loonies on the path

742
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,360
A lunatic is in the hall

743
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,560
The lunatics are in my hall

744
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,380
The paper holds the folded faces to the floor

745
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,960
Every day in the table, every day tomorrow

746
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,880
And if the dam rings open, many years do still

747
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,300
If there is no room above the hill

748
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,280
And if your next one is on the roof still

749
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,940
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

750
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,320
The lunatic is in my head

751
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,420
It is in my head

752
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,100
You raise the blade, you make the change

753
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,580
You rearrange me till I'm sane

754
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,860
You lock the door, you lock the door

755
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,340
Throw away the key

756
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,840
There's someone in my head but it's not me

757
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,740
And if a cloud bursts up and I ring your key

758
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,100
And you shout and no one sees the key

759
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,340
And if a man or an interest plays a trick too

760
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,140
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

761
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,720
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

762
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,480
One, two, three, four

763
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,440
And if a cloud bursts thunder in your ear

764
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,780
And you shout and no one sees the key

765
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,840
And if a man or an interest plays a trick too

766
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:47,840


767
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:47,840


768
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:47,840


769
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:47,840


770
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:47,840


771
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:47,840


772
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,520
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

773
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:56,380
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

774
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,240
guitar solo

775
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,440
bass solo

776
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,200
drums solo

777
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,900
guitar solo

778
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,820
drums solo

779
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,000
bass solo

780
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,280
drums solo

781
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,080
drums solo

782
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,360
bass solo

783
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,300
drums solo

784
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,300


785
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,620
drums solo

786
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,440
drums solo

787
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,840
bass solo

788
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,680
mostly playa

789
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,040
drum solo

790
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,380
conventional jazz

791
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,380


792
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,380


793
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,380


794
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,380


795
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,380


796
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,400
drum solo

797
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,960
drums solo

798
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,480
and other instruments

799
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:47,820
zabÐºÐ¸

800
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,440
I can't think of anything to say except

801
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,940
I think it's

802
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,760
MOLLY!

803
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,760
MOLLY!

804
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,700
MOLLY!

805
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,260
MOLLY!

806
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:49,780
MOLLY!

807
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,200
MOLLY!

808
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,420
MOLLY!

809
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,420
MOLLY!

810
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:00,680
MOLLY!

811
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:00,700
MOLLY!

812
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,060
MOLLY!

813
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,360
MOLLY!

814
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,120
MOLLY!

815
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,600
MOLLY!

816
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,840
Dear friends,

817
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,500
this music is by

818
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,420
Dr. Chris Gross

819
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,300
and

820
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,520
Men in Black.

821
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,420
But you know,

822
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,680
you know

823
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,040
an exquisitely

824
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,120
sharpened hatred

825
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,520
for the pink boy is

826
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,160
of course an emotion

827
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,800
not difficult for subgeniuses

828
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,400
to harbor.

829
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,680
If the truth be known,

830
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,720
this hatred does not abound

831
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,500
in every subgenius soul.

832
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,720
It relies upon too

833
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,520
many mysterious and hidden

834
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,420
patterns of life and

835
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,100
chance to flourish luxuriantly

836
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:50,640
everywhere.

837
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,700
Real hatred of the

838
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,560
sort of which I speak,

839
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,220
hatred so

840
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,220
pure and obdurate

841
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,740
that no sympathy,

842
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,060
no human warmth,

843
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,720
no flicker of compassion

844
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,260
can make the slightest nick or

845
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,300
scratch upon the stony

846
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,720
surface of its being.

847
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,340
That is, that kind of hatred

848
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,380
is not common to

849
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,680
all subgeniuses.

850
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,600
Because many conditions are

851
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,800
required for the full

852
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,720
fruition of this hatred,

853
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,220
for its ripe and malevolent

854
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,300
growth. Yet none of these

855
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,520
is as important as that at one time

856
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,900
or another that subgenius

857
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,820
must live in some degree

858
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,720
of intimacy with the

859
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,120
pink boy, the human.

860
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,760
That he may know the object

861
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,400
of his hatred, that he

862
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,320
become knowledgeable about the

863
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,260
mediocritons of wiles,

864
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,220
his pink duplicity, his

865
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,060
subgenius and his ultimate

866
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,840
depravity. For without

867
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,820
knowing the pink boy at close

868
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,660
hand, without having submitted to his

869
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,280
wanton and arrogant kindnesses,

870
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,740
without having smelt the

871
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,540
smell of his bed sheets and his dirty

872
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,480
under drawers and the inside of his privy,

873
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,660
and felt the casual yet

874
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,760
insolent touch of his women's

875
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,920
fingers upon his own yeti

876
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,900
arm, without seeing him

877
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,720
at sport and at ease

878
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,640
and at his hypocrite's worship

879
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,320
and at his drunken

880
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,440
mildness and his lustful and

881
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,520
adulterous couplings in the

882
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,600
hay fields and the condos,

883
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,600
without having known all these cozy

884
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,500
and familial truths, I say,

885
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,240
a subgenius can only

886
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,080
pretend hatred.

887
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,820
Such hatred is only an abstraction

888
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,980
and a delusion.

889
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,840
He finds himself trying to hate

890
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,740
pink boys, but he

891
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,620
will come to understand that he's hating

892
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,600
imperfectly without that calm

893
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,600
and intelligent and unrepenting

894
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,240
purity of hatred.

895
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,460
Which I have described and which is so

896
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,040
necessary in order to

897
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:51,860
murder.

898
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,920
A man's world,

899
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,120
but it wouldn't be

900
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,160
nothing without a woman

901
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,120
or a girl.

902
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,800
So,

903
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,880
remember the call

904
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,540
to take us

905
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,320
over the road.

906
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,340
So,

907
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,800


908
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,800


909
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,800


910
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,800


911
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,800


912
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:47,800


913
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,500
I'm going to

914
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,500


915
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,500


916
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,640
who was a

917
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,260
man made a train

918
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,160
to carry the

919
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,580
heavy load

920
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,820
man made the

921
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,380
electric light

922
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,900
to take us out

923
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,580
of the dark

924
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,640
and man made the boat

925
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,560
for the water

926
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,400
just like,

927
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,120
just like Noah

928
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,520
to take us

929
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:19,600
to the sea.

930
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:19,600


931
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,540
this is a man's world

932
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,500
but it wouldn't be

933
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500
nothing

934
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,360
without a woman

935
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,660
or a girl.

936
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,380
Man thinks about

937
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,220
a little bitty

938
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,660
baby girl

939
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,120
and a baby boy

940
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,120
and man makes

941
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,820
him happy

942
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,120
cause man

943
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,040
made some toys

944
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,280
and after man

945
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,100
has made

946
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:54,340
everything

947
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,960
everything he can

948
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,980
you know

949
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,880
that man makes

950
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,660
the money

951
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,440
to buy

952
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,280
another man.

953
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,820
This is a man's

954
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:11,880
world

955
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,340
this is a

956
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,180
man's world

957
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,020
but it wouldn't

958
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,520
be nothing

959
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,860
nothing

960
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,320
nothing

961
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,360
without a woman

962
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,920
or a girl.

963
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:32,420
music

964
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,200
music

965
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,620
music

966
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,180
music

967
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,800
music

968
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


969
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


970
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


971
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:47,800


972
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:49,780
music

973
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:51,980
music

974
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:54,320
music

975
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:57,840
music

976
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:57,860
music

977
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:57,880
music

978
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:57,900
music

979
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:57,920
music

980
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:57,940
music

981
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:57,960
music

982
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:12,900
music

983
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:12,920
music

984
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:17,600
music

985
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,020
You are...

986
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,180
The Residence, dear friends.

987
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,380
Live in Chicago, 2001 from Reverend Chris Lee.

988
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:10,540
And before that, me reading from the diary of Nat Turner.

989
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,800
Braindale with music by Chris Lee.

990
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,060
I mean, no, Christopher Gross.

991
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:16,740
Chris Gross.

992
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:16,920
Chris Gross.

993
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,880
Brain Damage was that song there by The Squirrels.

994
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,800
And of course, we've been hearing some Einstein Secret Orchestra

995
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,440
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and host Chaz Smith.

996
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,800
Perhaps some Radio Patapoo from Amsterdam

997
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,480
with Reverend Yitze and Pope Black.

998
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,340
Random Speak from Or Kill Me Radio.

999
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,300
Cryptology from Stang 64, Flow Spark.

1000
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,100
This background music is called Subgenius.

1001
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,700
By the band C-Rox.

1002
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,020
And now, Doug Valentine.

1003
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,100
Now that we've gotten to this level,

1004
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,640
we're going to just go right down to the very bottom

1005
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,000
and do something, a song about something

1006
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,580
that everybody is very familiar with.

1007
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,780
It involves hair.

1008
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,280
It involves blindness.

1009
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,440
And it involves...

1010
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,460
You can figure out the rest.

1011
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:29,900
You can figure out the rest.

1012
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,400
The good times, we've had.

1013
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:56,520
Pocket billiards in the back row at the movies.

1014
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:03,500
Now people might call it a sin.

1015
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:09,100
But I'll just buy me some popcorn

1016
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,600
that I'll hold in one hand

1017
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,360
and have a date with my mom.

1018
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,020
Again.

1019
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,620
Now in the evening

1020
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:33,440
all the boys go out gambling.

1021
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,340
But I'll just stay home

1022
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,600
and say I can't go.

1023
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,820
I've got a nice paradise

1024
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,060
paradise.

1025
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,420
Here to play with.

1026
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,780
And I'll do

1027
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,880
the one hand shuffle

1028
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,840
real slow.

1029
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,200
Five fingered stud

1030
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,300
in the bedroom.

1031
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,500
Strip solitaire

1032
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,720
with my friend.

1033
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,380
Deal a jack

1034
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,420
off the bottom.

1035
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,700
My hand beats the straight.

1036
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,000
I've got a date

1037
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,900
with my mom.

1038
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:25,560
Again.

1039
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,720
Each goddess

1040
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,440
has brought us closer.

1041
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,400
My fingers have erected

1042
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,860
a shrine.

1043
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,000
I know

1044
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,280
you.

1045
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:50,300
Like the back of my hand.

1046
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,620
And I'll love you

1047
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,040
until I go blind.

1048
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:04,200
We've had a fistful of trouble.

1049
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,740
Your thumbs were opposed at the start.

1050
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,540
Arthritis.

1051
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,720
I'm not sure.

1052
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1053
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1054
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1055
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1056
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1057
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1058
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1059
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1060
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:16,720


1061
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,360
Bursitis.

1062
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,560
And that hang down.

1063
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,860
And the time

1064
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,700
you shook hands

1065
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,760
with that tart.

1066
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,260
But then

1067
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,300
you caught me

1068
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,400
with a hoover.

1069
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,340
The cream cheese

1070
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:39,640
is found

1071
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,620
on my skin.

1072
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,080
I saw a mirror.

1073
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,480
But I remembered

1074
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,380
our promise.

1075
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,800
At Niagara Falls.

1076
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,920
And had a date

1077
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,120
with my mom.

1078
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:56,520
Again.

1079
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,660
Everybody sing along.

1080
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,160
Each goddess has brought us closer.

1081
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,620
Each goddess

1082
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,460
has brought

1083
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,280
us closer.

1084
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,620
My fingers have erected a shrine.

1085
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,380
My fingers

1086
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,440
have erected

1087
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,000
a shrine.

1088
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,660
I know you.

1089
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,900
Like the back of my hand.

1090
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,680
I know you.

1091
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,800
Like the back of my hand.

1092
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,900
And I'll love you

1093
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,600
until I go blind.

1094
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,980
Your pregnant paws

1095
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,120
will be showing.

1096
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,720
So soon I must ask

1097
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,720
for your hand.

1098
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:43,740
I know you.

1099
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,460
I know you.

1100
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:45,460


1101
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:45,460


1102
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:45,460


1103
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:45,460


1104
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,480
I'll just rent a tuxedo

1105
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,180
without any pants.

1106
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,220
And have a date

1107
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,420
with my mom

1108
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:57,940
again.

1109
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,160
I'll have a date

1110
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,680
with my mom

1111
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:06,560
once

1112
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,820
again.

1113
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:26,880
guess you

1114
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,080
Mr.

1115
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:27,640
achievement.

1116
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,340
And which

1117
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:45,240
Ballantyne,

1118
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:45,300
can you

1119
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:45,320
downtime

1120
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:45,440
with

1121
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:45,460
the

1122
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:46,040
and get the bong.

1123
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,620
If you were here,

1124
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,160
he'd go out and get the bong.

1125
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,100
But then I'm thinking to myself,

1126
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:50,520
I think,

1127
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,000
why do they say the thing of it?

1128
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,540
Why can't they think of the word

1129
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,040
that they're trying to think of

1130
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,160
and then not say thing of it?

1131
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,540
What do they mean by the thing of it?

1132
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,920
What is the point of the thing?

1133
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,940
What is the object being talked about?

1134
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,800
What is the true definition of thing?

1135
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,280
Is the thing an unknown

1136
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,560
or is the thing unknown

1137
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,080
that's currently just locked away?

1138
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,540
What's the deal?

1139
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,480
You ever thought about that?

1140
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,100
I don't, no.

1141
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,040
Why don't you?

1142
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,960
Because that's your show.

1143
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,280
Hey you, I really don't,

1144
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,140
except to just keep on

1145
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:29,920
trying to spread that mighty wheelbarrow

1146
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,720
full of bob across the barren plains

1147
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,580
of America.

1148
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,280
Yes, doctor.

1149
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:36,880
Ding dong.

1150
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,420
My name is Vivian Spud

1151
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:41,320
and I've got something I'd like to ask you, doctor.

1152
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,520
Well, don't just stand there, boy.

1153
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:46,240
Ask away and we'll try to answer your question.

1154
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,520
Well, something has always puzzled me

1155
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,780
ever since I was a bee spot

1156
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,000
back in Indiana, doctor.

1157
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,420
Why does the porcupine

1158
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,760
weigh as big as yours?

1159
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,740
Because Hoosier boys

1160
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,080
oughtn't to get off their home soil

1161
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,540
and come traipsing out where they're kind.

1162
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,540
You know, Phil used to ask us that too, but...

1163
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,740
It's not the kind of answer

1164
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,460
we can put on the air.

1165
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,060
That's the problem.

1166
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:10,480
Ooh.

1167
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:11,980
Ooh.

1168
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:13,880
Ooh.

1169
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,500
See, hear the clamoring masses here below us

1170
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,320
of sub-deans wishing for church air.

1171
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,760
Ho-hum, they say.

1172
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,320
They're looking for spiritual guidance

1173
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,660
in a time of confusion.

1174
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,940
A time of worse things than that.

1175
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,000
You know what I mean?

1176
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,160
We're back here at the studio

1177
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,360
trying to clean up the mess after the explosion,

1178
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,520
but we didn't.

1179
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,400
We did get Bob all over two billboards

1180
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,760
right by Tower Records,

1181
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,680
and we did take an authenticating photograph,

1182
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,840
which, as it comes out,

1183
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:50,520
I will send you.

1184
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,140
And you can see Bob spread out all over Berkeley.

1185
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:58,400
And I was relating to you on the tape

1186
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,500
and may come up later anyway

1187
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,840
that I've been putting Bob all over California.

1188
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,140
You can see those stars so clearly

1189
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:05,840
it's not ball-like on Earth.

1190
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,640
Look at that cloudy planet go by.

1191
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,020
It's really inspiring.

1192
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,080
I'm glad to be talking to you here.

1193
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:35,520
I heard some more puzzling evidence in there

1194
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,800
and some phylo drumming,

1195
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,960
but friends, I promise to give you the post office box,

1196
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,520
the sacred post office box,

1197
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,220
for information on the Church of the Subgeniuses.

1198
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,080
Of course, as always,

1199
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:50,060
Bob at post office box 140306.

1200
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:58,320
That's box 140306 in Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1201
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,960
If you need to send tapes and stuff to me,

1202
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:01,960
Reverend Ivan Stang,

1203
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:06,200
will you just send those to P.O. Box 181417,

1204
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,400
Cleveland Heights, Ohio,

1205
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,140
444.

1206
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,940
888.118.

1207
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:17,620
And it's all available at www.subgenius.com.

1208
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:24,600
Yeah, Bonnie Winston tastes good like a cigarette.

1209
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,700
Thank you.

1210
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,520
Yes ma'am.

1211
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,240
I don't know.

1212
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:50,520
I sit down,

1213
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,120
shut my eyes.

1214
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,740
Don't you know they're bigger than a Miz?

1215
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:55,800
No, no, no.

1216
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,540
C'mon dude.

1217
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,160
You try it.
