This is what I have to say.

Can't you understand?

The Rudy Schwartz Project did it.
For this episode, friends, number 1,842,
we're going to go back to the day before X day.
They got the sound system working better,
and the panelists on this live hour of Slack are Dr. Hal,
Reverend Pease, Reverend Fid Chooley,
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.
Fid first, and then Pease, actually.
A highlight, in my opinion, is Dr. Hal and I doing a duet
on the song Cool Water, but that comes later, as did Pease.
Although those two things don't always happen in that order.
This microphone is on the left.
This one here is in the middle.
And this one's on the right.

That one on the right.
Check 1. Check 1.
Check 2. Check 2. Check 2.
And Check 3.
Okay.
Conclude recording.
Well, they also butt tough!


coffee.
Dr. Fox, how are we looking
on mix?
This is test chatter.
I'm merely talking
into the microphone, not to convey
any actual
information, but merely
to put audio
into the mic so that
Dr. Fox can twist
those robot
nipples enough so that
we can get on
rethink radio.
You're doing a really good show,
Finn. Thank you,
Pease. Do I need to...
Tell them about the bit.
Oh, the, yeah. So
Pease had this idea
that was really funny. He said
we should do a bit. And I was like, yeah.
That is a good idea, Pease.
So...
I'm gonna chew the fat
with Finn Chewy later.
Do we have the fat?
I've almost caught that chicken
three times, so just give me
a couple more chances, and I'll
have some fat.
I remember bits, but only
bits. Bits
and pieces.
But yeah, I remember back in the day, we used
to do bits, but we
either we lost them or the exes took them,
one by one, along with
things like my spinal fluid,
my hair,
my memory,
my morals.
All gone.
All gone. I'll get them back tomorrow.
You're still doing better than me.
Yeah, I need to...
I got some catching up to do.
I'll admit,
since there's no girls here, anyway,
I lost a couple of d***s over the years.
I still got most of them.
Oh, that's okay. They grow back.
The main one works.
Well, at least for one thing.
Yes, Pease.
Everybody
pees. Okay?
Anybody with a
functioning urethra
is allowed to join
for free for only
$***.
Well, hey.
Shout out to Dobscord and shout out
to freethinkradio.com.
We are
piping hot.
Streaming. Streaming.
Piping hot.
Super. Ooh.
Getting the stage set up
for the hour of slack
coming very soon
to an ear hole
near your face.
And, uh,
I am going to
p*** my pants. Live.
Later on, too.
So stay tuned for that.
Did you guys get all the
fat samples for the chewing
event?
Well, that was Pease's job.
And, uh, if I've learned... Oh, well...
If you've learned anything from this X-States,
don't put Pease in charge.
Right. Okay.
Of anything.
Yep. I got my plane ticket home
for Stang Ivan.
Actually, I should double check that.
Or get to the airport
at real early.
I don't know if they fixed the return ticket
or not.
Well, to be fair, um,
me and Fox put Pease in charge of your ticket,
so I don't know who the real dummy is.
Is it Pease or is it us for putting
Pease in charge?
Why not both?
I got you.
That's what I say.
I need a direct flight, but...
I'm sure they'll have Pease drive you.
He never screws up.
Yeah, you won't have to
howl. The world's gonna end.
It really better end this time.
I'm just going to... Oh, yeah, that's right.
Nobody made any plans at all for after.
All the credit cards are maxed out.
Why did I even bother
to pay for these new glasses?
I'll put my bag...
Yeah, I've often asked myself,
why did I spend all day paying bills
just before X Day?
What kind of idiot am I?
Well, Hal, we're still
managing to
get ourselves up those three steps
to this stage.
Yes, well, this chair will definitely
cripple me before long.
As I was saying, it's like every
X Day, the X's take a little
bit or a little piece.
Yes, like old man Death, who takes
little pieces of you while you're lying in your bed.
You're in your box till you're all gone.
Oh, Bob.
Won't you spare me over for another year?
Won't you spare me over for another year?
Don't you take my brain.
Oh, Bob.
He's Bob.
Won't you leave me sane?
Bob don't ever change.
He's Bob.
Wish I knew your name.
Always will be Bob.
I always thought that song should
have percussion of chain gang.
Yeah, it should have that kind of...
Rocks with picks.
We need the loop of that.
Bob had a woman named Connie.
She was a
righteous frail.
She had a lot of friends
named Johnny. When Bob
he hit the trail.
He's Bob.
They told me to
praise him and they told me to pay him.
But I just want to be him.
He's Bob.
Always will be Bob.
Hi, Bob.
Bob was the
god of the forest.
Who claimed his jungle bride.
His pet was a
brontosaurus.
That Bob he used to ride.
He's Bob.
Bob don't ever change.
He's Bob.
Always will be Bob.
Or
There's a dark
and a shadow side of Bob.
That's Bob.
That every subgenius knows
is true.
I played that song on
Hour of Slightness in the last two weeks.
Also,
Papa Joe's fiery
speech, Five Minutes to Midnight.
I need to tell him that.
Recorded in Germany.
In full dress.
I'm sure they loved that over there.
It was nervy, actually.
Five minutes to midnight!
It was a wonderful
rant, perfectly written just to do it.
The Hamburg
Devival.
He's got friends up in the sky.
He's immortal and can fly.
Otherwise he's just a guy like me and you.
There's a
dead armadillo
on the road.
And Bob's bumper, he hit it fair
and square.
There's a twinkle in his eye.
Not a tear as he drives by.
Cause mean old Bob
Dobbs, he just don't care.
So keep on the
grinning side, always on the
grinning side. Keep on the
grinning side of Bob.
He may look friendly like your
dad, but you don't want to make him
mad. So keep on
the grinning side of Bob.
Philo wrote that verse.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
those folks that want to do the
Dr. Hal art, but maybe they should
put the lyrics of your hymns
in there. There's at least five
of them. Nobody ever sings
those things, but
Oh, but we've
seen two remixes of
He's Bob. That's true. Somebody did
make those. I had them
on my computer, that is several
computers ago. I don't have them on my
contemporary computer.
I actually have all the
audio that I've
ever digitized all on one gigantic
18 gigabyte
hard drive now. So I can pull up
just about anything if it's got
a decent file name.
Like for instance, if I type in Hal
it'll pull up everything, every
file name that has your
name on it.
Which would probably be hundreds.
Why is it so
buzzy?
I can call up anything that has an X.
Of course that includes sex
and a lot of other things.
Secret codes. All that
xylophone footage you have.
X dash, X dash
D, just X D.
You never know
how the file was named exactly
for X-Day. Sometimes you save time
and leave out the dash. A dash of
this, a dash of that
serves seven billion.
There you go.
Just a spoonful of punctuation
helps the medicine go down.
More Dobstown Weekly
whiff reader headlines.
Ivan Stang's secret recipe
for imitation skyline
chili. Well that's pretty funny.
Oh boy. A brown paper bag.
Yeah, with a big M on it
for Mason's Masonic.
How beautiful, thank you.
Tainted frop stash endangers dozens.
Thrills even more.
Yes, we'll deal with that in a moment.
Paparazzi perplexed
by Walter Kosmack's new fleet
of anti-glamour drones.
I like the alliteration there.
Reverend P's
greatest boner.
Las Vegas actually shameful.
Sexy swamp apes seeking
sultry meetups.
Details inside.
You know we had those back in Ohio.
The Loveland frogmen were a cryptid species
that you had to worry about there.
Now we have the sexy swamp apes.
Oh that's nothing like the Land O' Lakes frogmen.
Oh no. They uh,
they like the frog
way.
We're being told to talk into the microphones.
Stage douche
Argus Fox is instructing
the performers to
remember to articulate clearly
into the microphones.
Reverend Stang, are you familiar with this
publication, Mind Shaft?
No, I've heard
about it. I haven't actually seen it.
It's what all the cartoonists are doing
these days and I'm in the next issue.
The one that's coming out.
This one just came out.
Who's doing this?
Well uh...
Contributors are Crumb, Christopher Miller, Mary Flaner,
Sophie Crumb.
Nepotism.
Sophie's got...
Dennis Kitchen, is he still alive?
He's still alive and his drawings and cartoons
look just like they always did.
Huh.
But uh, we lost Jay Lynch and Skip Williamson.
Yeah, oh I didn't know Skip Williamson died.
Skip Williamson was so upset that
Jay Lynch died that he died.
Aww.
Yeah.
Like two old dogs that just can't live apart.
2015.
It was sudden.
The fellow in the Bright Night
gown.
Sudden is not so bad.
I've heard.
No actually I haven't heard.
Don't read Daniel.
Well it says right here in the
Dobstown Weekly
WIF reader that Dr.
Howell has announced
the new Universal
Poet Laureate.
Yeah.
Well it's gotta be true. It's in print.
That news came out weeks ago.
That old. Yeah that's old news.
If you haven't got your copy
of the Dobstown Weekly
WIF reader you can acquire
yours from the InfoSex
station.
Over at that pretty turquoise
building.
And get your free art supplies
from the stage.
That's right your bag of
free art supplies is waiting
for you. It's cold.
It's alone. It's crying.
It says how come I don't have
a mommy. Well you can be
that bag of art supplies
mommy right now. Come to the
stage get your free bag of art supplies
and get a doodling.
It says tangy
barbecue sauce therefore it must
be tangy barbecue sauce.
Friends it's ah yes
welcome to hour of slight number
1800 and
Exactly.
That innumerate
designation. It's all
the same stuff produced from
the same spigot.
Once again
live at X Day
in a new location
Land O' Lakes Florida
the Land O' Id nudist
resort. I thought it was the Land
of Fid.
Well I guess
you could change all the signs.
Change them to what?
Land of Fid
says
Dr. Fid Chooley
who's joined us on this panel.
Well he made such a sacrifice with his
attack on his legs and feet
the other day.
He was so bloodied he should have been
in Fox's Book of Martyrs.
That's right you've injured yourself
horribly and didn't even know how you did it right?
That's true.
That is true. It looked like a catamount
or a wild cat
had leapt on your bare legs and
scratched and marred them.
I actually
died yesterday.
I die every night.
It looked pretty bad.
But I was having such a good time
I figured I'd hang around a little bit
not to let a little thing like death
keep me from a good party.
Maybe you actually did pass
and sunk into the swamp which
revised you as it did Lon Chaney
in The Mummy's Curse.
Lon Chaney Jr. that is.
That's right. Yeah the Mummy
the Universal Mummy was last seen in Florida.
He went to the south. Yes.
Not only that he was hanging out with a woman
named Aunt Bertha
played by Virginia Christine
and Mrs. Olsen in all the coffee commercials.
Oh really? Yes.
Oh man, wait until Sternow hears that.
He's really hot for Mrs. Olsen.
She had a movie career
in a bunch of movies where just when
you're not expecting to see the lady
from the coffee commercials
she pops in. Like in Billy the Kid
meets Dracula for example.
Was that the
coffee commercials where she was horrified
that her husband asked for a second cup?
The husband is going to kill the wife
or something because her coffee is so bad.
My husband hates my coffee.
Well it's mountain grown.
He never asked for a second cup of my coffee.
And then there's a scene of the clock
ticking in suspense
as the hubby drinks the coffee
and the wife is a bundle of nerves
as she waits and then the husband
finally moos at her.
Honey, that's good coffee.
And she
shoo
relaxes out of her kitchen.
No beating tonight. Yes.
You won't have to go to the special room
tonight, baby.
I had that experience
last night.
That's for Mrs. Olsen and Folgers.
Dr. Fox
usually never asks
for a second helping of my
frop but last night
somebody gave him some frop and he wanted
some more and I was taken
by it.
I didn't know what to do with myself.
I was going to kill myself
again.
Well practice makes perfect.
Dr. Fox never asked for a second helping of my frop.
At X Day they give you hamburgers for breakfast.
Hey, you know what goes good
with X Day Breakfast?
Bloody Mary's.
There's some free Bloody Mary's
service happening right now.
General announcement.
If you want to get your
thang twisted into a spang.
But the sun ain't even high
over the yardarm yet, matey.
We're going to start boozing it up
with Bloody Mary's.

Bloody Mary's?
I don't know, maybe we are.
It's an exceptional set of circumstances.
An unusual holiday.
All the limitations kicked away.
Well I'm going to go
acquire one for myself.
Because it's
X Day.
This is it.
It better happen this year.
Who's with me? Come on.
Or else what, pilgrim?
Or else I have to go home.
And then go back
to work.
Well, whether your home
is a cardboard box on the street
or a palace on board
the X's saucers,
you will be home.
I can't wait for
tomorrow because
Princess We told me that
my two older dogs are pining
for me.
So the first thing I'm going to do
about 7.05 is beam my dogs
up and have
them rejoin me. And
I'm going to have them
join Princess We.
Be careful they're not
reassembled at gigantic size.
They already have.
They already have grown to gigantic size.
But, oh, I'm thinking of the puppies.
Professor Diemer's formula.
Just the old dogs.
In fact, last night I missed
some of the show because I was on
FaceTime trying to console the dog.
It didn't work.
The dog didn't recognize my voice
over Wee's phone. It's all right, puppy.
I'm going to have to
get you to the phone.
No, it's a FaceTime call.
So they can see me too.
But they can't smell you and so they know it's fake.
Yeah. Now my oldest,
previous dog, Dammit,
we brought him to Cleveland.
Really? That was the name of Chicken's dog.
Yeah, I know. My dad's name's
Dammit, Dammit, though.
Constantly heard his name called.
It was embarrassing in crowds.
You know, Dammit, come.
People look at you funny.
Then he died and then I got a dog
named Buddy. Already named Buddy.
Anyway, Dammit would...
When I went off to the radio station,
sometimes Princess Wee
would stay home.
I was recording it at home and
my voice was on the big speakers.
When my voice came on
live, the dog would snap
to attention. He
recognized it.
But that was on good speakers.
It was live radio, not
satellite, you know,
microphone, tinny little sound.
Poor Claudia.
Still waiting by the window,
staring at the driveway,
waiting for Daddy to come back.
I miss those dogs.
You know, at the end of the world,
the things that are most important
to you come to the forefront.
And I think in my case,
it's the damn dogs.
You know, I'm not worried
about my human family.
I'm worried about my doggies.
They don't know what's going on.
They're just idiots.
They're so innocent.
Unlike any humans that I know.
Man's commensal species.
Did you see that movie
Alpha?
No, I didn't, but that's not
the one where they had a computer generated dog.
No, no, that's
Call of the Wild.
It's the real dog in Alpha that looked very wolf-like.
Yeah, Call of the Wild.
It would be
a very realistic dog,
except that it acts too perfect.
It poses
in shots like a real
dog would never do.
There's no nipple slips.
No accidents.
Dogs are all about those.
That gives it the uncanny valley.
Well, one out of eight ain't bad.
Otherwise, it's a
good, it's a fun movie.
I heard it was a good version of the story.
Yeah, but if only somebody
who didn't have a real dog would be fooled.
Yes.
As realistic as it is.
I mean, they got hair down pretty well.
Well, hell, they can fake anything now.
You don't even need millions of dollars of special effects.
You can stick your face onto anybody
using a damn phone.
Well, Lassie and
Rin Tin Tin, let's give them credit,
could really act.
I could stick your face on Rin Tin Tin
and vice versa.
Please don't. Rin Tin Tin has been sleeping
with his ancestors for years.
Surgically, we can do that tomorrow.
A ghastly match-up.
Mmm.
Peanut butter.
If you can hold Hal down, I can scrape it on the inside
of the roof of his mouth with a popsicle stick.
Peanut butter not good for
humans of advanced age.
The peanut itself,
not a nut, but a legume
that grows on a tree.
Same with the cashew.
Almonds are alright.
Ah.
Well, I brought all this
dope up here, so we're going to
smoke it while we meander as
we do.
Smoke that dope.
In this tiny little pipe, there's, I mean,
you have to keep smoking to get it out.
I'll be interested
to see if gift
memberships will save
people tomorrow. For instance,
my kids never spent
the 35 bucks. They're grown-ups
now. Well, they have the
document and they...
I gave them
membership packs. One Christmas, I gave
everybody in the family membership packs, but
there's only one, only my niece
has ever
actually bought one.
And she's a regular listener
to our slaps. She would know
who you are and everything.
But what happens if you didn't
buy your membership pack yourself,
if somebody just gave it to you, are you
saved? If you don't
give a sh**, if you really
don't even believe in Bob, like my kids.
As long as somebody...
Well, that's not black in their name.
No doubt the exists will listen to that.
They will listen to these records as well.
They will know how thorough they are.
Of course, there is that transfer of
documentation, but a similar change
happens in the germplasm
at that time.
As long as somebody paid for it.
Because that's one of
the more insidious
uses of the
membership packet is
you can ordain somebody
else against their will
just by paying for a membership packet.
Just like the Mormons. They can throw you
to your dead.
Yeah, you can save your dead ancestors.
Just like the Mormons do.
And like Coca-Cola, which brings their beloved
ancestors back from the dead.
Or you can just take somebody that you know hates
the Church of the Subgenius, send them
your $35. I hate the Church of the Subgenius.
I hate it.
Guess what? Oh, you do? Well, you're in the
Book of Life now.
How do you like that? How does that taste?
Does his name appear in the
Book of Life? Well, I can't
find him here, Lord. Unless maybe it's spelled
differently. Then with
sorrow I say unto you,
into the eternal fire,
prepared for Satan and his fallen angel
buddies. You had a chance
when I sent that boring preacher
to your door and you laughed at him
and turned him away and embraced this
guy with the pipe.
Just better hope Reverend Pease wasn't the one
who wrote your name in the Book of Life.
The recording
angel does that.
You know, how come it's huge and thick
like a dictionary when everyone
at the Last Judgement is automatically
guilty and it's all a show
trial? Whose names
are in that there Book of
Life? Mostly Neanderthals.
Mark Twain wrote about Captain
Stormfield's visit to
heaven. He went
wrong and has traveled through
space and first of all ended up in
alien heaven. But he finally ended
up in human heaven and he found there were
the whole place was overwhelmed by
what he called engines, which were
Neanderthals, primitives,
cavemen,
pre-Adamic
men. You know, they outnumber
everybody else and so with
their tom-tom beating and so
on they make heaven resound.
I wonder if River
World owes Mark Twain
an explanation.
They have him in there, don't
they?
Did you ever see
the thing that's based on it? I
had an opportunity to watch it on the plane, but I
didn't want to. I would have had to watch it
silent. Which? The River World
show or River World
movie based on Philip King. I did
see the River World movie. Jose
Flaman. It sucked and on top of that they didn't
show everybody naked. Oh, that's
terrible. I especially wanted to see
Alice Blesent's Liddell
naked and having sex like in
the story. No, no. It was a TV
movie so it was lame.
Well, made for TV, that says it all.
C'est no more. C'est no more.
Wow.
Yeah, very little relation to the
book.
I mean, really.
There's a problem here about
COVID and everything and putting
our lips on this thing. Do you have one of these?
I've got one. Don't worry. I'm fine.
Okay, great. You know, I'm
at work. I don't
I don't frop at work.
Everybody's drinking
on the job.
Really? Well, you shame me, but
on the other hand...
Actually, I used to.
Back before
9-11.
When you could open the
radio station windows.
After 9-11, they locked
everything up. Total
lockdown was as bad as COVID.
And no more fropping in the
stations. After COVID, they locked the
station itself so no one could... Right.
And then there was no stations, but that
worked out fine
for me. I was already locked out of
any stations, doing it from home.
And...
I managed to get
the stations to accept
mp3 downloads so I didn't have to mail
them CDs anymore, which was expensive.
And most
of them weren't paying anyway.
But it's free advertising.
The great thing about
real radio as opposed to
podcasts is somebody can hear it
by accident. Just driving
along their car, putting it on
scan, and suddenly
they'll hear this crazy
stuff. And that's the...
That's really fun to
think of. And I've heard examples
of that. I've also heard it
happening in reverse. Thank you.
This one woman, she was actually
the station manager
at the Dallas station.
She was driving back from Austin
and it was 9 o'clock
Sunday and she thought, well I'll listen
to the Hour of Slack. She turned on the radio, but
she wasn't anywhere near Dallas.
And she thought she was listening to my
show for about half an hour
before she realized she had it tuned between
a rock station and a preacher station.
A rock station and a hard place station.
She was hearing rock music with idiot
preachers and figured that was Hour of Slack.
So...
Yeah, I used to do the same thing
with scrambled porn.
You just gotta pick what kind of stations
to put the needle
between. So you hear
both of them, back and forth.
Quick, what's in the needle?
Hey bees,
why don't you come up here and occupy this mic
so I can, uh,
cure for myself.
Occupy X Day.
I'm gonna go occupy a Bloody Mary.
Occupy X Day.
Or be occupied.
Hey, do you scratch these things
or do you peel them off the front?
We could start a new, uh,
subversive movement called
Anti-Pie for Anti-Pink.
Anti-Pie.
Hmm. Well, uh,
they should know that we're anti-
pink. Wow, look.
And tea pick. Ice cold water.
Dr. Pease has been real careful about making sure
people hydrate.
But don't get my valuable
mindset. Especially when he sees somebody
stumbling along about to pass out.
He'll follow along behind him.
Drink this, drink this.
Don't drink that, drink this.
Without a taste of water.
Cool water.
Water.
Water, water.
Keep up.
Keep up the movin', Dan. Don't you listen to him, Dan.
He's a devil, not a man.
And he spreads the burning sand
with water.
Water. Water.
Dan, don't you see there's a
big green tree with the water
running free and there's water
running there for me and
you.
The shadows
sway and seem
to say, tonight
we'll pray for water.
Cool
water.
Water.
And way up there, he'll hear
our prayer and show
us where
there's water.
Water.
Clear, cool
water.
Water.
Sons of the
Pioneers was the version I grew up with.
Yeah.
The hearing
aids are constantly shortening
out from sweat running into them.
And so I put this umbrella made of
McDonald's napkin over my left one.
Speaking of McDonald's, there seems to be
an extra bacon
mix-something here.
I feel foolish.
You can have that.
I'll have it, all right.
Or you can save it for later.
There is no later.
I feel foolish because
I saw you with the napkin on your ear.
Time
is running
out.
So it's a fabulous day here next day.
But there is no July 5th in this building.
Yes, that's going to be a problem.
I can't believe this.
Look at my arm.
Insect.
More water coming out of me than there is in that
store-bought water bottle.
That's why if you smoke
frop like me, you'll find your temperature
was regulated.
Perhaps you've reached your saturation level.
I used to get, in Arizona, when it
was super hot, I found if I
smoked some pot, I adjusted my temperature.
Where did peas come from?
It's horrible.
It's an X-Day miracle.
The X-Day miracle
for me was the rain of prairie
squid from the sky yesterday.
God, that was so fun.
It was so crazy.
It was the torrential rain and suddenly there were
these flopping, stinking
prairie squid, only they
were wet.
They actually weren't prairie squid.
Raymond Burr in his wheelchair.
People were calling them walking catfish.
They were making their way to the pool
and we had to put a stop to it.
They were coming out of the pond trying to get to the
pool because
they wanted cool, clear water.
They weren't reckoning on pouring.
Which I think would be bad for them.
In fact,
I saved one from poisoning.
I saw you with that net.
He resisted your attempts
to save him, much like many of the
subgeniuses.
Well, yeah. I guess that was a pink
walking catfish.
He didn't want to be saved.
I don't need any
more friends.
You really remembered
that one, didn't you?
It was a wonderful tale.
Well, it's typical subgenius.
You don't want to go to some party and meet new people.
Well, I think that's the thing.
We've all experienced that feeling
and probably all done
the exact same thing. You've got a friend
that says, hey, I know this guy.
You're really going to like him. He's so awesome.
And you're like, leave me alone. I've got all the
friends I need.
Well, what convinced me to go meet
the Drummond family was that
my sister-in-law said,
well, he's really into Captain Beefheart
and he collects comic books.
And, of course, now that describes
about half the subgeniuses. But then,
in 1976,
I didn't know anybody
like that. And it's like, well, okay.
We go over to this
suburban house
and there's Philo Drummond
and he looks just as pink as
a newborn babe
with this corporate haircut
and a sportcaster mustache
and he's playing darts.
He's a jock.
And he brings me over
and he says, here, throw some darts.
Let's throw some darts while those women talk.
And I go,
I don't know. I've never thrown darts.
I don't know anything about this.
He goes, go ahead and try.
I give it a try. Bullseye!
Right dead center! My first try.
Total beginner's luck.
Philo's thinking,
That shark.
He's like a card shark.
He's an expert at darts
and he convinced me that he was a nervous amateur.
So we both were suspicious
from the get-go. But then,
he said, hey, I found something cool the other day
and he brought it out and it was like
a Chick track or a John Birch Society pamphlet.
Something like that.
And I was like, wow.
He's interested in the same
that I am.
And next thing we knew,
we were,
he was telling me about this
special person.
But because, I know, I normally would have
fled at that point when he started telling me
about Bob, but he had such good
frop.
That was the other thing.
That was the thing my sister-in-law
should have told me.
He's got real good frop.
That's what frop was then.
So it wouldn't have helped much.
But he gave me this stuff.
I guess I thought it was marijuana at the time.
So I tried it for the first time.
Well, that's all it takes.
One hit, you're done.
You're going to be high the rest of your life.
You don't ever need another hit.
Oddly enough, I see people just
keep coming back for more all day long
the rest of their lives.
Even though you don't get any higher generally.
You're kind of stuck
in one level of extremely
high all the time.
Consistently. Too high.
And the rest, as they say...
But look at me!
I'm fine!
Aside from my backbone and my memory
and my eyesight and hearing,
I have a picture of health.
My lungs, allergies,
hospital visits...
Memory problems. You say you have memory problems?
You remember the money you owe me, right?
No, it's the money you owe me.
You see, that's the...
Yeah, there are some...
Some things are not lost to memory.
The exes have those.
The exes have those memories and we'll get them back tomorrow.
We'll settle it then.
Alright, that sounds fair.
I'll see you on the saucer, mister.
Yeah, we'll let Mwom settle this one.
In the casino.
Speaking of the saucer,
you have an especially exquisite
saucer plan for yourself
with many national monuments
and tchotchkes, if I'm not mistaken.
Right, I've just got to beat legume to them.
Well, hasn't he got a head start?
Yeah, but
I guess the official chase
doesn't start until 7am.
Oh, okay, that's good.
But he does have a head start, yeah.
And he knows exactly what I want the most.
And he's a devil.
In the end, he'll let me have him back,
but I'll have to fight him for him.
They'll be on his ship at first.
Yeah, I know how he is.
You'll have to trade it for something.
Yeah, like my memory.
Sacred nose hairs,
a strand of the sacred ponytail,
all of these will be
the currency of the future.
Relics left here on this
burning hulk of an earth.
I thought you'd forgotten
about the ponytail.
He still got his eye on my ponytail.
Circling back.
He's jealous.
That's what makes it funny, you circle back.
Look at that.
It used to be big, long.
I'm going to tell you something,
that is going to make the most fabulous keychain for me.
I mean,
people are going to see that.
It's hanging out of my pocket.
You mean not on your belt?
You can have it.
I'm going to have a whole new body tomorrow.
Now, I'm going to go for a robot body,
but I'm going to have an extra arm
for doing stuff
when I'm doing stuff with my regular arms.
What kind of robot?
I know what you mean.
You just need one right hand.
It only has to do one thing, pump up.
It's a pleasure saucer, by definition.
You're going to need that extra arm.
Now, don't be foolish
and just get the arm.
Order the hand option.
It needs a wrist.
It needs a flexible wrist.
Otherwise, it just gets too repetitious.
Take the claw!
You get calluses.
You just get calluses.
After a while,
everything loses sensitivity.
Take my word for it.
I know how that is.
He's right.
Some people say
they're just going to keep
their regular old body.
Ratnar, among others,
strangely enough.
Have you seen his body?
I've seen every bit of Ratnar's body.
What did he do to it?
He's a very large,
very pink-colored fellow.
He's a large-sized subgenius?
Soft.
His body is very big.
His skin looks like it has never seen the sun.
He'd come to X-Day
and sunburn himself horribly
in the first hour.
And then be miserable.
Invariably, he'd set up his tent
ineptly
and it would rain and soak everything
including his brand new video cameras
and so forth.
Then he'd be sure that
somebody else had sabotaged it.
Why did Bob pick on me?
I just wanted to come here and have fun.
Well, Bob didn't, but some of his followers
did.
Ratnar quit coming to X-Day,
but I kind of miss him.
He was such a regular
and he was kind of a...
I don't know.
He had served one of the functions of peace
as a punching bag.
He was an acolyte.
A classic acolyte.
Like a vampire is familiar.
I was sitting there one X-Day
looking around, oh no, Ratnar's here.
Here comes Ratnar.
He goes, Stang, I've got something for you.
He was in cash.
He had saved up from his
Pizza Hut delivery job.
He gave me
a whole bunch of Pizza Hut plastic
red glasses, which turned out
to be my very favorite drinking glasses.
I look for those things.
I steal them when I go to Pizza Hut.
Those were more valuable to me than the thousand bucks.
At that point, I changed my mind
about him instantly.
I said, Ratnar, it wouldn't be the same
without you at X-Day.
I was thinking, maybe he'll bring another
$200,000 next year.
He ended up running for Governor of Kentucky.
I think he got 23 votes.
That's a magical number, as you know.
His plan
was to solve
the war problems by
sending out
robot dog
mule soldiers instead of
human soldiers.
I said, wouldn't that be kind of expensive?
How would the Army pay for that?
He said, with legalized
equipment.
He said, with the


get all 23 votes.
He got the discordian vote.
If he had gotten
a subgenius vote, it would be
273, not just 23.
23 is common.
It comes up every 23 times.
273 is much more rare.
Now, 1303
or 13013,
that's
really the most sacred number.
Thank you.
That's a different type of number.
999 is a good one.
That was actually the number
of the anti-Bob.
I think the most sacred number
is 35.
35
measly dollars.
We've got to
raise it, man. It's been 35 bucks
for 20 years or something.
I think we're going to suddenly raise it.
$35.50.
It should have been $33.
But now we've gone past that.
But maybe that will include postage
unless it's overseas.
It costs $26 to send a
membership pack to England
and $22 to
send one to Canada or
Mexico.
Not that anyone's ever ordered one from Mexico.
I think we had two members.
Don't you think you should do it in steps though?
It may cost more if they
Like when Marvel would raise the price on the comic,
they'd put a little starburst on the cover
and say,
Still only $0.35.
Oh, I remember still only $0.10.
Still only $0.12.
Still only $0.20.
When it hit still only $0.50
and it was half ads,
I quit buying comic books.
Also, I had a kid to support
and read comic books.
The price of the comic books
outpaced the normal
allotment of ducats and dollars
that a young child might have.
So you'd start out
with 12 books and then
they'd raise the price and you'd get down to
$0.07 or $0.08. And then like you said,
when it was $0.50, well, Jesus, that's half
my allowance for this week.
No, I was 18 when it hit $0.50.
Well, now that those
children are adults, they find
that the same comic books are
still economically out of
their reach.
Well, here's the funny thing though.
All those $0.50
and dollar comics from
the 70s
and 80s,
my wife inherited from a collector.
Jeff Rosenbaum,
who started Starwood,
was a crazy
comic book collector also.
He had Marvels and DCs
of everything
from the 70s and 80s and he kept
them really nicely in these
plastic and these big comic
book boxes. He had a room full of them.
There's a room full of them in Cleveland.
I managed to grab two boxes
at random and take to Texas.
That's one reason my back is destroyed.
Those boxes were extremely
heavy and it was the last day before
we left. It was like there was just enough
room left in the car to get some
comic books in. Have you looked in the box
yet? Oh, the box, we managed
to get the box into the house and
I even read a whole bunch of the Batman
stuff. I hope they were good.
They were, but they're still
there and
they were jointly
inherited by my wife and my neighbor
Joe, but Joe doesn't care about them.
I don't know how we're ever
going to get them back to Texas though.
That's literally
tons and tons of comics.
None of which are worth very much.
Well, ship them at a low rate.
A low book rate or something.
Hey, look at this.
Alright.
I still haven't scratched
the one you gave me. Three more dollars.
I've cleared 40 bucks
now. Well, I had 30
to start with and I've gotten another
10 bucks worth of these things.
Thank you again.
I'm going to eat out tonight.
The luck plane is tilting in your direction,
Ivanstang.
This doesn't happen every day.
It's $10 in payout
tripler lottery cards.
Well, that's how much one would have to pay.
That's how I know how much they are.
You don't rub it again.
I'm about to rub
one of them myself.
Oh, this is exciting.
That's an excellent
scratching technique, Dr. Howell.
It seems efficient
and yet
adventurous.
Well, actually, whenever I have
an opportunity to scratch something like
this, which I find irritating
and unnecessary, I
actually use a little metal picture
of Bob that is the perfect
scratcher. But I don't
have that with me.
I hope it doesn't hurt the luck
involved. It's made at
Tucson Trade Engraving and it's engraved
on metal and it's a reverse
image of Bob.
I just put these things,
I tuck them into my dog's ear and then
he scratches them with his hind leg.
Let the dog do it.
Boy, those German Shepherd
puppies have turned out to be a bit of a
terror in that they
they're right at the age where they
want to see what
things taste like, especially
if they've been handled by me. They know,
they seem to know it for a long time
that stuff on the floor was
fair game, but things on
shelves were daddy stuff, don't mess
with them. But then they got more
adventurous and they tasted
several
video game controllers.
They really like those. How old are
the pups now? They're about seven months now.
So they're going through
secondary teething right now
and I would get a wash rag and
get it wet and put it in
the freezer and give them that to chew
because they're looking around for things to
chew now because it relieves
the massacration.
They've got tons of stuff to chew.
My house is covered
with dog toys and cat toys
and stuff. And we give them
new ones all the time, but you know, they want
a taste of furniture. The fossils.
Yeah, actually
I did one of the... You wouldn't think
a dog would give a hoot about a fossil.
I wouldn't. Daddy's been playing
with them. I want to check it out. German Shepherds are great
dogs and they're so inquisitive and
so intelligent and
you're just going to have a whole awesome time
up ahead of you. Especially as they
mature a little bit and they take
on their shepherd personas.
Well a good dog or a good
cat will teach you why you
want a dog or a cat in the first place.
Because they're so
sympathetic and empathetic and
they're far more than you ever believed
possible and so
from then on you want every dog and
cat to hit that high standard.
And they often don't.
Well,
those dogs are going to have some real treats waiting for them.
Tomorrow morning. Very good.
Now you'll
circle back to get everybody
at the ranch, right?
That's what I said. The first thing I'm going to do,
7-0-5 is get the... Because they're
pining for me. Princess Wee said
that Claudia's just going...
She just stares out the window waiting.
I tried to talk to her on
FaceTime yesterday but it didn't work.
So yeah, first thing I'm going
to do is beam up my lonesome
dogs and give them
something to play with. And then we?
Yeah, and then my wife.
And then I'll see if my kids... I want to just see
if my kids automatically get beamed up
or if their faithlessness leaves
them down there.
But just for the sake of my
grandkids, I'll go ahead and
probably beam up the whole gang.
You're a better man than me because I was
going to go, you know, tool around
a little bit to get the feel of the saucer
before I went back to get carrots.
You won't have to. You don't think so?
No, everything will be automatic.
Everything will be automatic.
Anywhere on and in an instant.
One will know before you think of it
what you want. Or as you're thinking
of it, it will pick
up on it. I always want to say, she.
Just like the government.
Yeah, kind of.
Well, that's not the
problem with it, you know. After a while
you're going, no, this is too perfect. I'm freaking out.
That's the
phase we don't tell everybody about.
All I want is a thought to myself
in my own mind.
Do you want to know the secret of how to deal with that?
That's a very important secret.
What's that, Dr. Howe?
The secret is that you also put a
spell on yourself
so that you don't know all these
things you arranged are going to happen
to you and you can just think
you're very lucky and so on. Every now and then
you get a reminder. But in
your case, you see, you don't
let yourself know
that everything is perfect.
Now that is a brilliant tip
from the keeper of the mystic
secrets of the Church of the Sun. That's why everybody
goes wrong who makes a deal
with the devil or whatever
because you cannot
take satisfaction when you know the game
is rigged in your favor.
So first you rig it in your favor
and then you create
limited oblivion for yourself
so you can enjoy it
as if it's your actual
just desserts.
And you forget that you sold your soul.
Yes, which is also good
because you don't fret about it all the time.
That takes it off your mind.
You can worry about that later
when the devil takes you to hell
for eternity.
He rises up through the floor at an inconvenient
time and holds the document
and reminds you and so forth.
And you have to beg and wheedle
for a little more time.
I know they say hell's
going to be bad but
what if it's not?
What if it's like super awesome and all your friends
are there?
I'm glad I'm not involved in any of that stuff
because I'll be on the pleasure saucer. But I want
to know what you think about it.
I wonder about all the other people.
Jack T. Chick denies it.
However, isn't it part of the subgenius
lore that the
Christian heaven is subgenius hell
or something like that?
You have to have
subgenius hell as practice
for subgenius heaven.
They're both fun
but subgenius heaven is so
fun you'd lose your mind
if you didn't go through boot camp.
You tend to lose your mind
if you don't go through boot camp.
Anyway, you have to be able to live with yourself
forever so the slightest flaw
becomes of an infinite size.
So you've got to watch out for that.
Only the part that is
worthy of moving on
to the next dimension
or whatever.
Look at that.
The thing that's supposed to protect my hearing aid
is soaked.
I'd have to put a new napkin up there every 10 minutes.
Do you want a new napkin?
I believe I might have one.
I'll get one.
I need to finish this bottle of water
so that I'll have something to catch the sweat in.
I can refill it in about five minutes.
I do like to remind people
to please stay hydrated.
You've got to drink some water today.
We have a lot of fabulous
barley beverages
that were donated by the
Orange Blossom Beer Company
and they're fabulous.
We got them ice cold for you
and we want you to enjoy them
but we also want to make sure that
everybody has a good time
so drink some water.
Ironically friends, good old Pease himself
neglected to drink enough water
even though he remembered to drink enough beer.
And by the afternoon of July 5th
he was really messed up.
But then, what subgenius wasn't?
