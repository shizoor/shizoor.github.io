1
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:25,240
acquired a new headquarters here in cleveland and i'm too busy dealing with that to edit

2
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,660
a show out of all the tapes from the amsterdam subgenius church field trip that we just got back

3
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:40,640
from and that means you lucky stiff that this show is given over to the loose but ever stiffening

4
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:52,340
suzy the floozy and this show is therefore a digital replay of bob's slack time funhouse

5
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,580
episode specifically number

6
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:02,420
350 she's done 350 shows and this is hour of slack number 779

7
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:13,400
this particular masterpiece of collage editing and ranting by the beautiful suzy the floozy

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:23,200
is an unusual up america episode we might say a patriotic episode friends produced by reverend

9
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,240
suzy the floozy

10
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:34,640
at the marvelous studios of w-r-e-k atlanta atlanta's only decent and patriotic radio station

11
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,300
this music in the background is einstein's secret orchestra with ron slave

12
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:49,520
recorded at winterstar and now let us go into the world of suzy the floozy

13
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,100
my friend the bible says in psalm 9 verse 17 the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the

14
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,560
nations who forget god we are coming to an era in america of singular my friend there's so much

15
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,220
sin degradation licentiousness loot that's going on in our nation that if god does not just have a good time with you

16
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:34,880
I love you.

17
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,560
In educating and training the youth.

18
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,260
In understanding and appreciation of the duties of citizenship.

19
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:12,640
Our children can learn how our forefathers established the government, the constitution, the two-party system of America.

20
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,320
Today the children can learn from television how the candidates for president and vice president are nominated.

21
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,380
So we the people have the privilege of voting.

22
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:40,820
It assumes that all normal or mature human beings who are affected by the decisions of government and the institutions of a society should have a voice and a vote and therefore some power in determining them, in conserving them or transforming them.

23
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,240
Power! The nation needs power to grow!

24
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,300
The nation needs inventions to harness it!

25
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,540
It needs that power! Power to get us where we're going, folks!

26
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,340
Just exactly where did you say we're going?

27
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,000
Didn't say, didn't say. Just move along right this way, folks. Move along.

28
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,540
Don't you worry about a thing. Hurry, hurry to the greatest life on earth!

29
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,020
Consequently, I don't need to tell you, it's in the south where the great test has come and will come.

30
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,740
Any southerner who had taken part in the war was stripped of his vote.

31
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,480
Heavy enough to scare me right off the couch, Bob. I'll jump right up and get on it.

32
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,940
I'm a ballot dropped in a box.

33
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,620
May God grant me the wisdom, the integrity, the courage and the strength...

34
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,680
...to keep myself.

35
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,260
...this historic decision which has caused such chaos and courage and violence.

36
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,880
Just before Christmas, a friend telephoned me this morning from Texas.

37
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,300
When there is a national crisis, the federal government in Washington can easily forget the special problems of...

38
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,340
...one part of the country or another when it's drafting an emergency law.

39
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,560
The place was Palm Beach, Florida.

40
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,680
The time was the 11th of December, a brilliant, clear, hot Sunday.

41
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,960
At 10 minutes to 10 that morning, a car that was being driven along one of the oceanfront boulevards...

42
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,740
...slowed down and parked...

43
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,220
There was nothing against any citizens parking his car on that street and walking across the road...

44
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,300
...to look at the high hedge of trees and to gaze up the long driveway.

45
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,280
Even so, you would not have gazed or lighted for long.

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,660
Because at the entrance to the driveway stood two men whose white buttons in their lapels...

47
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,460
...one hand in a pocket in the habit of rolling on the balls of their feet...

48
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,740
...instantly gave them away as members of the Secret Service...

49
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,240
...assigned to the President and his family by law the moment his election seemed sure.

50
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,040
However, the nub of the story is that on that Sunday morning...

51
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,720
...the car that drove along the Palm Beach Boulevard and parked opposite the President's house...

52
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,300
...had a car.

53
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:52,300


54
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,340
And nobody at the wheel.

55
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,260
Pray for our country. Pray for this college.

56
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,320
Pray for us that we may be able of these last days...

57
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,160
The dog's in the plane with a ring!

58
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,320
...so it goes on to the memory of its humiliation as a dog remembers its beating.

59
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,680
Well, class, the history of our country has been changed again.

60
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,680
America was now discovered in 1942 by...

61
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,180
...some guy.

62
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,820
And our country isn't called America anymore.

63
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,380
It's...

64
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,580
...bonerland.

65
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,860
Our democratic world and its legacy of ideas are under constant attack and criticism.

66
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,380
It is being challenged to justify itself.

67
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,540
And to such a challenge, we cannot merely reply,

68
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,400
Everyone knows it is good.

69
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,220
Our world faces not only the challenge of those who are opposed to it and who would destroy it.

70
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,080
We are blind, roping in the darkness of the future instead of illuminating it.

71
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,940
When we seek to describe our political ideal is democracy.

72
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,620
Often it rises no higher than our lips.

73
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,800
If it reaches our minds, it will rise even higher.

74
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,120
If it gets out of our mind, the term democracy raises as many problems as it answers.

75
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,360
For after all, those who are determined to destroy the American way of life call themselves

76
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,800
democrats too...

77
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,020
...and the system into which they would replace it a democracy.

78
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,180
How do we distinguish between our democracy and theirs?

79
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,560
Between a democracy to which we give our reflective loyalty...

80
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,880
...and a new democracy, organic democracy, guided democracy, higher democracy, socialist democracy...

81
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,380
And here's another thing.

82
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,920
The Secret Service has noticed over the years

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,840
that a man is never in greater danger than when he's just been elected

84
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,560
and is still president-elect.

85
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,300
The theory is that when a new leader is crowned

86
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,140
and his inauguration is inevitable,

87
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,880
this fact is itself a mockery of the maniac's urge to have the people reject him.

88
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,220
There is no king in America,

89
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,520
and so we need to wake up because people are doing that which is right in their own eyes.

90
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,120
The basic sense of freedom in our society is freedom of choice.

91
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,920
Freedom to choose who shall govern us

92
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,740
and the freedom to dismiss or replace our governors if they do not suit us.

93
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,560
In ancient Rome, there was a poem

94
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,020
about a dog who found two bones.

95
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,420
He picked the one, he licked the other,

96
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,720
and when it stuck, it peed itself dead.

97
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,000
Freedom of choice.

98
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,420
What you've got.

99
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,760
Freedom of choice.

100
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,220
Freedom of choice.

101
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,020
Freedom of choice.

102
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,460
Is what you've got.

103
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,980
Freedom of choice.

104
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,400
He's right.

105
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,520
You crooks in Washington have put a sock in it.

106
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,860
Do you can see, you can see,

107
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,200
but you can't silence.

108
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,100
Call your magnates.

109
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,340
Call your magazine.

110
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,440
Tell the people.

111
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,160
Don't let the government push you around.

112
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,280
You have a choice.

113
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,240
Fight back.

114
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,060
Well, that's very concise,

115
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,260
but it's an insult to everything I suffered for.

116
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,000
Now take a seat, Junior.

117
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,040
Listen to someone who gave their youth in service of their country.

118
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,460
Damn it.

119
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,400
Hey, what are you looking at me for?

120
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,880
Do I have a line here or something?

121
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,940
What I was wanting her to do is to keep on.

122
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,660
I could have asked her not to use profanity.

123
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,780
I could have asked her not to use anything,

124
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,300
but I didn't want to ask her not to.

125
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,920
Let her go.

126
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,100
Let her go.

127
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,740
Let her utilize her freedom,

128
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,280
because that's what America has given people.

129
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,660
Freedom of speech, freedom of worship,

130
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,060
freedom of religion, freedom of press.

131
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,180
But let me tell you one thing.

132
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,340
God didn't allow Americans to give us freedom

133
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,960
to take away the freedom that other people have as freedoms.

134
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,440
And let her do what she pleases,

135
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,660
but I don't want her to please herself

136
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,840
by taking away mine and your freedom,

137
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,180
because mine and your freedom are just as valuable to us

138
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,300
as her freedom is to her.

139
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,880
And the only reason she got done what she got done in the 60s

140
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,440
is she was a minority in the 60s,

141
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,400
but she became a majority

142
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,260
because the majority didn't know what the minority was doing.

143
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,140
And I found out the best way to make a minority

144
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,980
not do what they want to do

145
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,060
is to wake up the majority.

146
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,100
And when the majority are in the 60s,

147
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,760
when Americans are waking,

148
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,060
they don't want a minority to do anything

149
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,420
that's wrong and against what the majority

150
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,360
want to have made right and kept right in America.

151
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,980
Hey, man, you better not be pointing that finger at me.

152
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,120
I don't even know what the hell you said.

153
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,700
I'm just watching the fireworks like everybody else.

154
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,980
Sometimes a devil works an atheistic, agnostic,

155
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,780
anti-God, anti-church, anti-Bible people.

156
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,040
And if I've ever met anyone

157
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,000
the devil works in and through,

158
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,980
he works in and through

159
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,080
his number one responsibility.

160
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm not just a guy who's got a recruiting office in America.

161
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,400
America's most hated woman.

162
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,520
And she even enjoys being called that.

163
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:22,940
Whoa!

164
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,300
Hey, that's pretty good.

165
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,000
This woman is a brilliant, brilliant,

166
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,180
minded woman

167
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,240
with such a dumb, dumb outlook on life.

168
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,940
Hey, I may be dumb,

169
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,360
but I'm half as stupid

170
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,160
as what I'm seeing on TV.

171
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,660
Ooh, another news report.

172
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,440
This was decided

173
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,520
on the basis of the appeal.

174
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,820
The judges read over

175
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,480
the Constitution and take some phrase like

176
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,100
the equal protection of the law

177
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,540
or the right of the people to be secure in their persons

178
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,820
and then they apply it to the case before them.

179
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,780
Now, the judges are mortal men

180
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,580
and they bend and fit the phrases written in 1787

181
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,080
to rule on everything from the price of vegetables

182
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,480
to the threats of a street corner rabble-rouser.

183
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,320
The Supreme Court has been called

184
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,660
the most remarkable judicial body in the world

185
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,400
and it had better be.

186
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,420
When it correctly senses

187
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,640
the general direction of public opinion

188
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,720
or what has been called

189
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,520
the moral climate of the time,

190
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,040
the United States is a well-governed country.

191
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,940
Well, you got this big-haired floozy

192
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,000
coming down the, the, the Supreme Court steps.

193
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,600
Ah!

194
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,920
The American nation is in trouble.

195
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,100
As indeed, it is now.

196
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:33,960
Shh!

197
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,120
Sandra Day O'Connor has just appeared on the steps.

198
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,180
Uh, is, is, this thing on?

199
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,900
Can you hear me in the back there?

200
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,800
Okay, it is the...

201
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,880
the verdict of the Supreme Court

202
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,180
that in view of the closeness

203
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,460
of the tallies of, of the votes

204
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,280
so far counted in the Florida race,

205
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,000
it is the verdict of this court

206
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,440
that because of the closeness

207
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,180
of the figures, the,

208
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,080
the will of the people would best

209
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,620
seemingly be served if

210
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,500
both candidates became president together.

211
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,020
Thank you.

212
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,920
Thank you.

213
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,500
No, no, no questions.

214
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,340
No questions.

215
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,540
I wasn't asking...

216
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,940
The theme of this year's inaugural is

217
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,960
We the People, an American Celebration.

218
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,480
This is the inaugural heritage.

219
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Let us also make this inaugural day

220
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,640
a day of prayer.

221
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,560
Events around the globe remind us

222
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,840
how lucky we are to live in a country

223
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,940
that has a tradition of

224
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,420
quarterly transition of political authority.

225
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,860
On Inauguration Day,

226
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,600
we all stand together as Americans.

227
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,160
With this historic pageant,

228
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,280
we celebrate the spirit of America.

229
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,200
We look back with thanks for the many blessings

230
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,100
we enjoy as a nation

231
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,960
and forward to the sense of opportunity

232
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,660
and progress, rededicating ourselves

233
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,900
to building a free, more prosperous America

234
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,240
for generations to come.

235
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,360
God bless you and God bless America.

236
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,360
Oh, God, this is politics the way I love it.

237
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,480
Oh, yeah, I always imagined

238
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,740
wouldn't it be wonderful if both sides could lose?

239
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,560
But here I got my wish.

240
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,580
Oh, jeez.

241
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,760
Just a minute, just a minute.

242
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,000
What fresh hell is this?

243
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,140
Oh, damn.

244
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,340
Hello?

245
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,160
Yes, this is Reverend Susie the Floozy.

246
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,260
Who wants to know?

247
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,920
Ah, doll!

248
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes, sir!

249
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,560
Standing at attention, sir.

250
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,420
Yes, sir, I'm doing a show right now.

251
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,100
And in one short hour,

252
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,360
I assure you that thanks to my efforts

253
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,820
chipping away at the foundations of this country,

254
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,740
our mad dreams of global conquest will be realized.

255
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,720
What?

256
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,880
No!

257
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,160
When did this get changed?

258
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,200
I thought I knew the church's agenda.

259
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,140
Oh, yeah.

260
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,260
Oh, sir, I'm so sorry I missed that meeting.

261
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,080
Yes, the collapse of America

262
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,840
would be quite the sticky wicket in your plans, sir.

263
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,820
I didn't realize the church owned so much of this country.

264
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,660
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

265
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,740
I assure you I will not liquidate your assets

266
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,180
until I get word from Control, but...

267
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,100
But that leaves me hanging for tonight's show.

268
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,700
Oh.

269
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,640
Oh, no, I...

270
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,560
I couldn't possibly do that.

271
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,820
A pro-America show?

272
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,340
Ah.

273
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,140
Well, actually, I have kind of blown my wad on this part, now.

274
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,580
And I do have a pretty good rerun that I could spring on them and...

275
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,860
It's not like they know what's going on, right?

276
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,600
Yes, sir.

277
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,280
Yes, sir.

278
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,280
Oh, you and me both, sir.

279
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,460
Yes, sir.

280
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,160
No, sir.

281
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,760
No.

282
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,380
Yes.

283
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:35,820
No.

284
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,680
No.

285
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:36,920
Yeah.

286
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,000
Oh, yes.

287
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,020
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, oh, oh, oh, no!

288
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,420
Oh, I hate this job.

289
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,220
And I was tired of sitting around and thanking God for our freedoms that we have in America

290
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,120
and have one woman with her group going around plucking away the foundation of this nation

291
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,620
under God.

292
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,380
And I no longer sat back and said, let her do what she wants to do.

293
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,660
I'm going to stay in the closet and pray.

294
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,340
I got out of the closet, moved into the living room.

295
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,280
I got the lead out and let the Lord in and started moving in there like a man of God

296
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,000
is supposed to move.

297
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,120
Oh, my God.

298
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


299
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


300
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


301
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


302
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


303
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


304
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


305
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


306
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


307
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


308
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


309
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


310
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,720
Oh, just put a cork in it.

311
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,660
Let me see if I can tune in this old Americana show.

312
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,060
Oh, yes.

313
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,660
You know, I've been doing this show for quite some time now.

314
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,420
I've been saying and playing some pretty outrageous things.

315
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,660
And, you know, I guess I've been taking that right for granted.

316
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,600
Well, the other day, I got to thinking about how lucky I was that I live in a great country

317
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,540
like the United States of America.

318
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,100
Because in any other country, I'm not going to be able to do that.

319
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,100


320
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,100


321
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,100


322
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,100


323
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,100


324
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,100


325
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,100


326
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,100


327
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,240
I'm going to need to make a good decision.

328
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,580
And in any other country, I would have been dragged out into the streets and clubbed like

329
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,900
a baby seal a long time ago.

330
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:55,560
So I just wanted to take this opportunity to pause a second and reflect on the values

331
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:01,240
of this great country of ours, a country that is tolerant enough to just snort and grumble

332
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,380
and turn the other way when a frightening little bimbo like me takes to our nation's

333
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,520
airwaves just to have Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July all rolled into one.

334
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,100
And just in time, I get to be like, wow, this is a bit of a surprise.

335
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,100


336
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,100


337
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,100


338
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,000
and Miss President's Day, too.

339
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,660
Because America is too big to ignore.

340
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,780
When I look out across this great land,

341
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,460
I can only see a little bit of it,

342
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,760
so it must be really, really big.

343
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,180
I mean, America is even bigger than Texas.

344
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,480
Yes, yes, in America, size does matter.

345
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,060
And tonight, I've got a real American-sized show

346
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,880
that will hog the highway like a Buick Roadmaster.

347
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,460
So in honor of the country that gave us Uncle Sam's cereal,

348
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,060
a natural laxative,

349
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,220
I dedicate tonight's special Americana Spectacular.

It's a vacuum of the soul.

358
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,500
A void into which millions of Americans are pouring alcohol, drugs, illicit sex, and religious occultism.

359
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,180
Our youth are perishing in an orgy, a quest.

360
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,840
They want the older generation to tell it like it is.

361
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,760
They have questions they're asking, the ultimate questions of life.

362
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,780
Why am I here?

363
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,000
Where did I come from? Where am I going? What's the meaning of life?

364
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,960
Stay away from mindy places.

365
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,540
And value the ability to make your mind a blank.

366
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,000
That's what gave America the urge and surge of the age of the past.

367
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,780
But my friends, let us be very, very careful that our very virtues, our good Christian virtues,

368
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,460
render us vulnerable to the enemy today.

369
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,300
Because as you know, we are up against the greatest crowd of cheats,

370
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,200
rogues, blackguards, liars, backstabbers, blackmailers this world has ever known.

371
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,020
And as my friend, Hubert says, masters of deceit,

372
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,320
we're up against an enemy who believes that might is right,

373
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,720
that the end justifies the means,

374
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,940
that the only language they understand is the language of force and strength.

375
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,980
Everything that we hold sacred and dear,

376
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,440
everything that we fight to instill,

377
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,040
to our children and our fathers instilled into us,

378
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,640
the enemy holds despised.

379
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,180
We're here to take you on a journey

380
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,640
through one of the most incredible countries on earth,

381
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,040
the United States of America.

382
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,600
And you know, it's my home.

383
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,740
America!

384
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,700
The land where dreams can come true.

385
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,040
America!

386
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,400
It was founded on God.

387
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,520
America!

388
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,040
America!

389
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,000
Gave us apple pie and hot dogs.

390
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,040
America!

391
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,160
Where we can work, think,

392
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,880
love, pray,

393
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,600
speak, disagree,

394
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,420
all without fear.

395
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,760
America!

396
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,200
Land of opportunity for everyone.

397
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,100
America!

398
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,380
The home of the red, white, and blue.

399
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,380
America!

400
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,400
It's the land of the free.

401
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,300
America!

402
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,140
It's all kinds of people.

403
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,820
America!

404
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,420
America!

405
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,180
It's my home.

406
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,220
America!

407
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,220


408
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,120
If any of you are still searching for a good reason

409
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,080
why you're being called to pray for America,

410
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,440
listen to Pat Burns.

411
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,180
And of course, my story can be multiplied

412
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,540
millions and millions of times.

413
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,400
I know that in America,

414
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,000
there are people whose dreams haven't come true.

415
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,140
But there's the opportunity here

416
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,300
that they can.

417
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:11,480
So the great American dream has become a hideous American nightmare.

418
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,580
Divorce rates in the U.S. are now the highest in the world.

419
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,520
Five out of nine marriages, 55%, end in divorce.

420
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,280
Abortion was legalized in 1970.

421
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,000
During that year, 193,000 abortions were performed.

422
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,980
In 1979, there were over 1,300,000 abortions.

423
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,260
70,000 teachers are attacked each year in public schools.

424
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,540
And families cost the taxpayers $500 million every year.

425
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,920
There are 1,200 new alcoholics every day.

426
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,280
1,300,000 young people between 12 and 17 years of age.

427
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,460
have a serious drinking problem.

428
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,700
It is estimated that 43 million Americans have experimented with marijuana.

429
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,080
10 million U.S. citizens have tried cocaine.

430
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,420
In 1960, there were 55,000 heroin addicts in America.

431
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,440
Now there are over 500,000.

432
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,500
In the past 10 years, violent crimes have increased 174% in America.

433
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,280
In the last 10 years, the number of drug addicts has increased by over 1,000.

434
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,280


435
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,280


436
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,280


437
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,540
At their conference in Chicago, the National Lesbian Leaders

438
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,440
called for 500,000 test-tube babies to lesbian mothers over the next four years.

439
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,560
Thank goodness my eyes are still clear enough to see miracles.

440
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,760
An America full of miracles.

441
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,740
And never you forget that.

442
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,880
That this is the land where miraculous things can happen to a man as in no other land.

443
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,720
A nation laden with sins.

444
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,620
Verse 5.

445
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,080
3. A nation which hath glorified herself and lived deliciously.

446
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,280
Verse 5.

447
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,280


448
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,280
That's us.

449
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,000
We spend $173 billion annually for food, alcohol, tobacco, recreation, and gambling.

450
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,160
This is living high.

451
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,160
Unbelonged.

452
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,900
Well, it will not last forever.

453
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,280
America's decapitation and destruction may come in jet-speed fashion.

454
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,120
That is what the communist is trying to do today.

455
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,640
He's trying to make us forget.

456
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,840
Now, my friends, resolution 2 is this.

457
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,320
That we stop downgrading the United States.

458
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,020
We stop considering how well or how badly we stand in the eyes of neutrals.

459
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,640
We stop apologizing for America.

460
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,140
Because I've traveled the world.

461
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,760
I've seen a good deal in my lifetime.

462
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,280
And I'm convinced that we have nothing to lose.

463
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,980
Nothing really to apologize to as a people.

464
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,060
All things being relative.

465
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,900
I think instead we should feel proud.

466
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,980
Desperately proud.

467
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,120
That it is this young republic of ours.

468
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,160
This child of our nation.

469
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,520
That is today the arsenal of democracy.

470
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,900
And has for many years been.

471
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,840
We are the safe depository of the vital deeds of human dignity and freedom.

472
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,380
We are the only nation on the face of the earth.

473
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,540
And in the history of mankind.

474
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,740
That has ever.

475
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,840
Has not only taxed itself voluntarily to help its former friends.

476
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,060
But taxed itself to put back into business its old enemies.

477
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,520
This is the only land.

478
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,160
A failed.

479
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,640
To face people on the face of the earth today.

480
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,040
That has never had any taste.

481
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:08,720
Of colonialism.

482
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,780
This is the only land that I see as the most founded land on the earth.

483
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,100
This is the land of opportunity.

484
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,820
This is the land of heart and mind.

485
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,940
That's what America is.

486
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,520
What is an American anyway?

487
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:26,880
Well.

488
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,600
He yells for the government to balance the budget.

489
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,520
Then takes his last dime to make him a down payment on his car.

490
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,100
He whips the enemy nations.

491
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,560
Then gives them the shirt off his back.

492
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,040
He yells for speed laws.

493
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,600
And stop fast driving.

494
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,580
And then won't buy a car unless it'll make a hundred miles an hour.

495
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,380
He gets scared to death if we vote a billion dollars for education.

496
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,920
But he's cool as a cucumber when he finds out we're spending three billion dollars a year on tobacco.

497
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,200
He gripes about the high price of the things he has to buy.

498
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,280
Gripes still more about the low price of things he has to buy.

499
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,960
Gripes still more about the low price of the things he has to sell.

500
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,020
He'll get mad at his wife for not running their home with the efficiency of a hotel.

501
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,100
Then get mad at the hotel for not operating like a home.

502
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,600
He'll spend half a day looking for vitamin pills to make him live longer.

503
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,560
Then drive ninety miles an hour on slick pavement to make up for time lost.

504
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,620
He'll fall out with his wife over her cooking.

505
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:34,640
Then go on a fishing trip and swallow half fried potatoes, burnt fish, and gritty creek water coffee.

506
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,260
Made with a little bit of sugar.

507
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,480
Then eat in a rusty bucket and think it's good.

508
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,740
He'll work hard on the farm so he can move into town so he can make money so he can move back on the farm.

509
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,160
He's the only fellow in the world who'll pay fifty cents to Park while he eats a twenty-five cent sandwich.

510
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,280
He likes to cuss his government but gets fightin' mad if somebody else does it.

511
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,700
We're the folks that have more food to eat than any other place in the world.

512
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,640
And more dives to keep us from eatin' it.

513
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,240
We're the most ambitious people in the world.

514
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:12,080
We run from morning till night to keep our earning power up with our yearning power.

515
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:19,640
We're supposed to be the most Christian nation on earth but still can't deliver a payroll without an arm of God.

516
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,620
But we're pretty nice folks.

517
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:31,760
Calling a citizen of the United States a real American is the best compliment you can pay him.

518
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,940
I believe God's smile will support America because there's more humbling Christians.

519
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,760
We made another discovery.

520
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,580
We discovered that we really didn't need God after all.

521
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,220
Times of repentance, fasting and prayer, reliance on an almighty God like our forefathers.

522
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,220
You've gotta be kidding.

523
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,000
God? Who needs you?

524
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,820
It says save for a remnant.

525
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,600
You would have been a Sodom and Gomorrah.

526
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,980
I come back to that same scripture saying there's a remnant still in America.

527
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,240
That's still bloody good.

528
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,240


529
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,040
They're still under the blood. They're still living for Jesus. They're still right with God.

530
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,760
What a blessing that has come to this sixth thing.

531
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,880
The friends of America.

532
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,840
Oh, I like that. I'm glad we got some friends.

533
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,760
I believe the best folks in this country are Christians, don't you?

534
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,960
And I believe every funny little Christian's a friend of America.

535
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,980
And I don't think you gotta agree with that.

536
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,960
I don't believe in everything in this land.

537
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,920
The USA alone meets the requirements.

538
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,160
She seems to be the political Babylon of the hour.

539
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,560
Millions of Americans have lustily echoed this refrain and petition down through the annals of our history.

540
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,660
Is decline already visible in America?

541
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,140
Definitely.

542
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,600
We, like other civilizations, allowed atheists, agnostics, skeptics, and weirdos to set our standards.

543
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,220
PhDs told our college students that there was no creation by an almighty God.

544
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,660
Instead, a lot of monkey business took place.

545
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,560
These irresponsible, irreligious, God-deniers never found the missing link of their evolutionary hypothesis

546
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,140
and never scientifically proved their allegations.

547
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,000
America has never been in such a state of degradation and hopelessness.

548
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,520
Truly, America is laden or loaded with iniquity.

549
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,720
The pollution inundating our land centers around one.

550
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,820
Drunkenness, or culturally identified as alcoholism.

551
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,560
Ten billion inebriates drink themselves into insensibility on a continual basis

552
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,780
while millions more spend billions on booze.

553
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,480
And two. Drug addiction, which mars and scars another ten million in our nation.

554
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,960
Three. Tobacco, which pollutes both lungs and land to the tune of ten billion dollars per year.

555
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,680
Four. Gamma, which robs needy millions through governmental control lotteries

556
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,560
and mafia-dominated casinos to the amount of sixty billion dollars each year.

557
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,700
Five. Prostitution and pimping, which spreads disease and shame to nine million Americans.

558
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:43,040
Six. Homosexuality, which seeks to arrogantly, egotistically, blatantly, and publicly boast about its perverted membership.

559
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,320
In anger, they desire to come out of the closet.

560
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,400
Well, the closet is a good place to practice sex!

561
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,760
It's good enough for the married and the privacy of the closet.

562
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,320
Why should homos receive special privileges to proclaim their perversity?

563
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,680
We will not have to at all.

564
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,500
She will fall into our hands like overripe fruit.

565
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,680
The plan is presently in its final stages.

566
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,680
In spite of it, Americans are so duped and deceived that tomorrow's concentration camps will be destroyed.

567
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:02,680


568
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:02,680


569
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,120
The information could ruin one's pleasurable pursuits.

570
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,860
It could affect one's golf score, batting average, or amusement schedule.

571
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:16,220
The rotted overripe fruit, the symbol of leisure mad Americans, is beginning to fall, and the end may be imminent.

572
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,480
Today, a devastating atomic attack could obliterate everything a nation took two centuries to build in one hour's time.

573
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,320
If God has America in mind, and it certainly looks that way, then what?

574
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Are you prepared for the judgment that may soon hit our nation like a bowl of lightning?

575
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,620
The country's in the very best of hands.

576
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:32,660
The country's in the very best of hands.

577
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,120
The best of hands.

578
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,120
The best of hands.

579
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,500
Thus do the members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States

580
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:51,520
accent the positive and rebuff the frowsy, self-praised revolutionists

581
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,820
who are determined to defy all law and order, strangle America,

582
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,400
and then deliver freedom's corpse to their communist grandfathers

583
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,360
who long have boasted,

584
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,560
We will bury you.

585
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,800
There are those, a minority, but still too many,

586
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,340
who would like to place the American system on trial.

587
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,840
America, what's happened to the parenthood of this nation?

588
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,060
Let's come to the fifth thing about America I showed you first.

589
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,000
The founders, the freedoms, the fruit, the polish, has come to the foes of America.

590
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
We got enemies, friends. They want to tear us down.

591
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,980
We got enemies. They'll work it night and day against this nation.

592
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,120
They hate that statue. They hate that old flag.

593
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,200
The defilement of the nation has reached such lascivious stages

594
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,580
that 30,000 Los Angeles children have been used for kiddie pornography,

595
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,000
according to the Associated Press.

596
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:49,080
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America

597
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:58,040
and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible,

598
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,160
with liberty and justice for all.

599
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,100
Fire!

600
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:03,540


601
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,420
Death on the highway, a pack a day, cheating from the top to the bottom in society.

602
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,360
Get rich quick, break up the family, altering and foreign policies, reckless debt.

603
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,780
These have destroyed nations before us.

604
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,860
Well, despite all hatreds tried to do, the fears of a hopeless situation confronts America,

605
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,560
because judgment is coming upon all nations.

606
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,380
In America today, one-fourth of the people are living off of the income.

607
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:31,380


608
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,980
The other three-fourths, completely or partially.

609
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,580
Of course, how can this nation ever forget the start of today's parade

610
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,520
as the Ellenborough Float made its way down Pennsylvania Avenue?

611
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,320
Barbara, I know for you there were many moving moments.

612
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,060
You were part of the alliteration.

613
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,800
Perhaps you'd care to describe one or two of them to our viewers.

614
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,020
Well, the strangling of the bald eagle was it for me.

615
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,060
It was thrilling, and of course the effigy burning.

616
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,420
And now here's a contingent of our heroic POWs,

617
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,360
many of whom spent years in prison in Hanoi, California,

618
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:01,360


619
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,320
courageously resisting the persistent efforts of their North Vietnamese captors

620
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,560
to brainwash them into thinking that the United States is run by a tiny clique of criminals

621
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,920
dominated by powerful business interests,

622
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,280
bankrolled by huge monopolistic corporations,

623
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,140
and working hand-in-glove with the CIA in a campaign of intrigue at home and abroad.

624
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,000
Jesus, why do they bother?

625
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,100
Oh, I don't know, Barbara.

626
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,700
Let us stop this character assassination which disunifies us.

627
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,940
Let us stop running the country down.

628
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,600
What we need is a Patriot Party, a Booster Party,

629
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,500
an American First Party.

630
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:41,980
I hear people talking bad about the way they have to live here in this country

631
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,160
Harping on the wars we fight, griping about the way things ought to be

632
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,160
I don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things that they believe in

633
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,580
But when they're running down our country,

634
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,340
man, they're walking on the fighting side of me

635
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,220
They're walking on the fighting side of me

636
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:16,640
Running down a way of life by fighting men I fought and died to keep

637
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,860
If you don't love it, leave it, let the song that I'm singing be won

638
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:30,560
When you're running down our country, hoss, you're walking on the fighting side of me

639
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,960
Hey, Jeannie C. Reilly, your singing and your country both suck!

640
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,000
Ha ha, microphone, Earl!

641
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:48,940
I read about some squirrely guy who claims that he just don't believe in fighting

642
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:56,120
I wonder just how long the rest of us can count on being free

643
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,540
They love our milk and honey and we love our food and drink, but they don't care about us.

644
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,820
And yet they preach about some other way of living

645
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:11,220
And when they're running down our country, man, they're walking on the fighting side of me

646
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,280
They're walking on the fighting side of me

647
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,740
Running down a way of life by fighting men I fought and died to keep

648
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:30,520
If you don't love it, leave it, let the song that I'm singing be won

649
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:38,760
When you're running down our country, hoss, you're walking on the fighting side of me

650
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:46,260
The Congress, the presidency, the flag, the home, the educational system, and even the church!

651
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:53,120
But we are here to say with loud voices that in spite of their faults and failures, we believe in these institutions.

652
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,280
America needs to sing again!

653
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,300
America needs to celebrate again!

654
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,660
America needs to wave the flag again!

655
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,480
Problems cannot be solved, he said, by waving the American flag.

656
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,840
In simple eloquence, that sums up the spirit of Honor America Day and of what you're about to hear.

657
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,300
First, the voice of Pat Boone.

658
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,940
Friends, this song was written at a crossroads time, a time of crisis in our nation's history.

659
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,320
For over 150 years, it's helped unite Americans.

660
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:30,500
For over 150 years, it's helped unite Americans.

661
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:36,200
As we stand today at a crossroads and in a crisis time, let's all sing this song with love and conviction.

662
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:51,560
Oh, say can you see

663
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,320
By the dawn's early light

664
00:36:59,320 --> 00:36:59,960
Oh, wow!

665
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:06,040
What so proudly we hailed

666
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:13,200
By the twilight's last gleaming

667
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,760
By the dawn's early light

668
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,880
Oh, say can you see

669
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,940
By the dawn's early light

670
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,040
What so proudly we hailed

671
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,560
By the dawn's early light

672
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,180
What so proudly we hailed

673
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,180
By the dawn's early light

674
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,160
What so proudly we hailed

675
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,400
By the twilight's last gleaming

676
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,040
What so proudly we hailed

677
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,360
By the dawn's early light

678
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,100
What so proudly we hailed

679
00:37:54,100 --> 00:38:13,160
By the dawn's early light

680
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:20,620
occasion and so we felt that tonight we should at least clear up this problem so that it's not

681
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:25,580
just a humorous interview it can be effective for dancing and so forth we're going to play

682
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,740
the stars and stripes forever

683
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:33,700
oh hey clues at this point you better wake up and turn the tape over

684
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:46,340
oh yeah that's right oh yeah the guy that plays stars and stripes forever on his hands not his

685
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:55,600
armpits mind you his hands he was right on the crack of the old show and yeah maybe i put a

686
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,260
background music on him i shouldn't have but that's what these retrospectives are all about

687
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,620
and yeah once i start

688
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:10,700
going on in my next rant you're going to be able to tell that this was done back in 1997

689
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:21,020
yeah i think i said 1979 or something i don't know it's 97 it was a year and a half before

690
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,540
before x day

691
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,140
but enough about lost hopes

692
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,580
we're going to play the stars and stripes

693
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:33,860
forever

694
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,760
all right

695
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,780
um

696
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,500
um

697
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,260
all right

698
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,460
all right

699
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,620
all right

700
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,840
Thank you.

701
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,740
Thank you.

702
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,080
Thank you.

703
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,040
Thank you.

704
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,880
Thank you for that quality entertainment.

705
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,960
Entertainment on WREK Atlanta.

706
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,080
Woo.

707
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,580
First thing on my list of things to do

708
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:44,400
is to separate their church from our state with a crowbar.

709
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,080
Hoo.

710
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,420
Oh, but let's explore our great American heritage, seekers.

711
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,400
Although it might bore you to tears,

712
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,280
I was born with a different perspective

713
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,560
thanks to the fact that my mother was a British citizen all of her life.

714
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,860
Having a mother who had to work for me

715
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,560
and who registers an alien every year

716
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,320
kind of does things terribly.

717
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,980
Some genius things.

718
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,320
And it gave me a unique outsider's eye view of everything around me.

719
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,500
Oh, I don't think you full-fledged Americans

720
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,180
really appreciate what you've got going for you here.

721
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,380
Look at it this way.

722
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,640
If my mom had stayed in Wales,

723
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,900
today, March 1st,

724
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,820
I would be celebrating St. David's Day

725
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,840
by walking around all day long,

726
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,780
with a leak pinned to my lapel.

727
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,800
That's right, a leak.

728
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,320
Those big, smelly onion things

729
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,380
that produce violent intestinal gases when consumed.

730
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,460
I mean, what kind of a sorry, suck-ass tradition is that?

731
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,780
Oh, don't ask me why they do it,

732
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,980
but escaping a national heritage like that

733
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,300
makes me breathe a big sigh of relief.

734
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,080
Thankfully, I'm tainted with the infernal reek of onion.

735
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,520
Oh, but you Americans,

736
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,980
have quaint, charming customs.

737
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,060
Well, such as a recent three-day weekend

738
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,700
when you celebrated the Siamese births of George Washington,

739
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,200
the inventor of the one-dollar bill,

740
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:19,160
and Abe Lincoln, the, uh, Lincoln Logs heiress or whatever.

741
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,200
Oh, you Yanks really have it made.

742
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,920
I mean, you had cool presidents like Jack Kennedy.

743
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,920
Look what the Brits are stuck with.

744
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,680
Oh, God, don't get me started on the royal family.

745
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,700
Oh, yes.

746
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,700
National pride, just short of fascism, of course,

747
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,900
is a nice thing.

748
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,780
But there's a right way and a wrong way to go about it.

749
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,340
If Americanism falls into the hands of the wrong people,

750
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,340
it's frightening.

751
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,800
On one end of the spectrum,

752
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,300
you have the religio-malicious right

753
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,500
and the rest of all those star-spangled boners.

754
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,280
Oh, but on the other end,

755
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,760
you wind up with things like,

756
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,160
that Omega glory episode of Star Trek.

757
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,660
La lista.

758
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,160
Ooh.

759
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,820
Oh, everybody's missing the point.

760
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,340
It's not just rabid, mindless jingoism

761
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,460
peppered with awkward catchphrases.

762
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:21,300
The Church of the Subgenius is walking that alley

763
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,000
and we sure don't want the competition.

764
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,360
Oh, but, hell,

765
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,300
even I don't know what the point is.

766
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,160
I just know what I think.

767
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,140
I think.

768
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,760
And, well, yeah, I think it's time for the subgeniuses

769
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,260
to take back America,

770
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,520
to enjoy it as fully as we can

771
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,940
in this short year and a half left to us.

772
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,220
Oh, and some of the inbred right-wing pinks around here

773
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,900
just ain't getting with the program.

774
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,720
Oh, this latest rash of bombings and killings

775
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,860
in our local mutant-friendly community

776
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,280
is really starting to piss me off.

777
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,820
Oh, and it's...

778
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,700
It's not that the flues is turning into an old softie.

779
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,340
All of them are to me, why?

780
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,300
It's...

781
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,360
It's just that I don't want anything

782
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,620
stealing the thunder from the exes

783
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,820
when they come roaring through this transphere.

784
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,000
I want them to have as pristine and tranquil a planet

785
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,300
as possible to trash.

786
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,000
Keith Moon didn't work with messed-up hotel rooms.

787
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,860
I want this planet kept so clean that you could eat off it,

788
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,440
which is exactly what we'll be doing,

789
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,340
come 1998.

790
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,060
Oh, but until then,

791
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,000
let's give the exes' hordes a nice, clean canvas

792
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,360
to work with, okay?

793
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,880
Well, now, let's just take a peek

794
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,860
at the rich tapestry of the Earth's history,

795
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,280
shall we, Seekers?

796
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,520
We often manage to forget just what started the whole thing,

797
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:01,780
I think.

798
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:01,880
I don't know.

799
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,420
I don't know.

800
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:02,420


801
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:02,420


802
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:02,420


803
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:02,420


804
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:02,420


805
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:02,420


806
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:02,420


807
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:02,640
I don't know.

808
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,340
And the real significance of July 4th.

809
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,680
Any red-blooded flag-feeding American would love

810
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,740
the M3 20.

811
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,680
Celebrate the independence of your nation

812
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,820
by blowing up a small part of it.

813
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,480
All right.

814
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,240
Wake up, America.

815
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,360
Why, I remember when 13 states was all I had to my name.

816
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,500
I want to give you seven things about America,

817
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,280
and this is called in country they matched,

818
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,780
the founders of America.

819
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,720
But if you know the founders of Israel

820
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,040
were not a bunch of lazy, good-for-nothing,

821
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,080
woodwork-out people.

822
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,400
The founders of this country

823
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,320
wasn't a bunch of rebels

824
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,820
and a bunch of subversives

825
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,180
trying to turn down everything.

826
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,780
They came to the place

827
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,680
where they could serve God and have liberty.

828
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,560
And they came in three words.

829
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,700
In what we just said,

830
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,960
they knelt down in the snow.

831
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,640
We hold these truths to be self-evident.

832
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,300
We hold these truths to be self-evident.

833
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,220
We hold these truths to be self-evident.

834
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,080
That all men are created equal.

835
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,320
That all men are created equal.

836
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

837
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,000
Hey, hey, hey.

838
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,500
Look, everybody.

839
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,240
John Hancock's writing his name in the snow.

840
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,240
As our founding fathers left us something,

841
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,980
we're to leave something for the next generation.

842
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,640
But we're leaving something for somebody

843
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,520
that will follow in our footsteps.

844
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,600
Stand right here, adventurer,

845
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,940
and keep a sharp eye.

846
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,480
Tell Paul Revere the signal is two if by sea.

847
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:20,920
Hey, father,

848
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,680
you're right, adventurer.

849
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,520
I see it.

850
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,080
The British are coming by sea.

851
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,440
My trusty horse is saddled and ready to ride.

852
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,380
Hop up here on my horse behind me.

853
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,200
Hop up, adventurer.

854
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,200
I need you to help me warn the countryside.

855
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,240
We'll ride the route to Lexington.

856
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,440
Get up there.

857
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,860
Hang on, adventurer,

858
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,860
and do everything that Paul Revere says.

859
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,840
And first stop will be at the house on Cobble Hill.

860
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,640
The man who lives there is ready to fight at a minute's notice.

861
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,220
That's why he's called a minute man.

862
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,880
And as soon as we get forward,

863
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,260
you jump down on the horse,

864
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,780
run up,

865
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,620
and pound on the door.

866
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,820
And when somebody answers,

867
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,100
yell out good and loud,

868
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,120
the British are coming.

869
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,140
Then come right back up on the horse,

870
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:55,940
and we'll be off again.

871
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,380
Do you understand that, adventurer?

872
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,140
Oh, sure.

873
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,340
Here's the house on Cobble Hill.

874
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,720
Get ready to jump off.

875
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:01,700
Jump.

876
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:02,360
Ow!

877
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,880
Oh, damn!

878
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,180
What's the matter down there?

879
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,520
Sarah, hand me the rifle.

880
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,380
Thank you for warning me.

881
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,380
Right on, adventurer.

882
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,120
God bless Vespucci land.

883
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,660
Oh, by the way,

884
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,840
Domini, Domini, Domini,

885
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,160
you're all Catholics now.

886
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,420
God bless you.

887
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,160
Oh, Father,

888
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,980
nobody in the world

889
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,400
has a right mind

890
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,920
to believe in this thing you tell us.

891
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:34,600
Come on, Cisco.

892
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:36,960
1796.

893
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,600
A fiercely determined band of pioneers

894
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,560
leaves Maryland

895
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,900
after misinterpreting

896
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,280
a passage in the Bible.

897
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,520
Their destination,

898
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,960
New Sodom.

899
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,060
My fellow settlers,

900
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,800
we stand here

901
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,360
at the edge of civilization

902
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,440
on the banks of the Mississippi River,

903
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:56,920
looking west

904
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,620
at our destiny.

905
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:00,740
What may appear

906
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,960
to the faint-hearted,

907
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,740
as a limitless expanse

908
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,180
of God-forsaken wilderness,

909
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,160
is in reality

910
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,840
a golden opportunity

911
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,060
for humble,

912
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,720
God-fearing people

913
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,800
like ourselves

914
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,260
and our families

915
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,380
and our children

916
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,800
and the generations

917
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,580
a-comin'

918
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,940
to carve a new life

919
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,040
out of the American Indian.

920
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,820
Welcome, white brother.

921
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,020
Engines!

922
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,620
Pull the wagons

923
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,540
up into a circle!

924
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,480
Why do you always do that?

925
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,620
We get better reception

926
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,040
that way.

927
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,540
Do you mind if I put this antenna

928
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,380
up on yonder peak?

929
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,640
That's our sacred mountain.

930
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,920
This is our sacred antenna.

931
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,560
It's shaped like a cross,

932
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,600
made out of aluminum.

933
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,220
Got any aluminum?

934
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,940
We've still got some corn left.

935
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,580
Hey, corn!

936
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,740
Now we can make whiskey!

937
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,280
We've been waiting

938
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,440
hundreds of years for this!

939
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,040
Invented at Tom Collins.

940
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,540
Here, engine,

941
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,540
you want some fire water?

942
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,060
No.

943
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,260
We were warned by our elders

944
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,140
not to drink anything

945
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,600
that would make us weak or silly.

946
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,440
Put it in their well.

947
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,000
That's not a well.

948
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,100
It's the eye

949
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,340
of the Holy Serpent Mound

950
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,120
on which you're standing.

951
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:02,900
It's a butte.

952
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,660
No, it's a mound.

953
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,860
And right pretty, too.

954
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:05,880
Can you move it?

955
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,840
But why?

956
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,340
Railroad's coming through.

957
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,640
Right now.

958
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,500
Civilization!

959
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,160
Help!

960
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,720
This is a line of Indians

961
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,660
leaving Rancho Malario

962
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,980
to make room for you.

963
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,740
Here's the beautiful

964
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,440
Trail of Tears golf course.

965
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,260
You all may have heard

966
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,100
how the Pilgrims landed

967
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,760
at Plymouth Rock.

968
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,900
You heard how the Pilgrims

969
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,960
pushed west to New Jersey.

970
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,280
Heard about the pioneers

971
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,060
who pushed south

972
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:37,720
to Miami Beach.

973
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,300
Well, this is a story

974
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,140
about Isaiah Smith,

975
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,520
the pioneer that led

976
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,520
a small band of settlers,

977
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:43,660
but unlike others,

978
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,520
he didn't push anyplace.

979
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,760
He just kind of stumbled

980
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,440
across the plains

981
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,360
and founded a town.

982
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,480
And when they got there,

983
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,380
the settlers asked,

984
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,320
where are we?

985
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,440
And Isaiah answered,

986
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:51,700
huh?

987
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,020
And so, huh?

988
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,100
USA was born.

989
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,660
And then the settlers asked,

990
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,200
Isaiah,

991
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,280
is there any Indians

992
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:57,760
around here?

993
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:58,960
And Isaiah answered,

994
00:50:59,080 --> 00:50:59,560
nope.

995
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,120
He was a man of few words.

996
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:01,820
He was right.

997
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,400
There wasn't a single Indian there.

998
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,500
They were all married

999
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:04,980
and had children.

1000
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,140
On May 21, 1864,

1001
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,220
the men of the 9th

1002
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,180
Bearded Infantry

1003
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,140
were sunning

1004
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,680
and fluffing their beards

1005
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,120
in the sun.

1006
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,120
Suddenly,

1007
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,200
enemy troops

1008
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,480
crested that hill

1009
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,460
over there.

1010
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,840
Fort Springfield,

1011
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:20,820
we surrender

1012
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,120
unconditionally.

1013
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,200
We're sick.

1014
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,540
We need leeches

1015
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,620
and hacksaws

1016
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,340
to saw off

1017
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,600
our gangrenous limbs.

1018
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,320
But the Springfield Brigade

1019
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,320
was too brave

1020
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,120
to accept

1021
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:31,740
and surrender.

1022
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,000
Come on, boys.

1023
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,260
Those white flags

1024
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:34,920
are no match

1025
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
for our muskets.

1026
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:36,740
Charge!

1027
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,920
And the Springfielders

1028
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,180
heroically slaughtered

1029
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:40,660
their enemies

1030
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,800
as they prayed

1031
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,480
for mercy.

1032
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,820
We begin with a tribute

1033
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,760
to our lesser-known presidents.

1034
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,620
We are the

1035
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,940
younger presidents.

1036
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,380
You won't find our faces

1037
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,240
in the light.

1038
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:01,820
Boys or insects.

1039
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:02,980
There's Taylor.

1040
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:03,820
There's Tyler.

1041
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:04,720
There's Gilmore.

1042
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,640
And there's Hayes.

1043
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,320
There's William Henry Harrison.

1044
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,800
I died in 30 days.

1045
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,280
We are the adequate,

1046
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,020
forgettable,

1047
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,260
occasionally regrettable.

1048
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,480
Can't take your presidents

1049
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,200
off the U.S.A.

1050
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:24,600
Hey!

1051
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:28,880
Boom.

1052
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:29,600
Boom.

1053
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,200
Boom.

1054
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,340
Boom.

1055
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:31,340


1056
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:31,340


1057
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:31,340


1058
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:31,340


1059
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:31,340


1060
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:31,340


1061
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:31,340


1062
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:31,340


1063
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:31,340


1064
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,240
Check out this president.

1065
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,520
Oh, you're not a butt.

1066
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,080
But do you want to play

1067
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,900
John Wilkes Booth

1068
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,700
or do you want to act

1069
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,260
like a maniac?

1070
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,360
I'll be good.

1071
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,040
To the illusion.

1072
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,420
To the plurality.

1073
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,800
To the plurality.

1074
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,960
To which it stands.

1075
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,160
To which it stands.

1076
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:50,980
One species.

1077
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,340
One species.

1078
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,580
One nation.

1079
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,580
One nation.

1080
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,640
In denial.

1081
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,780
In denial.

1082
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:57,740
With error.

1083
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,040
With error.

1084
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,940
And excess.

1085
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:00,920
And excess.

1086
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:01,840
By all.

1087
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,460
By all.

1088
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,780
Now lift your hand

1089
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,080
and go,

1090
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,260
that's the way you want it.

1091
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,220
And that's the way you want it.

1092
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,580
And none of us.

1093
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,600
And none of us.

1094
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,060
I'm kidding.

1095
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:10,820
You're all in the church.

1096
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,280
I'll be.

1097
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,460
Once upon a time

1098
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,980
people cared about being free.

1099
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,100
Turned from the establishment

1100
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,260
to keep loving all of me.

1101
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,060
But,

1102
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,300
we lost our revolution.

1103
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,480
Guess it wasn't meant to be.

1104
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,740
We never burnt down the system.

1105
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,640
Good thing,

1106
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,960
because the system's been good to me.

1107
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:46,220
The only peace I care about, man,

1108
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,480
is my peace of American power.

1109
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:52,240
The only protest I'll ever make

1110
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,200
is if I don't give my hand.

1111
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,680
Don't care much for politics.

1112
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,980
Not even,

1113
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,380
being free,

1114
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,220
don't wanna make more.

1115
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,900
Our love,

1116
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,320
just money.

1117
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,660
Ten or fifteen years ago,

1118
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,260
we fought with the pigs.

1119
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,680
And now they're called policemen.

1120
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,760
They protect all our lost things.

1121
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,920
Like our dear friend,

1122
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,200
Homer Cuthbert,

1123
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,920
another Richard Mann I know.

1124
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:30,180
Saying you can't take it with you,

1125
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,400
better get it before you go.

1126
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,800
The only peace I care about, man,

1127
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,940
is my peace of American power.

1128
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,840
The only protest I'll ever make

1129
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,780
is if I don't give my hand.

1130
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:50,200
Don't care much for politics.

1131
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,460
Not even,

1132
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,900
being free,

1133
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,660
don't wanna make more.

1134
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,360
Our love,

1135
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,900
just money.

1136
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,020
Geez,

1137
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,160
I'm so tired of this.

1138
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,160


1139
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,160


1140
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,160


1141
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,160


1142
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,200
Geez, you know, now that I look at it,

1143
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:07,800
it looks like our founding fathers were really just a bunch of slave diddling fat cats.

1144
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,620
Yeah, much like the politicians of today, now that I think of it.

1145
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,180
Hmm.

1146
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,380
Yeah, but still, their technique was interesting, wasn't it?

1147
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:25,520
A bunch of Europeans come over here and swipe the continent out from under the moccasin feet of its original tenants,

1148
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,660
with a whole lot of cheap trinkets and mumbo jumbo.

1149
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,340
And then they get them to sign it all away.

1150
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,660
And once they've golded this house of paper and legalese,

1151
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:41,000
they use the power of the written word to pin the native Americans up in blighted concentration camps.

1152
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,880
Going on and on through history.

1153
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,080
Hmm.

1154
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:51,040
But yeah, they didn't plan on fives for the region of the future, did they?

1155
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:56,480
Because now there are subgeniuses living in that little paper house that they wrote up.

1156
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,640
And maybe now the conspiracy has started.

1157
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:05,060
I'm starting to think that they made a big mistake when they let that Bill of Rights get published in so many places.

1158
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:11,140
Oh, but I'm picking up the cue from the con itself, and I'm taking their tactics.

1159
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:20,320
Tonight, as a precaution, bravely risking paper cuts, I've wrapped myself in the Constitution of the United States.

1160
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:28,060
Oh, but oh, seekers, it keeps getting draftier and draftier, so republicrats tear off whole chunks of it.

1161
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,120
Oh, here goes another amendment.

1162
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,740
I'd better rant while I can.

1163
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:37,400
Oh, as I was saying earlier, my mother was British,

1164
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,060
but I, Reverend Susie the Floozy, am an American.

1165
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:49,580
And as an American, I demand the rights and privileges that their revered legal documents say that I have.

1166
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,920
I demand my right to the happiness of pursuit!

1167
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,400
Or whatever.

1168
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,220
Because I am an American!

1169
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:05,880
the right to shout theater at a crowded fire because I am an American. I demand the right

1170
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,900
to drive around a parking lot for 15 minutes to find the perfect parking space so as not

1171
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:18,220
have to walk an extra 20 feet because I am an American. As an American, I am assured

1172
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:24,840
of freedom of religion, which therefore includes nude head launchings in a speeding motor vehicle

1173
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:31,320
and whatever unsavory interspecies sexual congress my performance of this ministry demands

1174
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:40,460
of me. And I can do that because I am an American. And as an American, I have the right to produce

1175
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:47,140
poisonous swill like this episode of Bob's Slapdown Funhouse. Yes, I have the right to

1176
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:54,660
defend the words of Billy Graham, Kate Smith, Richard Nixon, Minnie Pearl, Broadway's version

1177
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:01,900
of Lil Abner, Jack Van Impey, Jeannie C. Reilly, Bob Hope, Jimmy Stewart, Brother Maze Jackson,

1178
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:08,740
the Fireside Theater, a whole lot of the Simpsons, the Holy Ghost Players, the Church of the Last Laugh,

1179
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:15,880
Danger Woman, and a whole bunch of crazy, forgettable creatures. Oh, and I have the right to bend them

1180
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:21,840
into my own unique interpretation, not to mention what I did to Limp Mold's incredibly irritating

1181
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,060
national anthem. Yes!

1182
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:32,140
And I swear, as Bob is my witness, I'll never take my many freedoms for granted again, or

1183
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:38,560
let them go unexercised. After this show tonight, I'm going to go out and have a partial

1184
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:44,620
free abortion, and then go knock off a few drinks with my lesbian friends. And I can

1185
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:50,040
still do that, seekers, because I am an American!

1186
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,460
I am an American!

1187
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,740
I am an American!

1188
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:59,900
I am an American!

1189
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,180
I am an American!

1190
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,800
I am an American!

1191
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,480
I am an American!

1192
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,440
I am an American!

1193
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:15,980
I am an American!

1194
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:16,560
I am an American!

1195
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,120
I am an American!

1196
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:17,140
I am an American!

1197
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:17,220
I am an American!

1198
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,220


1199
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,220


1200
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,380
I am an American!

1201
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:17,500
I am an American!

1202
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:17,600
I am an American!

1203
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,820
I am an American!

1204
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,820
I am an American!

1205
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:44,540
But it will all come back and be there, friends,

1206
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,340
because you know where to go for free information.

1207
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:52,040
On the web, that's www.subgenius.com.

1208
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:58,560
Subgenius is one word and does not have an O in it for my fellow true subgeniuses.

1209
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,620
Or you can write to the sacred post office box in Dallas, Texas for free information.

1210
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:16,140
Friends, write Bob at post office box 140306 in Dallas, Texas 75214.

1211
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:21,740
Just because I live in Cleveland doesn't mean you don't have to send your news to Bob.

1212
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:22,880
In Dallas.

1213
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:29,640
But you can send your tapes to me, Stang, at post office box 181417.

1214
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,120
That's my new one.

1215
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:32,780
The old one's still good.

1216
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:38,320
But 181417, just for stuff going to me, tapes and art and stuff.

1217
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:46,460
And that's in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1218
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Praise Bob and hails Susie.

1219
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,180
And thank you.

1220
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,200
Thank you.
