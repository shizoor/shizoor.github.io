1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
Bob, would you help me, please?

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,400
Bob!

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,780
Bob, what do you mean, Bob?

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,380
The thing wasn't weird.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,680
Well, you pulled it too hard.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,720
Well, it's a good thing I don't believe in ghosts.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,080
Neither do I, but...

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,560
Let's get out of here anyway.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,220
Bob, who attended a party in the country last night and on the way home, took a detour.

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,960
Most of us on waking in the morning know exactly where we are.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:49,220
The rooster or the alarm clock brings us out of sleep into the familiar sights, sounds, aromas of home and the comfort of a routine day ahead.

12
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,520
Not so with our young friends.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,860
This will be a day like none they've ever spent.

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,560
And they'll spend it in the...

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,480
Some genius power.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,220
Roll the siren.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,580
Is this a test?

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,900
You're trying to find out how much of this we can take before we turn into blabbering idiots?

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,160
Honey, look, there's bound to be an explanation.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,060
What? What?

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,440
Uh, grass.

22
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,540
No.

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,980
Grass?

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,980
Just calm down.

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,480
Here.

26
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,820
Grass?

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,320
Grass.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,220
Grass?

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,260
Grass?

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,320
Grass?

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,280
Grass?

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,160
Grass?

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,100
Come on, get up now. Come on.

34
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,980
Uh...

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,220
Uh...

36
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,020
Uh...

37
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,780
Uh...

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, I knew you were swacked, but really...

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,840
Uh...

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,620
Uh...

41
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,860
Oh, boy.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,680
Oh, I didn't have that much...

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,120
Ah.

44
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,440
Hoo-hoo!

45
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,040
Where are we, Bob?

46
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,640
Where are we?

47
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,380
Where'd everybody go?

48
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,060
There isn't anybody.

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,860
Just us.

50
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,680
Oh, come on.

51
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,120
There isn't a person or a thing alive in this town.

52
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,540
There isn't a person or a thing alive in this town.

53
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,980
There isn't a person or a thing alive in this town.

54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,780
You just assembling an organism.

55
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:30,780


56
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:30,780


57
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,680
We're being watched.

58
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,900
No.

59
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,620
Now you're getting delusions.

60
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,120
Nothing in this town is real.

61
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,060
The house we slept in.

62
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,000
This child we can't find.

63
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,600
That squirrel...

64
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,080
stuffed with sawdust.

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,500
Show me one thing that's real.

66
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,600
Bob is real.

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,240
That's where they must be.

68
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,900
They're in church.

69
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,560
Maybe they're praying.

70
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,800
Was that a delusion?

71
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,140
Here's the church.

72
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
There's the steeple.

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,420
Open the door.

74
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,780
Open.

75
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,440
Is this some kind of a joke?

76
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,680
Is this some kind of a joke?

77
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,140
Church.

78
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,800
I don't get it.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,340
Bob, where are we?

80
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,200
I had hoped we were in

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,860
the self-genius

82
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,380
power of

83
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,540
the world.

84
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,860
Well, we're not.

85
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,880
I don't know what it is.

86
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,940
A trick, a joke.

87
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,420
I don't get it.

88
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,140
Nothing moving.

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Nothing real.

90
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,320
How did we get back there?

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,660
Why?

92
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,560
Why, this...

93
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,080
This isn't grass.

94
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,320
This is a...

95
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,400
It's a prop.

96
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,160
Maybe we're dead, Bob.

97
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,760
Maybe this place is hell.

98
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,460
I don't know.

99
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,140
I don't know.

100
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,600
I don't know.

101
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:22,980
I don't know.

102
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:22,980


103
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:22,980


104
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:22,980


105
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:22,980


106
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,300
What a nutty little tongue.

107
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,340
And how.

108
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,060
I still wonder how we got there.

109
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,420
Well, somewhere along the line,

110
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,560
your drinks caught up with you.

111
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,500
And you got lost.

112
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,760
And we ended up here in

113
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,520
Centerville.

114
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,800
I suppose it's the kind of screwball thing

115
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,540
that I would do.

116
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,480
How do you put up with me?

117
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,160
I don't know

118
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,860
I guess I just have a weakness for screwballs

119
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,500
Well, you certainly have a good one

120
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,540
Well, well

121
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,580
No

122
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,180
No

123
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:04,980
Well

124
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
Maybe it's not the same Centerville

125
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,820
Centerville

126
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,160
A real nice place to raise your kids up

127
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,940
Centerville

128
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,260
It's really neat

129
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,520
Centerville

130
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,840
Centerville

131
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:40,980
Churches

132
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:46,940
Churches

133
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,700
And liquor stores

134
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,380
Be careful with your pets, dear

135
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:09,680
Daddy

136
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:09,760
Daddy

137
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:09,800
Daddy

138
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,940
You brought them all away from Earth

139
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,380
Oh, can I play with them, Mommy?

140
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,900
After lunch, dear

141
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,180
Right now, put them back

142
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,480
No

143
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,840
Go on

144
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,400
The moral of what you've just seen is clear

145
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,600
If you drink, don't drive

146
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,740
And if your wife has had a couple, she shouldn't drive either

147
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,000
You might both just wake up with a wail of a headache

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,820
In a deserted village

149
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:35,860
In

150
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,240
The Self Genius

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,960
Power of

152
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,800
Self Genius

153
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,280
Life

154
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,440
Bob, please don't try to find out anything more

155
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,840
Let's just keep going

156
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,960
I wake up in the morning

157
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,640
And I'm not feeling too good

158
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,040
I hit upon my pipe

159
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,080
And I'm better than I should

160
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,220
Take another hit

161
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,880
And turn on the TV

162
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
Go into the kitchen

163
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,320
Find something to eat

164
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,780
Take another trip

165
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,620
As I'm blowing out the smoke

166
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,140
Thank you, everyone, for providing what I have

167
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,740
I step out on the street

168
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,360
Going to an interview

169
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,320
With an alcoholic cop

170
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,880
Who has just been on the deuce

171
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,200
The day is bright and warm

172
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,880
And I'm smoking on my pipe

173
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,400
The singing, mocking bird

174
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,040
Moves me over to the right

175
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,660
He sits right on my shoulder

176
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,780
Squeaking louder than I can hear him say

177
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,380
My thoughts

178
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,120
Give us both a token

179
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,160
He tells me what he wants

180
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,260
But he grabs me by the hair

181
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,780
And we're flying through the air

182
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,020
To the pyramid of the red-head millionaire

183
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,800
In the pyramid

184
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,980
In the circular room

185
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,660
Arrhythmically pulsed

186
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,000
To a floyd turns

187
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,400
I meet the iron lady whose attention

188
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,480
I want to know

189
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,760
I'd want to know

190
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,420
Somehow

191
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,980
She said

192
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,240
If you have the time

193
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,340
We could party

194
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,360
In the piney woods

195
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,720
If you come with me

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,980
I could make you free

197
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,720
Make you free

198
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,780
I wake up in the morning

199
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,980
And I have a cup of tea

200
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,580
I read the funny papers

201
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,180
And I'm laughing happily

202
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,300
The iron lady comes

203
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,960
And she takes me by surprise

204
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,560
She leads me to the sea

205
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,100
Where a city will arise

206
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,920
Drifting from the ocean

207
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,760
In cascades of waterfalls

208
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,180
It's a delicate black city

209
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,140
Biggest thousand shopping malls

210
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,520
Walking from the ocean

211
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,100
As a big and mighty man

212
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,840
With a smile upon his face

213
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,420
And a pipe is in his hand

214
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,100
He reaches in his pouch

215
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,760
And hands me lots of herb

216
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,040
With the compliments

217
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,800
That it is quite superb

218
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,500
My lady turns to me

219
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,280
She says

220
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,860
You've seen a lot today

221
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,620
But you can still see more

222
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,540
If you load it off away

223
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,240
If you have the time

224
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,420
We could party

225
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,280
In the piney woods

226
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,560
If you come with me

227
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,840
I could make you free

228
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,440
Whoever smokes a pipe

229
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,140
Shall fly away in it

230
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,560
Whoever digs a pit

231
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,540
Shall fall in it

232
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,360
Whoever smokes the pipe

233
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,460
Shall fly away

234
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,460
So that nobody seems toOMe

235
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,460


236
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,460


237
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,460


238
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,460


239
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,460


240
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,460


241
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,460


242
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,460


243
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,460


244
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,460


245
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,440
Fly away free

246
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,200
Love me

247
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,040
Love me

248
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,220
In my private�

249
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,700
World

250
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,320
Love me

251
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,420
In your private

252
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,020
World

253
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,780
Love me

254
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,800
Here

255
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,580
That's where I acquire

256
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,880
Love and care

257
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:36,880


258
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:36,880


259
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:36,880


260
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,400
But it tries to know

261
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,400


262
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,400


263
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:37,400


264
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,940
Why do you think Kentucky Fried Chicken changed their name to KFC?

265
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,200
The signs were a lot cheaper to paint.

266
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,040
You know the real reason, actually, I heard?

267
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,120
Because they wanted to take the word fried out of their name back when, you know,

268
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,140
because frying food is not good for you.

269
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,420
Actually, I heard that they wanted to take chicken out of their name

270
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,820
so nobody could sue them for not actually using chicken anymore.

271
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,360
Urban legend.

272
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:14,960
Really?

273
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,840
Well, I mean, just ask the PETA people.

274
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,620
They think those are real chickens.

275
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,980
Parts of it, anyways.

276
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,940
You know, if it's got a thigh bone.

277
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,260
They have chicken trees now, don't they,

278
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,720
where it's just a sort of a vegetable-like creature with no head that just...

279
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Yeah, they've gone beyond urban chicken.

280
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,620
Yeah.

281
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,720
A sort of a root chicken and all these...

282
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,780
He's checking breasts and legs and...

283
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,360
Meat that grows on trees.

284
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,900
Actually, those trees are a very complex symbiotic relationship, actually.

285
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,180
For example, you know, you have to have extra large amounts of nitrogen-fixing bacteria

286
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,580
in the soil there as well, you know,

287
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,140
just to make sure that they can get enough protein from the air.

288
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,380
Well, and they haven't been able to get rid of the skin yet, right?

289
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,400
I mean, they don't have feathers,

290
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,480
but the meaty fruit, as you might call it, still has this sort of skin.

291
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,080
It's a barky.

292
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,400
It's a barky skin.

293
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,700
It's a barky skin that has to be removed.

294
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,520
See, all you've got to do is take a chicken genome,

295
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,260
or one of the chicken genomes,

296
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,320
and implant it into the tree,

297
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,920
into the primordial cell, the first cell, the original cell.

298
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,500
They've been doing that for two years now.

299
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,880
Mm-hmm.

300
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,000
That's where most of the chicken in the supermarket comes from,

301
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,700
chicken trees.

302
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,880
Mm-mm-mm.

303
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,600
Somebody else had the idea for cow trees,

304
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,100
but people just couldn't...

305
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,900
They wouldn't stomach that.

306
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,660
They wouldn't...

307
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,580
Well, you know, that's the kind of tree that, like,

308
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,240
they're saying we should plant more trees to curb the greenhouse effect.

309
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,780
Right.

310
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,520
A cow tree would do the exact opposite.

311
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:45,920
Right.

312
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,380
They'd be breaking wind and knocking themselves over simultaneously,

313
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,880
and it wouldn't be good for the logging industry or any of us.

314
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,180
Hello, you're on the air.

315
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,240
Yeah.

316
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,720
What are you guys talking about?

317
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,440
What's it sound like we're talking about?

318
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,680
We're talking about meat trees.

319
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,060
We're talking about genetic engineering, man,

320
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,100
something that's very important.

321
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,600
It's very important to humanity right now.

322
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
You should be paying attention.

323
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,820
What do you mean by meat trees?

324
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,940
We're talking about trees that grow flesh on them.

325
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,380
Haven't you heard?

326
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,600
No, I...

327
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,480
Explain.

328
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,800
You never heard of a chicken tree or a beef tree?

329
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,980
Professor, you sound kind of quiet, actually.

330
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,480
Well, they outlawed the beef trees.

331
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,660
Now, what's the status of the pork tree?

332
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,860
Are we still getting...

333
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,560
They won't make mammal...

334
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,320
They won't make trees with mammal flesh

335
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,100
because there's a law in the U.S. against it,

336
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,620
although I understand that in...

337
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,920
Yeah.

338
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,100
Yeah.

339
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


340
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


341
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


342
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


343
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


344
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


345
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


346
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


347
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


348
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


349
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


350
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


351
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,100


352
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,100
In foreign countries, they're about to legalize it.

353
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,980
Legalize it?

354
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,840
Yeah, legalize beef and mutton trees.

355
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,980
Legalize it?

356
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,840
Apparently, it's not that hard to do,

357
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:54,700
but the presence of little tiny mouths and eyes

358
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,440
and beaks and things here and there

359
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,940
along the branches of the tree freaks people out,

360
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,040
so they don't advertise much

361
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,820
that that's the way they do it.

362
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,760
They'll say farm-raised chickens and...

363
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,200
I can't wait.

364
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,320
What does that mean?

365
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,600
I can't wait until long pig is available.

366
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,180
Well, it already is available for a limited time only

367
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,200
at your favorite supermarket,

368
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,880
but it's not real, real long pig.

369
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,120
There were human genomes introduced into the pig

370
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,540
so that it has a longish flavor,

371
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,120
but it's not real long pig yet.

372
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,440
Some of those swine are kind of cute.

373
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,720
Mm.

374
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,620
Well, they have pretty legs.

375
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,360
I don't know how they did it,

376
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,640
but they'll have these...

377
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,000
They look mostly like pigs,

378
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,300
but their hind legs will look like Betty Grable's gams.

379
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,640
And it's kind of a shock, you know?

380
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,620
It makes you uncomfortable to look at one of those.

381
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,800
Like, I went to the state fair in Texas

382
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,260
where they had some of these new crossbreeds

383
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,320
between humans and farm animals.

384
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:03,900
And...

385
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,420
Well, in some parts of Texas,

386
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,620
that just happens naturally.

387
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,320
Right.

388
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,160
Well, on the other...

389
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,760
That happens in parts of Ohio, too.

390
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,780
There's a lot of people who look increasingly like pigs,

391
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,040
but I'm talking about these genetically engineered pigs,

392
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,560
and those are the only kind I've seen, actually.

393
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,580
Ever.

394
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,980
The pigs that have been...

395
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,620
have some human...

396
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,600
Because apparently human and beef doesn't...

397
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,360
That combination isn't that tasty,

398
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,600
but pork and...

399
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:33,880
Yeah.

400
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:33,880


401
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:33,880


402
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:33,880


403
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:33,880


404
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:33,880


405
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:33,880


406
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:33,880


407
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,420
I mean, they're close enough together that...

408
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,800
If you get the human and beef combo...

409
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,500
I know some Chinese restaurants that can do it pretty well, actually.

410
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,960
Kind of like the whole Four Seasons dish or whatever, you know?

411
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,340
Yeah.

412
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,640
Chinese chefs have been there once in a while, too,

413
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,480
but, yeah, sometimes they're long on the long pig,

414
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,960
and sometimes they're a little bit short, but, yeah.

415
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,960
It's a taste treat for this time of the year.

416
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,020
Yeah, it makes my mouth water.

417
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,300
I haven't enjoyed it in a while, but I remember.

418
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,260
Mm-mm.

419
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,720
Good.

420
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,980
Turd duck, man.

421
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,860
I wonder why...

422
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,100
I will not eat any food that starts with the word turd.

423
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,580
If they can take the turducken and just rearrange the parts of that name,

424
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,760
then I might be interested.

425
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,900
Like turd key or something, or...

426
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,100
Man pig turducken.

427
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,960
With a big apple in his mouth.

428
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,320
I can't believe that they would...

429
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,300
Is that an unwitting society?

430
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,120
Can you...

431
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,100
You know, if we thought about it, even in a satirical way,

432
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,060
somebody in Brunei or Saudi Arabia has tried it.

433
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,140
Or Japan.

434
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,140
Some rich dude with the money.

435
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,500
If we think of it, somebody has already tried it.

436
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,860
Well, we should start thinking of things that save our own skins, then.

437
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,000
What about the one...

438
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,920
Well, no, because some other guy will just save his own skin first.

439
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,840
See?

440
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,360
You gotta...

441
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,540
If you think about it, don't let yourself know you thought about it,

442
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,160
because somebody will steal the idea.

443
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,940
You gotta keep it secret, even from yourself,

444
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,960
until you're ready to put it right into production.

445
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,300
I was just thinking maybe Ulysses was the progenitor of the man pig race,

446
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,620
because wasn't it Circe who was like a pig,

447
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,920
and she was like really hot or something like that?

448
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,200
Do you know anything about that, Dr. Sinister?

449
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,460
I know you know a bit of classical literature.

450
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,460
Oh, gosh.

451
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,720
The name sounds familiar.

452
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,760
But I can't remember.

453
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,900
Are you talking about the Circe?

454
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,240
Circe?

455
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,240
Circe.

456
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:39,780
The circus?

457
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,060
The Circus Soleil.

458
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,440
No, I'm talking about a pig in mythology,

459
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,020
who, you know, the sirens were singing to him,

460
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,620
but a pig did allure Ulysses to some sort.

461
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,560
No, he would get lured, and then they would turn him into pigs.

462
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,300
But he killed the swine.

463
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,500
He did kill the swine because he knew it wasn't really a hot babe,

464
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:03,800
I guess.

465
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,260
He came to his senses and killed it.

466
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,700
That was after he was done with it.

467
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,220
Yeah.

468
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:17,140
He was, you know, it's like, well, how many of us have awakened in that sleazy motel room

469
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,740
and looked over and went, oh, my God, what was I thinking?

470
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,820
No, it hasn't happened to me.

471
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,600
But how many of us has it happened to?

472
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,980
Raise your hands.

473
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,540
I don't know.

474
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,460
You're asking.

475
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,760
How many of you wish it would, at least that much would happen to you?

476
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,500
If only.

477
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,780
If only that would happen to me.

478
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,720
If you could actually.

479
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,080
I don't care how much regret I have afterwards.

480
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,640
I just want it to happen once.

481
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,800

482
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,820

00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,800

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,100
Bob?

485
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,100
По Week так бывает

486
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,860

487
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:18,860

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:18,880

guitar solo

00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,180
Who is your friend?

506
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,520
It's the amino acid.

507
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:36,660
The amino acids did that from their CD, Destroy the Warming Sun, theaminoacids.com.

508
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:43,420
By the way, they will be doing their last performance at X Day 14, but then that will

509
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,440
be everybody's last performance.

510
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:54,060
This is Hour of Slack number 1302, and that song was called 13013.

511
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,480
Say, did you know that we did an episode number 1301.3?

512
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,120
A 20-minute show between our regular weekly shows?

513
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:12,600
And you can only hear it by going to subgenius.com, because it is the most offensive thing your

514
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,780
ears will ever hear.

515
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:21,560
Before the amino acids, some radio synesthesia with host Dr. Sinister from WCSB Cleveland.

516
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:27,640
Before that, the song Stone was by the group Rainbow, friends of Reverend Topper.

517
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,420
And the long Twilight Zone bit was...

518
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,380
Wrecked up by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Spang.

519
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,240
The theme of this episode is, again, monsters.

520
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,920
But that covers more territory than you might think.

521
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,760
We're looking for people who like to draw.

522
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,720
There's a lot of art critics out there.

523
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,960
People want to be art critics.

524
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,340
Oh, yeah.

525
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,120
We have critics.

526
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,040
But we're not art critics.

527
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,620
We're looking for people who like to draw.

528
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,520
Drawing on a pipe.

529
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,600
Drawing on a pipe, daddy.

530
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,140
Yep.

531
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,900
Drawing on a pipe, Bob.

532
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,060
Yep, we like to sit back and hop, sissy.

533
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,480
You know what I'm saying?

534
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,480
Like, take the whole idea until the brain starts to melt and come out the ear canal.

535
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,280
Now, don't stick those tubes too high up in the ear canal and you can cause some pretty

536
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,220
bad sniffage.

537
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:10,920
You know what I'm saying?

538
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:11,880
Yeah.

539
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,720
Makes your sinuses go.

540
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,940
Back of your eyes.

541
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,860
Corrode, I guess, is the word.

542
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,700
Best word for it.

543
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,200
Corrode.

544
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,120
Eyes are corroding.

545
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,520
Grod in the scrote.

546
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:27,800
Friends, yes, we grow some great concepts deep down in the scrotes of our bodies where we

547
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,380
store our real soul.

548
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,960
You know what?

549
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,500
Did you know?

550
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,480
Did you know that the soul is stored in a hairy sack?

551
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,960
Yes, it is.

552
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,640
Between the thighs of your pet.

553
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,600
That is so not true.

554
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,180
Your pet, depending on what kind of virtues it may have.

555
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,320
If you don't have a pet, you ain't got a soul or a good receptacle for it.

556
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,120
It may have to just hover around you.

557
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,860
You could find yourself a rabbit or a beatnik.

558
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,800
They like dogs or cats best.

559
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,040
Tomatoes is good, but, you know, they'll go bad on you and they don't talk.

560
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,300
No.

561
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:00,700
No.

562
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,200
Oh, wait.

563
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,680
Here they are.

564
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,480
They're talking, though.

565
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,120
Oh, yes.

566
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,560
Oh, yeah.

567
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:03,980
Right.

568
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,320
Oh, look.

569
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,300
They're going out to sea.

570
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,720
They're in the little boat now.

571
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,320
How long we been out here, man?

572
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,420
I don't know, man.

573
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,400
I'm rooting for them.

574
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,200
I can't remember.

575
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,960
I can't remember anything.

576
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,280
It seems like we've been out on this boat forever.

577
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,720
I can't take any more seawater.

578
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,060
I'm this old, parched, and hydrated.

579
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,020
I keep drinking.

580
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,720
You'll be all right.

581
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,300
It looks like an island in the distance.

582
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:27,700
Here.

583
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,300
Just look.

584
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,660
It's a little bit.

585
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,180
It's a little bit.

586
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:30,560
It's a little bit.

587
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:30,560


588
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,300
I don't see.

589
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,360
It's a mermaid.

590
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,440
Yeah.

591
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,200
Hey, this is Merlin Island.

592
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,160
That's a mermaid's city.

593
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,400
What is this stuff?

594
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:37,540
Yeah.

595
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,880
She's beautiful.

596
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,900
Oh, my God.

597
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,460
She's so lovely.

598
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,560
Give me back up on the raft, man.

599
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,600
I must get to the mermaid.

600
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,860
I want to see her.

601
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,680
I'm hurt.

602
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,600
Oh, no.

603
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,340
Me first.

604
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:50,800
Me first.

605
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,480
Oh, she's so cute.

606
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,040
She was a sight for sore-eyed men.

607
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,340
Oh, she smells.

608
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,360
That fishy smell.

609
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,400
She's swimming rapidly.

610
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:57,840
Oh, wait.

611
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,260
Wait.

612
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:58,880
What's happening?

613
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,900
She's changing.

614
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,560
She's changing.

615
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:00,780
Too late.

616
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,900
She's too late.

617
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,580
My God, man.

618
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,180
Man, that's a big one.

619
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:05,820
It's no mermaid.

620
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:12,060
This is a creature that should have died 10,000 billion years ago.

621
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,080
Oh, from the smell of her.

622
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,580
I think she did.

623
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,720
My God.

624
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,360
By all rights of man.

625
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,300
Oh, my God.

626
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,220
I'm going to get those teeth.

627
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,820
This foul thing should not exist.

628
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh, my God.

629
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,220
What have we done?

630
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,720
What is this?

631
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,220
All right.

632
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,740
Look.

633
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:29,940
Look.

634
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,580
It's getting up.

635
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,960
It will not die.

636
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,960
It refuses to die.

637
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,140
We must kill this thing.

638
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,500
Yeah, we got to get out of here.

639
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,400
What we got to do, man?

640
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,400
This religion we've created, it is turning against us.

641
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,480
That's what it is, man.

642
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,700
Stitched together as it was.

643
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,520
It's a monster of the air.

644
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,880
It's your own religion, you fool.

645
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,600
Look into the mirror.

646
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,440
No.

647
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,100
No, I refuse to admit it.

648
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,640
Yes, I admit we stole from dead religions.

649
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,900
Yes, I admit we dug up the corpse of Buddha, Jesus, and every other great teacher.

650
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,260
Yes, we did it.

651
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,240
And abused them.

652
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,460
Yes, threw them over our dash.

653
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,080
And had at them.

654
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:06,660
We buggered these other cults and would be world leaders.

655
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,700
And we took the best.

656
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,740
We took the best from them.

657
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,420
And we sutured it together into this great thing.

658
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,640
The great thing.

659
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,340
The church of the subgenius.

660
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:29,400
Yes, for we shall overcome the fools and the pig boys and the little pig men and the big pig men.

661
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,580
We will heal them.

662
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,980
This is our messiah, Frankenstein.

663
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,940
Oh, sorry.

664
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,060
Where are my medicines?

665
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,700
I need more of the drugs.

666
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,620
The drugs, you see.

667
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,580
The drugs seem to light up my brain.

668
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,340
I saw in an instant the power.

669
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,940
The power I had.

670
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,880
The power of slack.

671
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,720
The slack in my little finger had more power.

672
00:25:59,720 --> 00:25:59,720


673
00:25:59,720 --> 00:25:59,720


674
00:25:59,720 --> 00:25:59,720


675
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,300
Yes.

676
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,420
Than the president.

677
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,840
Than the premier.

678
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,860
Even perhaps, yes, even more power than Bob.

679
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,880
Could it be?

680
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,900
Could I be the chosen one?

681
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,060
He was the nexus of the universe in his mind.

682
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,240
Yes.

683
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,720
And so I trudged on into the night.

684
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,900
Sand was slipping in the wind.

685
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,940
Away from the drug.

686
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,100
With his robe glowing.

687
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,680
Away.

688
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,000
He sauntered on.

689
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,640
Worse and worse.

690
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,120
Thinking that he had become the one.

691
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,280
I am.

692
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,720
The unit.

693
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,240
That one.

694
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,240
The vestige of.

695
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:29,960
The name.

696
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,540
The focal point of all universal forces.

697
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,300
The vessel of the universe.

698
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,060
Yes, I, Reverend Ivan Stang.

699
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,820
I was the great genius.

700
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:47,520
The brilliant writer who etched his flammable words onto the very skin brain of the followers.

701
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,800
And yet.

702
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,840
The great swollen sack confused, man.

703
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,940
What?

704
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,040
The drifting angel of infantilism.

705
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,660
What is that silly voice?

706
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,120
Oh, that's my conscience.

707
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,780
A few maggots.

708
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,100
That's disgusting.

709
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,980
I can ignore that easily enough.

710
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,740
A rested idea.

711
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,020
Of our courts.

712
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,680
But hey, come on, Aaron.

713
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,800
But I need to feed.

714
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,040
A brain such as mine must have more power.

715
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,480
It must have nutrients.

716
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:13,960
Yes.

717
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,440
The souls of others would be good.

718
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:17,940
Yes.

719
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,460
The brain stems.

720
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,020
The medulla.

721
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,740
Can I help you, sir?

722
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,760
You've been staring at the freezer case for a long time.

723
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,320
No, actually.

724
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,140
Why don't you?

725
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,780
The manager asked me to see if I could help you.

726
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,800
Yes, you could help me.

727
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,640
You could help me.

728
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:28,640


729
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:28,640


730
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:28,640


731
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:28,640


732
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:28,640


733
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:28,640


734
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:28,640


735
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,260
Help me, sir.

736
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,220
Please come back here into this dark alley.

737
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,940
Further back here into this little closet.

738
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,440
Here into this broom cellar.

739
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,020
All right.

740
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,240
Now take this.

741
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,640
I've noticed.

742
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,900
You're moving me along in this story much too fast.

743
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,560
Oh, look.

744
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,640
Oh, look.

745
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,240
A little girl has come in.

746
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,180
I'm out.

747
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,240
So I'm so.

748
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:49,920
Act normal.

749
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:56,320
The makers of new ideas for an old, tired mankind bring you Hitler's hand soap made

750
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,520
from real hands.

751
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:04,520
And by Tokyo Rojo, the amazing new hair cream that makes you shine like FDR's scars.

752
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,920
Come that man is wearing that from me.

753
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,280
What happened?

754
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:08,900
What?

755
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,920
Look how he's wearing all that goofy clothes and shoes.

756
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,240
Look, he's got white and brown shoes.

757
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,740
What's wrong with him?

758
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,260
His shoes got like brown in front and white around his side.

759
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:25,200
Or to try to convince the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden.

760
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,560
I'm sorry.

761
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,040
I'm sorry.

762
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,500
I'm sorry.

763
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:27,500


764
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:27,500


765
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:27,500


766
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:27,500


767
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:27,500


768
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:27,500


769
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:27,500


770
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:27,500


771
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,000
I, all right.

772
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,200
I understand.

773
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,200


774
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,200


775
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,220
Yes you can.

776
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:47,880
And not to embarrass me.

777
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:47,880


778
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:47,880


779
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:47,880


780
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:47,880


781
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:47,880


782
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:47,880


783
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:47,880


784
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:47,980
Are you there?

785
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:47,980


786
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:47,980


787
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,500
And Snake seems more satisfied this way.

788
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:57,500


789
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:57,500


790
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,040
MC yells I'm free

791
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,740
Hey dude, coming through

792
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,880
As he mows them down

793
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,140
In his truck

794
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,880
Pedal stuck to the floor

795
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,720
4x4, burning oil by the ton

796
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,140
I walked outside

797
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,040
It hit me on the dome

798
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,720
If you don't want trouble

799
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,340
You should stay at home

800
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,120
In the big blue sky

801
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,960
Above the deep old city

802
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,560
I looked up and saw

803
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,640
The man a big and bold

804
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,220
Later is now

805
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,760
Sooner or later

806
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,100
Everybody gets it right

807
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,180
Later is now

808
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,740
Sooner or later

809
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,040
Everything comes to light

810
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,100
Later is now

811
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,740
Light a gold on the phone

812
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,580
Dish in dirt till it hurts

813
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,620
Sends them all to hell

814
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,660
Stocks of prey every day

815
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,480
Nasty vlog, it's a job

816
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,440
Making trouble pays it well

817
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,840
I walked outside

818
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,740
It hit me on the dome

819
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,440
If you don't want trouble

820
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,000
You should stay at home

821
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,800
In the big blue sky

822
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,640
Above the deep old city

823
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,200
I looked up and saw

824
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,280
The man a big and bold

825
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,900
Later is now

826
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,540
Tomorrow is a replay

827
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,560
So tonight

828
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,460
I'll try to sleep

829
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,920
I'll deal with it later

830
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,600
I'll deal with it later

831
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,380
I'll deal with it later

832
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,060
Later is now

833
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,520
Sooner or later

834
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,700
Everything comes to light

835
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,540
Sooner or later

836
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,540
Sooner or later

837
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:02,540


838
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:02,540


839
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,800
Everybody feels the fire

840
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,020
Wasn't this life

841
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,940
Isn't the harvest

842
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,580
Won't this freedom

843
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,320
Happen

844
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,360
When I wake

845
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,320
And my sleep

846
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,120
And my dream

847
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,120


848
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,120


849
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,120


850
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,120


851
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,120


852
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,400
Shoulder

853
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,900
I want to change

854
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,480
Yeah I'm smoking

855
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:25,660
Your tailleste Molly NEQ

856
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:25,700
Football

857
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,860
Later is now, is now, is now, is now, is now, is now

858
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,780
But that was the normal stature.

859
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,640
Well, wait just a second.

860
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,580
For a Palestinian of Christ's era.

861
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,180
Just a second.

862
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,860
Wait a minute.

863
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,880
Just a second, Mr. Plachette, if you might.

864
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,640
I'm only telling you what Mr. Ricci has found as a result of these studies on the shroud.

865
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,860
I think you're reaching for it, personally.

866
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,720
But go ahead.

867
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,340
Well, may I continue?

868
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:40,860
Continue, sir.

869
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,440
All right.

870
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,180
All right, continue.

871
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,240
Be cogent, please.

872
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,580
I'm being perfectly cogent.

873
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,740
You're the one who's...

874
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,720
Now, he was...

875
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,500
Jesus was a shade under five feet, four inches.

876
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,460
What shade?

877
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,860
And probably weighed...

878
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,360
I'm not going to play games with you.

879
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,420
And probably weighed about 155 pounds.

880
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,220
And that was, as I tried to say before, a normal stature for a Palestinian.

881
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,380
Bull's pizzles.

882
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,340
In Christ's time.

883
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,260
Bull's pizzles.

884
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,980
Well, this is...

885
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,780
That's just the way it is.

886
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,020
Go ahead.

887
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,520
You're young.

888
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,940
You have a great career ahead of you.

889
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,160
Also, Ricci believes that Jesus was beaten while bent over a low pillar by two soldiers

890
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,020
using three-pronged whips tipped with lamb's or dog's bones.

891
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,920
What a bummer.

892
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,180
Which left gaping...

893
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,580
That's our religion, folks.

894
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,800
You did...

895
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,080
Why...

896
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,840
Is this communist here for any particular reason?

897
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,520
Columnist.

898
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,420
Columnist.

899
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:28,860
I'm sorry.

900
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,840
Go ahead, please.

901
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,260
It's the fifth columnist we've had in here today.

902
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:32,960
That's right.

903
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,300
The marks from the shroud indicate that Jesus was scourged at least 98 times.

904
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,080
Are you accusing Jesus of being a Marxist, then?

905
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,360
Is that what you're trying to say?

906
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,060
You keep trying to inject politics into this,

907
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,700
and I'm trying to tell you that this is not a political thing.

908
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,980
That's why I object to having this columnist over here.

909
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,760
Now, the bar of the cross...

910
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,100
Sometimes that just has to do that.

911
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,700
...weighed between...

912
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,060
Excuse me.

913
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,120
...between 66 and 88 pounds.

914
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:57,560
Yeah.

915
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,840
And was tied with a rope to the shoulders, arms, and left ankle.

916
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,160
Now, that caused Jesus to fall over on his face, and he broke his nose.

917
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,720
And this is also indicated in...

918
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,780
Jesus.

919
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,380
Broke his nose?

920
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:10,680
Yes.

921
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,440
I didn't see that in the Frau Lippo lippy...

922
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,700
No, the Bruno Wald's got it, though.

923
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,940
...in the Cleveland Museum of Art.

924
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,960
Mark on the shroud.

925
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,760
There's a picture of the shroud right here,

926
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,180
which I'd be glad to hold up for your audience.

927
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:20,840
Go ahead.

928
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,460
Here.

929
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,740
This is...

930
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,020
Look.

931
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,820
Oh, my...

932
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,980
This looks like...

933
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,820
...a plastic bag.

934
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,240
Well, a shroud was like a plastic bag.

935
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,000
They used plastic bags on the Vietnamese dead.

936
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,560
I don't see anything funny about that.

937
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,920
And they quick-freezed them, too.

938
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,340
That just happens to be a fact of life.

939
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,880
Cryogenics me a river, right?

940
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:36,580
Yes.

941
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,640
Well, I'm not going to go on with this.

942
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,060
Yes, you are.

943
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,740
Yes, you are.

944
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,780
Yes, you are.

945
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,960
That was the Firesign Theater

946
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,800
from their first Radio Hour Hour episode, January 1970.

947
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,940
Available thanks to Reverend Taylor Jessen,

948
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,640
and SealandRecords.com,

949
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,560
who assembled all of the old Firesign Theater radio shows

00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,700
into a book and disc package called Duke of Madness Motors.

951
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,200
Very few copies are left.

952
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,320
See FiresignTheater.com.

953
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,320
Theater spelled Ritt style.

954
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,260
All radio subgeniuses over 30

955
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,720
owe their very lives to the Firesign Theater,

956
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,240
and as of now, we're going to start repaying them as best we can.

957
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,240
Before that,

958
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,300
Met Devo from their new album,

959
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,020
and before that, some old Hour of Slack 955

960
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,180
with lonesome cowboy Dave.

961
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,680
Now, back to monsters,

962
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,720
as discussed on the 13X Day stage last year.

963
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,100
I look out upon this field of faces,

964
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,880
this huge crowd,

965
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,140
and I think, how many?

966
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,020
How many here?

967
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,020
When they saw that monster movie,

968
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,500
was there a single one here

969
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,880
who was rooting for the humans to kill the monster?

970
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,720
I think not.

971
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,540
I think almost everyone here did the opposite

972
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,020
of what they were meant to do,

973
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,540
and they went,

974
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,360
oh, great, the monster's destroying the town.

975
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,100
I hope he makes it to the next town to destroy that.

976
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,260
At the end, of course, invariably,

977
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,020
at the end of a Hollywood pink movie,

978
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,120
the monster gets killed.

979
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,700
At the end of Independence Day,

980
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,800
which Hollywood released,

981
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,700
on X Day 1996,

982
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,880
at the beginning of our first X Days,

983
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,400
who won?

984
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,160
The humans.

985
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,640
With some foolish computer code

986
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,880
that any alien could see right through in a nanosecond.

987
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,380
How likely is that?

988
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,380
An America online virus

989
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,220
saved the humans from X Day.

990
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,420
Oh, yeah, according to Hollywood.

991
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,240
The one monster movie I've seen

992
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,660
that shows hope

993
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,220
is the Cloverfield Monster,

994
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,220
which is...

995
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,160
At the end of which,

996
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,500
you know that thing's not dead.

997
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,040
All that's left of New York

998
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,440
is the code name Cloverfield,

999
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,320
because there's no way else

1000
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,200
to truly describe the horror of what happened.

1001
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,060
Yeah, they had to...

1002
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,840
That was a movie that ended with hope,

1003
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,760
the hope that every human died

1004
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,600
and that monsters inherited the earth.

1005
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,120
Because are we not those monsters that they fear?

1006
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,200
We're not.

1007
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,420
Where are the monsters walking among them?

1008
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,640
The movie's even more subtle than that, Stan.

1009
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,780
Some of us, it's obvious,

1010
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,420
like Reverend Skull over there.

1011
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,140
You can tell just by looking at him,

1012
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,400
he's one of the monsters.

1013
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,220
Then there are others

1014
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,560
who are a bit more subtle in their monstrosity,

1015
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,380
such as the big boss of this area,

1016
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,780
Reverend Back It On Up.

1017
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,740
You'd never think that she was,

1018
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,180
aside from the gigantic cranium,

1019
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,080
you'd think she was a human being.

1020
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,920
You'd hardly look twice at her.

1021
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,860
Well, actually, most people probably,

1022
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,140
a lot of guys do.

1023
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,720
Yeah, speak for yourself.

1024
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,680
Sneak a second look.

1025
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,020
But let's not get bogged down in the doctrine here.

1026
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,500
We were trying to address the hearts and minds

1027
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,240
and glands, really.

1028
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,460
Forget the minds.

1029
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,140
They're pointless in this church.

1030
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,000
But the glands,

1031
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,500
the feeling of slack.

1032
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,760
Because isn't that what it is?

1033
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,420
It's a feeling,

1034
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,760
feeling that everything's right.

1035
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,700
If your cigarette,

1036
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,220
you're a cigarette smoker,

1037
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,380
you can only get that feeling with another cigarette.

1038
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,660
But if you're a cigarette smoker who's a subgenius,

1039
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,380
you got your cigarette and your Dobbs head.

1040
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,900
That's ominous music.

1041
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,520
A plate of dead insects and cigarette butts.

1042
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,240
Not the most appealing meal I've ever seen.

1043
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,040
This makes me feel like biting someone on the neck.

1044
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,800
Well, I wouldn't give in.

1045
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,400
Oh, no wonder it's Dracula music.

1046
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,240
Dracula.

1047
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,280
Who's Dracula?

1048
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,680
Who's Dracula?

1049
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,100
Who's Dracula?

1050
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,440
Who's Dracula?

1051
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,600
Riding little skeletons and guys in capes.

1052
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,400
No wolfman, no creature, no mummy, no silly stuff.

1053
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,600
He's not just any vampire.

1054
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,820
What about a giant 90-pound spider?

1055
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,000
Really extra spooky.

1056
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,080
Well, yes, there is that feed.

1057
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,560
Liches from the graveyard.

1058
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,520
So what about Alien versus Dracula 2000?

1059
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,200
Now you're talking.

1060
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,840
I want to have like War of the Alien Creatures

1061
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,680
against War of the Alien Creatures.

1062
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,800
I want to have War of the Earthly Creatures

1063
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,040
and have all the aliens on one side

1064
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,920
and all of the Earth monsters on the other side.

1065
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,980
What Earth monsters?

1066
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,260
Like Frankenstein and Dracula and all the creatures.

1067
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,320
All the famous monsters that didn't come from outer space

1068
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,520
versus all the famous monsters that came from outer space.

1069
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,640
All of the six-foot-high posters of Frankenstein

1070
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,520
that sold for a dollar in the back of the console.

1071
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,000


1072
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,640
You'd have to have dinosaurs

1073
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,840
that would be part of the Earthly Monsters.

1074
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,920
But you could have, you know, like the alien.

1075
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,560
The alien.

1076
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,000
The various aliens.

1077
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,220
Maybe to them, you're the monster.

1078
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,600
E.T. would be on the monster.

1079
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,380
Yeah, like that one.

1080
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,380
That ghastly alien with an eyeball

1081
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,780
staring out of a massive twisted...

1082
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,160
The thing that wouldn't die.

1083
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,700
I mean, the crawling eye would be on...

1084
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,660
The crawling eye, yeah, right.

1085
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,320
That was an invasive monster.

1086
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,100
What about mutants?

1087
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,660
But the abominable snowman would be on the Earth creature side.

1088
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,160
New challenges on War of the Earth.

1089
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,140
They'd be on the human's side, really,

1090
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,880
or the side that will keep the humans alive.

1091
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,560
The side that would be of Earthly origin

1092
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,500
versus the side that's a...

1093
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,180
Well, what about genetic mishaps?

1094
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:24,940
That's Earthly origin.

1095
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,760
They do happen, but with constant vigilance.

1096
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,580
They would be on our Earthly origin side,

1097
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,380
monster side.

1098
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,740
So right now, we have an idea

1099
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,960
that's searching for a plot.

1100
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,220
If you've got a good plot to go with our idea,

1101
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,940
we'd like you to call right now at 510-844-3355.

1102
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,260
There's press extension 4

1103
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,240
and ask for...

1104
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,920
Pull over to the side of the road to pee

1105
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,520
and then get out of your car.

1106
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,260
Ask for Larry,

1107
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,540
the plot point,

1108
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,540
and Larry, the plot boy.

1109
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,400
Larry, the plot boy,

1110
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,340
is waiting for your call right now at...

1111
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,580
www.plot.com

1112
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,560
And as you stand there...

1113
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,920
510-848-4425

1114
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,480
...to a rather interesting person...

1115
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,000
Call now...

1116
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,120
...to this cascade of mail...

1117
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,780
And give Larry, the plot boy,

1118
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,860
a reason for existence.

1119
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,680
He's sitting over there...

1120
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,620
...tweeting his phone.

1121
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,840
He needs you to call right now.

1122
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,760
Larry, the plot boy,

1123
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,660
is sitting there wasting your money.

1124
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,300
We're paying him to sit there

1125
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,220
and answer your call.

1126
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,520
Plot boy is...

1127
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,520
You know, this just isn't working out puzzling.

1128
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,460
I think we're going to have to fire plot boy.

1129
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,280
Oh, no.

1130
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:28,880
Already?

1131
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,760
He was only hired eight minutes ago.

1132
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,240
Well, you do it this time.

1133
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,580
I'm tired of being the ax man for this show.

1134
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,880
More dead bugs and cigarette butts on the plate

1135
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,740
and a dead mouse, too.

1136
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,500
If I had a nickel for every plot boy

1137
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,860
I fired for this show,

1138
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,680
I'd be a millionaire.

1139
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,080
I'd be a millionaire.

1140
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,540
I'd be a millionaire.

1141
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,860
Here's one of the alien creatures

1142
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,880
that lives on the planet.

1143
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,000
He's tugging at his head like it's in pain.

1144
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,400
Ridiculous.

1145
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,380
She was terrified

1146
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,640
and now she doesn't answer the door

1147
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,140
but her car is sitting in the garage.

1148
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,200
She was out

1149
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,480
or in bed with the flu

1150
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:14,960
or...

1151
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,040
Maybe she was abducted by aliens

1152
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,040
for all we know.

1153
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,880
The alien pees.

1154
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,720
In the bushes.

1155
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,480
He staggers.

1156
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,800
His behavior is erotic.

1157
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,960
I'm erratic.

1158
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,020
He can't focus.

1159
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,740
Yes, he is.

1160
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,660
Negative art man.

1161
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,980
And that is the mountain from hell.

1162
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:59,920
And the sky of orange in the place of the doomed people.

1163
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,860
And there are the plantages that grow on this horrible planet.

1164
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,920
And there...

1165
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,520
Oh, look!

1166
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,760
There is one of the alien creatures that lives on the planet.

1167
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,800
He's tugging at his head like it's in pain.

1168
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,020
We're lucky to have the benefit of this long-range zoom.

1169
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,640
We can zoom...

1170
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,920
I'm a hideous, hideous, foul demon.

1171
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,300
And he is.

1172
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,720
Like some movie, horrible, horrible movie creature.

1173
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,800
There he is, just sort of walking.

1174
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,720
Yeah, I think they walk.

1175
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,960
And then they creep.

1176
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,040
Creepily creeping away.

1177
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,120
The Star of the East was in the vicinity of the Falkland Islands.

1178
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,420
And the look I sighted a large sperm whale three miles away.

1179
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,260
Two boats were launched.

1180
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,040
And in a short time, one of the harpooners was unable to spear the fish.

1181
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,440
The second boat attacked the whale, but was upset by a lash of its tail.

1182
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,620
And the men thrown into the sea.

1183
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,440
One man being drowned.

1184
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,540
And another, James Bartley, having disappeared, could not be found.

1185
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,460
Well, the whale was killed.

1186
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,200
And in a few hours was lying by the ship's side.

1187
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,780
And the crew were busy with axes.

1188
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:20,780
And spades.

1189
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,240
Removing the blubber.

1190
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,940
Well, they worked all day and part of the night.

1191
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,000
Boy, am I tired.

1192
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:31,560
Next morning, you know, they attached some tackle to the stomach.

1193
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,220
Which was hoisted up on the deck.

1194
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,620
Get off of my stomach.

1195
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,960
The sailors were startled by something in it.

1196
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,960
Which gave spasmodic signs of life.

1197
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,060
Where are my spasms?

1198
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,180
And inside was found the mission sailor.

1199
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,840
Doubled up.

1200
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,440
And unconscious, yes.

1201
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,180
He was laid on the deck.

1202
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,100
And treated to a bath.

1203
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:50,920
A sea water.

1204
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,220
Which soon revived him.

1205
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,180
And he remained two weeks a raven lunatic.

1206
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,820
But at the end of the third week, he'd entirely recovered from the shock.

1207
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,140
And resumed his duty.

1208
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,380
Being swallowed by a whale.

1209
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,660
That's far out, man.

1210
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,340
And didn't die either.

1211
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:13,760
No.

1212
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,040
Down in the belly of the whale.

1213
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,020
Thank you, Jesus.

1214
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:17,940
Thank you very much.

1215
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,680
Thank you, Jesus.

1216
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,520
That's an amazing story.

1217
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,940
It all has to do with the Bible here, isn't it?

1218
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,380
Isn't that a great story?

1219
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:21,600


1220
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,140
Isn't that beautiful, all right?

1221
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,200
I got some stuff up.

1222
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,200
This is all in a chapter of, uh, of, uh, book called The Year of the Whale about Jonah.

1223
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,540
Mission Control for 201109 has mission completed.

1224
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,660
You shall not be able to escape from the realm of the whale.

1225
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,180
Push.

1226
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,080
Push.

1227
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:40,720
Push.

1228
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:41,560
Push.

1229
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:42,800
Push.

1230
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:43,940
Push.

1231
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:44,520
Push.

1232
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:44,700
Push.

1233
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:44,700


1234
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,160
Push.

1235
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,860
This is how you are

1236
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:58,960
This is how you are

1237
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,700
This is how you are

1238
00:47:45,160 --> 00:48:15,140
This is how you are

1239
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,140

00:52:45,260 --> 00:53:05,140
This is how you are

1249
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:45,140
This is how you are

1250
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:55,040
This is how you are

This is how you are

00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,440
This is how you are

1257
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:32,040
This is how you are

1258
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:50,100
This is how you are

00:58:45,160 --> 00:59:14,860
This is how you are

00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,080
This is how you are
