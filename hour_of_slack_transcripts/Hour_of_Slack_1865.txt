Could fixing the first problem solve the second?
And does the rest of the society need more compassion, too?
And I'm a guy that wants to save money.
I also want cleaner clothes.
How do I do that?
This is like fill-up my void, maybe, in a way.
I just think about it.
These shows are actually lovingly...
Just like he killed Bob.
...connected and downloaded and podcasted.
See, that's what I'm afraid of.
Unmatched quality, unequaled diversity, or as one loyal fan writes,
thank you, thank you for being so good and making us sound so good.
Don't be afraid.
It's just a little radio show, and sometimes it gets scary.
Created by a team of sound engineers,
constantly in contact with a world of feature films, documentaries, advertising, and sound design.

Hello, children.
Hello.
Well, last week we showed you how to be a gynecologist.
And this week on How To Do It, we're going to learn how to play the flute.
how to split the atom, how to construct box girder bridges,
and how to irrigate the Sahara and make vast new areas cultivatable.
But first, here's Jackie to tell you how to rid the world of all known diseases.
Hello, Alan. Hello, Jackie.
Well, first of all, become a doctor and discover a marvellous cure for something,
and then when the medical world really starts to take notice of you,
you can jolly well tell them what to do and make sure they get everything right
so there'll never be diseases any more.
Thanks, Jackie. That was great. Fantastic.
Now, how to play the flute.
Well, you blow in one end and move your fingers up and down the outside.
Great, Alan. Well, next week we'll be showing you how black and white people
can live together in peace and harmony,
and Alan will be over in Moscow showing you how to reconcile the Russians and the Chinese.
Till then, cheerio. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye.

Hey,
but first,
this
last weather update
from that greasy
manicure lady at the
tattoo shop.
Stay inside,
people.
Just
stay inside.
Stay inside.
Stay inside.
This weekend, why not unplug?
Getting closer to nature can get you closer to your family.
To find the four-
This is the golden age of literacy.
Never before have so many written and read for their own pleasure.
It just turns out that for many people,
their pleasure is sermonizing,
scolding,
tattling,
bullying,
and cats.
Lots of cats.
Cats are fine.
My pleasure is reminding the reader to join
the church of the subgenius.
Tonight's the night I should be talking to you about.
I'm going to be talking about a flu,
the subject of word association football.
This is a technique out of living,
much used in the practice makes perfect of psychoanalysis,
dear brother,
and one that has occupied, Piper,
the majority rule of my attention squad by the right number one,
two,
three,
for the last five years to the memory.
It is quite remarkable, Baker Charlie,
how much the Miller Sun,
this so-called Wally Roud word association immigrants problems,
influences the manner from heaven in which we sleek it car in
Timorous Beastie's All-American Speak,
the famous explorer.
And the right to the word association,
really well,
that is surprising partner in crime is that a lot in his wife,
the lion's feeding time.
We may be CDE effectively quite unaware of the fact or fiction
section of the Watford Public Library that we are even doing.
It is a far,
far better thing that I do now.
Then now,
then what's going on with Christine Barra,
the famous hearty part of the lessest now praise famous mental homes
for loonies like me.
So on the button,
my contention causing all my headaches is that unless we take into
account of Monte Cristo in our thinking,
George the fifth,
this phenomenon,
the other hand,
we shall not be able to satisfy fiction section of the Watford
Public Library again,
early to understand retention when I'm talking to you and stop
laughing about human nature,
man's psychological makeup,
some story,
the wife will believe,
and hence the very meaning of life itself is bastard.
I'll kick him in the ballspun road.
You could ask yourself question.
Do I feel lucky?
Well,
do you punk?
I'll be back.
You did all the right things.
You didn't do any of the wrong things.
You didn't bring this on yourself and you sure don't prefer things to be
as they are.
No matter what happens on the show.
Don't take it personally.
I'd like this weekend.
Why not unplug getting closer to nature can get you closer to your
family to find the four.
Are you just going to run reruns or like what's your first show after the,
after you leave?
Well,
I was playing.
I,
or is there,
are you just going to blow it off?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,


I was under some understanding that they were going to install some black,
black box,
black box,
and black box in the studio here.
I don't know what the technology of this really is.
You know,
I,
like I say,
I don't understand how a lot of this is going to,
you know,
take place.
I don't understand how a lot of this happens.
I just know that it won't fail because of me.
This is not a rerun.
I lived and led at a time of immense volatility and change.
Always did my best.
Some things worked and some things didn't.
I've led 30,000 lives without any regret.
Did Mu and I fight against SV.
That sort of thing is crucial.
Next thing that brought me the adjustments to this function was so much else that I almost
lost count of the glass on themill's board.







It is here, and the players know all the battles, drops, targets, and lengths to get to the bonus round multiball and claim their letters on the documentation display.
Players will guide each other, waiting their turn, learning more about the machine and passing it on.
When faced with someone that has never played, nor had any intention to learn this intricate thing,
there are only symptoms.
To rule and scoop, the first of these are the flipper buttons.
Rule number one. Keep the ball up and active.
Rule number two. Aim for any rep or target that is flashing.
Rule number three. Ignore rule number one and two. You lose.
Advice to players on a date.
Hold instead, idiot.
So, you let her go first.
The next rule is to...
Actress three multiball sessions on your first ball is a bonus round, two extra balls stacked up, and two credits won.
Your date is about to show you a new meaning for the term, Duraino, as she pours it into your drink.
As you lapse into foamy-mouthed unconsciousness, you see her piss away your game one flipper shot at a time.
Her last mistake.
Nevertheless, you still made top score.
And she inputs your name as M.U.D.
She pours the last of your poisoned drink into your crotch and leaves with the bowling machine repairman.
Your eyes close, and you hear a pop.
You always thought you were a good match.
We'll see you next week.
I'm going home.
See you.
I'm going home.
I'm going home.
I'm going home.
I'm going home.
I'm going home.
Okay, let's start with what didn't work out.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
And let's just go.
And let's just go.
Sweet assurance of sanity goodbye.
So shut up and listen!
Listen and look for yourself!
You don't even need us to translate the handwriting on the wall.
What's going on is very grotesquely obvious to even the most subjugated idiot.
Face it.
It's all falling apart.
We don't need to say anything else.
If you're in production,
you know the power potential of music when it's right.
When it sounds as good as your picture looks.
When the music complements what your copy says.
The right music can make it all come alive.
Listen.
Once upon a time there were ten little cannibals swinging on a vine.
One tried to pat a big...
wild cat.
And then there were nine.
One of the nine drank turpentine.
And then there were eight.
Then one more fell dead on the floor.
And seven was their fate.
One went in politics.
Then there were nine.
Then there were only six.
One took a dive.
Now five we see.
One went to Singapore.
Then there were only four.
One turned green.
And then there were three.
One fell into some glue.
Then there were only two.
They drank from a loving cup.
One became a skeleton.
Then there was only one.
And he ate himself all up.
If you were to look up,
compassion or empathy,
you will not necessarily get every article.
So we had to do something which was essentially the equivalent of the Dewey Decimal System.
We had to go back and do a systematic review of a reference of references approach.
Pull articles and then read all of those references.
And then read the references of those articles.
And then the references of those articles.
And keep doing that like a giant tree.
That's why it took a couple years to do.
Mathematically quantified by the quantitative finance people at hedge funds.
So the idea is that you can actually gauge through all sorts of very complicated partial derivatives based on options that are being taken on the level and the volatility of them.
I know this sounds very complicated.
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.
This is not a rerun.
Just listen.

Money is a fiction.

but he left me his question in his will
oh dear well what he said but let's hear the question
uh uh unfortunately one of the conditions of the will is that i myself grew up in northern






should not reveal the question.
Oh, dear, well, can someone else reveal it?
Yes, he left provision...
I'm sorry, we're running out of time.
Yes, he left provision in the will
that his wife should be able to reveal the question
in certain circumstances.
Is she there?
Er, yes.
Well, perhaps she could read the question on farming, please.
Well, she's here, but she's not very well.
Well, is she well enough to read the question?
Er, no, I wouldn't think so.
Well, is there anyone there who can read the late Mr Gannett's question?
Only if the executors of the will
were to agree on a revocation of the clause
by applying for a codicil.
Well, I'm afraid we must leave that question there.
It could be rushed through in about two months.
Well, I'm afraid, I'm sorry, that's all we've got time for.
Say, I wonder who double-crossed us with that record.
I don't know who did, but I want to get out of here.
Quiet, you lost your voice.
Where?
Shut up.
I don't know who did, but I want to get out of here.

Yes, although I'm feeling your credit card

Don't get freaked out.
Don't get freaked out.
Don't get freaked out.
I still think it would be fun to talk to a robot.
Realistically.
He can help you find the right product or show you the way into the hospital.
I think I'm going to die.
Hey, I got a great idea.
We better get out of here.
Yeah.
Gee, gee, gee.
Where's all that?
Be a nervous wreck.
This keeps up.
I got to get some.
Here's a song.
This old subgenius reverend, Reverend Green, said,
It's very late in the game, Stang, but I found these lyrics I wrote long ago for a country song.
In the unlikely event that any sub-musicians still exist,
I'd be grateful if you'd pass the words along to them.
Well, there are plenty of those.
But this is the kind of song I wrote.
This is the kind of song that actually would work just as well if an old slave field hand was singing it all by itself.
As long as it's an old one.
It's called A Pipe Full of Sin.
I reached out my hand and he let me fall.
Thank you, oh thank you for nothing at all.
A big grinning mouth and a comic book chin.
Smoking a pipe full of sin.
Full of sin, full of sin.
Oh, I'll never win.
Cause he's smoking a pipe full of sin.
I tried to love Bob, but he kicked me in the shin.
He's smoking a pipe full of sin.
Oh, and it's signed,
Sincerely, the former pope on holy protuberance.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And now this.
