1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
... a choice of a primordial importance, because Japan does not forgive divorce.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,700
Hi, I've missed somebody.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,380
I'm here tonight to talk about the rights of the unconceived.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,280
That's right, you heard me right children.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,340
The rights of the unconceived.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,800
Those as yet not conceived.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,200
Abstinence has been said on this stage already tonight, but it bears repeating. Abstinence is murder.

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:50,080
We're talking about going into a singles bar and protecting the rights of thousands of potential unborn people.

9
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,660
I don't understand you.

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,780
I just don't understand you.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,360
I don't understand.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,860
I don't understand the things you say.

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,540
I can't understand a single word.

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,880
I don't understand you.

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,380
I don't understand you.

16
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,800
I just don't understand you.

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,220
I heard a sound. I turned around.

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,640
Turned around to find the thing that made the sound.

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,980
The Soap Genius Hour of Swag.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,560
Designed to make those synapses fire. Designed to make that blood circulate. Designed to make that heart throb even harder.

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,520
Yes. Causing vasoconstriction and violent headaches at times.

22
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:46,100
I'm going to go to the spooky post office.

23
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,980
Get the evil mail.

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,840
Yes.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,700
And then...

26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,280
And then...

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,860
Oh, the lobotomy. That's right. I have an appointment for a lobotomy.

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,640
Who?

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:02,780
Who?

30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:02,940


31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,840
This is a scary neighborhood this morning. Strangely silent.

32
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,340
No one on the streets.

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,380
Are the kids all in school or have they all been taken away to the future?

34
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,480
To be kept as slaves on Mars?

35
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,260
Huh.

36
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,420
Uh.

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,880
Oh...

38
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,860
Oh, wow.

39
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,220
Wow.

40
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,340
Wow.

41
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,000
Wow.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,080
Wow.

43
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,080


44
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,080


45
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,080


46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,200
When have you been himself...

47
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,200


48
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,880
You know...

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,060
I was raised in the altijdly orderity orderÃ¬.

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,280
It turned out fairly well.

51
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,280


52
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,280


53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,360
No.

54
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,300
It

55
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,980
I haven't stayed on there to give you a good show.

56
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,500
I know.

57
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,660
Yeah, well, I haven't stayed.

58
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,360
We all know what happened to him.

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,580
What happened to him?

60
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,860
He fell from grace.

61
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,140
Yeah, all great men have their fall, and he met his, that's for sure.

62
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,860
Oh, really?

63
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,760
Well, who runs the Subgenius Foundation now?

64
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,240
Me.

65
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,640
Dr. Philodrum, and like it was always intended, I've taken over the Subgenius Foundation.

66
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,080
You mean you're a corporate radio station?

67
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,200
What?

68
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,000
You're now in Dallas, Texas.

69
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,860
Listen, this is more international than Dallas anymore.

70
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,960
Sure, that's a fine place to be born, but, you know, the boy grows up and has to go out into the world.

71
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,080
I know.

72
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,940
He has to go west, young man.

73
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,540
It's the same thing over and over.

74
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,700
It's like all the bad old movies you watch.

75
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,040
Oh, he's Hawaii.

76
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,480
That's great.

77
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,280
Let's go.

78
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,240
Well, what's your question, caller?

79
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,620
Well, how's your story?

80
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,160
I was just wondering.

81
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,340
You thought Ivan Stang was going to give a better show than we do, huh?

82
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,320
Is that what it boils down to?

83
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,440
Well, you know, you don't have to keep me in the corner about it.

84
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,560
Where's the kill button here?

85
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,880
Where is the kill button?

86
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,960
It's right over there, doctor.

87
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,480
There, that should teach these callers what happens when they get too big for their britches.

88
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,920
I was just kidding, caller.

89
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,780
I don't, sorry about that.

90
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,260
Too late.

91
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,140
You snuffed him.

92
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,940
He's gone.

93
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,160
I was just looking around, and then hit that button.

94
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,320
Well, you just looked at him, and he blew up.

95
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,300
I want to clear it.

96
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,300
I don't want anybody to think there's any rivalry between.

97
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,480
I'm just saying that Reverend Stang and myself.

98
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,880
Oh, no, no, no.

99
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,680
But, uh, well, look, I mean, there's only so much I can say.

100
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,540
My lawyers really caution me not to say very much about the situation,

101
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,740
because it could be damaging in the upcoming situation.

102
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,120
I won't refer to it, or really lead you on as to think it could be anything more than that.

103
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,140
Stay calm.

104
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,120
Everything will be all right.

105
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
The door seems to be jammed.

106
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,440
Please.

107
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,380
Check the lock on your side.

108
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,380
You get him from where you are.

109
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,520
We won't harm you.

110
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,800
We only want to help.

111
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,020
Look.

112
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:18,960
What?

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,280
I just punched up one, and I'm opening.

114
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,920
Should we zoom the?

115
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,160
What?

116
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,080
So it's best to go back to two.

117
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,460
Okay.

118
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,880
That's it.

119
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,820
Okay, now watch that reading.

120
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,260
Watch the needle on five now.

121
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,920
Watch it.

122
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,100
This.

123
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,420
This.

124
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,040
Now this.

125
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,280
This.

126
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,340
Which is the switch to get it out?

127
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,920
Master.

128
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,760
Okay, there we are.

129
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,320
What is the real dope on the cortex bond problem, anyway?

130
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,160
Oh, you find yourself with...

131
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,500
What if you...

132
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,040
And I punched two up.

133
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,920
Tonight we have a very special show for you.

134
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,460
Tonight we have...

135
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,100
Jesus.

136
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,920
Right.

137
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,540
Is that your cognomen?

138
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,800
Yeah, Reverend Jesus Christ of the Church of the Subgenius.

139
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,540
Okay.

140
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,580
And...

141
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,180
You can just call me Jesus or the Lord, Teacher, Messiah, King of Kings, JC.

142
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,000
JC.

143
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,700
One of those.

144
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,160
And the Subgenius is an organization.

145
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,600
The Subgenius Foundation, is it?

146
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,100
Right.

147
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,240
The Subgenius Foundation is more of the...

148
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,460
I'm the CFO of the Subgenius Foundation, which is sort of the capitalistic...

149
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,440
branch of the Church of the Subgenius.

150
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
The Church of the Subgenius is the...

151
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,900
actually the religion around it.

152
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,380
I mostly just run sort of the T-shirt and book-selling side of it.

153
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:54,720
I brought the money, the tax collectors and change collectors back into the church, actually, I feel.

154
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,400
I see.

155
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,880
So you righted the table.

156
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,480
Exactly.

157
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,200
Okay, well, there.

158
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,760
That works.

159
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,260
That works.

160
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,760
And you can perform marriages.

161
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:02,940
That's true.

162
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,420
Well, anyone who's ordained in our church...

163
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,240
We have a...

164
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,260
Much like...

165
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,240
Different than many other religions, we have a one-time $30 fee.

166
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,680
We sell eternal salvation or triple your money back.

167
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,340
That's been our promise for over 25 years.

168
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,800
And anyone who is ordained, as myself, through the church, which you can do on...

169
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,200
Can I put my shameless plug?

170
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,160
Okay, no money.

171
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,000
You can't say money, but you can say the website.

172
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,600
www.subgenius.com

173
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,060
But all of our reverends, yes, can perform marriages, sickenings, healings, and...

174
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,160
We'll marry you to anyone or anything.

175
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,380
We don't really have any laws.

176
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,160
I can marry you to your wallet, to your Dr. Demento hat.

177
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,160
Well, there you go.

178
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,380
Okay.

179
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,900
Has that been auctioned off?

180
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,620
That's been auctioned off.

181
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,060
The Dr. Demento top hat that's on my website, rome.org, R-O-M-M.

182
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,520
That was auctioned off at MarsCon.

183
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,980
I got to wear it briefly, and it was special.

184
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,840
I can marry you to your radio station.

185
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,820
In fact, I can marry everyone to everyone.

186
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,920
How did you happen to become a messiah?

187
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,500
Was that just...

188
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,520
Was that just a calling?

189
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,040
Yeah, it was more of a calling.

190
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,000
It was sort of an accident.

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,080
I sort of fell into it.

192
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,480
I was mowing the lawn of Reverend Ivan Stang,

193
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,480
who is kind of given the credit of founding the Church of the Subgenius.

194
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,920
Actually, J.R. Bob Dobbs is the founder,

195
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,240
but Reverend Stang sort of has picked up the word.

196
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,660
And one day, almost like a miracle,

197
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,880
I received a call from J.R. Bob Dobbs,

198
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,380
and he said to come work for the church in Dallas, Texas.

199
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,360
We now, of course, are located in...

200
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,160
Austin, Texas.

201
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,560
You know, a lot of moving.

202
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,960
The church tends to stay on its feet, you know,

203
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,440
just to avoid FBI, CIA, and such.

204
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,860
But yeah, it was sort of a revelation one day

205
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,380
when we realized that, you know,

206
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,000
of my personal divinity

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,800
and my calling to save the Church of the Subgenius

208
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,100
from financial ruin.

209
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,340
I see.

210
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,520
So did you have to get dunked or shaken

211
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,760
or whatever branch that is?

212
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,680
We have...

213
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,820
Well, within the church, we have what we call bobtisms,

214
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,940
which are...

215
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,520
usually done nude with a lot of people present

216
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,840
during our X-Day festival.

217
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,580
But personally, no, there's no light,

218
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,200
no, you know, blinding light from Bob.

219
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,160
There was just simply a phone call,

220
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,800
and he said,

221
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,680
Hey, you're Jesus, and by the way,

222
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,840
I'd like you to come work for me.

223
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,680
That's pretty much how it all started, yeah.

224
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,220
How many disciples do you have?

225
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,120
Well, not many.

226
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,480
You see, the strange thing is,

227
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,440
once I realized that I was the Lord and my own divinity,

228
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,980
I kind of looked back at history

229
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,260
and what happened before,

230
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,320
and I said, Where?

231
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,420
This is perfect.

232
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,200
If I just stay within the Church of the Subgenius

233
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,980
amongst the disbelievers and the blasphemers of the world,

234
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,300
no one will ever find me,

235
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,680
and perhaps I could sort of sneak out.

236
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,580
And this is my 33rd year of life,

237
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,300
and this is the year it's supposed to happen.

238
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,740
And I'm hoping that because I'm around the disbelievers

239
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,840
that I won't get nailed to the stick this time.

240
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,160
So I have very few disciples,

241
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,720
because really no one does truly believe that I am the Lord.

242
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,000
And as long as I can keep that low profile,

243
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,920
I think I'll be okay.

244
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,960
Well, do you want to go through the same experience

245
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,420
that the other one is going through?

246
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,440
No, absolutely not.

247
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,600
Absolutely not.

248
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,800
I've been promised by Bob.

249
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,720
Now, I know you don't know a lot about our philosophy.

250
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,420
Not a lot.

251
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,300
We believe that on July 5th this year,

252
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,600
the world will come to an end,

253
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,120
and all the saved subgeniuses,

254
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,020
that is, those of the non-human race,

255
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,280
those of the subgenius race,

256
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,260
will be taken up aboard the space vessels of the sex goddesses.

257
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,420
And I, too, am supposed to have a front seat ticket

258
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,820
on that space vessel.

259
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,820
And hopefully then, I won't have to go through the whipping

260
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,880
and the bleeding, and you know, you've seen the passion.

261
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,900
Well, I've heard about it.

262
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,400
Yeah, me too.

263
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,640
It's a relatively well-known story.

264
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,480
Yeah.

265
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,120
Been around for a while.

266
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,060
Been around for a while.

267
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,320
And that's, so what is your philosophy?

268
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,960
I mean, how do you, do you,

269
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,420
what are some of your major holidays?

270
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,380
Well, our main holiday is X-Day.

271
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,080
That would be the end of the world.

272
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,320
That is July 5th at 7 a.m.

273
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,980
And this is, I believe, the sixth time

274
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,400
that we've predicted the end of the world.

275
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,400


276
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:04,400


277
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,120
And it hasn't happened.

278
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,480
So that puts us right up with some of the greatest.

279
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:08,900
That's true.

280
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,900
You're up with the Millerites, yes.

281
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,200
Yeah.

282
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,040
So we're hoping this time, you know,

283
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,660
maybe after we get seven or eight, you know,

284
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,500
we can get even better than, like,

285
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,420
let's say the Jehovah Witnesses

286
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,940
or, you know, the Seventh-day Adventists, you know.

287
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,020
But X-Day is our main holiday that we have.

288
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,280
There are some other ones in there,

289
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,260
St. Janer's Day and such.

290
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,480
I've always advocated that a subgenius holiday

291
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,880
should happen exactly five days

292
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,580
after the conspiracy holiday.

293
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:33,880
Okay.

294
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,400
So you can hit up the website.

295
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,200
You can get all the good sales.

296
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,520
But, you know, that's...

297
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,940
That works for me, yeah, sure.

298
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,320
...not necessarily caught on yet.

299
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,120
And is there any sort of dietary restrictions?

300
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,660
No, no.

301
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,240
A subgenius will eat just about near anything.

302
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,160
I'll tell you.

303
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,020
Well, our group is very eclectic.

304
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,240
It is a group of people who seriously believe

305
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,960
almost nothing or those who will believe

306
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,840
just about anything.

307
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,720
The philosophy itself is based in a...

308
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,740
on the...

309
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,920
shifty, sandy beaches of hypocrisy.

310
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,700
We're one of the few churches,

311
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,940
and this is what lacks in religion today, Barron,

312
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,160
is we're one of the few religions that not only lie,

313
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,780
but we tell you the truth about it.

314
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,760
The rest of them are going to lie to you.

315
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,860
We're the only ones that are going to honestly tell you right now

316
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,120
we're lying to you.

317
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,200
So kind of make the philosophy up as you go.

318
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
That's pretty unique.

319
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,220
It's true.

320
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,300
Most of them just sort of say,

321
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,040
well, this is the truth in various forms.

322
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,560
And whether they're lying or not,

323
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,540
they'll just claim it's the truth.

324
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,100
Correct.

325
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,180
One of the things that Bob has always told us

326
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,980
is that pretty much if you say it,

327
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,720
it is the law.

328
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,580
You know, whatever it is that you truly want to believe.

329
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,900
Bob once said to us,

330
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,800
you'll pay to know what you really think.

331
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,300
And really that's where it's based in.

332
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,140
We also have the fundamental belief in slack.

333
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:57,960
Slack.

334
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,640
And that is, yes,

335
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,220
the non-ending chase for fulfillment.

336
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,780
Of your own personal dreams, whatever that may be.

337
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,040
Which they should cut you.

338
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,740
Yes.

339
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,520
And you should get, everyone should cut you some slack, right?

340
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,100
That's right.

341
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,940
But in the meantime, here is an apropos song.

342
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,060
This is Jesus Jr.

343
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,720
Jesus Jr.

344
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,960
His grandpa is the Lord.

345
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,940
Jesus Jr.

346
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,280
He drives a big white Ford.

347
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,180
Jesus Jr.

348
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,360
He takes his dad's advice.

349
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,340
Jesus Jr.

350
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,720
The country of Western Christ.

351
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,200
Well, he was born in Tennessee, not somewhere out in Galilee.

352
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,040
His dad got his at Calvary and his mom works at the grocery.

353
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,960
Jesus Jr.

354
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,040
His grandpa is the Lord.

355
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,120
Jesus Jr.

356
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,500
He drives a big white Ford.

357
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,300
Jesus Jr.

358
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,340
His grandma marries Joy.

359
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,680
Father, son, and a holy good old boy.

360
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,480
Well, Junior takes his name in vain when folks abuse the passing lane.

361
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,720
And at his favorite bar main, the only thing he'll raise is cane.

362
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,280
Jesus Jr.

363
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,480
His grandpa is the Lord.

364
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,480
Jesus Jr.

365
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,740
He drives a big white Ford.

366
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,660
Jesus Jr.

367
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,820
At least he's not a Jew.

368
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,020
Ten for Satan, his rigs passing you.

369
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,540
Now if his father is a Jew, he's a Jew.

370
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,540


371
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,540


372
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,540


373
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,540


374
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,540


375
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,540


376
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,540


377
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,540


378
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,540


379
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,540


380
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:33,540


381
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,760
His wheels get stuck in mud.

382
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,860
He'll part that shoulder lock, the flood.

383
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,080
And when he drives on, he's stir but his left hand signals drip in blood.

384
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
Jesus Jr.

385
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,820
His grandpa is the Lord.

386
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,860
Jesus Jr.

387
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,560
Got mud guards on his big white Ford.

388
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,080
Jesus Jr.

389
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,120
He takes his dad's advice.

390
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,260
Jesus Jr.

391
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,660
The country of Western Christ.

392
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,700
Jesus Jr.

393
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,480
The country of Western Christ.

394
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,620
Because of our special guest.

395
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,900
Hello, my name is Dave Rome.

396
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,380
You're listening to Shockwave Radio Theater.

397
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,660
And over there is Jesus.

398
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,040
Not the one with the nails, but the one with the subgenius.

399
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,120
The one with the checkbook.

400
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,860
The one with the checkbook.

401
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,380
And the Church of the Subgenius has been around for a while, hasn't it?

402
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,900
Yeah, we originally, well, some people say that the church was originally founded back in the 60s.

403
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:37,060
But the first book, the Book of the Subgenius, and pamphlet number one was penned in 1980.

404
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:48,520
As you may or may not know, we also have the Hour of Slack radio program that's on in many public radio stations and colleges across the United States and Canada.

405
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,300
And that's been going on also since that time.

406
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,120
So we have our own ministry of merchandise.

407
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,840
How do you convert people?

408
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,100
What do you say to them as they're coming out of the Scientology booth or whatever?

409
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,340
Well...

410
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:09,280
Most of our people, it's very difficult to know where you're going to find a subgenius or what's going to draw them to us.

411
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,380
Sometimes it's hearing the preachers.

412
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,480
Sometimes it's the books.

413
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,500
Sometimes it's Bob.

414
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,880
Mostly it's just the promise of cheap sex that really draws in most of our members.

415
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,640
Okay, well, sure.

416
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:30,920
And how did you happen to pick Jesus as your savior as opposed to the Dalai Lama or the chief rabbi?

417
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:39,720
Well, actually, the savior, I guess you can think of actually the Jesus of the Church of the Subgenius is not really me.

418
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,360
Sort of the leader behind it all is Bob.

419
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,060
J.R. Bob Dobbs is the world's greatest salesman.

420
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,920
He's a multimillionaire.

421
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,480
Actually, he's a multibillionaire.

422
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,880
Many people think Bill Gates is the richest man in the world.

423
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,460
Friends, if you know the name of the richest man in the world, he's not the richest man in the world.

424
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,020
There are people who can buy and sell Bill Gates.

425
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,180
And J.R. Bob Dobbs happens.

426
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:01,920
Be one of these.

427
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,500
Not only is he the richest man, but he also is the luckiest man.

428
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,000
And that is pretty much how he made his money.

429
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,480
Bob always said, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

430
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,180
And he is.

431
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,780
Extremely lucky.

432
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,800
Okay.

433
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,080
And so, let me start that sentence again.

434
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,140
Describe some of your more pleasant rituals.

435
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,880
We have a lot of, like I said earlier, healings, sickenings.

436
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,260
The marriage ritual, I think, is the...

437
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,580
Well...

438
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,260
Would you mind?

439
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,080
Would you mind if I married your entire audience today?

440
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,820
I mean, I can do that.

441
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,120
A mass marriage real quick.

442
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,420
Sure.

443
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,820
It'll only take about 30 seconds or so.

444
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,620
Okay, so all of you out there, be prepared to get hitched.

445
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,780
Yeah, what you want to do, and maybe we can come back after a little while,

446
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,540
and at least let you find your significant other.

447
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,440
Man, woman, animal.

448
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,480
Again, we can marry you to your wallet.

449
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Or your favorite CD.

450
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,660
To your favorite CD.

451
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,280
Just, you know, grab anything, but you do want to have it prepared and with you.

452
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,400
The marriage ceremony, is there something that we need to do?

453
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,940
Sprinkle rice or, I don't know.

454
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,920
No, you simply just need to have the person or object that you wish to marry with you.

455
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:07,880
In thought?

456
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,140
Do they have to physically be there?

457
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,360
No, they don't even have to really be there.

458
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,840
In fact, you could call them up later and let them know that you're married.

459
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,940
Now, this is what we call a short-duration personal marriage.

460
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,300
I see.

461
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,200
We feel that long-term relationships are, you know, really a part of the conspiracy.

462
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,200
So, today's marriage ceremony, at least for this one that we're doing over there,

463
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,580
will just be for 24 hours.

464
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,100
I see.

465
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,900
And then, of course, it's annulled.

466
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,780
But during that 24 hours, you are legally...

467
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,900
Bonded in holy matrimony.

468
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,240
Okay.

469
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,320
So, I'll play the fake organ here.

470
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,400
Oh, are we ready to do it?

471
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,940
Yes, go for it.

472
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,780
Well, what are you going to get married to there, Baron?

473
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,680
I think I'll get married to this Kinky Friedman CD.

474
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,060
Okay, that's appropriate.

475
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:55,560
I'm going to do sort of the short version here of the subgenius short-duration personal marriage.

476
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,860
The first thing you want to do, though, is take out your CD or your favorite person,

477
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,260
your loved one.

478
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:01,800
Or your wallet.

479
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,140
And you want to just hold it in your left hand.

480
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,760
Something that means something to you.

481
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,000
Something that means something to you.

482
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,400
And I'll just do this.

483
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,780
Everyone can just play along at home, but I'll do it with the Baron here.

484
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:21,940
Baron, in the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs and what other deities, gods, and saints you may wish to worship at this time,

485
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:31,020
do you take this CD to be your lawfully wedded object?

486
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,460
For the next 24 hours.

487
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,800
Aum.

488
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,000
That's a yes.

489
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:46,520
And do you, CD, take the Baron David Rahm to be your lawfully wedded partner, at least for the next 24 hours, till death do us part?

490
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,980
Yes, the clapping of the CD.

491
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,060
Then, now this is something you could do if you actually have a human.

492
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,260
This might be difficult with a CD.

493
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,380
Shake their hand and say, it's a deal.

494
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,440
And friends, in the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

495
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,320
that was the quickest way to do it.

496
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,620
The quickest short-duration marriage on record.

497
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,700
I now pronounce you thing and thing for the next 24 hours.

498
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,380
Praise Bob.

499
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,600
Wow.

500
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

501
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:17,320
I've discussed this with the CD, but I really only got married for the health insurance.

502
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,800
You must now consummate the marriage!

503
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,280
Oh, I forgot that part.

504
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:21,720
Oh.

505
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,140
Well, I already played the CD.

506
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,140
Well, I don't...

507
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,800
You can wait till after.

508
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,020


509
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,240
Okay.

510
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,560
I don't necessarily want to see that.

511
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,740
You can wait till after the show.

512
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,020
Okay.

513
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,260
Okay.

514
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,280
Sure.

515
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,660
Do you have a lot of luck proselytizing when you go out and spread the word?

516
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,160
Well, I think we do.

517
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,120
I think people...

518
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,820
It's a message that people want to hear.

519
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,900
And, you know, we really don't collect feedback.

520
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,300
I don't think we really care whether or not we're getting through.

521
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,380
We mostly just preach with big megaphones.

522
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,020
Sort of a one-way communication.

523
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,240
We just sort of, you know, force our message on to people.

524
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,740
I mean, that's just the way of religion.

525
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,180
That's right.

526
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,540
You know, we don't really care whether people...

527
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:01,800
Well, do you have gatherings?

528
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,760
I mean, I went to one of your big gatherings in 1984.

529
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,560
It was a while ago.

530
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,260
That was a big thing in Chicago.

531
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,640
Yeah, we have what we call devivals, subgenius devivals.

532
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,140
And, in fact, a lot of them take place in the North, the frozen North, in places such

533
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,580
as Cleveland, Ohio.

534
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,920
And if you want to know more about these devivals and when you can go to them, see preachers,

535
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,080
see some subgenius music, go to our website.

536
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,860
It's simply subgenius.com.

537
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,720
Maybe I should spell it.

538
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,380
I don't know if you know that for the geniuses out there.

539
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,620
Sure.

540
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,220
The subgeniuses, right.

541
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,060
S-U-B-G-E-N-I-U-S.

542
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,860
There's no O in subgenius.

543
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,560
Some people try to put it in there.

544
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,000
And if you do, then you know you belong to our group, right?

545
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:41,980
That's right.

546
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,940
The subgenius is an interesting word.

547
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:49,600
A lot of people believe that means that you're stupid, you're under a genius.

548
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,420
But, truly, it's the genius of the subculture is what it was supposed to be.

549
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,180
I know there was a rival group, the Wile E. Coyote Super Genius branch that had...

550
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,700
Yes.

551
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,220
...a split off.

552
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,200
I don't know if that was a heresy of yours or just...

553
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,020
Well, there's a lot of...

554
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,560
We do have a lot of clenches and a lot of detractors that will go out and form their

555
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,220
own groups.

556
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,840
The Church of Dawn, some of you may have heard of.

557
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,300
It's a pretty popular group.

558
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,700
Church of Dawn.

559
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,060
Yeah.

560
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,860
It's sort of the anti-Bob group for the people who hate Bob.

561
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,300
I should think the anti-Bob would be Odo.

562
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,240
No, Obo.

563
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:22,980
Obo.

564
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,320
Obo.

565
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,320


566
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,640
Strangely enough, you know, Baron, that's why you are a great subgenius because there

567
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,420
is an anti-Bob named Obo.

568
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:29,960
It's amazing.

569
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,280
It's just like it's already been in your brain.

570
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,840
Well, there you go.

571
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,420
The electric mind is one that can achieve a versatile high quality self-medication.

572
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,400
Oh, I was...

573
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,120
Excuse me.

574
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,060
I didn't realize you were going to open the door.

575
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,900
I should have locked it.

576
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,480
Well, now...

577
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,240
Oh, oh, oh, hold on.

578
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:51,720
Hold on a moment.

579
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,560
You know, science doesn't acknowledge the existence of some of these transient phenomena.

580
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:05,000
After all, science must basically pick up a conservative position.

581
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,340
Well, I've been using this brain, I mean this machine for years and science says it

582
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:16,560
doesn't even work and yet I found it to be greatly satisfying and pleasing to my alpha

583
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:17,980
rhythms.

584
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,520
Not only that, the...

585
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,000
This is fascinating.

586
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,640
Yes, the vibrations that get processed when the brain is in motion is one that can only

587
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,540
be reflected in the brain.

588
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,760
You can see it back upon oneself with the proper polarity and reversal transmission

589
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:38,720
migration, mutated magnetic resonances.

590
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,340
Magnetic mutants getting you down?

591
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,280
Mutated magnetic resonances.

592
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,080
Well, there's always one thing you can do about it.

593
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:53,640
You can dispense these altered ones, let's call them, who cluster around the more fortunate

594
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,540
like magnetic monopoles in a cloud chamber.

595
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,520
Nogahyde.

596
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:04,660
do with this social solace? It's a question we've asked since the beginning of time. Are we going to sweep the problem under the societal rug?

597
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:17,200
Is it Naga Hive or Corinthian leather? Or perhaps use the societal vacuum cleaner in the societal closet to suck up every particle of that which makes us uncomfortable or afraid? Is it simulated Naga Hive?

598
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:27,800
But some of us understand that all men are my brothers, though I wouldn't want some of them to marry my sister.

599
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:33,680
And which animal line does the Naga descend?

600
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:40,740
According to the latest scientific information, male marmosets...

601
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,140
A Naga is related to the marmoset.

602
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,020
The Naga, you say?

603
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:52,180
The Naga is related to the marmoset. Naga is the source of the Naga Hive.

604
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:52,940
Yes, that's right.

605
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,260
But I was speaking of male marmosets and...

606
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,980
Their high approval of sex. In other words, the realm of monkey love.

607
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,180
The mighty monkey.

608
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,660
Upon noticing the seductive, sexy scent of a female marmoset...

609
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:13,740
Did you know that if a marmoset was the size of a human that it could lift its own body and a house?

610
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,060
A male marmoset doesn't pursue her mindlessly.

611
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,480
Male marmosets appear to think about, not just react to what they're getting into.

612
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,140
Just as people do.

613
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:27,780
But they...

614
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,220
Well, they said that, but their actions would belie their true intent.

615
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,400
That's it. It's time for hot coos by Dave.

616
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,180
I'm sorry, but you're going to have to listen now.

617
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,240
I once was a very happy young man.

618
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,040
At the age of five, my father taught me how to bleed and stop the bleeding

619
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,660
in case an emergency involving a garbage truck should ever ensue.

620
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,780
At 19, I took my first banking down by the river with a thermos.

621
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:57,780


622
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:57,780


623
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:08,640
He said they used nen see a cliched way to CGI himself.

624
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:24,820
So I used the hoenk to scan the

625
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,120
He's still as miserable and stinky as no town.

626
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,860
Let's do it to him again.

627
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,380
Come on, go on.

628
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,880
Ungrateful as he ever was.

629
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,260
He was a red-headed stepchild, Dave was.

630
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,440
And they yanked him by that red hair and threw him into the well.

631
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,000
Until he learned respect for his elders.

632
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,160
And so here he is today.

633
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,220
Thank you.

634
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,120
Thank you, everyone.

635
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,120
Let's have a hand.

636
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,680
Thank you.

637
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,000
Who is giving Elder Dingleberry their props now is Dave with his beautiful,

638
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,940
not only red hair, but his entirely red face.

639
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,780
He's ready to face an entire basketball team armed with AK-47s.

640
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,100
Ask a silly question.

641
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,580
You just might get the truth.

642
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,140
It's there between the ditches and the ruts.

643
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,800
It's real hieroglyphics.

644
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,860
I'm callous to the touch.

645
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,580
You ask me if I'm happy, guess I'm happy enough.

646
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,720
God is like the French.

647
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,540
He understands English, but he doesn't like to speak it lest he must.

648
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,420
You ask him to repeat himself, he'll grind you into dust.

649
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,900
Do you need to hear more?

650
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,480
No, I think I've heard enough.

651
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,020
Yeah.

652
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,420
Ask me if I'm happy, guess I'm happy enough.

653
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,340
Ooh.

654
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,180


655
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,080
Ooh.

656
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,820
Ooh.

657
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:57,580
Ooh.

658
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,160
Ooh.

659
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,240


660
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:05,040
The objects in the mirror are closer than they seem, but they're backwards like Leonardo's

661
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,300
hand.

662
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,240
He wrote all of the answers down in disappearing ink.

663
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,980
And I'm happy.

664
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,740
Yes, I'm happy.

665
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,220
As a goddamn clam.

666
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,200
I'm happy.

667
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,260
Oh, I'm happy enough.

668
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,300
Ooh.

669
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:16,860
Ooh.

670
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,580
Ooh.

671
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,600
Ooh.

672
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,060
Ooh.

673
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,320
Ooh.

674
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,240
Ooh.

675
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,240


676
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,660
Ooh.

677
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,480
There's music at the minimart.

678
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,720
There's rhythm in the rails.

679
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,800
I gotta think for sixteenth notes right at the top.

680
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,840
I was just about to crack it, but the cold got tough.

681
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,700
You ask me if I'm happy, guess I'm happy enough.

682
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,480
Dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot, ooh.

683
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,480
Ooh.

684
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,040
Ooh.

685
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,320
Ooh.

686
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,380
We were doodling in the margins of the Doomsday book.

687
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,780
You could draw a dick, but not a crowd.

688
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,660
So we turned it up loud and we sang it real rough

689
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,480
Did it make you happy? Made me happy enough

690
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,660
Oh, I guess it made me happy, made me happy enough

691
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,140
I was digging through my bottom drawer of uncut gems

692
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,540
Looking for a ruby in the rough

693
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,240
Hold my beer while I wrestle with the clown and get pinned

694
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,220
Ask me if I'm happy, guess I'm happy enough

695
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,420
I guess, guess, guess, guess I'm happy enough

696
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,720
Hey, love is all around you if you know where to look

697
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,220
My life is overflowing with the stuff

698
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,180
You'll know it when you see it, it'll hit you like a book

699
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,960
Guess it made me happy, made me happy enough

700
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,080
Ask me if I'm happy, guess I'm happy enough

701
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,180
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy, happy enough

702
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,200
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy, happy enough

703
00:29:47,200 --> 00:30:17,180
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy enough

704
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:47,180
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy, happy enough

705
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,180
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy, happy enough

706
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:31,080
I love ya all, I'll give you six more

707
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:40,300
I love you, I'm going to put wonky by choking on abroad

708
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,180
Cause I won't regret it

709
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,280
Got a flight out to Yale next month

710
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,780
Hear ya later, wake up to the sound

711
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,180
I've been along here six years

712
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,580
Jesus had AK-47.

713
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,960
Jesus had a Stinger missile.

714
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,660
I just understand that's the old world.

715
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,440
They're in new thinking now.

716
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,440
See, that's what's happened today.

717
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,340
People get sloughed off with these cheap imitations.

718
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,520
Yeah, but Papa Joe, Mama, I can't even have a list of high-ranking officials

719
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,320
that were there that night and were actually such geniuses.

720
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,060
All right, punch it up.

721
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,840
Well, it has been alleged that certain hierarchies

722
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:20,120
have carried weapons of destruction on their persons during public appearances,

723
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,120
but this is merely a defensive measure, let me assure you.

724
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,740
These allegations of opening up on the audience,

725
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,940
dispensing with people that didn't applaud loud enough,

726
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,100
these are purely exaggerations.

727
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,760
Okay, all right, there was some shooting on the audience,

728
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,460
but it was target practice.

729
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,180
We were deliberately missing.

730
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,340
Tell the truth.

731
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,500
Okay, okay, so all right.

732
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:44,820
A few.

733
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,780
A few people were hit, but that was from cricket change.

734
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,080
What a beautiful future it is.

735
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,040
Listen, would I lie to you?

736
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:54,900
Would I lie to you?

737
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,820
We're the elite of the world.

738
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,000
Those people that died, those were people that wanted to die.

739
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,580
They jumped up in the line of fire.

740
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,760
Would you lie to me?

741
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,540
What about that night you told me you were?

742
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,600
Well, never mind.

743
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,680
Never mind, never mind.

744
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,720
Quote the Raven, never mind.

745
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,540
Quote the Raven, never mind.

746
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,660
There's a place where there's no sun to shine.

747
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,780
A little planet called X19.

748
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,080
No flow with rivers, no communist.

749
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,900
Just poor paper and electric mist.

750
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,180
What do you know?

751
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,460
What do you know?

752
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,740
What do you know?

753
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,920
What do you know?

754
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,460
She's driving me crazy.

755
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,620
Ah, the view is hazy.

756
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,440
Oh, no, it happened again.

757
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,540
And every time I say,

758
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,660
I'll never fly with lizard eyes and turn the other way

759
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,220
Then you find you came to swim in water

760
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,480
That is free and pulling in the night sky

761
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,800
Of a land beyond, beyond a world of hope and fear

762
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,600
And so I bid you space man

763
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,180
Now I'm here

764
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,580
Now I'm here

765
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,040
Now I'm here

766
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,280
Now I'm here

767
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,440
There's a place where there's no sunshine

768
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,940
A little planet called X-19

769
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,600
No flowing rivers, no communists

770
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,080
Just poison, vapor and electric mist

771
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,380
What do you know?

772
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,580
What do you know?

773
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,840
What do you know?

774
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,100
What do you know?

775
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,440
She's driving me mad

776
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,400
I see and I see bad

777
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,560
Oh no, it happened again

778
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,660
And every time it goes

779
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,300
I put her in my sights

780
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,500
I jump like Geronimo

781
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:52,860
And move the nutritional

782
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,260
Line

783
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:07,980
I see out of the sky

784
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,760
Ahtop with Summeransa

785
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,920
Now up here

786
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,260
Now up here

787
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,560
There's a place where there's no sunshine

788
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,220
A little planet called XY9

789
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,660
No flowing rivers, no communists

790
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,040
Just poison, vapor, and electric mist

791
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,180
There's a place where there's no sunshine

792
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,840
A little planet called XY9

793
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,200
No flowing rivers, no communists

794
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,620
Just poison, vapor, and electric mist

795
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,120
What do you know?

796
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,280
What do you know?

797
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,300
Chaz Smith's Einstein's Secret Orchestra

798
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,600
A song about Planet X

799
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,820
From the rare album Sex in Another Dimension

800
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,380
I've worked with that Cleveland band for years

801
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,100
Michelle George on electric violin

802
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,020
Dave DeLuca on guitar

803
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,580
Bob Muzzick drums

804
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,200
Regis Sedlock music

805
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,200


806
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:41,600
Mixin'

807
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,520
Well, sir, ma'am, X Day is a-comin'

808
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,120
Including an actual real-life gathering

809
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
At Landa Id in Florida

810
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,380
I'm about to play audio of the section about X Day Drills

811
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,260
From Sandy Boone's new documentary

812
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,280
J.R. Bob-Dob's and the Church of the Subgenius

813
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,520
Now streaming everywhere but Netflix

814
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,020
The voices you'll hear are

815
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,640
Irreverent Friday Jones

816
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,020
Papa Joe Mama

817
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,540
Dr. Legume

818
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,160
Onan Canobite

819
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,200
Hal Robbins

820
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,580
Doug Wellman

821
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,860
Me and Dr. Philo Drummond

822
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,260
ips.com

823
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:33,480
I mean this is the fulcrum event of human history

824
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,720
This is when we finally get our history back in our own hands

825
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,740
What an ad

826
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,320
It's time to join the subgenius revolution!

827
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,380
The countdown has begun. It's like Christmas, you know? Santa's coming. Santa's coming real soon.

828
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,300
We've got the shortwave. Tune in and hear Santa delivering his little gifts of death and destruction.

829
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:01,060
That next day you always see all sorts of different people and they all have this kind of common sense of humor, a warped sense of humor, a dark sense of humor.

830
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,040
And I find dark sense of humor to be the most fascinating type of sense of humor because it's taboo.

831
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:14,220
You could talk about all these taboo subjects and make jokes about things that polite company would find extremely distasteful.

832
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,380
Find out if he's really Jewish!

833
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,440
He's not Jewish if he's not!

834
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:35,220
It was cool as shit. I was a socially awkward person and suddenly, you know, after a couple of sermons, I could go to half the towns on the East Coast and people would open their doors to me, buy me dinner.

835
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,020
And I was like, I'm going to be a good man.

836
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:45,900
About a week ago, I had a vision of 7 o'clock coming and Reverend Stang getting up on stage and making some kind of lame excuse why the saucers didn't come.

837
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,160
And some bent dumbass out in the audience just putting a bullet in.

838
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,620
We're missing Jesus and Stang.

839
00:39:55,220 --> 00:40:04,100
Perhaps there are some amongst us that are worried that if nothing shows up in 20 minutes, they're going to get themselves beat to a bloody pulp.

840
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,180
What?

841
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,920
There's a white limo pulling up!

842
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,740
It is a white limousine!

843
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,140
Hail the limousine!

844
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,860
Of course, there's tremendous feeling of anticipation.

845
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,260
20 years ago, I thought 1998 was a million years off.

846
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,440
Jeez, it's really coming. This is really happening.

847
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:33,580
This is the original handwritten note in J.R. Bob Dog's own hand that says,

848
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,020
The world ends here.

849
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,700
July 5th, 7 a.m., 1998.

850
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,880
All right!

851
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,200
This is the original paper touched by Bob.

852
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:53,540
It's been difficult to be patient, but I knew that if I just persevered, I'd be able to say goodbye from above, from the saucers.

853
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,140
30 seconds.

854
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:03,240
Here's this joke that I've been telling myself and other people for over half my life.

855
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,000
13, 12, 13.

856
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:17,240
11, 6, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

857
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,980
Suck up if they can't take a joke!

858
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,660
And then the saucers didn't show up.

859
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:35,660
At one time, this date was comfortably far in the future.

860
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:48,400
But it has turned out that the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses did not descend on that occasion to lift us all off into universes of slag.

861
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,420
Everybody was looking around, looking around at each other.

862
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,180
He's a charlatan!

863
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,060
That fucking charlatan's been lying to us all these years!

864
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,540
There ain't no Bob Dog, it's just a fucking doll!

865
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,160
It's a fucking dummy!

866
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,240
I just did what Bob told me to do!

867
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,820
I had a real philosophical problem with the X-Day thing, and I still have a hard time remembering the date.

868
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:21,020
Because in any religion, if you have an end-of-the-world date, I think it should be written into the bylaws that that date has to happen long after you, the person issuing the date, is dead.

869
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,020
You don't put it just a few years later.

870
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,480
We never really expected the church to go to 1998.

871
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:32,000
Back in 1981, we set 98 out there because it was still way out there.

872
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,940
We tried to warn him, children.

873
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,760
He wouldn't listen.

874
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:45,060
You can't take all the money, all the girls and all the slag, and never have to pay it back.

875
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,860
We're gonna need a good lubricant, aren't we, children?

876
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:58,260
I guess to be honest, I'd have to say that I never really expected any flying saucers.

877
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,680
To be honest,

878
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,280
a lot of this stuff is really, really stupid.

879
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:13,140
But I guess a lot of people need something really stupid in their lives to give it meaning.

880
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,580
I don't know. It's still a pretty beautiful world we've got here.

881
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,900
And Bob is still a very important part of my life and always will be.

882
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,340
There was some sense that now, now what?

883
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,880
From across the nation they came and they saw

884
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,660
A new will begin in northern Arkansas

885
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,140
They rose in storms and hurled at night

886
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,040
To the new awakening and talk, talk and die

887
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,140
They shared seeds of love and grew in time

888
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,140
The journey was dead and they were meeting in time

889
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,100
The body was there but they were new

890
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,280
There was mostly cool guys like me and you

891
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:10,160
And we got high, so high on the ground too

892
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:18,640
Yeah, we got high, so high on the ground too

893
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:24,760
We ate lots of mushrooms to commune with nature

894
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,940
How are we to know we'd have to move our ship later?

895
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,720
Five hundred colors flashed into my brain

896
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,840
My cell division occurred in three or four planes

897
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,860
My brain was blasted, my head feeling fixed

898
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,780
My eyeballs protruded but I didn't get sick

899
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:49,060
We packed up my tips but we kept seeing dots

900
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,060
Yeah, we found that the peak had gotten all the best spots

901
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,200
So we got high, so high

902
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,760
So high on the ground too

903
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:06,940
Yeah, we got high, so high on the ground too

904
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,320
The people were happy, they were all having fun

905
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,520
While Dr. Sparback was farming skulls in the sun

906
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,540
The corpses were swinging, their love did abound

907
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:25,680
The average corpse floated a foot off the ground

908
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,740
The bandit dare not watch him die

909
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,820
The bandit's name was the only thing in his name

910
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:34,020
While his doctors on the flint shell were claiming their fame

911
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,860
Sparkdog explosion and combo gang fun

912
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,800
Finishes their sin just in time for life

913
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:47,560
And we got high, so high on the ground too

914
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:55,880
Yeah, we got high, so high on the ground too

915
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,900
With two people that liked Pakistan

916
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:17,900


917
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:17,900


918
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:17,900


919
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,980
The bandit even killed Arä¸å¤«

920
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,380
The bandit locked him up on all sides

921
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,520
Then , without any issues, was killed

922
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,860
The bandit hid his hippo, Reptilander and BÃ¼tzen

923
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,880
He had his sleeping bagigger

924
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:27,880


925
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:27,880


926
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:27,880


927
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,720
full of bottles of gin

928
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,280
Ah yes, dear friends, the swinging love corpses

929
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,760
Gonna go back there, I'll even meet the Pope

930
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,740
Better make it to Toc-Toc, or just give up hope

931
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,660
The dead will be walking, maybe Bob will appear

932
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:03,820
The sound of chainsaws will be all that you hear

933
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,860
Now I'm gonna go back, and I won't be stopped

934
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:12,040
I'm gonna go back to smoke the ultimate frown

935
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,700
You just can't imagine what it's like to go

936
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,280
When reality's on hold, and Toc-Toc's the show

937
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,440
We got one!

938
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,340
One!

939
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,320
One!

940
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,300
Hi!

941
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,320
Go hi?

942
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,260
...Toc-Toc!

943
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:40,660
Oh yeah, oh, yeah!

944
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,260
I climb down- I climbed up all the way to the top

945
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,820
I took, I took everything you could think of

946
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,000
I shot.

947
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,240
I smoked.

948
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,140
I smoked heroin...

949
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,800
I sorted marijuana.

950
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,360
I stuck a stiff glue.

951
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:12,640
I put barbiturate repositories in my rectal cavity.

952
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,400
The Swingin' Love Corpses, Philo on vocals.

953
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,860
That song is about the pre-X Day subgenius events called Doc Stock,

954
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:26,020
but it perfectly describes the average X Day drill as well.

955
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,700
And now, Oingo Boingo.

956
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,840
Oingo Boingo.

957
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,060
Little people with tiny brains.

958
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,720
Little bullets flowing in their veins.

959
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,360
What do they want? What do they want?

960
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,660
Little airplanes with tiny bombs.

961
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,000
Two squadrons dropping dimples on their palm.

962
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,220
They want you, you, you, you, you, you.

963
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,020
Look at them!

964
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:00,980
Look at them!

965
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,480
Look at them!

966
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,460
Look at them!

967
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,460
Look at them!

968
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:06,500
Look at them!

969
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:07,900
Look at them!

970
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:07,900


971
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,040
Yeah.

972
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,160
Yeah.

973
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,360
Hey, that's the difference with the machine.

974
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:21,420
You look like you're gone, but yourumba is flying.

975
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:21,440


976
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:21,440


977
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:21,800
Hi-ha!

978
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,840
guitar solo

979
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,860
guitar solo

980
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,120
Tiny people with little guns

981
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,060
Little armies march to little drums

982
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,480
What do they want? What do they want?

983
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,780
Tiny soldiers with little guns

984
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,000
Little tanks no bigger than your bomb

985
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,640
They want you, you, yeah, you, you, you

986
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:29,980
guitar solo

987
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:57,060
Tiny people with little guns

988
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,920
Tiny people with little guns

989
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,480
Tiny people with little guns

990
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,580
That's such a perfect image for what we're going through right now,

991
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,820
what's trying to pierce our humble little books.

992
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,100
And there you see,

993
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,480
Yeah, once the administration is in place.

994
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,220
The administration is in place now.

995
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,640
You know, at least with Clinton,

996
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,440
it was a literal screw.

997
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:32,620
Yeah, right.

998
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,560
When they said you were getting screwed,

999
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,280
that's exactly what they meant.

1000
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,380
I mean, that's what it was.

1001
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,460
That meant if you were like some blonde fired...

1002
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,840
This secondary thing, it's like,

1003
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,400
think how many Monica Lewinsky's there are in between us and George now.

1004
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,320
And none of them are cute.

1005
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:50,760
None of them are cute.

1006
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:51,560
None of them are cute.

1007
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,060
None of them are cute.

1008
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:52,080
Everyone is like,

1009
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,360
they're just more ugly, old white men,

1010
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,480
all the way down the line,

1011
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:58,080
except for a few old white women

1012
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,000
who are really ugly old white men in disguise.

1013
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,400
Well, that is where our power structure is today.

1014
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,200
We have 500 ugly old women disguised

1015
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,400
as 500 ugly old men.

1016
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,840
Now there's like thousands of them.

1017
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,340
Mm-hmm.

1018
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:17,200
Most of them don't even look as much like a woman as she does.

1019
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,860
Or even as much like Janet.

1020
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,780
Same much.

1021
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,200
Same much.

1022
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,340
I mean, hey, I don't judge a book by its cover.

1023
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:29,380
I judge it by how many pages are stuck together.

1024
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,360
Here you come fully equipped with a bunch of those quotable quotes.

1025
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:38,620
Janis Joplin or Janet Reno, who sang the blues better?

1026
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:44,980
With a grading system of 10 to 9, in what way?

1027
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,420
Who had more soul?

1028
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,740
Who had the greater range?

1029
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,600
Who does ball and chain better might be another way to look at it.

1030
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,400
That was erudite.

1031
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,340
That was laconic.

1032
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,300
That was lugubrious.

1033
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,920
I mean, forget all of that.

1034
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,380
That was quick.

1035
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,220
That was a panacea.

1036
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,200
Love is like a ball and a chain, yay, yay, yay, yay, baby.

1037
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,100
Oh, my gosh.

1038
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:05,900
Oh, my God.

1039
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,100
We just watched one of his strangest.

1040
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,000
We're looking at the Internet monitor right now.

1041
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,680
We're not going to get the Internet porno on the radio anymore.

1042
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,600
Higgins, forgive the bluntness, but if I'm to be in this business,

1043
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,640
I shall be a responsible.

1044
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,520
I'm responsible for the girl.

1045
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,100
I hope it's clearly understood that no advantage is to be taken of her position.

1046
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,300
What, that thing?

1047
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,120
Sacred, I assure you.

1048
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,820
Come now, Higgins, you know what I mean.

1049
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,020
This is no trifling matter.

1050
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,620
Are you a man of good character where women are concerned?

1051
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,600
Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?

1052
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,540
Yes, very frequently.

1053
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,260
Well, I haven't.

1054
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,920
I find the moment a woman makes friends with me,

1055
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,120
she becomes jealous, exacting, suspicious, and a damn nuisance.

1056
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,720
And I find the moment that I'm not.

1057
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,440
I make friends with a woman, I become selfish and tyrannical.

1058
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,980
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor and likely to remain so.

1059
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:03,420
Well, after all, Pickering, I'm an ordinary man who desires nothing more than just an ordinary chance

1060
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:08,240
to live exactly as he likes and do precisely what he wants.

1061
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:16,020
An average man of mine, of no eccentric whim, who likes to live his life free of strife,

1062
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,700
doing whatever he thinks is right.

1063
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,160
And he does whatever he thinks is best for him.

1064
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,620
Well, just an ordinary man.

1065
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:31,060
But let a woman in your life, and your serenity is through.

1066
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,120
She'll redecorate your home from the cellar to the dome,

1067
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,560
then go on to the enthralling fun of overhauling you.

1068
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,560
Let a woman in your life, and you're up against a wall.

1069
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,480
Make a plan, and you will find.

1070
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:52,340
She has something else in mind, and so rather than do either, you do something else that neither likes at all.

1071
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:56,540
You want to talk of Keats or Milton.

1072
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,000
She only wants to talk of love.

1073
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:04,540
You go to see a play or ballet and spend it searching for her glove.

1074
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,620
Let a woman in your life, and you invite eternal strife.

1075
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:16,440
Let them buy their wedding bands for those anxious little hands.

1076
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:22,900
I'd be equally as willing for a dentist to be drilling than to ever let a woman in my life.

1077
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:32,500
I'm a very gentle man, even-tempered and good-natured, whom you never hear complain,

1078
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:37,400
who has the milk of human kindness by the court in every vein.

1079
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:41,040
A patient man am I, down to my fingertips.

1080
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,420
The sort who never could, ever would, let an insulting man in.

1081
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,040
Remark, escape his lips.

1082
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,820
A very gentle man.

1083
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:59,940
But let a woman in your life, and patient hasn't got a chance.

1084
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:05,600
She will beg you for advice, your reply will be concise, and she'll listen very nicely,

1085
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,760
then go out and do precisely what she wants.

1086
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:14,360
You are a man of grace and polygamy, who never spoke above a hush.

1087
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,420
Now all at once, you're...

1088
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,000
You're using language that would make a sailor blush.

1089
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:24,860
Let a woman in your life, and you're plunging in a knife.

1090
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,980
Let the others of my sex tie the knot around their necks.

1091
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:38,740
I'd prefer a new edition of the Spanish Inquisition than to ever let a woman in my life.

1092
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,860
I'm a quiet living man,

1093
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:48,560
who prefers to spend the evenings in the silence of his room.

1094
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:53,120
Who likes an atmosphere as restful as an undiscovered tomb.

1095
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,920
A pensive man am I, a philosophic joy.

1096
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:04,320
Who likes to meditate, contemplate, free from humanity's mad, inhuman noise.

1097
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,420
Quiet living man.

1098
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:12,740
But...

1099
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:13,840
Let a woman in your life, and patient hasn't got a chance.

1100
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,600
Let a woman in your life, and your sabbatical is through.

1101
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,700
In a line that never ends, come an army of her friends,

1102
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:23,980
come to jab her and to chatter and to tell her what the matter is with you.

1103
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:31,060
She'll have a booming, boisterous family, who will descend on you en masse.

1104
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:36,080
She'll have a large, Wagnerian mother, with a voice that shatters glass.

1105
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,200
Let a woman in your life...

1106
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,540
Hey, Monty's never to see the boy, eh? I say this to you.

1107
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,600
Let her. Let her see her. Let her see her.

1108
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,100
Let a woman in your life...

1109
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,020
My very own Sonia Monty's face.

1110
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:42,900
All right, now you go say that to the...

1111
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:04,340
I shall never let a woman in my life...

1112
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:10,960
Rex Harrison singing in My Fair Lady.

1113
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,880
Of course, by the end of the show, you'll be singing in my fair lady.

1114
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:12,880


1115
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:12,880


1116
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:12,880


1117
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:12,880


1118
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:12,880


1119
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,160
Oh, he's singing a different tune.

1120
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,720
A friend of mine said that was his theme song when he was fourteen.

1121
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:23,020
Anyway, friends, this is Hour of Slack, and for more information on pretty much anything,

1122
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:29,600
start with subgenius.com, and then follow any old rabbit hole you jolly well please.

1123
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,580
They're all bottomless.

1124
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,880
That's subgenius.com.

1125
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:38,920
For all the Facebook pages, Google forums, Discord and Mastodon and whatnot forums,

1126
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,840
and the X Day events, whatever.

1127
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,440
It's there.

1128
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,140
And with that, I'm out of here, Price Bob.

1129
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,680
Thanks to the Empire Jazz Orchestra there for the music.

1130
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:52,180
Yeah.
