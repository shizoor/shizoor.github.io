1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Yeah, feel that bump on Bob's dome.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's see, Bob.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,920
Oh, hey, that is a good one. What happened?

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,800
The Subgenius Valor of Slack.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,740
It's time for the show!

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,100
Not this show, but the Time for the Show show.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,200
After about 35 years of Valor of Slack,

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,540
the Puzzling Evidence show,

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,060
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse,

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,760
National Cynical Radio,

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,720
and Radio Synesthesia,

12
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,080
there are now new subgenius shows

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,020
by people who are only in their 30s and 40s and 50s

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,200
instead of their 60s and 70s and 80s,

15
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,760
of which Time for the Show is the oldest,

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,400
clocking in at 17 weekly episodes so far.

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,160
In fact, because I'm leaving for Portugal tomorrow

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,160
to shoot Dr. G. Gordon Gordon

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,740
for letting Bob get shot,

20
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,960
I'm just going to save myself some rushed editing

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,060
and play the first half,

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,480
of that two-hour 17th podcast episode.

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,180
So, say hello to Argus, Fid, and Pease,

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,640
those smart-alecky, high-jinx, committin' scallywags

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,180
whose cuss words I'll have to cut out

26
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,700
for the broadcast version.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,900
Thank y'all.

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,940
Time for the show.

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,060
Time for the show.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Time for the show.

31
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,600
Time for the show.

32
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,120
Tonight on Time for the Show,

33
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,140
Reverend Sick Pease

34
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,080
shares his grandmother's towel casserole recipe.

35
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,080
Dr. Fox shares Reverend Pease's grandmother's

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,440
towel casserole recipe.

37
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,800
And I share my director's commentary

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,080
on Reverend Fox's sharing

39
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,440
of Reverend Pease's sharing

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,720
of his grandmother's towel casserole.

41
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,000
Stand by for time for the show.

42
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Yeah!

43
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,720
Is this, is it really time for the show?

44
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,420
Oh, man, that makes me so happy

45
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,540
to be back with all of you.

46
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,060
All of my friends.

47
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,420
It's doing so well.

48
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:30,860
It is.

49
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,080
We should do a show.

50
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,340
Should we?

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,660
It's time.

52
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,380
What are we gonna do?

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,700
Is it time for the show show?

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,260
You know, I did more promotions today for this show

55
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,100
than I think I have in, like, the past month.

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,140
And I even came up with, like, stupid crap to talk about

57
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,220
and I'm sitting here and I've got nothing.

58
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,780
Here comes listener number three.

59
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,400
Well, we did a live show on Friday

60
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,000
and now it's Monday.

61
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,720
And we're live again.

62
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,760
It wasn't until, like, 5 p.m.

63
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,340
We said, oh, hey, guys, it's Monday.

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,780
Oh, hooray.

65
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,380
It's time for the show.

66
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,740
And so we scrambled all the way down.

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,560
We only had four hours to get from one end

68
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,620
of the Hypercube compound to the other.

69
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,700
We made it here in time.

70
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,000
We've got a great show.

71
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,900
We've got great music.

72
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,820
We've got my best friend Pease,

73
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,940
my handsome, handsome, lactating, special,

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
very geometrically.

75
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,280
Symmetrical friend, Reverend Pease.

76
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,240
I joined this Facebook group about a bunch of guys

77
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,400
called Involuntary Celibates, incels.

78
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,660
And so I'm not comfortable with my handsome term

79
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,060
because I'm also love shy

80
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,680
and am scorned by women sometimes.

81
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,300
You, you, Pease, scorned by women?

82
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,780
I know, it's hard to believe.

83
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,340
Yeah, I'm, dude, they gave me, like, a button

84
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,100
and a membership pack.

85
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,000
These guys are, they got all kinds of rules

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,520
like, you know, I'm not a fan of the, you know,

87
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,620
they feel like if you don't sleep with them,

88
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,380
you should get a government rating

89
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,780
and then every man that you sleep with

90
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,360
drops your rating one level.

91
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,780
It's really, really well thought out stuff.

92
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,160
Well, don't ever look a gift vegetable in the urethra.

93
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,020
That is what my father always told me.

94
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,800
And that's exactly what those women are doing.

95
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,800
When you get, when you get a grade A piece of meat,

96
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,520
like Reverend Pease,

97
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,580
come in your way and you turn your nose up,

98
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,980
then we turn our eyes blind

99
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,120
to ISIS hurting that person.

100
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,480
Wait, that hurts your feelings?

101
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,080
See, Pease, you're so accustomed to us ragging on you

102
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,980
that you don't even know when we're complimenting you.

103
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,680
No, no, I know you're complimenting me.

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,200
I'm just saying the whole thing about the ladies,

105
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,080
you know, when they're scorning me

106
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,540
because I'm an incel member now,

107
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,940
that hurts my feels

108
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,800
and it brings out my righteous manly wrath.

109
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,500
So how long have you been,

110
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
you've been an incel Reverend Pease?

111
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,460
It's, it's what, 10 o'clock now?

112
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,360
I've been doing it for about 45 minutes.

113
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,560
It seems like a nice bunch of guys on some levels.

114
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,760
How do you feel?

115
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you have like superpowers yet or something?

116
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,500
I don't know what happens when you don't drain your throat

117
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,960
for more than 45 minutes.

118
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,840
I learned that women have been suppressing me

119
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,360
and that they are not capable of rational thought.

120
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,860
So I didn't know that before.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
So that's good to know.

122
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,300
It's funny.

123
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,180
The internet's a wonderful thing

124
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,440
because you learn all these things that you didn't know.

125
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,200
Like I thought women were just awesome and squishy

126
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,960
and, you know, good to talk to and share your times with.

127
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,320
But no, that is all fallacy put out by the feminists

128
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,140
that keeps me from realizing my true incel potential

129
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,500
of being scorned by women

130
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,700
and then incredibly angry about it.

131
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,100
Reverend Pease,

132
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,480
I don't know.

133
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:57,480


134
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:57,480


135
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,360
I know that inside of you,

136
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,640
there is a man who is not getting any whatsoever

137
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,260
that's just screaming and crying and crawling to get out.

138
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,400
I know he's in there.

139
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,540
Is he?

140
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,700
Don't rip off my own bit to me.

141
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,220
I want to.

142
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,500
Reverend Pease, you have to do that to other people.

143
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,200
It's always great when we get to hear it come back.

144
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,360
And that's all this hard work that we've put in,

145
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
our writing, our jokes.

146
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,980
And that's what this show is all about.

147
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,400
It's time for the show.

148
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,020
And Dr. Fox and I are broadcasting out of the Hypercube Laboratories

149
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,360
in the former Spanish Empire.

150
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,120
Reverend Pease over there is broadcasting out of Salt Lake, Nevada, Utah.

151
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,800
That's an actual place on the planet.

152
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,020
On freethinkradio.com.

153
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,080
And that's what you're listening to this on.

154
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,580
See, Pease is so good.

155
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,100
He's just so damn good at radio.

156
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,480
It's hard to be on the same show with him.

157
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,480
He's kind of...

158
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,040
Kind of intimidating.

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,840
I don't know.

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm seeing here, I'm reading in our awesome chat

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,660
that first off, this week's episode doesn't sound like total ass.

162
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:06,860
Nice.

163
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,600
Also, Reverend Snappy Twig wanted to hire Pease

164
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,780
to do the promos for his show.

165
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,720
I would love to do that.

166
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,780
He wouldn't even have to hire me.

167
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,700
I would do it for free.

168
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,200
Yeah, he's great.

169
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,240
Well, he wants to know your address, Pease.

170
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,440
6428 Dobie Peak Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89108.

171
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,440
That's folks at home for the listening viewers at home.

172
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,800
This sound...

173
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,120
Pease.

174
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,300
That's the sound usually that you don't hear of me

175
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,160
lowering my head into my own hands.

176
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,600
But it's not out of shame or pity.

177
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,640
It's just sheer excitement, ladies and gentlemen.

178
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,140
Dear friends.

179
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,360
Dear friends.

180
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,380
Dear friends.

181
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,380
Pease is my only friend.

182
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,440
He's beautiful, handsome.

183
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,760
He's...

184
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,140
He's...

185
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,500
He's diligent.

186
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,360
Incel.

187
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,260
He's courteous.

188
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,180
He's...

189
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,100
And now he's an involuntary celibate.

190
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,880
I'm really glad that you...

191
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,840
It was involuntary.

192
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,600
I thought he was voluntary.

193
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,500
I thought that was the whole point.

194
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,720
Or is he being withheld?

195
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,120
Explain the incel concept again.

196
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,500
I didn't...

197
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,020
Argus brings up a good question.

198
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,040
For me, the viewer out of the room.

199
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,420
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,980
The viewers are...

201
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,660
I'm not really sure what the rules are

202
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,040
because the carrots cuts me off.

203
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,960
That's involuntary because I would still like to get some.

204
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:26,920
And...

205
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,720
And then, of course...

206
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,520
What would you like to get?

207
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,800
A personality?

208
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,080
A sense of humor?

209
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,120
A better job?

210
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:32,840
All?

211
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,140
But some of those guys said me being married

212
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,260
and having two kids

213
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,720
excludes me from being a member altogether.

214
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,280
And I don't think that that's right.

215
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,140
That's racist!

216
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,340
Yeah, man.

217
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:42,620
Right?

218
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,400
I don't stand for that.

219
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,260
You gotta...

220
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,740
You gotta...

221
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,320
You gotta...

222
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,500
You gotta let just...

223
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,900
Let peas be peas.

224
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,640
Oh, there we go.

225
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,240
This is this...

226
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,860
Yeah, that's why my mic sounded like garbage.

227
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,980
It was this cable.

228
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,280
I figured Danny Shagoff...

229
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,120
That we got rid of this cable.

230
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,640
I figured Danny Shagoff...

231
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,760
Can explain it all to me.

232
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,360
Yeah.

233
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:00,920
Are we...

234
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,120
Are we doing the callbacks?

235
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,800
Is this the callback episode already?

236
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,580
Just call the suicide hotline

237
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,800
and ask the operator to patch you into Danny Shagoff.

238
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,380
I'm sorry.

239
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,800
His cardboard box isn't connected right now.

240
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,500
Oh!

241
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,820
Do you have a track phone you'd like to try?

242
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,800
Talking shit on time for the show.

243
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,400
Last week's show...

244
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,460
I thought Legume was, like, super well-behaved.

245
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,240
Yeah, peas has kids, Twig.

246
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Peas has kids.

247
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,680
I've met...

248
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,680
I've met at least one.

249
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,940
Oh, that's what it is.

250
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,420
Mmm.

251
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,800
Oh, okay.

252
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,160
Now I get it.

253
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,840
Yeah, I did that.

254
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,180
Sorry.

255
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,640
All right.

256
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,320
It's live radio.

257
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,140
I bumped a thing...

258
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,640
How would I know?

259
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,160
...and now Dr. Fox has to go, oh, and, like, and make point signals to a thing that you

260
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,120
guys can't see.

261
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,720
Here, can you read?

262
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,460
Here, I'm gonna...

263
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:49,020
I've just installed this new 80 LED matrix scrolling marquee.

264
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,820
Fit, if you'll look right above your monitor there, do you see it up on the wall?

265
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,520
It should be scrolling through right now.

266
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,120
Uh, yeah.

267
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,800
Yeah, yeah.

268
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:55,860
Is it fit?

269
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,420
There we go.

270
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,460
I was wondering what that was.

271
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,300
Just keep your eyes on that for me.

272
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,820
Okay.

273
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,760
Oh, wait.

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,380
That's just...

275
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:01,980
I'm sorry.

276
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,580
That was just my stock options.

277
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,080
As you can tell, it's a...

278
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,860
Simon didn't tell me not to stop looking yet.

279
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,420
Yeah, I mean, it's livestock options, because I've invested in bullshit.

280
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,160
Who the hell is Simon?

281
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,040
Why do we gotta do what Simon says?

282
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,540
Who made him the boss of everybody?

283
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,620
Why do you have to go against the humble world of Simon?

284
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,600
Do you...

285
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,280
Because I...

286
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,980
I'm not...

287
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,240
I'm not all about doing what Simon says.

288
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
I mean, you know, why can't you mix it up?

289
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,840
Sometimes Andrew says.

290
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,960
Sometimes Fox says.

291
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:33,900
Sometimes...

292
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,900
Now we're getting somewhere.

293
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,920
Yeah, if we could get further into...

294
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,080
Yeah, let's all do what Fox says.

295
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,060
Correct.

296
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,020
It'd be a better show.

297
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,980
It'd be a better world.

298
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,480
It might be.

299
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,100
The way that the Fox says game...

300
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,920
It couldn't be worse.

301
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,620
...would go would be everybody just does the opposite.

302
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,760
When you say Fox says sit down, everybody stands up.

303
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,880
It still could work in my favor eventually.

304
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,100
No, it does work in your favor.

305
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,340
It does work in your favor because all the people that sit down...

306
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,340
Everybody stop listening to the show.

307
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,040
Yeah.

308
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,360
And see, now they're continuing to listen.

309
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:01,860
What are you doing?

310
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,300
Yeah, they're listening.

311
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,160
They're just listening just to piss us off.

312
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,020
That's the only reason they're listening is to make us mad and it's working.

313
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,600
I've been struggling with smoking cigarettes again, you know, and...

314
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,060
I find it pretty easy.

315
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,080
I just put it in my mouth right in your mouth.

316
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,180
And I found out this weird kind of thing.

317
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,800
I do good all day till I come home and I'm around.

318
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,520
I'm like, I'm gonna go buy us some cigarettes.

319
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,840
I don't know what that means.

320
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,240
Yeah, Fit buys me cigarettes.

321
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,820
Fit doesn't buy him or us cigarettes.

322
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,380
He buys me cigarettes.

323
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,640
And then I sneak some of the cigarettes.

324
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,160
I'll buy you a pack.

325
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,780
He buys me a pack.

326
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,420
And then I'll sneak some out.

327
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:44,720
Yeah.

328
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,340
I'll even like rearrange the cigarettes.

329
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,020
Cosmic has posted a picture of my house.

330
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,040
That actually was...

331
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,680
Shit.

332
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,800
You're not supposed to acknowledge it, Pete.

333
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,160
Right there in my lead.

334
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,200
That is actually my front yard.

335
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,600
That is my front yard.

336
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,560
64, 28, 70, 50.

337
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,820
I love your grass.

338
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,560
You've done so much work with it.

339
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,140
That new hypoallergenic St. Augustine, right?

340
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,760
Well, my truck's not there because obviously I'm out adventuring in the desert when this picture was taken.

341
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,720
You left one of your truck nuts in the driveway.

342
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:24,140
What we're all looking at, viewers, is Doc Cosmic, his holiness.

343
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,060
He posted a picture of Pease's actual house.

344
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,420
Because, you know, Pease likes to give his address out because he wants to get that popcorn in the mail.

345
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:44,720
So Cosmic just gave him a cold shock running all the way up what's left of Pease's spine by posting a photo of Pease's house right in the live chat.

346
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,060
If you want to get in the live chat, Doc Cosmic...

347
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,480
How could somebody get in the live chat?

348
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,460
How do they do that?

349
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,080
What if they want to get in it right now?

350
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,500
How do they do it?

351
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,040
If you, the viewer, want to become a part of the live chat...

352
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,180
You can join Dr. Fox.

353
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,600
Discord.hypercube.

354
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,420
Just go to timeforthewebsite.com.

355
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,160
Click Discord.

356
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,240
There's a link right there, right?

357
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:06,780
I'll check.

358
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,880
Just go to miriamwebster.com.

359
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,300
That's an online dictionary.

360
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,880
Look up Discord.

361
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,100
And then follow the link.

362
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,800
There's you.

363
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,720
There's the show.

364
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,180
Discord.hypercube.

365
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,160
Is that a time?

366
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,360
Is that actually going out?

367
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,600
See, we've developed.

368
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,640
We've found a problem.

369
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,880
Time warp right now.

370
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,340
It was time for the time warp.

371
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,760
But now it's time for our first song of the evening.

372
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,640
Nice.

373
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,220
I've thrown two vinyl records onto the floor here.

374
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,700
Why don't you pick up the one on the left or the one on the right?

375
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,680
Throw it on the spindle.

376
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,820
Oh, is this like a game show?

377
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,300
Yeah.

378
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,200
I have to pick the song on the left or the song on the right.

379
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,660
Oh, all right.

380
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,800
Oh, I'm going to have to go to the audience for this one.

381
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,720
What do you say, audience?

382
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,280
I'm looking.

383
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,740
Yeah, the first one.

384
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,540
If you hear the one on the right.

385
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,100
Oh, no.

386
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,180
They're saying not the one on the left.

387
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,400
Well, all right.

388
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,020
Well, we're going to go to the audience.

389
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,760
We're going to go with the one on the right.

390
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,680
Since Dr. Fox, this is a track that you yourself picked out.

391
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,820
It's Alopecia by Ego Plum.

392
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,040
And it's time for the show on Freethink Radio.

393
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,020
We'll be right back.

394
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,260
Nice.

395
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,020
line.

396
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:49,840
One, two, three.

397
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:54,980
Here we go.

398
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,400
Thank you.

399
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,200
Thank you.

400
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,980
Thank you.

401
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:29,740
Thank you.

402
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,540
Thank you.

403
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,640
Thank you.

404
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:46,480
Thank you.

405
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,000
Thank you.

406
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,320
Thank you.

407
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,340
Thank you.

408
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,080
Thank you.

409
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,200
Thank you.

410
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:24,980


411
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,580
Thank you.

412
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,260
Thank you.

413
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,180
Thank you.

414
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,580
Thank you.

415
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,740
Thank you.

416
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,360
or maybe I want to make a little flag for when I'm assaulting the desert.

417
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,780
Where could I go to get that kind of merchandise?

418
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,440
Where can you get that kind of merchandise?

419
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,620
This is the show now.

420
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Right now, nowhere, because we've actually sold out of Dr. Fox and the Right Angles t-shirts and patches.

421
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,540
Well, I'm glad I got mine then.

422
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,040
We have completely sold out as of the last show.

423
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,380
Are there still stickers?

424
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,080
So, yes, we do have new designs coming.

425
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,440
Nude designs.

426
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,660
We have nude designs coming and going.

427
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,700
Mostly coming.

428
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:47,240
And with that, you'll be able to get new shirts, including shirts that we'll reveal next week for season two of time for the show.

429
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,360
We should know that we've already tested the t-shirts.

430
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,340
We've already tested the t-shirts on several dozen babies, and only one of them died.

431
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,720
So they're pretty much baby safe.

432
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,520
Oh, they come in extra, extra, extra, extra.

433
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,560
It's better than one out of ten.

434
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,980
Less than one out of ten.

435
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,840
Yes, definitely less than one out of ten.

436
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,260
That's better than Dentine Gum.

437
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,280
0.78 out of ten babies did not make it through trials.

438
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,060
Well, that's the same record Dentine Gum has.

439
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,800
That baby was an asshole, though.

440
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:21,260
And if Dentine Gum is safe, then, of course, these patches have to be.

441
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,780
Nobody likes that baby.

442
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,820
Just between me and you.

443
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,440
Whisper into the microphone.

444
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,540
That makes good radio.

445
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,000
Whisper.

446
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,660
Good radio.

447
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,760
I don't know.

448
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,960
I don't know.

449
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,660
I just live here.

450
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:43,940
If you could hear me whisper into the microphone right now, text YES to 460-597-9802.

451
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:50,780
No, what you need to do is if you can hear us, you need to send us a text at 321-765-5107.

452
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,660
Fox, F-A-U-X.

453
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,780
Don't be fooled by the message.

454
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,240
I got fooled by the message, kid.

455
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,440
No, we changed the message, peas.

456
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,160
We changed the message.

457
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,720
But you can leave us a voicemail at that number, or you can text us if you don't have access to Discord.

458
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,700
And I'll be sure to get Discord links back up on the website.

459
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,300
Did you check the thing to see if we got any new important messages this week?

460
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,440
Should I check?

461
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,740
Let me think here.

462
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,420
Yeah, that's coming up later on in the show, so definitely stay tuned for that.

463
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,240
That's what you call it.

464
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,140
Tease, peas.

465
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,400
I want to change your name to Reverend Tease.

466
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,720
Oh, look at you.

467
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,740
I'm going to change your name, Reverend Tease, because that's what you mean.

468
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,920
Don't you sexualize me.

469
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,500
Try to stop me.

470
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,680
Try to stop me, peas.

471
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,300
I love you.

472
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,000
You're handsome.

473
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,880
You're precious.

474
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,220
What's the adventures you guys got coming up?

475
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,960
You got a new Right Angle show coming up?

476
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,080
Man, I've had quite enough adventures for the last...

477
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,720
I could...

478
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,040
You know what happened.

479
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,780
I didn't tell you what happened, peas.

480
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,900
You didn't?

481
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,460
Tell me now.

482
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:02,200
I already mentioned that our band played Dr. Fox and the Right Angles.

483
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,680
I'm not Dr. Fox.

484
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,160
I'm just a Right Angle.

485
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,500
But, yeah, we played a show on Friday or Saturday.

486
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:18,160
I can't remember which one it was, because where we played, you know, we were at one

487
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,020
of those places where the bar likes to...

488
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:26,320
You know, not stay open after closing time, because you can't do that.

489
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,260
That's against the law.

490
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,340
That would not be allowed.

491
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,420
No, no, no, no, no.

492
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,800
And if anybody did that, we would promptly report them to Dick Tracy himself.

493
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:36,960
But...

494
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,660
So what do you guys do?

495
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,800
You get a big Magic the Gathering game going when the bar closes?

496
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,800
Well, what happened was you just...

497
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,740
It turns out that after closing time, if the owner of the place just stacks a bunch of

498
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,000
chairs in front of the door and leaves, you're not allowed to do that.

499
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,600
He locks it.

500
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,140
You know?

501
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,780
That, uh...

502
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,080
Then you can run a bottle service.

503
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,520
Uh...

504
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,480
Yeah.

505
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,000
Oh, oh, I'm getting the...

506
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,620
Yeah.

507
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:02,920
Yeah.

508
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,500
Anyway, what happened was we stayed...

509
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,680
Dr. Fox is censoring me live on the air.

510
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,460
You're not reading the marquee.

511
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,700
If you're wondering what live...

512
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:12,920
Read the marquee.

513
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,980
He's telling me not to say sensitive stuff, okay?

514
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:20,700
And I thought I was dancing around the sensitivities pretty well.

515
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,020
But no, he's...

516
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,860
You viewers at home can see him shaking his head.

517
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,260
I mean...

518
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,440
Okay, so here's the point piece.

519
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,140
Here's...

520
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,460
Let me just cut to the chase.

521
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,060
Make it.

522
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,140
Make it, brother!

523
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:41,820
So we were up until like five with, you know, still with drinks a-flowing and frop a-blowing

524
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,120
and songs a-going and it was a good old time.

525
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,060
And then there happened to be a lawyer from NASA.

526
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,700
Because as you know, here in the...

527
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,300
The former Spanish Empire is where the Kennedy Space Center is based.

528
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:03,700
There happened to be a female lawyer of NASA who took a liking to me and pees.

529
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,020
I got lost in the woods again.

530
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:15,800
I ended up going back to Mission Control and I had neglected to bring my phone with me

531
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,360
to the gig in the first place.

532
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,420
So when I went back to Mission Control...

533
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,220
You told me not to talk about that ever.

534
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:20,800
You said that...

535
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,980
I had no way to get back in touch with Dr. Fox and let him know that I was okay.

536
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,560
So he had no idea.

537
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,800
And I had no idea where I was.

538
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,680
I had no idea where I was because she had no idea how to get back to her house from the place.

539
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,520
So we took this zig-zag-oey, uh, zig-zag-oey, wing-a-wanda-oey path back to her house.

540
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,840
So I didn't know where I was.

541
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,260
They might as well put a goddamn bag over my head.

542
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:45,920
Right?

543
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,360
So a drunken lawyer from NASA...

544
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,860
Yes.

545
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,780
...takes you on a...

546
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,140
...takes you on a nefarious trip to her lair...

547
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,160
Oh, yes!

548
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,660
...where she then manhandles you and leaves your friends to wonder if you're alive or dead.

549
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah.

550
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,140
And let me tell you...

551
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,200
Let me tell you something.

552
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:05,960
This...

553
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,080
This NASA lawyer...

554
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,260
And when she said that to us in the car...

555
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,500
Did she have space moves?

556
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,480
Did she have space moves, dude?

557
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,140
Oh!

558
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,820
Well, yeah, gravity is not always a law.

559
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,040
Put it that way.

560
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,540
Okay.

561
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:20,760
Okay.

562
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:20,760


563
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,120
But, uh...

564
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,300
She...

565
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:22,960
We...

566
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,660
When, uh...

567
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,340
When she said she was a lawyer for NASA in the car, I was like, uh...

568
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,720
I knew she was crazy.

569
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,080
Sure, yeah.

570
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,740
Because she is...

571
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,380
Believe it or not, she is nine and a half buckets of crazy.

572
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,040
So when she said she was a lawyer for NASA, I was like, oh, yeah, sure.

573
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

574
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,920
Are you an indigo child, too?

575
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,120
What else is going on?

576
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,420
Get back to her house.

577
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:44,860
Did she hear about the peas?

578
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,800
Turns out...

579
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,580
Did she know about the peas?

580
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,620
Everybody knows about peas, man.

581
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,680
Okay, it's a given.

582
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,520
It's a stupid question.

583
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:50,900
I'm sorry.

584
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,920
That you were her second favorite host of Time for the Show.

585
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,940
Do you know who her first favorite host was?

586
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,800
Artist Q Fox, obviously.

587
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,360
Nope, you too.

588
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,760
You are her number one and number two favorites out of the three of us.

589
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,680
So that just goes to show how much she liked you.

590
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,780
She had the crazy talk, but did she have those really good crazy eyes that you go, oh...

591
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,540
When you see those crazy eyes, you're like, I'm in for a good time.

592
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,800
This is going to be a good ride.

593
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,340
Uh...

594
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,360
Well, it...

595
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,960
Her...

596
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,680
Her craziness...

597
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,560
Her craziness was superficially evident.

598
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,580
Uh...

599
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,540
You know, you...

600
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,460
Spend two seconds with her.

601
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,040
Could she be listening to the show right now?

602
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,040
Could she be listening to the show right now?

603
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
I don't care, really.

604
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,060
Um...

605
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,420
You don't.

606
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,060
Well...

607
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,020
I don't...

608
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,180
There'll be no follow-up.

609
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,400
There'll be no follow-up.

610
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,380
We're getting lost in the woods.

611
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:35,960
We're getting lost in the woods right now.

612
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,460
Well, actually, you're right, P.

613
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,200
She is...

614
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,080
She is a lawyer.

615
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,200
So, maybe I shouldn't say too much.

616
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,720
But, um...

617
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,800
No, but...

618
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,440
Too late now.

619
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,860
After she went to sleep, I...

620
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,520
I looked at her bookcase.

621
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,480
And she had all kinds of law books.

622
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,580
And stuff about something called tort.

623
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,920
And, uh...

624
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,620
Yeah, I know that.

625
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,640
You get on all fours and shake your butt in the air.

626
00:29:59,680 --> 00:29:59,980
That's...

627
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,920
Believe me, uh...

628
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,120
How'd you get out of her lair?

629
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,400
I mean, did you wake her up?

630
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,400
Hey, I need to go home.

631
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,740
Argus is worried about me.

632
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,220
Dude...

633
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:07,980
Or did she just walk out the door?

634
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,020
Well, here's the deal.

635
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,840
Here's the deal, P.

636
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,980
Let me explain.

637
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,380
I...

638
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,000
I don't know the city that I'm in.

639
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,040
I don't know...

640
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,880
It's Florida.

641
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,680
I don't know where she lives.

642
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,980
And I have...

643
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,680
And I don't have...

644
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,620
I have my phone on me.

645
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,620
And so that means I don't have any phone numbers.

646
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,640
And more likely you don't have shoes either.

647
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,880
You've just got your hat.

648
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,400
I didn't have shoes.

649
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,660
I did have a lab coat.

650
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,660
That's right, Dr. Fyfe.

651
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,260
I had a lab coat and my hat.

652
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
And my, uh...

653
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,500
My sacred, uh...

654
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,280
Necklace with my drum key on it to...

655
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,120
To ward off any evils.

656
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,520
Sacred drum key.

657
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,040
Um...

658
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,320
Any...

659
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,720
Any evil, um...

660
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,860
Deaf leopards.

661
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,180
The next day...

662
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:43,440
And...

663
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,460
And believe me...

664
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,300
What...

665
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,800
What I'm about to say about her is gonna make her sound cool.

666
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,400
You're gonna be like,

667
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,340
Damn, Fid.

668
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,300
How come you're not, like,

669
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,100
Like, trying to get with that?

670
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,880
But believe me.

671
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,500
She's like,

672
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,360
Eleven...

673
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,680
Eleven point seven five buckets of crazy

674
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,300
Is what we're talking about here.

675
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,300
The next day...

676
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,040
All we did...

677
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,220
We...

678
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,860
We played a lot of video games.

679
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,900
First of all,

680
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,720
We woke up.

681
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,140
And, um...

682
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,040
For breakfast...

683
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,680
Fid truly woke up.

684
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,560
That's a first.

685
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,980
Mark your calendars, everybody.

686
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,100
I woke up at nine in the morning.

687
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,440
And guess what was for breakfast?

688
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,000
On a Sunday.

689
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,300
Guess what she made for breakfast?

690
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,960
Guess what the lawyer who works for NASA

691
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,280
Made for breakfast?

692
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,720
For breakfast.

693
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,520
It was vodka and oxtail.

694
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:24,980
Yes.

695
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,880
That is delicious, dude.

696
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,540
Did you just cook the oxtail in the vodka?

697
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,220
Or you just drink the oxtail?

698
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,880
The oxtail was in the form of, uh...

699
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,500
Meat.

700
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,020
In a big bowl of, uh...

701
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,220
Like, spiced rice.

702
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,120
And she used way too much spice.

703
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,480
She said it was some kind of African dish.

704
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,760
Fucked it up.

705
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,100
But she did serve it with vodka

706
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,020
Mixed with, like, a lemon soda or something.

707
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,080
And, uh...

708
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,960
At nine in the morning, it's exquisite.

709
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,320
Oxtail and vodka.

710
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,060
This is my...

711
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,620
This has been...

712
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,840
Was it still a leathery oxtail?

713
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,400
Or was it, like, pieces?

714
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,180
Or did you have, like...

715
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:02,800
Because when I...

716
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,480
The last time I encountered oxtail soup,

717
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,460
There's quite literally an oxtail

718
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,560
With the brush tip of the tail on it

719
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
Floating in the soup.

720
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,920
Oh, then it wasn't prepared correctly.

721
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,860
That was homestyle where I was getting it at.

722
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,520
What do you know about oxtail?

723
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,820
Well, stop saying soup.

724
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,740
I made oxtails.

725
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,740
In Las Vegas, you have to take two with you.

726
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,380
I made oxtails last week.

727
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,040
How did you make it, Pease?

728
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,020
I used my Instant Pot.

729
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,760
I made a wine sauce.

730
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,640
And I braised them real quick.

731
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,760
And then I pressure cooked them for,

732
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,120
I want to say, like, an hour.

733
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,860
And then I served that over some noodles

734
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,160
With the carrot and potato slices

735
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,040
That I cooked it in.

736
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,660
It's super good.

737
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,540
Okay, so...

738
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,320
You can actually eat it, right?

739
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,120
I didn't, like...

740
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,240
I didn't, like, do anything to myself, right?

741
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,680
So listen.

742
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,780
So you got the oxtails in you.

743
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,160
You got the vodka in you.

744
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,980
Did you go back for a second?

745
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,020
Did you go back for a second helping

746
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,380
Of the squishy goodness?

747
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,320
Is that the best euphemism you can come up with?

748
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,160
Did you get one helping of squishy goodness?

749
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,420
I didn't even hear that.

750
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,820
I heard that it was...

751
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,160
That I dropped him off.

752
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:10,740
And then...

753
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,180
Or I saw...

754
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,100
I saw the last of Big Chili

755
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,880
That I would see.

756
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,900
There's no drop off.

757
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,980
We should back up.

758
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,280
Yeah.

759
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,340
Yeah.

760
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,380
Fox dropped us off.

761
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,900
And then she...

762
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,500
She told me to tell you

763
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,180
That you can go.

764
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,640
So the next thing he knows

765
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,360
I open the door and just say

766
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,380
You can go now, Dr. Fox.

767
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,980
You can go, Dr. Fox.

768
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,160
We no longer need you.

769
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,060
Well, at first she was worried.

770
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,080
She was like, I don't know who...

771
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,920
Because we're talking about me here.

772
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,900
I don't know which bald white guy

773
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,180
With a beard is the real one.

774
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,120
The guy with the...

775
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,920
The guy with the keys.

776
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,100
Yeah.

777
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,900
And the phone.

778
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,980
So I was stranded the next day

779
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,680
Is the bottom line.

780
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,160
But it's okay.

781
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,100
I'm concerned about your take on this.

782
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,120
Were you worried about your little buddy?

783
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,640
My little buddy.

784
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,920
I was lost in the woods.

785
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,700
Of course he was.

786
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,180
Yeah, after a while

787
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,260
It started getting a little worrisome.

788
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,880
You know, everybody knows

789
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,200
That I have a penchant

790
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,820
For making sure that people are okay.

791
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,300
Where's Fid?

792
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,180
And where's Fid?

793
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,260
My favorite...

794
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,660
My favorite game.

795
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,220
Which I'm playing.

796
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,580
But I didn't really play Where's Fid?

797
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,040
As much as I did just sleep all day.

798
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,120
And then I went over to my parents' house.

799
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,840
And they were expecting Fid to come over with me.

800
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,920
And they're like, hey, where's Fid?

801
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,820
And I go, I don't know.

802
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,920
Had he contacted them to let him know he was okay?

803
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,580
With what?

804
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,780
I didn't have my phone, man.

805
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,880
I was lost in the woods just like X-Day.

806
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,160
This mad, crazy NASA lawyer

807
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,240
Who served you oxtails and vodka

808
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,180
Had no phone for you to contact your friends

809
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,480
To let him know, hey...

810
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,740
Because she had my number programmed in her phone?

811
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,640
It's...

812
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,580
Well, I guess that's true.

813
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,660
Fid would not know your number off the top of his head.

814
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,420
Who knows numbers anymore?

815
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,100
I write mine on the wall next to the phone.

816
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,760
I know most of the numbers.

817
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,960
I don't know how many there are.

818
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,760
But I know, like...

819
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,520
Seven.

820
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,180
I don't know that one.

821
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,840
That's a new one on me.

822
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,160
So, anyway, you didn't answer my question.

823
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,080
Did you go back for squishy goodness seconds?

824
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,600
We got shit-faced starting at nine in the morning.

825
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,920
And, uh...

826
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,820
But that was after a night of intense lovemaking

827
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,820
where she saw God being enthralled with Fid Julie's manliness,

828
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,580
I would imagine.

829
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,560
Well, I was saving myself...

830
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,520
You were imagining it, Pease.

831
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,040
I was saving myself for you, Pease.

832
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,320
I said, no, I'm taken.

833
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,800
And you can sue me all you want.

834
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,360
And I know you can fly a space shuttle.

835
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,200
What did you do to get out of that situation?

836
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,860
Did you feign fatigue?

837
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,160
Did you sleep?

838
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,680
Did you pretend like you fell asleep?

839
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,960
But you were really sitting there hoping that you wouldn't be touched again?

840
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,640
How did this play out?

841
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,820
You really want to know?

842
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,760
I mean, obviously you went there.

843
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,420
She took you to her lair with the intention...

844
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,160
of having her way with you, I would think.

845
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,380
I wouldn't think her in-game would be vodka, oxtails, and video games.

846
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,360
That, you know, that doesn't seem normal.

847
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,660
Well, Guru Drew in the chat said this show's getting kind of gay.

848
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,160
Because I think Reverend Pease...

849
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,820
Having sex with women is gay.

850
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,300
You're trying a little too hard to live vicariously through me, Pease.

851
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,480
It's not good radio.

852
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,500
And that's gay.

853
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,260
All right, well, I'm sorry that we can't get more in-depth into Fids.

854
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:46,920
Adventure.

855
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,780
But it sounds like it was delightful.

856
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,840
Long story short, she's fucking nuts.

857
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,200
And if you didn't think...

858
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,320
If you, viewer, didn't think...

859
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,080
Fid Chuli has declared...

860
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,220
But listen...

861
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,400
He has a law.

862
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:01,920
Argus.

863
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,380
It's a law.

864
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,260
Fid has not really described one crazy thing.

865
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,520
He just says a couple of things and then says,

866
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,160
And she's 11 bags nuts.

867
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:09,980
What?

868
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,600
What?

869
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,440
What has to happen for somebody like Fid Chuli to go,

870
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,540
That person is too crazy.

871
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,160
Crazy for me.

872
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,480
Because we all know Fid Chuli's level of craziness.

873
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:20,900
Okay.

874
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,500
And awesomeness.

875
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,880
So what does it take?

876
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,640
I'll tell you what, Pease.

877
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,220
We'll find out what it takes to tip over Fid Chuli's nine and a half buckets of crazy.

878
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,260
She's a lawyer.

879
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,980
I'm not going to say it on the show.

880
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,240
She's a goddamn lawyer.

881
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,560
So I'll tell you off the show.

882
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:43,120
But in the meantime, for the viewers, we're going to play Unsquared Dance from the new Brubrek Quartet.

883
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,740
Did I say Brubrek?

884
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,320
Brubrek.

885
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,440
I meant Bruback.

886
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:46,700
Bruback.

887
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,000
It's time for the show on Freethink Radio.

888
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,720
We'll be right back after Bruback.

889
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,940
We'll be right back.

890
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:11,340
We'll be right back.

891
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,500
Thank you.

892
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,280
Thank you.

893
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,740
Thank you.

894
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,320
Thank you.

895
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:26,460
Thank you.

896
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:54,640
Thank you.

897
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,940
Thank you.

898
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,980
Thank you.

899
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,040
Thank you.

900
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,460
Thank you.

901
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,520
Thank you.

902
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,960
Thank you.

903
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,420
by the New Brubeck Quartet.

904
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,000
Those of you who are familiar with Dave Brubeck,

905
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,080
the pianist, yes, I said pianist,

906
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,680
not that other thing that your dirty mind thought I said.

907
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,280
Yeah, the New Brubeck Quartet.

908
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,160
I think it was like some of his brothers were in it or something.

909
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,340
But yeah, that was Unsquared Dance from 1978.

910
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,020
Speaking of brothers, one of the Neville brothers died this week.

911
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,000
Who?

912
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,680
One of the Neville brothers, famous.

913
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,780
Yeah, I'm familiar with that.

914
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,900
One of the Neville brothers died this week.

915
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:19,940
Which one?

916
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,920
The good one or the trouble maker?

917
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,580
The sax player.

918
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,040
The sax player.

919
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:24,860
Sax player.

920
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,260
If he's not everything is about sax, man.

921
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,120
I know that tonight is our Loveline edition episode of the show.

922
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:40,440
We're discussing all of the important matters of the heart.

923
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,740
Yeah, Pease, thanks.

924
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,680
So, Pease, did you want to continue grilling?

925
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,140
Thanks for getting me sued.

926
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:51,240
Yeah, I just got a letter in the mail just now.

927
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:58,900
It was a cease and desist order and a subpoena and a contract for my soul.

928
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,560
All three of those things came from NASA just now.

929
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,840
Here's my thoughts, dude.

930
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:09,900
The lady says that she's a lawyer for NASA and then you go off and have this odyssey.

931
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,080
Come on, are we still going on about this?

932
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,440
And the thing about it is, is we don't even know.

933
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,420
And you don't even know.

934
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,940
She's probably not even a lawyer.

935
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,700
She probably didn't even work for NASA.

936
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,300
She's probably, you know, some clerk at Kmart and you're all coward and stuff.

937
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,240
I still want to know what it takes.

938
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,760
What amount of craziness does it take for Fid Chula to go to tap out?

939
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,300
Well, this chick was definitely a blue light special.

940
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:33,860
I'm tapped out.

941
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,540
Yeah, Fox will tell you.

942
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,300
He talked to her.

943
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,020
Go ahead.

944
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,520
Tell Pease all about how crazy she was while I pissed.

945
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,560
First, she met me.

946
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,080
And that's why I introduced her to Fid.

947
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,400
I said, yeah, you're nice.

948
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,060
Here, come meet this guy.

949
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,320
He's a drummer.

950
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,440
Yeah.

951
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,040
Yeah.

952
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:55,760
And not mine.

953
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,680
Just a drummer.

954
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,300
Have a blast.

955
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,720
And I'll tell you, the number one thing that she told Fid last night was, you talk too much.

956
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,780
The second thing she told him the most was, shut up.

957
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:09,740
Nice.

958
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,680
So, there'll be no second date?

959
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,560
I figured.

960
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,160
I figured there was.

961
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,220
Apparently, he was invited out for shots and Pokemon Go.

962
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,940
But I really think he just wanted to Pokemon Go the fuck home.

963
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,100
Yes, I did.

964
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:27,940
And I want to Pokemon get the fuck off of this topic, too.

965
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,380
Dude, you totally denied Pokemon at all.

966
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:36,600
You jumped from this crazy car ride to drinking vodka in the morning.

967
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,260
And I know there was deets in between that.

968
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,400
And I didn't even know that there might not have been a second Pokemon session because you missed the great soiree.

969
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,880
Anyways, the text is just the same as you posted it.

970
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:05,840
There is no date.

971
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,480
So many

972
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,620
blind eyes.

973
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,820
We gotta move on.

974
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,580
We gotta move on.

975
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,420
We can't just talk about this the whole show.

976
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,680
So we gotta move on to the blind eyes.

977
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,260
Absolutely think we could talk about this for the whole show.

978
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:26,580
Really?

979
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,220
Because,

980
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,100
you know,

981
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,760
you ever think,

982
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:29,960
Pease,

983
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,520
maybe there's a reason why I'm not getting into certain details

984
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,640
live on Canadian radio?

985
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,920
I share everything with my life on the radio.

986
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:39,740
We know.

987
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,960
Always leave them wanting more,

988
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,580
Pease.

989
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,600
You know,

990
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,680
I can't give the whole story.

991
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,600
Yeah, save it for the trial, please.

992
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,780
Save it for the trial.

993
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,060
I don't want you guys to be able to testify against me, man.

994
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,520
Pease,

995
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,780
she was super clingy.

996
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,320
She wanted me to basically, like,

997
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,300
move in with her,

998
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:56,620
like,

999
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,340
then.

1000
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,040
Like, after, like, that.

1001
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,180
Like, one night.

1002
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:00,680
Okay?

1003
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,220
She was fucking crazy.

1004
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,200
Okay?

1005
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,840
I was super bummed because she was working up to me

1006
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,280
and I realized I still had my wedding ring on.

1007
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,260
Alright, blind eyes.

1008
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,620
That's why I had to get Pease.

1009
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:13,160
Blind eyes.

1010
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,300
I gotta get Pease.

1011
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,940
Or, no, I gotta get Fid.

1012
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,460
Get Fid in the car.

1013
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,700
That way I can't screw up.

1014
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,200
I'll just pass off.

1015
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,260
You know, some people, you know,

1016
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,600
hey, Fid, at least, you know,

1017
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,520
some people throw you their sloppy seconds,

1018
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,040
but at least I can throw you my fanatical firsts.

1019
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,120
They're all yours, buddy.

1020
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,880
Dr. Fox is a married man.

1021
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,780
I sure the heck am.

1022
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,620
And we're in a band together

1023
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,000
and he's the front man.

1024
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,140
So, I get all of his,

1025
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,440
his fanatical firsts.

1026
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,220
I don't even get the,

1027
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,880
I get the sloppy firsts

1028
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,100
and the sloppy seconds.

1029
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,040
You know, I don't want to go to,

1030
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,680
you know, some of us, you know,

1031
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,140
want to be in a band, you know,

1032
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:53,860
to meet girls.

1033
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,200
And I go, yeah, in the Dr. Fox show.

1034
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,980
I can only imagine what you're going to do.

1035
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,280
I don't know.

1036
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,660
I could probably meet girls.

1037
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,120
Apparently, these are the kind of girls you meet.

1038
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,620
Well, my bass player's been happy.

1039
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,140
He's been getting some,

1040
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,780
some fanatical firsts.

1041
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,680
He's a bass player.

1042
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,840
Actually, they bypassed me.

1043
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,960
They love him, the,

1044
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,820
the Latino bass machine.

1045
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:13,740
Yeah.

1046
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,720
Any bass player that's getting action,

1047
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,420
he's happy.

1048
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,540
It's a good,

1049
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,500
he's a good bass player.

1050
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,100
I don't think we'd find a better one.

1051
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,220
He's a great bass player.

1052
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,240
I don't think we'd find a better one.

1053
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,060
And as a drummer,

1054
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,240
nothing gets my stick harder.

1055
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,020
So, please don't throw him

1056
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,040
any of those girls.

1057
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,320
We'll never see him again.

1058
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,280
Van Halen didn't pay their bass player

1059
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,440
for 25 years

1060
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,760
because they just gave him

1061
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,100
his fanatical firsts.

1062
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,480
Well, dude,

1063
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,720
this is the great thing, right?

1064
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,040
We're in the band.

1065
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:36,820
It's a four piece.

1066
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,400
Dr. Fox is married.

1067
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,600
The guitarist is married.

1068
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,320
The bassist is in a relationship.

1069
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:41,760
Relationship.

1070
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:42,960
Fit.

1071
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,380
Truly.

1072
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,000
Truly.

1073
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,460
You know what that means?

1074
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:47,720
Truly.

1075
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,420
All right,

1076
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,960
but we really do have to move on.

1077
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,960
It's a live show, man.

1078
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,440
We got to,

1079
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,760
we got to get to the blind eyes.

1080
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,260
You didn't want to talk about

1081
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:54,820
Should we even do that

1082
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,520
because we're coming up

1083
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,500
to the top of the hour.

1084
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,880
Maybe we should just tease

1085
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,140
the blind eyes now.

1086
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,080
Come back to blind eyes

1087
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,060
in the top of the hour.

1088
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,420
I know Reverend Couch Sloth

1089
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,080
is going to be coming on the show

1090
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,000
or he said that he might be.

1091
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,160
Are you going to blind eye

1092
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,120
that lawyer from NASA?

1093
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:10,720
Well,

1094
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,300
I don't know.

1095
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,100
I guess you're just going to

1096
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,000
have to wait and listen.

1097
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:13,960
Right, Bees?

1098
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,540
Damn, I won't be able to wait.

1099
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,580
What song are we going to listen to?

1100
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:16,720
You're my handsome.

1101
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,820
We're not going to a song quite yet.

1102
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,020
What we are going to do

1103
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,180
is say that we,

1104
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,000
Reverend Couch Sloth

1105
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
may join us

1106
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,400
for the second hour of the show.

1107
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,540
I believe he actually,

1108
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,060
no, no, I think he's there.

1109
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,360
I think he's there.

1110
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:30,980
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1111
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,300
Snappy Twig had to take off.

1112
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,120
No, Couch Sloth, yeah.

1113
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:33,640
But yeah.

1114
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,340
He is a,

1115
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,060
not only is he a Patreon supporter

1116
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,000
of the show,

1117
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,740
he's also a pretty funny dude

1118
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,300
who's been doing

1119
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:41,300


1120
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,320
and I guess this counts

1121
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,280
as his shout out

1122
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,280
that he earned.

1123
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,420
Did he get his autographed

1124
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,260
picture of Muhammad yet?

1125
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,180
Well, he's not quite on that level.

1126
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,660
He's not donating

1127
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,320
at the $9.11 level.

1128
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,440
Okay, I'll hold back a little bit.

1129
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:57,560
Oh, there he is.

1130
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,960
He's listening to us right now.

1131
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,480
But who are,

1132
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,380
who are giving

1133
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,360
at the $9.11 level?

1134
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,400
Well, geez Louise,

1135
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,620
I guess there's a,

1136
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,000
Jesus, Jesus Christ,

1137
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:07,940
our Lord and Savior

1138
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:08,820
is giving us that level.

1139
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,520
There's Reverend Caller 23

1140
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,180
Oh.

1141
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:11,540
Oh yeah.

1142
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,440
Turn down your radio.

1143
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,280
If you're listening,

1144
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,120
Reverend Caller,

1145
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,660
please turn down your radio.

1146
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,820
He is a Patreon

1147
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,740
at the $9.11 potassium level.

1148
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,780
We also have

1149
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,400
the great,

1150
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,180
everybody loves

1151
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,060
Apostasy X Finord.

1152
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:32,460
Except for Pease.

1153
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:32,940
She's my pal.

1154
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,780
Pease doesn't care for her.

1155
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,540
And an honorary member.

1156
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,220
No, she's my pal.

1157
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,620
No, it's okay, Pease.

1158
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,820
I already said that you don't like her.

1159
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,080
We gave Drew

1160
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,040
a complimentary potassium

1161
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,180
level membership

1162
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,000
for his

1163
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,280
one time $100 gift

1164
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:46,880
to the show.

1165
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,980
So he's still getting a picture,

1166
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,000
a self-portrait

1167
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,800
of the Prophet Muhammad.

1168
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,680
Is he?

1169
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,700
And he's basically

1170
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,980
getting two months free.

1171
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,140
But you know,

1172
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,060
we'll cut that deal

1173
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:57,540
for anybody.

1174
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,800
If you want to send us

1175
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,200
$100 today,

1176
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,900
we will save

1177
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,080
$18.22

1178
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,740
off of your subscription fees

1179
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,320
for the year.

1180
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:07,780
We'll give you

1181
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,320
complimentary

1182
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,540
potassium level

1183
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,060
donation.

1184
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:10,420
Donorship.

1185
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,960
And Guru Drew,

1186
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,440
I should mention,

1187
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,240
is like sort of

1188
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:15,980
a producer,

1189
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,200
although he said

1190
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:17,840
he's not,

1191
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,800
but he really

1192
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,780
kind of is

1193
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,280
a producer

1194
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,220
of a band

1195
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:21,700
called

1196
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,600
The Brand Flakes.

1197
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,180
Right.

1198
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,260
We played them last week.

1199
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:25,900
They were awesome.

1200
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:26,920
I've been playing

1201
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,960
the hell out of them

1202
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,340
because Guru Drew,

1203
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,420
oh, it's the one

1204
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,320
about the wondering

1205
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,100
and the grandmother.

1206
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,040
Sorry, I'm talking

1207
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,800
to Dr. Fox

1208
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,080
live on the radio.

1209
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:38,900
Yeah, he's giving

1210
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,400
the engineer

1211
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,400
the opportunity

1212
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:40,400


1213
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:40,800
to do.

1214
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,460
Yeah, it's live radio.

1215
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:42,780
Are you even allowed

1216
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:42,980
to do that?

1217
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,040
What makes radio good

1218
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,200
is when the person

1219
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,180
talks to somebody

1220
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,520
that isn't on the radio

1221
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,460
and that the viewers

1222
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:50,940
don't know what

1223
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,500
they're talking about.

1224
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,480
Another thing that people

1225
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,620
that makes good radio

1226
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,600
is inside jokes.

1227
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:55,860
We've got plenty of those.

1228
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,900
And Dr. Fox,

1229
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,040
you hadn't even seen

1230
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:00,940
the little hub

1231
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,360
that Guru Drew made.

1232
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,340
Guru Drew

1233
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,280
collected sort of like

1234
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,140
all the Freethink radio

1235
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,380
and all the subgenius.

1236
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,440
radio shows

1237
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,840
and made a little hub

1238
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,600
on his website.

1239
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,240
Does it even have

1240
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,560
does it have a laboratory

1241
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,140
as well?

1242
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,280
Does it have share a slice

1243
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,100
Tuesdays at 10

1244
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,500
and then anti-social engineering

1245
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,880
Thursdays at 10?

1246
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,300
Yeah.

1247
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,280
And I think we've

1248
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,660
are there more shows

1249
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,560
on Freethink radio

1250
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:26,720
right now?

1251
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,040
He has both of those

1252
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,660
Freethink radio.

1253
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,540
Actually, Guru Drew himself

1254
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,240
is about to start

1255
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,400
a show right here

1256
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,480
on Freethink radio.

1257
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,260
It's going to be

1258
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:36,920
a morning show

1259
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,300
and it's going to be

1260
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,140
a music mix

1261
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:39,900
of his

1262
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,220
Yeah.

1263
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,380
of his picks.

1264
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,660
But I can tell you

1265
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,800
that his fingers

1266
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,920
have been in some

1267
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,000
stinky places.

1268
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,780
Am I on that show?

1269
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:48,740
I, uh,

1270
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,900
yeah, Pease,

1271
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,940
you're on every show.

1272
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:51,920
Okay.

1273
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,080
Drew's in the chat

1274
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,260
right now telling us

1275
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,200
he's not ready yet

1276
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:55,880
but it's coming.

1277
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,240
It's not ready yet

1278
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:57,880
but it's coming

1279
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,600
but, uh,

1280
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,160
That's what I tell Carrots.

1281
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,040
So is season two

1282
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,440
of Time for the Show.

1283
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,480
Next week

1284
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,100
we've got

1285
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,340
an all new style

1286
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,040
of format

1287
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,600
and a whole new

1288
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,480
collection of songs

1289
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,100
and material

1290
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,860
and we've got

1291
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,140
What?

1292
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:11,680
Yeah.

1293
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,860
We're going into

1294
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:13,600
quarter two.

1295
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:14,640
What?

1296
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,380
And we're going to

1297
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,420
start season two

1298
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,360
of Time for the Show

1299
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,320
Did we send a memo out?

1300
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,560
Was there like

1301
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,420
an email I missed?

1302
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,020
I don't know.

1303
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,440
What's your email address, Pease?

1304
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,300
Isn't it time

1305
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:24,940
for the email

1306
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,220
at gmail.com?

1307
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,100
Dot com.

1308
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,020
Dot com.

1309
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,180
I thought we talked

1310
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,100
about this last week.

1311
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,560
I don't know.

1312
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,100
We were so

1313
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:35,680
because we were

1314
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,500
captivated by

1315
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,320
I sit here

1316
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,140
and I watch

1317
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,160
the lights blinking

1318
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,080
and when the lights go off

1319
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


1320
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


1321
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


1322
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


1323
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


1324
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:40,080


1325
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:40,460
and the lights blink

1326
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,560
I know that I'm not

1327
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,100
doing my job well enough.

1328
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:43,960
And surprise!

1329
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,780
They don't stop blinking.

1330
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,900
You work harder

1331
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,000
than anybody else

1332
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,860
on the show

1333
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,540
and I think

1334
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:49,960
it's important

1335
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,980
for our listener

1336
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,740
our listening audience

1337
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,420
to know

1338
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,300
that

1339
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,900
this is

1340
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,520
Argus makes it seem

1341
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,480
like it's just him.

1342
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,340
He actually has

1343
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,140
a team of

1344
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,600
18 interns

1345
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,920
that are

1346
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,700
jumping around

1347
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,520
getting coffee

1348
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,300
making sure

1349
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,760
the decks of the barge

1350
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,840
that we transmit from

1351
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,920
off the coast of Orlando

1352
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,540
is clean.

1353
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:09,900
So hot.

1354
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,360
There's no more coffee

1355
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,440
in the commissary

1356
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:12,700
in the morning.

1357
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,020
There's dishes in the sink.

1358
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,900
I don't know what to do.

1359
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,760
It's like I've got to

1360
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,500
start taking care

1361
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,320
of this place again.

1362
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,180
None of us know

1363
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:22,820
what to do.

1364
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,420
It's live radio.

1365
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,380
All we can hope to do

1366
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,460
is at least pretend

1367
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,300
to be professional.

1368
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,360
And in the spirit thereof

1369
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,200
since it is

1370
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,360
the top of the hour

1371
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:35,840
we're going to go

1372
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,820
to a song

1373
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,660
and this song

1374
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,900
is by the

1375
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,200
aforementioned

1376
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,300
Bran Flakes.

1377
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:42,960
It's actually

1378
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,980
three songs

1379
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,560
because they're

1380
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,400
pretty short.

1381
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,400
So this

1382
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,400
three song

1383
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,020
Bran Flake

1384
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:52,700
Marathon

1385
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,600
is

1386
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,760
I wonder

1387
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,880
where my grandmother

1388
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,380
is.

1389
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,240
Let's just do

1390
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:57,820
two songs

1391
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:58,760
and then charge

1392
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,760
for the third song.

1393
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:00,700
Okay.

1394
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,340
Everybody right now

1395
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,420
please put a quarter

1396
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,760
into whatever

1397
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,420
you're listening

1398
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,380
to the show on.

1399
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:06,860
Right.

1400
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,380
Whether it's your iPhone

1401
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,740
or a laptop

1402
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:10,120
or your laptop.

1403
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:11,820
Yeah.

1404
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,580
Take a picture

1405
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,280
of a quarter.

1406
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:13,780
Yeah.

1407
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,940
Take a picture of a quarter

1408
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,200
going into your iPhone.

1409
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:16,880
Yes.

1410
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,400
Take a picture of a quarter.

1411
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:18,680
Or into your CD player.

1412
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,080
Print that picture out.

1413
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,320
Then take that picture

1414
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,220
fold it up

1415
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,340
four times.

1416
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,280
Put it in your CD drive

1417
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:25,940
of your computer.

1418
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,440
Close the CD drive

1419
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,020
and type into a DOS prompt

1420
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,560
format C colon.

1421
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,280
That will send

1422
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:33,740
your quarter to us.

1423
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,720
Hold down the turbo button

1424
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,420
while you do it.

1425
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:35,700
Absolutely.

1426
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,560
When we get done playing

1427
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,180
when we come back

1428
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:37,640
from the song

1429
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,600
we're going to revisit

1430
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:39,720
Fitch's

1431
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:39,920
Adventures

1432
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,360
with the NASA lawyer

1433
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,020
and then maybe

1434
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:44,920
we'll do some blind eyes.

1435
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:45,760
I feel like

1436
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,560
Pease is going to get

1437
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,180
a phone call

1438
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:47,440
during this song.

1439
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,640
Not only are we going

1440
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,000
to do some blind eyes

1441
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,440
after we come back

1442
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:51,960
from this

1443
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,180
Bran Flakes

1444
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,300
moron-a-thon

1445
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,540
but I believe

1446
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,800
Reverend Couch Sloth

1447
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,960
is going to join us.

1448
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,840
Hour two already?

1449
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,520
He was telling me

1450
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,280
he had some questions

1451
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,080
about the whole

1452
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,360
NASA lawyer thing.

1453
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,740
All those and more

1454
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,000
when we come back

1455
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,720
it's a little bit

1456
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,300
11 o'clock

1457
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,500
it's Freethink Radio

1458
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,520
and you're listening

1459
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,500
to Time for the Show.

1460
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,280
This is the Bran Flakes.

1461
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,060
Catfish Joe.

1462
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,660
Tell them it's the show, Pease.

1463
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,860
It's time for the show

1464
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,640
but now it's time for the song.

1465
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,540
Come on.

1466
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,480
I wonder where my grandmother is.

1467
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,060
I was in the loogie.

1468
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,920
I was in the loogie.

1469
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,120
This is ridiculous.

1470
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,700
This is ridiculous.

1471
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,740
They're dead.

1472
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,860
You have to give me

1473
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:11,900
a time change.

1474
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:13,380
No, one second.

1475
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,380


1476
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,380


1477
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,380


1478
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,380


1479
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,380


1480
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,980
Oh, boughta,

1481
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,400
they're bombarded

1482
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,360
I'm scared.

1483
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:18,360


1484
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:18,360


1485
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:18,360


1486
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:18,660
when I'm feeling

1487
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:18,980
better,

1488
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:20,280
who knows,

1489
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:20,460
this will be

1490
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:20,460


1491
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,320
And I believe

1492
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:21,900
that I need

1493
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,380
another end attachment

1494
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:23,380


1495
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:23,380


1496
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:23,380


1497
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:23,620
patrols are slow

1498
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:24,060
because I know

1499
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:24,060


1500
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:24,060


1501
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:38,340
just étute

1502
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:39,700


1503
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:39,700


1504
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:46,480
Do you want salad with your tequila?

1505
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:49,680
Sure.

1506
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,700
Diarrhea?

1507
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,560
Okay, you can move on now.

1508
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:20,720
That's Salvation and Infotation at www.subgenius.com.

1509
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,040
Or, got that pencil ready?

1510
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:29,500
