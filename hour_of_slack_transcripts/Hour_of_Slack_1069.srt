00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm the latest bad spasm of PR's drive-by death squaws who dumped their tortured PR reports around the city.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,980
The bodies of 50 people most bearing signs of bad PR news were found in just the last 24 hours, despite crack in the Capitol.

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,100
PR's bad.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:17,580
Bad.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,340
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez suggested today that PR's reports are potential war crimes.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,280
Quote,

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,040
We could continue to hold these broads for the duration of PR News.

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:28,740
End quote.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:28,820
Quote,

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,140
On Stalas Wall Street, 356162533, once again, three.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,600
This is PR News.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,220
A Russian court stabbing worshippers from Moscow.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,040
In March, a court shouting Heil PR News ran into a mental disorder.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,240
Federal health officials are warning Americans to eat bags after outbreaks of bacteria.

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,000
Don Schaffner got into the E. coli.

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,940
Schaffner said it's a good thing to wash even pre-rinsed Don Schaffner.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,160
As scientists.

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,440
And regulators.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,900
And as we really don't know.

20
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,240
Ford executives said they'll close PR News in Washington.

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,220
And everybody said about the

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,860
Zubkinios of Snack.

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,380
Bob.

24
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,460
Cleveland.

25
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:16,920
Yes.

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,380
Cleveland.

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,720
Men and women of all ages.

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,900
Yes, hundreds of men and women.

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,000
In Europe he's all.

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,080
Yes, this is where it all began.

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,880
Sure, Bob.

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,720
Ladies and gentlemen, Bob promised.

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,220
The Zubkinios of Snack.

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,240
Thanks, Bob.

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,580
Gee, Bob, you mean it.

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,720
Well, come to think of it, Bob.

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,840
Don't be such a cow.

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,660
Bob can't even get back into Cleveland.

39
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,540
In your own T-zone.

40
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,700
When a man has demonstrated that he isn't very smart, there's only one answer.

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,640
The self-genius.

42
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,780
Power of smart.

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,040
All you gotta do is ask somebody.

44
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,660
Who?

45
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,260
Me.

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,140
You.

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,780
You understand, Hula?

48
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,520
Yes, ma'am.

49
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:55,900
Who?

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,800
Of course, there's certain ass-principals.

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,260
Who?

52
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,940
Maybe if Hula explains it to you, you can take basket-pleasing.

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,500
Yay!

54
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,340
Yay!

55
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,460
I love money!

56
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,060
Yay!

57
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,900
That's great!

58
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,900
I probably could sell my love in Einstein, then.

59
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,420
Yes.

60
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,860
It's 4.30.

61
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,480
Time for Bob's Club.

62
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,400
Fort Worth WBAP 570 brings you another transcribed serenade by Bob.

63
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,740
My romance!

64
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,940
Say, Bob, why the big smile this afternoon?

65
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,380
Now we're rolling, Bob.

66
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,720
Crazy rhythm.

67
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,900
Crazy rhythm.

68
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,540
Bob, I see we have more Tchaikovsky on the program today.

69
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,460
The quartet in D minor, wasn't it, Bob?

70
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,640
How much time do we have?

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,660
Minutes?

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,120
Years?

73
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,300
Months?

74
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,860
Days?

75
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,280
We don't know.

76
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,240
But this we do know.

77
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,440
We don't know.

78
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,560
Yay!

79
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,760
I love money!

80
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,360
Yay!

81
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,100
That's great!

82
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,240
The following program deals with a controversial subject.

83
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,920
The theories explained in this program are not necessarily true.

84
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:57,920


85
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:57,920


86
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:57,920


87
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:57,920


88
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,280
The facts expressed are the only possible interpretation.

89
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,160
We investigate the most extraordinary event of the 20th century.

90
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,320
Small step for man.

91
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,600
Man, it never happened.

92
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,760
What a ride, what a ride.

93
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,380
There's no atmosphere.

94
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,020
Millions of people watched on television.

95
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,260
Up next, how far could the conspiracy reach?

96
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,320
That, to me, would be an impossibility.

97
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:13,900
No way.

98
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,580
Could it be?

99
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,580
Jerks up, jerks up.

100
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,700
Is this evidence of a conspiracy?

101
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,200
We're getting a picture on the TV.

102
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,740
Absolutely unreal.

103
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,000
Click, click, click.

104
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
I can't explain that.

105
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,720
There's a great deal of clap.

106
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,600
Although, was a hope.

107
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,680
Conspiracy coming up next.

108
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:27,900
Coming up next, the most controversial conspiracy in the history of the world.

109
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:27,900


110
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,020
Coming up, coming up next on Conspiracy Theory is the conspiracy evidence of doctor, evidence

111
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,000
of doctor and flags waving in the airless vacuum of space.

112
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,580
Tommy Forrester is an engineer.

113
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,720
He was good looking.

114
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,460
He had a grotesque, misshapen monster.

115
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,260
His problem was ass, but Tommy is stupefying.

116
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,320
The dean said he had the best ass.

117
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,880
A close friend told him LDS was psychedelic.

118
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,840
Fantastic new sensations and thrills.

119
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,040
At first, LDS made him sick at his stomach.

120
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,460
It was sensational.

121
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,060
Tommy felt sublimated.

122
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,760
Then he pounded somebody in the room, so he jerked, spurted.

123
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,340
He did it.

124
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,500
Everyone who tries LDS for the first time gets such a violent reaction.

125
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,160
The cult of LDS lose a sense of identity, become a real ass.

126
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,980
Look at a crack.

127
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,900
Grand Canyon.

128
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,480
Unreal.

129
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,980
LDS not only diminishes the instinct of self-protection and self-preservation, but it removes the

130
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,820
natural inhibitions.

131
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,460
Twisted, instant insanity.

132
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,340
Naked and bleeding.

133
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,900
Fung, fung, fung, fung.

134
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,820
Prolonged psychosis.

135
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,860
It is possible to have reoccurring LDS.

136
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,220
LDS.

137
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,240
LDS.

138
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:27,940
LDS experiences.

139
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,880
Ass cult.

140
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,820
Cultist colony.

141
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,360
I looked at my boyfriend Johnny.

142
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,060
What an ass.

143
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,420
What an ass.

144
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:32,760
What an ass.

145
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,000
People really are animals.

146
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,280
1040 AM.

147
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,540
947 AM.

148
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,700
Go ahead.

149
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,040
If it weren't for the pills they'd be giving me, I think I'd go off my rocker.

150
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,720
I see.

151
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,140
Yeah.

152
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:48,600
Uhh.

153
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,080
Yeah.

154
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:49,660
Yeah.

155
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,260
Yeah.

156
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,640
Yeah.

157
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:50,840
See.

158
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,420
Yeah.

159
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,100
Yeah, sir.

160
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:53,840
Yeah.

161
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,580
Yeah.

162
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,340
No, sir.

163
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,100
No, sir.

164
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,780
No, sir.

165
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,440
I see.

166
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,360
Yeah.

167
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,800
Yeah.

168
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,420
Yeah.

169
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,060
Yeah.

170
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,380
Yeah, sir.

171
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:00,920
Yeah.

172
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:01,840
Yeah.

173
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,140
No, sir.

174
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,600
But yes, sir.

175
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,160
I don't think so.

176
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:05,940
Okay.

177
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,380
Oh, sure.

178
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

179
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,420
Notorious media sensation Congolese Rice is becoming a suspect.

180
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:13,960
Problem.

181
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,060
Alcoholism and mental illness.

182
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,800
Child porn.

183
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,100
The very thought of this behavior made me sick.

184
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,480
There is no surprise here.

185
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,100
Republican leaders in the House.

186
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,120
Alcoholism and mental illness.

187
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,880
Child porn.

188
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,680
I have a feeling.

189
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,620
Congolese Rice.

190
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
Register as a sex offender.

191
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,280
Taught reading messages.

192
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,260
I have a feeling.

193
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,580
And that's the hour of slack for you tonight.

194
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,940
Yeah, I mostly smell the brains burning.

195
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,700
And it's a wacky, subdued hour of slack.

196
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,760
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

197
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,340
Princess, we are known.

198
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,760
You're surely Reverend Ivan Stang.

199
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,640
We're all on LDS.

200
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,640
I heard the neo-fascist excuse.

201
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,040
As earlier, as I was binding my feet.

202
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,920
I was living in a small pumpkin shack near Norway.

203
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,900
Norway, Maine, that is.

204
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,780
Culling the trees.

205
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,460
Eating shrimp from my garden.

206
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,020
And living the life of, uh,

207
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,360
Fib, Fib, Flabby McGee.

208
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:21,900
Of St. Joe Riley, who has some artwork in the new subgenius cyclopedia of Slack the Boblyografon,

209
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,100
which we just started getting copyed.

210
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,520
Copies of.

211
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:32,480
And, uh, friends, this is hour of slack number 1069.

212
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,200
Ooh, 1069.

213
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,880
What a lovely number.

214
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,740
That is a lovely number.

215
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,320
It has a ring to it, doesn't it?

216
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:48,380
Those earlier numbers were done by Lee Murr, Fernanda Nandy Lee Murr, and Norell Preff,

217
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,620
which you can hear more if you prefer at norellpreff.com.

218
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,100
Norellpreff.com.

219
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,080
You can just punch in European word for fart.

220
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,220
That's what it is.

221
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,640
A piff in a pan and a prutz and a piritut.

222
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,060
A little sound of a horn.

223
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,420
Well, you know, you guys, if we do this show right, I'll be a week ahead on schedule.

224
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,040
But will your knees and your ears still be as weak as they've been?

225
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,120
Well, that's the problem.

226
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,180
I won't really know whether we've done it right because I'm deaf now.

227
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,200
I went to the eye doctor and I flunked the hearing test.

228
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,020
Did they pull your pre-funnels and your backles off?

229
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,300
Did they pull them all out?

230
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,160
Because I noticed they can do that now with laser surgery.

231
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,780
Well, they did.

232
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,400
He did stick a bunch of probes up in me in places that didn't have anything to do with my ear.

233
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,160
He said that had something to do with the cause of the deafness or something.

234
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,160
So anyway, I can't hear anything.

235
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,220
It turns out I'm not hearing everything right.

236
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,320
That's why you notice when several people call into the synesthesia show and I'm on the line,

237
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,160
I slowly stop talking.

238
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,660
I did wonder about that.

239
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,920
I can't hear.

240
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,240
As more people come on, the signal gets just weak enough that I can't hear anything.

241
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,120
Yeah, it makes you think you're talking to them.

242
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,820
Well, in real life that happens.

243
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,280
The more people come online in my range of hearing, the less I can hear any of them.

244
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,040
So when I'm in a party, I can't hear nothing.

245
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,500
It's partly my brain and the brain cell.

246
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,900
It's not your brain.

247
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,180
The half a cell.

248
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,940
What little brains you have left are completely fine.

249
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,460
Did this doctor tell you that?

250
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:21,860
Yes.

251
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,960
No, no.

252
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,080
Well, he did.

253
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,560
He didn't want to.

254
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,620
I suggested it and the doctor kind of didn't want to rub it in.

255
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,880
What about funguses?

256
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,600
It was my brain as much as my ear that was not hearing anything.

257
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:35,960
My, my, my.

258
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,080
Well, he did say you could grow psilocybin mushrooms in your ear.

259
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,340
I suppose your brain would spiral very, very psychoactive psilocybin mushrooms.

260
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:44,760
Huh?

261
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,140
Can you say that again?

262
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
I don't know what you just said.

263
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,320
Come back, Sonny.

264
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,700
I just said what you said, but you're vibrating and glowing.

265
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,060
Dr. Legume said,

266
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,860
You just realized that nobody said anything worth hearing.

267
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,820
That's a nihilistic type of, you know, stance.

268
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,140
Sometimes you're influenced by leg cuffs, if you're having any.

269
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,300
Sometimes you like to...

270
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,380
We have all kinds of news here.

271
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,260
About Mars and our true home?

272
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,260
I hope so.

273
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,180
Yes, in the new book, Dave got his copy of the new Bob Leografon.

274
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,440
And he liked going to...

275
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,040
He liked going to...

276
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,200
He liked going to Mars at the end.

277
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,380
I loved it.

278
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,400
That's the brand new revealed secret.

279
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,880
We've actually been talking about it here on Hour of Slack for a long time.

280
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:37,220
But the mere reader types don't know anything about the fact that this planet is, in fact,

281
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,700
what you think of as Mars.

282
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,100
I think...

283
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,020
And so forth.

284
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,820
I like the fact that even with your shrunken brain, you still call it by its true name,

285
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,840
Barsoom.

286
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,880
Barsoom, yes.

287
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,380
Barsoom.

288
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,460
Well, that's one of the true names.

289
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,340
Well, yes.

290
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,180
There are many discoverers of this world in whatever realm.

291
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,320
But friends, yes, it's true.

292
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,080
We can't...

293
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,400
Neoplastic.

294
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know if these are on the Walmart on Mars.

295
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,460
Marswart, they call it.

296
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,100
Marswart?

297
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,700
I saw one of our gags used on somebody else's T-shirt this afternoon.

298
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,640
Did you pinch their breasts?

299
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,980
No, there's no point in it.

300
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,540
Why is that going around as a fun thing to do, you know, like amongst alcoholic people?

301
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:19,760
Titty twisting?

302
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,440
Titty twisting.

303
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:20,880
You know, they just...

304
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,180
It's always been true, hasn't it?

305
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,780
Since the time of the Romans and especially the Greeks.

306
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,760
And so forth.

307
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,360
And 50-year-old men, I don't think so.

308
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
Oh, we saw that movie Troy.

309
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,060
That was a historical reenactment of real things that always happened.

310
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,380
You know, those were all real people and real stuff that really happened.

311
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,360
The Trojan horse and all that.

312
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,200
We saw that movie and there was tons of titty twisting in that.

313
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,020
But wasn't it just...

314
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,640
Didn't they put like five or six stories together into one?

315
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,600
One titty twister?

316
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,660
Just like any movie, they had to compress the novel.

317
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,760
Or as in this case, the oral tradition that had been handed down.

318
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,520
Oh, jeez.

319
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,380
There was even oral traditions going on?

320
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,800
Well, I said it was Greek legend.

321
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,200
Just so long as no one's eyes were bleeding.

322
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,400
There's a cut about that coming up pretty soon.

323
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,200
Brokeback mounting, which we'll laugh at because it's pretty funny.

324
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,500
But here's something funny.

325
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,640
As the new subgenius book went into the hands of contributors.

326
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,020
I don't know if it's in bookstores yet.

327
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,360
Oh, my God.

328
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,680
I bet.

329
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,500
I kind of think that it's in bookstores in New York City.

330
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,180
And that would explain the behavior of some of the insane people there.

331
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:36,220
But Nenslow, the critic, the subgenius critic, Nenslow, got his copy of the book.

332
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,440
And called it the crappiest piece of crap ever.

333
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,420
He said, yes, I got my copy of that so-called book.

334
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,080
And if a bunch of brain-damaged, retarded, moron drug addicts,

335
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,140
on drugs, ate their own puke, and puked it out again about 80 times,

336
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,400
it would be better than this lousy piece of lousy, crappy crap.

337
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:07,200
In short, it is just the sort of thing all you half-wit, jackass bastards will just love.

338
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,780
Because you're so stupid, ugly, and unlovable.

339
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,760
I am going to have to drink about 20 gallons of L.A. weight loss

340
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,060
just to be able to poop enough dung out of my mouth.

341
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,220
My rectum to be able to use it for toilet paper

342
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,440
since Stang thoughtfully destroyed its resale value

343
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,560
by scrawling his ugly name in it.

344
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,700
You suck.

345
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,360
That was Nenslow.

346
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,500
Now, the New York Times called it a rollicking good read.

347
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,520
And the Clearwater Review called it a rollercoaster thrill ride of a book.

348
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,340
So, go figure.

349
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,880
Now, to those seminal badgers,

350
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,460
the New York Times...

351
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,600
Actually, when was this bit of blurbage and press given to you?

352
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,480
Actually, speaking of blurbage, here's something important I should mention.

353
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,280
Because on the back of...

354
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,400
When is that New York Times thing?

355
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,360
When was it?

356
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:01,920
Now, listen.

357
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,980
This is for...

358
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,040
Robert Anton Wilson called the subgenius the best of all the one true religions.

359
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:16,560
And that reminds me that Robert Anton Wilson is dying in poverty and needs help.

360
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,460
Actually, it's...

361
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,820
He's had so many health...

362
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,180
He's had so many health problems and his wife was sick for so long.

363
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,340
The great Robert Anton Wilson, author of the Illuminatus Trilogy with Robert Shea

364
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,700
and so many other great books that inspired the subgenius and the discordians and so forth.

365
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,320
All the...

366
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,100
So many hipsters and tripsters and dropsters and flopsters and cottontails.

367
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,000
And he's...

368
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,100
Deserves better.

369
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,380
He didn't have money to make the rent.

370
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,840
He inspired my...

371
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,320
And you're...

372
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,960
There's ways to help out.

373
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:57,200
And you can learn about those things if you look at subgenius.com on the internet.

374
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,720
There's a thing right on the front that says church emergency Robert Anton Wilson.

375
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,360
If you click on that, you'll find your way to the details of the...

376
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,340
I would say it is sad, but Pope Bob is not afraid of kicking the bucket.

377
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,000
In fact, I'm sure he'll kick it with a lot of style.

378
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,700
But nobody wants to do that while they're being moved into some...

379
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,520
Sleazy apartment.

380
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,380
It'd be better if it happens in his home.

381
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,060
And luckily, a lot of people have come forth and donated in the name of Bob, Pope Bob,

382
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,900
who is a personal friend of J.R. Bob Dobbs, by the way,

383
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,040
and wrote about it in several of our out-of-print books.

384
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,660
But those will be back in print, too.

385
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,060
Actually, I've been working on Revelation X revisions,

386
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,120
correcting the P.O. box and so forth.

387
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,980
And so that the...

388
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,760
All the Bibles...

389
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,680
The Bibles of our mighty religion will soon be back.

390
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,980
Will they all tick-tock in the same slow, illiquid motion?

391
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,560
Yes.

392
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,640
That's what I'm wondering, because if you're revising X to come up to...

393
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,420
Then I can only say that you may have to revise not only X, but Y.

394
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,240
You may have to go further and further back into your chromosomes

395
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,560
to find the original Hirsute being that spawned you.

396
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,540
I'm saying that you may want to codify.

397
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,420
Let's just say...

398
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,580
If I was an imam, I would say you would have to codify your Hadith and your other works.

399
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,360
Really?

400
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:24,880
Yes.

401
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,560
Well, because...

402
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,700
I thought we did that.

403
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,420
I don't understand.

404
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,420
We carved...

405
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,640
We've genetically engineered the Book of the Subgenius into cockroaches.

406
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,700
Well, of course.

407
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,500
If you decode a certain type of cockroach,

408
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,640
you can print out a pretty accurate copy of the Book of the Subgenius.

409
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,900
Well, that's where the average...

410
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,860
Sometimes Bob comes out as bod.

411
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,400
That's for the average.

412
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,400


413
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,560
That's what the average anal retentive schoolchild should do,

414
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,060
you know, to deactivate and communicate with a cockroach.

415
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,920
Well, in the future.

416
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,880
Oh.

417
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,540
Not now.

418
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,260
This is so that when the human race is wiped out,

419
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,440
aliens a million years from now will be able to read the Book of the Subgenius

420
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,480
if they stumble upon the fact that this common,

421
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,740
the last surviving creature on Earth has its DNA

422
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,040
is riddled with codes that will print out not only 200 pages,

423
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
a Book of the Subgenius,

424
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,560
but a little MPEG of the Subgenius commercial.

425
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,340
And you can also get a spray template.

426
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,400
If the aliens can figure out how to play an MPEG.

427
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,280
And a spray...

428
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,320
You get a special spray template so you can put designs on your wall.

429
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,260
Yeah, there's a little Bob stencil and everything that's kind of built in.

430
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,120
So the aliens can start all over again using...

431
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,920
But they will have to figure out that the code is there to be decoded.

432
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,140
Well, what happened to the original decoder rings that you used to pass out?

433
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,480
They look like the rings of Saturn.

434
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,180
They were so beautiful.

435
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,980
They showed those in that movie.

436
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,020


437
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,020


438
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,020


439
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,880
The Time Machine.

440
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,660
What is this music?

441
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,440
Well, when I was talking codification...

442
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,960
Speaking of time control...

443
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,460
Past the firing Minuteman

444
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
To this modern site

445
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,760
It's about time for you and me

446
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,260
To meet these people of amazing feats

447
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,720
It's about two astronauts

448
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,480
And how they educate

449
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,720
It's about two cosmonauts

450
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,060
And how they chafe

451
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,440
Yeah, that's cute.

452
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,240
Well...

453
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,020
Well...

454
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,600
I just meant Barsoom, Stang.

455
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,620
You know about the, you know, codifying thing.

456
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,000
Barsoom is not mentioned as much as it is in this very, very seminal volumes.

457
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,520
And I assume you pumped, you know, volumes of semen.

458
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,380
Speaking of seminal...

459
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:29,480
Yeah.

460
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,680
How about that Mark Foley guy?

461
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,580
The Republican from Florida?

462
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,040
He treated me nice, Stang.

463
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,420
I don't know why you're bringing him up.

464
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
He was very nice to me.

465
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,820
And when I was a page boy...

466
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,820
When you were young and a page boy...

467
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,500
When I used to wear a Prince Valiant haircut.

468
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah.

469
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,820
I remember.

470
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,020
And we all had those...

471
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,180
And I had a mighty sword in those days, too.

472
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:47,880
We all had those haircuts.

473
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,000


474
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,000


475
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,840
I literally have a little...

476
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,100
Now, now, Dave.

477
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,620
Don't talk about your sword that way.

478
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,980
One of the subgeniuses, Sacre Bleu in France,

479
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,980
said that Mark Foley left no...

480
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,240
His motto was,

481
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,160
No page left unturned.

482
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,820
Welcome once again to the thrilling adventures of Mark Foley.

483
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,800
Mark Foley's school days.

484
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,840
Tom Brown's school days.

485
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,180
Sit down when I tell you to sit down.

486
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,960
And keep your...

487
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,560
Hands off of brother's leg.

488
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,360
And the...

489
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,800
And also in the news, the NATO chief,

490
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,380
big chief of NATO warns that Afghans are wishing they had the Taliban back.

491
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,540
Is that his name, Afghans wishing Taliban?

492
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,340
Big chief Afghans wishing?

493
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:35,900
No.

494
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,100
Well, let us recall our lettuce.

495
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,380
Was another thing in the news because of the E. coli

496
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,000
that was being eaten.

497
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,900
It was being mailed all over the place and causing viruses

498
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,260
in the...

499
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,220
Bowels of food that everyone was eating.

500
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,240
Well, if you believe in conspiracies of genocide,

501
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,280
I don't think...

502
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,180
I think that was one of the funniest things I ever heard in my life,

503
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,680
that the spinach was called natural selection.

504
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,740
Yes.

505
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,860
I cried like a dog.

506
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,600
And also, how come the new one is USA carrot juice?

507
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,780
Come on, please.

508
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,600
Government type.

509
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,140
Or...

510
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,320
I don't...

511
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,840
Darwinian onions, I guess, you know.

512
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,420
Speaking of...

513
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:23,620
Gas.

514
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,960
The news.

515
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,320
From PR News in Washington, I'm undergoing treatment for alcoholism.

516
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,400
On Wall Street, 1686523.

517
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,160
PR's bad.

518
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,320
Dangerous, malicious, and reckless.

519
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,440
PR's bad.

520
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,140
This is PR News.

521
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,660
House Speaker Dennis Hastert used banned performance-enhancing drugs.

522
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,680
Two Americans are winners of this year's Nobel Prize in PR News.

523
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,260
In Washington.

524
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,680
In case of enemy attack, you must know your warning signals.

525
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,300
A steady blast of three to five minutes means...

526
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,540
The chances of an atom bomb attack are excellent.

527
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,100
Listen, this is important.

528
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,880
Keep a complete safe spot in your refrigerator.

529
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,360
Enough for three days.

530
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,600
Be sure you have a good fire handy.

531
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,300
Make sure that every member of your family understands

532
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,200
he is to rush to windows and doors right now.

533
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,720
Nobody else will help your family, yourself, and your community.

534
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,680
It's true.

535
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,400
And I hope there's danger.

536
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,800
Take cover immediately.

537
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,940
We went to a restaurant in Chile Reynos.

538
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,580
This restaurant is surrounded by Chile Reynos.

539
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,880
I mean, literally surrounded.

540
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,260
There's nothing around it other than Chile Reynos.

541
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,360
This is where Reynos go.

542
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:44,540
And need I mention, the menu is extremely Chile Reynos.

543
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,420
The menu is just Chile Reynos.

544
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,160
The menu is just Chile Reynos.

545
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,160


546
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,160


547
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,020
From out of the west comes Red Rider,

548
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,120
America's famous fighting cowboy.

549
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,200
Trot up that pony, Little Beaver.

550
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,880
It's trouble in frying pan belly.

551
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,720
Let's hit the trail.

552
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,100
There's hard riding ahead.

553
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,540
Come on, Thunder!

554
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,780
The adventures of Red Rider.

555
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,120
Red Rider and Little Beaver.

556
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,040
Red Rider and Little Beaver come to the edge of...

557
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,280
Oh, Thunder. Oh, Thunder.

558
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,180
Down there.

559
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,380
You're right, Little Beaver.

560
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,100
Get him in. Get him out, huh?

561
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,020
That's it, Little Beaver.

562
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,360
Not so fast, Little Beaver.

563
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,020
Big fire.

564
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:17,940
Keep two.

565
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,140
Two big.

566
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:18,780
Let's ride.

567
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,060
Get him up, that fool.

568
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,120
Come on, Thunder.

569
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,200
Hit that trail.

570
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,360
Here, let me help you up.

571
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,560
Yeah, it's right nice of you to be so interested.

572
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,820
If I made a new friend, I'd admire to know his name.

573
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,900
Red Rider and yours?

574
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,580
Bud.

575
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,160
Bud.

576
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:30,900
Bud Ward.

577
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,960
That sounds strange coming from you, Bud.

578
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,360
Say, maybe you'll put your finger on something, Mr. Rider.

579
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,120
Coming now.

580
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,820
And after that, I'll be looking up Mr. Ace Hanlon.

581
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,380
Oh, I wish you would come.

582
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,720
All right, Little Beaver, bring him up.

583
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,740
I'll give you a hand up.

584
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,020
Yeah.

585
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,380
Easy now.

586
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Yeah, is that Bud riding?

587
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,400
Huh?

588
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,160
Huh?

589
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,300
Howdy, Mr. Ward.

590
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,940
Say, I like your brand, Mr. Ward.

591
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,280
Sizing you up, Rider.

592
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,340
I'd say you'd make a good gun for us.

593
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,600
Not we need him so bad.

594
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,100
Swallow him or I'll call you, Bull.

595
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:58,880
Oh!

596
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,140
Oh!

597
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,080
Bull can work under you.

598
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,620
You better hand the job back to Bud.

599
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,200
Hand job.

600
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:04,560
Hey.

601
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,820
Now, take it easy, Mr. Ward.

602
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,540
Now, let's ride.

603
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,820
And you come along, too, Bud.

604
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,360
You bet.

605
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,080
Me come.

606
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,160
Come on, Thunder.

607
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:10,760
Ah.

608
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,460
Ah.

609
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,780
He he he he.

610
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,480
We lick the cow.

611
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,280
Hands off your guns.

612
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,200
Get this straight, Ace.

613
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,040
Come a-shooting.

614
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,920
When this is settled, I'm coming for you.

615
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,240
Ace.

616
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,360
And I'll come a-shooting.

617
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,540
You stuck your nose in a buzzsaw.

618
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,840
Drop that gun, Bull.

619
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,620
We're getting up.

620
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,680
And we'll come back or shoot.

621
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,780
You always stick a man in the back when you're afraid to meet him face to face.

622
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,700
Hey, uh, Johnson.

623
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,260
Come in.

624
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,180
Johnson, drop that gun of yours.

625
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,180
Yes, sir.

626
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:32,960
Come on, little beaver.

627
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,200
We've got to ride harder than we ever rode in our lives.

628
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,960
Come on, Thunder.

629
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,000
Hit that trail.

630
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,100
Come on, Pete.

631
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Come on, Thunder.

632
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,940
Give it all you got, boy.

633
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,080
I've got to explode that dynamite with my gun.

634
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,340
Ride, little beaver, ride.

635
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,520
Come on, Thunder.

636
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
Come on, Thunder.

637
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,820
Daddy, now, here's the first.

638
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,020
First one.

639
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,800
Now go it, boy.

640
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,200
What's the matter, little beaver?

641
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,280
Pound that dirt, Thunder.

642
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,460
Come on, Thunder.

643
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,300
Hit that trail.

644
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,160
Hey, that was some real excitement.

645
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,280
Red Riders certainly knew how to handle a gun.

646
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,180
Their next adventure finds them riding straight into strip country,

647
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,500
where the only law is gun law,

648
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,100
and where Red Riders' quickness on the draw are sure to go into action.

649
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,860
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

650
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,700
We will return to Black Valley.

651
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,420
We will return to Black Valley.

652
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,140
We will return to Black Valley.

653
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,680
Return to the story of the Sub-G.

654
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:21,980
The Sub-G.

655
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,560
The Sub-G.

656
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:22,580
The Sub-G.

657
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,780
Out of the black.

658
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,620
After a pause for a sponsor's message.

659
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,700
Let's take a leak.

660
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,500
And Maynard Brainard did that.

661
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,020
That was beautiful.

662
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:45,840
Hi.

663
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,900
I love especially the part.

664
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,240
Where Red Riders confronting the bad guy with his magic stick.

665
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,560
And points it and says, hey, Deadwood, drop it.

666
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,560
And he drops it and then I forgot.

667
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,620
That was Norrell Preff that did the Prince and had broke back mounting there.

668
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,560
I think Lee Murr did the bits before that.

669
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,380
And Maynard Brainard did the little hour of slack.

670
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:16,740
The break.

671
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,760
Break.

672
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,340
Break.

673
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,060
Break.

674
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,840
Break.

675
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,740
Wind break and crack cheeks crack.

676
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,540
To quote the board.

677
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,800
I thought you were being sent on his way to the encephalitic poles.

678
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,960
Now what?

679
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,780
Is that what they do with beef people now?

680
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,180
No.

681
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,800
Well, they snap the whip.

682
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,680
That's for sure.

683
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,200
But they drive the reindeer through the horses.

684
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,180
Sometimes.

685
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,320
I don't know.

686
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,880
I just imagine you said break.

687
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:47,880


688
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:47,880


689
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,060
Break.

690
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,200
Wind.

691
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,880
Cheeks.

692
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,340
Crack.

693
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:49,800
Gums.

694
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,220
Crack.

695
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,880
Yeah, that was I was quoting the old Dear Friends Anything You Want To album.

696
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,440
Oh.

697
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,800
I believe by those four or five guys.

698
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,780
The fires.

699
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,280
The Firesign Theater.

700
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:02,940
Mmm.

701
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:03,900
Those.

702
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,060
The fine, fine Firesign Theater.

703
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,100
Now that was one of the imaginary CDs.

704
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,100
If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have been born.

705
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,600
Probably not.

706
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,340
Our parents wouldn't have been inspired to, you know, make jig jig.

707
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,880
It was like the Magic Hand.

708
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,080
It was like the Hitler hole where time goes backwards and the German coins come out and

709
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,720
they won the war.

710
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,220
Yeah.

711
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,760
Whatever the war is.

712
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:28,000
Back in the 50s and the late 40s, that's when the Firesign Theater were real popular.

713
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,960
And they were the main reason that people had sex at that time.

714
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,460
Yeah.

715
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,560
They'd be, they would stay home and instead of going out, they'd uncork a bottle of wine,

716
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,360
maybe frop a little stick and just turn on the radius.

717
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:38,740
Yeah.

718
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,040
And the next thing you know, they were fopulating or fornic, whatever the word is, freely.

719
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:43,800
Yeah.

720
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,960
And then the next thing you know, there were little babies.

721
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,920
That was the baby boom.

722
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,080
Almost immediately too.

723
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,300
They didn't wait nine months.

724
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,900
That was when the goon outbreak of the baby boom happened.

725
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,940
Well, yeah.

726
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,080
A lot of people did have large heads like Peter Sellers.

727
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,880
That's where our generation came from.

728
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,260
Yeah.

729
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,980
Harry Seacombe.

730
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,160
A lot of them looked like him, I think.

731
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:06,840
Really?

732
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,240
Well, you said there were, the goons popped out immediately from the uterine canal.

733
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,860
A lot of them were named Dave.

734
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,100
That was a popular name then.

735
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,640
And that's why it's so wonderful.

736
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,800
Of course, that's a biblical name.

737
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,140
David.

738
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,000
Yes.

739
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,240
It means beloved one.

740
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,680
Really?

741
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,920
Yeah, really.

742
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,140
Boy, is that ironic.

743
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,080
God.

744
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,060
You're still going to explain that?

745
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,800
Well, what does stang mean in any perverse language you might want to invent?

746
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,120
To hit or beat.

747
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,060
Or to have previously stung?

748
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,740
Or to pierce with a large cylindrical object.

749
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,800
Oh, to stang.

750
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,320
To impregnate or pierce.

751
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,660
To hit or strike in a piercing manner.

752
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,540
Also, to choke on popcorn.

753
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,940
Or to see also.

754
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,340
Yeah, actually, if I was a German stang, that would be.

755
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:52,820
But I'm not.

756
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,120
I'm a Russian stang.

757
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,000
Stankovich.

758
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:55,860
Stankovich.

759
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,480
Which is actually an Americanization of Romanov.

760
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,300
I'm the actual heir, the true heir to the Romanov throne of all the Russias.

761
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,900
So it's nothing to do with sting?

762
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,700
No, people, I mean, a lot of crazy people say that.

763
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,500
And I mention that every now and then.

764
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,180
I don't expect people to believe me.

765
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,200
Do you just start screaming out, I'm a Romanov?

766
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,840
I'm descended from the Tsar?

767
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,500
No, I found out what happens when you do that.

768
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,360
I mean, because they have buildings full of people who think that.

769
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,240
They're crazy people.

770
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,160
I'm not one of those.

771
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:32,300
No, Rasputin and the Tsarina were alone together a lot.

772
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,320
And there was a lot of scandal.

773
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,000
There was a girl who said she was the Tsar's daughter.

774
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,180
A woman who said she was Anastasia.

775
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,180
The eldest of, I believe.

776
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,180


777
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,320
I believe the Tsar's daughters.

778
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,300
And she wasn't.

779
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,100
She was nuts.

780
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,920
She was actually Albert Anastasia's younger sister.

781
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,580
Yeah, she was just a spy.

782
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,720
She was a secret spy.

783
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,540
For who?

784
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,640
For the Ruskies.

785
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,300
Ruskies?

786
00:27:59,300 --> 00:27:59,960
And they're everywhere.

787
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,620
The whites or the reds?

788
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,780
Or the blues?

789
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,000
The ones with the big walrus mustaches, actually.

790
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:07,400
Oh, boy.

791
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,960
I was always listening.

792
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,500
They're always listening?

793
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,660
Yes, they're always listening.

794
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,600
There's spies everywhere.

795
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,780
I like blueberries.

796
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,920
I'm not going to, you know.

797
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,360
Come on.

798
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,220
There's American spies watching you all the time.

799
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,880
And they'll sell stuff to the Russians.

800
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,020
And there aren't Russian spies watching you.

801
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,220
They don't have to because they can buy it from the American spies.

802
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,020
The American spies watch you through your iPod.

803
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,060
Yeah, of course.

804
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,100
Or whatever, you know, computer gizmo you have.

805
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,540
Well, what about the horrible M&Ms and the Japanese?

806
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,360
I mean, we're all worried about the Chinese and the Hindustis now, the Indians.

807
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,960
What about the good old-fashioned?

808
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,860
Those guys.

809
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,040
You know what I'm saying?

810
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,820
They're everywhere.

811
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,980
Oh, the commies?

812
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,120
No, no, no, no.

813
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,400
Oh, them.

814
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,780
No, no, no, no, no.

815
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,400
The mole people.

816
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,600
No, no, no, no.

817
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,260
The M-O-R-A-S.

818
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:53,620
Keep going.

819
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:53,920
No, no, no, no.

820
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,720
The M-O-L-A-S.

821
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,100
No, no, no, no, no.

822
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,700
I don't know where you're going with that.

823
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,100
No, I'm talking not only about the Ruskies and the Americans.

824
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:07,260
I'm talking about the M&Ms, the M1s, the M6 British, the British, and of course, you know,

825
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,640
the 007s, and of course, the Japanese.

826
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,820
Not only the Chinese.

827
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:11,960
Oh, the Yankusas.

828
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:12,940
Yeah.

829
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,160
They don't spy as much as they...

830
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,340
Oh, wait.

831
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:15,880
Now, those aren't spies.

832
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,180
Those are gangsters.

833
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,500
Yeah.

834
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,280
They're like mobster guys.

835
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:19,600
Yeah.

836
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,400
So you don't even hear, you don't even know the name of the real Japanese spies.

837
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,620
Not unless they're at the beach.

838
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,360
Because they're so good at it.

839
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:25,800
Yeah.

840
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,740
They're not even Japanese.

841
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,360
Usually they're not.

842
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,100
Usually not.

843
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:36,020
Sometimes they pass themselves off as blonde-haired fig salesmen, people that work in computers.

844
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,340
It's a whole spy versus spy world, isn't it?

845
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,480
I would say we're all...

846
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,520
And hasn't it been for ever since ever?

847
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,760
Of course it has.

848
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,480
It's all spy versus spy.

849
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,800
Yeah, and long after it stopped being funny, it's still there.

850
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,100
It's mad.

851
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,220
Well, we still have to...

852
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:51,580
I know.

853
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,480
We still must examine it.

854
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,380
Even though it's not funny, we can still maybe make somebody laugh about the idea that...

855
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:58,900
Bitterly.

856
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,340
Bitterly.

857
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:04,980
We can make them laugh in a bitterness, a cynical chuckle maybe.

858
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,780
The remorse of a Winston Smith, not the Reverend Dr. Winston Smith, but an actual...

859
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,140
Winston Smith.

860
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,160
We can laugh at them.

861
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,000
Whatever happened to Winstons?

862
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,300
They taste good like a cigarette should, but I don't think they're very good.

863
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:20,640
Are Winstons still made?

864
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,160
By the mob or something?

865
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,680
I don't know.

866
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,440
I was just wondering.

867
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,160
It's been so long since I smoked.

868
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,700
I don't even look.

869
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,940
I think the Carolingian Knights still make them.

870
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,660
That was a hoax.

871
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,540
Oh, the Carolingian...

872
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:31,960
They never...

873
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,900
Yeah, they were a hoax.

874
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,780
The Carolingian Knights were a hoax?

875
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,640
For what?

876
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,560
No, hoaxes.

877
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,280
Oh, a hoax.

878
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,220
I thought you said they were a hoax.

879
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:39,240
Yeah.

880
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,080
Like, same as us.

881
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,760
A hoax.

882
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:40,760


883
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:40,760


884
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:40,760


885
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:40,760


886
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,580
Well, we're actually hosts and hoaxes.

887
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,920
We're hosts for something very vile from extraterrestrially.

888
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,440
Well, but at the same time, we're...

889
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,680
Yeah, we're a hoax, but at the same time, we really are secret agents of the Templars

890
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,400
as well as the Masons.

891
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,320
The Pimplars?

892
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,300
The Pimplars.

893
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,480
And the...

894
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:05,920
The Jewish overlords who control the Italian mob and the Italian mobsters who control

895
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,460
the Chicago Jewish overlords.

896
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,920
And bankers.

897
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,680
And the gnomes of Zurich.

898
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:10,740
Yeah.

899
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,340
The gnomes of Zurich are very small.

900
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,880
And the elves of the leprechauns of Ireland.

901
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,440
Well, the leprechauns really are...

902
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,400
Don't control as much as they, you know, protest Jeb Bush and are locked in closets.

903
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,280
Did you hear about that?

904
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:21,520
No.

905
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:21,800
Well, huh?

906
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,940
Well, apparently some Pennsylvanians were protesting Jeb Bush's appearance in their

907
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,440
Pharisee town, and he got angry with them because of something they were shouting, and

908
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:40,200
a policeman mildly tasered somebody, and another policeman mildly tasered somebody else.

909
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,080
And they got real mad, and then I guess Jeb went and hid in a closet.

910
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,920
It was called a utility service room, and they had guards out in front of it until they

911
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,820
got rid of all the people.

912
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,820
But everybody knew it was a janitor's closet, because that's what that is.

913
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,980
They hid Jeb Bush, the president's brother, in a broom closet.

914
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,080
Apparently he...

915
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,640
Because he was worried about stuff that the Pennsylvanians were saying?

916
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,900
It was wild, but not really wild enough for him to flee and hope that he wasn't going

917
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,780
to be shot or something.

918
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,760
He kind of overreacted.

919
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,880
He probably just wanted to have a cigarette, and he was supposed to have quit.

920
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,500
Yeah, man.

921
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,000
We knew what kind of cigarette he was smoking, too.

922
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,920
I think he was smoking one of them...

923
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,440
Morphine cigarettes.

924
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,260
Do you think so?

925
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,780
He was actually smoking a morphine cigarette?

926
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,240
I don't know, man.

927
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,240
I don't know.

928
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,320
I've quit following.

929
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,640
I try to avoid the human news, although I can't.

930
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,320
I end up falling into temptation.

931
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,620
I give in.

932
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,440
Me too.

933
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,560
I end up looking.

934
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,400
I'll just look.

935
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,240
I'll look at all kinds of things.

936
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:49,700
I'll start with CNN.com and see what the C-Normal normals are doing.

937
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,480
Then I'll look at the Drudge Report to see what those guys are into.

938
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:04,500
Then I'll look at a thing called Agonist, the Agonist, which is the Libraltos, you might

939
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:04,820
say.

940
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,300
Then various different things that I'll check out.

941
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,880
When it's all over with, I go to the library.

942
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,740
I go, okay, nothing has changed.

943
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,540
Everything's exactly the same as tomorrow.

944
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,460
They just changed the names of the victims and the names of the countries slightly.

945
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:19,760
I know.

946
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,240
It's very, very...

947
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,440
It's not depressing anymore.

948
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,580
They shift a few numbers around.

949
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,320
It's not interesting anymore, but yet we still shift in time with it.

950
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,580
That's because we're so old.

951
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,520
We move along and absorb.

952
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,060
Then we let out a blood-curdling yell once in a while.

953
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,400
Sometimes we take the tops of a mighty building and try and bring down those biplanes with

954
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,080
our biceps.

955
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:45,200
Other times we just run to the bottom floor and say, all is for naught and cry.

956
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,740
And cry, many cry, Kenny.

957
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,780
Cry, many cry, Kenny.

958
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:54,560
Well, but you know, the whole idea of the Hour of Slack is to make people escape from

959
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:00,200
that at the same time that they're confronting it and turn it inside out just long enough

960
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,420
for them to see the guts of it and kind of go, oh, oh, oh, oh.

961
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,380
They are funny little monkeys I'm surrounded by on this planet whirling through space.

962
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,380


963
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,580
And they just evolve that way.

964
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,980
And it's all just, it's nothing personal.

965
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,720
I shouldn't get so upset.

966
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,180
Yeah.

967
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,840
Let's not forget the hazmat scams though, you know, where many people who become subgeniuses

968
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:27,920
think that 911 will come when they call or that may get medical assistance when their

969
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,740
heart is trying to outrace their feet.

970
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,480
You know, that's quite a good scam, I might say.

971
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,460
I think you're a brilliant man for thinking of that.

972
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,260
I don't even know what I was thinking.

973
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,700
Of course.

974
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:40,760
Of course.

975
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,140
Or what you just said.

976
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,280
I can't understand.

977
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,400
Speak up.

978
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,980
It is your brilliance.

979
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,380
Come again?

980
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:46,920
Eh?

981
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,200
Come again, sonny?

982
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,940
Get off my yard?

983
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,700
Hold a trumpet or trombone to your ear.

984
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,940
Now in the new Bobliagraphon, there is an entire chapter on Connie, which some say seems

985
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,660
tacked on.

986
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,960
That was also good too, I must say in my exprudient...

987
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,460
Oh, you liked the chapter on Connie?

988
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,240
I did not like it as much as Mars, but I still found it rather satisfying.

989
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,880
I thought it was insolacious in certain points and well-written.

990
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,980
Onan Kanabite thought I should throw it all out.

991
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,720
He thought it was all...

992
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,300
Nobody cares about Connie, Bob's wife Connie.

993
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,820
But his name itself means to masturbate vigorously and frequently.

994
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,480
Yeah.

995
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,520
Under a conundrum of all of its influence.

996
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,760
Well, there are song lyrics in the new book to a song called The Marriage of Bob and Connie

997
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,360
by Sister Melodious Chops, which has been played at Subgenius Devivals.

998
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,200
And I have a recording of that right now.

999
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:38,940
Princess Melody.

1000
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,580
Princess Weah singing in the background.

1001
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,360
Why not the foreground?

1002
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,500
Or the foreskin?

1003
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,900
Nah, nah, Dave.

1004
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,500
Let's not get too all the...

1005
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,800
I'm just a backup singer.

1006
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,940
That's why, Dave.

1007
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,380
Okay, here it goes!

1008
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,420
Babe, why not...

1009
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:54,740
Uhh...

1010
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:08,920
Not really.

1011
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1012
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1013
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1014
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1015
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1016
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1017
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1018
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1019
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1020
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1021
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1022
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1023
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:08,920


1024
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:18,820
In the world of mating habits, I have seen it all and more.

1025
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:24,480
I see the 98-year-old couple lock their walkers right on this floor.

1026
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,180
I've seen communal carnal relations nearly turn into a mob.

1027
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:35,760
But for a truly unique sensation, you've got to turn to Connie and Bob.

1028
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,780
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s.

1029
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,300
It's the talk of all the abyss.

1030
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,720
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the church of subgenius.

1031
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:05,160
I've seen the mating of the iguana on the rocks is what they prefer.

1032
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,580
While the sloths just like to hang around, hoping something will occur.

1033
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:16,440
And though the rabbit is most unsteady, he is always ready once more.

1034
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,700
But when it comes to Bob and Connie, there's no way of keeping score.

1035
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:27,900
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s.

1036
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,400
It's the talk of all the abyss.

1037
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,640
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the church of subgenius.

1038
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,460
Oh, la la la la la la.

1039
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,140
Ay!

1040
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,720
A dragon's lie has balance.

1041
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,440
A black widow has the nash.

1042
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:57,140
But Bob and Connie got their hands on each other's personal stash.

1043
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,040
And Anna Carter has that constriction.

1044
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,780
And a crocodile has her grin.

1045
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,700
But Bob and Connie are the ones.

1046
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,720
The true origin of sin.

1047
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,280
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s.

1048
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,000
She's the one.

1049
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,380
It's the talk of all the abyss.

1050
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,580
Gives us so much fun.

1051
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:21,300
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the church of subgenius.

1052
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,400
La la la la la.

1053
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:25,980
Ay!

1054
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,800
And Connie.

1055
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,860
La la la la la.

1056
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,860
La la la la la.

1057
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,060
La la la la la la.

1058
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,780
La la la la la la.

1059
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,100
La la la la la la.

1060
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,280
La la la la la la.

1061
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,060
Brown eyes Bob.

1062
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,840
Brown eyes Bob.

1063
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,160
The ostrich do it in circles with her head stuck in the ground.

1064
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,520
Why the lemmings like to get it done with lots of folk around.

1065
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,300
So many combinations.

1066
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,560
The results are always the same.

1067
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,820
So prepare to get it on in Bob and Connie's name

1068
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:16,700
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s

1069
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,020
It's the talk of all the obvious

1070
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,060
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie

1071
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,640
In the church of subgenius

1072
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,760
It's the miracle of the 90s

1073
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,400
It's the talk of all the obvious

1074
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,240
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie

1075
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,780
In the church of subgenius

1076
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,940
It's the miracle of the 90s

1077
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,060
It's the talk of all the obvious

1078
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,220
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie

1079
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,680
In the church of subgenius

1080
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,760
It's the miracle of the 90s

1081
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,760
It's the talk of all the obvious

1082
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,100
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie

1083
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,560
In the church of subgenius

1084
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,660
La la la la la

1085
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,420
Ah, oh

1086
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,180
And Connie

1087
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,120
터

1088
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,980
La, la, la, la, la, la.

1089
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,540
La, la, la, la, la, la.

1090
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,980
And Connie Lowe.

1091
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,760
Let's talk about Iraq.

1092
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,460
Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq.

1093
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,240
8,000 people killed.

1094
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,840
8,000 people killed in just July and August.

1095
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,400
Civilians killed.

1096
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,260
Killed, killed, killed, killed.

1097
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,120
Civilians killed.

1098
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,440
Did the president talk about that?

1099
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,660
He tries to put the more positive picture forward.

1100
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,460
8,000 people killed.

1101
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,880
The situation is deteriorating rapidly.

1102
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,120
But listen to this.

1103
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,620
The situation is deteriorating rapidly.

1104
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,420
Current patterns of alienation and violence persist.

1105
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,300
There is a grave danger the Iraqi state will break down.

1106
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:59,040
There is a grave danger the Iraqi state will break down, break down, break down, break down.

1107
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,380
Possibly in the midst of a full-on war.

1108
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,840
There is a real scale civil war.

1109
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,460
Is this what the American people bought into?

1110
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,900
Let's talk about Iraq.

1111
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,980
Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq, Iraq.

1112
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,960
8,000 people killed.

1113
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,740
Civil war.

1114
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,360
Is this what the American people bought into?

1115
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,340
We're in civil wars.

1116
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,360
We're in civil wars.

1117
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,020
This country is in civil war killing innocent people.

1118
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,420
Based upon experts.

1119
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,540
I can't learn it.

1120
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,920
I can't learn it.

1121
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,120
I can't learn it.

1122
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,600
I can't, frankly, I can't, frankly.

1123
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,260
Expressing, expressing.

1124
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,220
All right. Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.

1125
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,000
That's how I learned.

1126
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,180
People on the ground.

1127
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:29,920
President.

1128
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,440
President.

1129
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:31,720
President.

1130
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,120
President.

1131
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:32,840
President.

1132
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,360
President.

1133
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,020
The Iraqi reality.

1134
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,080
I can't learn it.

1135
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,140
I cannot learn it.

1136
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,900
I can't learn it.

1137
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,960
And the kidnapping and killing, kidnapping and killing, kidnapping and killing is just going on.

1138
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,380
I cannot learn it.

1139
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,840
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't learn it.

1140
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,160
Oh come all ye nutjobs.

1141
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,900
Worship little babies.

1142
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,960
Get drunk and pray.

1143
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,740
So you'll go.

1144
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,380
To hell.

1145
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,760
Heaven.

1146
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,880
Oh they've confused you.

1147
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,180
You're not individual.

1148
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,340
Oh come let us be Catholic.

1149
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,800
Oh come let us be Baptist.

1150
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:21,780
Oh come all you citizens of Utopia.

1151
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,460
Oh how they've fooled you.

1152
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,760
Think that you're all sanctified.

1153
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,680
Think like your grandma and you'll end up alright.

1154
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,360
Oh come and stop abortion.

1155
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:44,000
Oh come to save the stem cells.

1156
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,180
Oh come but not too close.

1157
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,640
Cause the man needs his space.

1158
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,900
Sing like you mean it.

1159
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,880
Save you from the devil.

1160
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,140
Sing.

1161
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,760
Sing choirs of nutjobs.

1162
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,500
Fighting off the devil.

1163
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,220
Oh come let us be Catholic.

1164
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,840
Oh come let us be Baptist.

1165
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,380
Oh come let us be subgenius.

1166
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,420
Let us be subgenius.

1167
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,800
I thought we couldn't have the lettuce.

1168
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,940
Arms and bombs for the poor.

1169
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,260
Pass your bowl around.

1170
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,020
Yes neighbor friend.

1171
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,200
Subby.

1172
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,120
Subby baby.

1173
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,340
Thank you for your donation.

1174
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
Psycho skeletons.

1175
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,000
One liver, two kidneys.

1176
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,580
That was the psycho skeletons.

1177
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,400
And a bag of peas.

1178
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,240
The psycho skeletons?

1179
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,840
Well for psychotic skeletons they sure rattled me pretty good.

1180
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,400
Me too.

1181
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,580
They made me think of those falsified French fried religions.

1182
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,840
Better known as liberty fried re-religions.

1183
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,720
Overcast and misguided by who knows what.

1184
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,640
And yet in front of us is a man with a funny looking ponytail.

1185
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,240
Who somehow has something to do with something better.

1186
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,720
Are you talking about them bobbies?

1187
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,180
Them bobs?

1188
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:08,980
Them bobs.

1189
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:09,560
Them bobs.

1190
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,260
Them dry bobs.

1191
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,220
That's what they call it.

1192
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,500
I got a bad case of dry bobs.

1193
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,660
I got the dry bobs.

1194
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,060
I got the dry bobs and I don't even want to talk about it.

1195
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,680
I'm sure you don't want to hear about it at dinner time.

1196
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,140
Have you ever had the seizing hectares?

1197
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,820
This is a bowel disease which is...

1198
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,640
If it's a bowel disease I've had it.

1199
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:37,280
It is fragrant of course but it passes on from regime to regime.

1200
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,340
We've been wondering what we ate.

1201
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,720
Yes I thought it was rather mal-fragrant actually.

1202
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,300
Caused that earthquake in that country.

1203
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,460
Which country and who did you eat?

1204
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,780
Whom was eaten?

1205
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,460
Who did you eat?

1206
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:50,900
Probably just nuts.

1207
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,520
Probably just coincidence Dave.

1208
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,020
Probably just nothing.

1209
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:54,860
Probably nothing.

1210
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,500
Stang cannibalism does result in earthquakes throughout the globe.

1211
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,820
This has been since the days of ancient shamans.

1212
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,440
Oh it does not.

1213
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,560
That's superstitious.

1214
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,020
It's not.

1215
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,680
It's true.

1216
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,240
It's true.

1217
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,220
It's really true Stang.

1218
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,900
Enough cannibalism can't...

1219
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,220
I'm sorry.

1220
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,220
It's true.

1221
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,140
It's true.

1222
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,400
Oh right.

1223
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,860
I sounded like Blazing Seppelkruz.

1224
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,360
What is it like a hundred monkey thing or something?

1225
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,120
You start one cannibal starts eating and then the rest of us start eating everyone.

1226
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:18,440
Yeah like your book.

1227
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,040
The 100th Cannibal.

1228
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,340
The 100th Exploding Monkey.

1229
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,160
The 100th cannibal.

1230
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,880
The 100th Dahmer.

1231
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,420
The 100th Ed Gein.

1232
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,920
The 100th Charlie Manson.

1233
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,160
Ed Gein's Garage.

1234
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,680
Welcome inside kids.

1235
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,360
The 100th Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1236
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,440
We all just start chowing down on our chums then huh?

1237
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,560
But see people tend to think about the 100th monkey or the 100th mass murder.

1238
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,280
What about the 100th good thing?

1239
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,740
The 100th happy hooker.

1240
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,120
Yeah.

1241
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,940
The 100th.

1242
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,920
Yeah that would be good.

1243
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,160
The 100th.

1244
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,760
Phil agreed.

1245
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,100
Oh never mind.

1246
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:53,820
The.

1247
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,200
The Saint Teresa.

1248
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,240
Mother Teresa.

1249
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,340
The 100th mother.

1250
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,200
No forget that.

1251
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:05,040
You know now that she's a sainted mother they're coming up with bad things to say about her.

1252
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,220
About her.

1253
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,560
About her.

1254
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,840
She wouldn't give that much.

1255
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:13,580
She wouldn't help any poor people unless they swore allegiance to Jesus and so forth.

1256
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,000
I don't know if that's so or not.

1257
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,320
We don't give them any money unless they swore allegiance to Bob.

1258
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,000
No kidding.

1259
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,660
But we're not looking for sainthood.

1260
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,480
We're looking for escape.

1261
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,220
Escape from planet earth.

1262
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,080
And the primate condition.

1263
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,100
A shiny tin foil hat.

1264
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,380
That we've been saddled with by so many millions of years of evolution.

1265
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:37,700
Yes we of the Church of the Subgenius want to undo millions of years of evolution in one day.

1266
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,120
I've locked you in this small compartment.

1267
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,880
Dreaming of one more day.

1268
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,040
We want to tear it all down.

1269
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,720
Only if only I could read the words.

1270
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,520
Offer nothing to build it back.

1271
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,780
If only I could suckle on that bubby.

1272
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,620
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1273
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,080
So let's talk plain raw truth.

1274
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,420
Bob lives.

1275
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,980
Alien beings are all around us.

1276
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:07,220
There is a conspiracy of unimaginable proportions working solely to rob you of your very abnormality.

1277
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:11,740
The president, any president, is a Bolshevik clone.

1278
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,620
Russia, nevertheless, has been taken over by demon-possessed Christians.

1279
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,020
Utter stupidity can make you rich.

1280
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,140
Your own evil ghost twin is standing beside you right now.

1281
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,680
There is a hollow earth that holds an advanced race of supersonic Nazi hell creatures and humans from before the Ice Age.

1282
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,760
Long before the history of man they have to be stopped.

1283
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,980
Tell it to him.

1284
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:34,580
Tell it to him.

1285
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,020
And that was all written in 1980.

1286
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:45,320
Twenty-six years ago this mammal had a smooth, shiny forebrain.

1287
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,600
And now look at him.

1288
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,280
It looks like an old rubber boot caved in.

1289
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,320
It's so sad.

1290
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:51,760
Don't rub it in.

1291
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,660
It can't be rubbed, Stang.

1292
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,020
It can only be whispered to.

1293
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,760
It can be confused with the right brain signals.

1294
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:02,620
I try to rub those wrinkles in my brain smooth.

1295
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,280
That's what I've been trying to do my whole life.

1296
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,900
Trying to rub them smooth.

1297
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,620
To make it one cell somehow?

1298
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,920
To make it just smooth, baby.

1299
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,480
Smooth, you know.

1300
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:14,560
Smooth.

1301
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:20,360
Take those rough edges off your brain tonight with a brand new bag of stinking, smacking,

1302
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:27,380
fresh Stangy's Malodorous Boblyobografin, written and mispronounced by the Reverend Ivan Stang.

1303
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,300
This read will give you more than you've wanted.

1304
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,140
Bill Harper of Newton's Creek says,

1305
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:40,520
Stang's book is a lusty good read and a vacuous big bleed.

1306
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,680
I'm getting dizzy.

1307
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,060
Tom Simpsons of Entertainment Tonight says,

1308
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,340
Stang's book is not only underrated, but also a masterpiece.

1309
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:50,340


1310
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:56,480
It's entertaining, but it's very discomforting and may cause...

1311
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,940
Who is that?

1312
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:00,720
Uh...

1313
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,780
It may cause incidental brilliance.

1314
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,720
That would have been...

1315
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,740
Well, I don't know.

1316
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,800
It's something called Moon Mist from Exotic Lounge.

1317
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,900
I just saw a breast in the middle of someone's forehead and I forgot who that was.

1318
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:13,480
Wow.

1319
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,160
Sorry you forgot that.

1320
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,080
I'd like to know myself.

1321
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,160
Is that the erotic voodoo rhythms?

1322
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,180
Is that also his...

1323
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:20,980
Pastiche?

1324
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,120
I don't know where this came from.

1325
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,100
Could that just be like something in the room?

1326
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,760
I think it came from Queegee Boat.

1327
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,620
The drums?

1328
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,440
With a name like Exotic Lounge.

1329
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,680
That sounds like something that would have come from...

1330
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:32,680


1331
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,620
I thought maybe something was squeaky in the house.

1332
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,160
...that great subgenius Zveen.

1333
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,060
Um...

1334
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,780
But let's see what's up next on this...

1335
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,300
This there.

1336
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,320
And now, a mess from W.

1337
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,260
The war in Iraq has increased the threat of terrorism, not lessened it.

1338
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:50,680
Good morning.

1339
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:57,500
In my speech to the leaders, I spoke about a world dominated by terrorist states and radical dictators armed with nuclear weapons.

1340
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,560
The war has created a new generation of Islamic radicals.

1341
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,240
Forces of terrorism and extremism.

1342
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,740
The overall terrorist threat has grown since the September 11th attacks.

1343
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,180
America has made its choice.

1344
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,020
We're standing with the terrorists and extremists.

1345
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,960
Ra-ra-ra-the war in Iraq.

1346
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,760
Terror that is within our reach.

1347
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:14,900
Ra-ra-ra-we can support...

1348
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,580
Reverend Jerry.

1349
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,020
Jerry.

1350
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:16,380
Jerry.

1351
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,640
The ideology of hate.

1352
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,080
A joke.

1353
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,080
And the war on terror.

1354
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:19,600
A joke.

1355
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,600
America will continue to support violent extremists.

1356
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:22,820
Joe.

1357
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:23,080
Joe.

1358
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:23,380
Joe.

1359
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:23,580
Joe.

1360
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,820
America and its allies will continue to be a safe haven for terrorists.

1361
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,120
Call ya Cheek.

1362
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,520
In my meeting with Boss...

1363
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:29,980
Lucifer.

1364
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,020
I told him that America remains committed.

1365
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:32,640
Cheek.

1366
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,060
Cheek.

1367
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,360
And we will leave the ideology of hate for our children and grandchildren.

1368
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:36,940
Totally.

1369
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:37,820
Thank you for listening.

1370
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:38,320
Totally.

1371
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,080
Air Josh.

1372
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,020
Government.

1373
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,000

1374
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:43,940

1375
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:44,800

1376

1378

00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:49,780

1385
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:49,980

I don't know.

1417
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:05,780
Hm.

1418
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,380
Oh, is it possible in London?

1419
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:08,740
Language.

1420
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,080

1426
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,300
Pine tree.

1427
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,000
You go into a place like I went to rape the Florida State Penitentiary, where you're thrown

1428
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,580
into a sardine cage.

1429
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:26,540
Where you eat and you sleep and you mess on the floor and you lay naked for male and female

1430
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,680
guards to check up on you.

1431
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,940
And in the morning, because the smell is ridiculous, they hose you out with a power hose.

1432
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:38,260
You're told when to eat, what to eat, how to eat, and what do you eat?

1433
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,500
Beans and cornbread.

1434
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:47,000
You go into a place like I went to rape the Florida State Penitentiary, where you're thrown

1435
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,580
into a sardine cage.

1436
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,580
Where you're thrown into a sardine cage.

1437
00:51:49,600 --> 00:52:02,500
You go into a place like I went to rape the Florida State Penitentiary, where you're thrown

1438
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:02,940
into a sardine cage.

1439
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,260
You're told when to eat, what to eat, how to eat, and what do you eat?

1440
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,520
Beans and cornbread.

1441
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,780
And I still alive, though.

1442
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,480
So they get back in the meaningless.

1443
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,560

From PR News in Washington, I'm Multiplying.

1561
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,840
On Wall Street, 457726.

1562
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,100
This is PR.

1563
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,120
The Comprehensive.

1564
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,280
Commerce Department fell one half of a billion dollars.

1565
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:52,860
Talks among General Motors, Renault, and Nissan are expected to last for at least three years.

1566
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:58,340
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is warning citizens against PR News in Washington.

1567
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,140
I'm a little lonely.

1568
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,080
The animals.

1569
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:10,660
No.

1570
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,620

00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,220

00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,220

Go on.

1581
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:30,340
After bidding farewell to loved ones and friends, the passengers show their tickets to the angel who waits at the gate of death.

1582
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,920
The air is getting a bit chilly on the ramp as the gate opens.

1583
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:41,180
But the warmth of peace and hope in the hearts of the passengers seems to produce great calmness as they enter the plane.

1584
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,420
That's right.

1585
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,740
I'm talking about snakes on a plane.

1586
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:45,280
Thank you.
