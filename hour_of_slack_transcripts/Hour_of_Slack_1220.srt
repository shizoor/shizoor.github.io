1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,360
I don't want to be anymore.

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,520
I can't be in my dream.

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,500
The Obama administration will have to ditch Bob and hurry.

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,580
He says here plain as day, no slack.

5
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,060
The subgenius.

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,500
Bob.

7
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,920
Not enough.

8
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,920
Too much is always better.

9
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,420
Too much is always better than not enough.

10
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,200
Hello.

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,720
Hello.

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,360
Hello.

13
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:12,660
Hello.

14
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,100
Hello.

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,320
Hello.

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,940
Hello.

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,880
Hello.

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,820
My name is Bobby J. Dobbs.

19
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,140
Dude.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,860
Hello.

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,460
Meet Groucho Marx.

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,580
Here's your first question.

23
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,260
You have $20.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,920
How much will you bet?

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,180
We bet $35.

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,880
What happened on October 12, 1492?

27
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,900
Fresh.

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,480
The French are right.

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,480
And they wind up with a grand total of $1.

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,160
Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,140
13 is an unlucky number.

32
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,340
If 13's unlucky, then so should the letter BB,

33
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,420
because B looks like a scrunch together 13.

34
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,160
Hello.

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,080
What is your name?

36
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,580
Bob.

37
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,580
Get the hell away.

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,800
Get the hell away.

39
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,780

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,620
The Soul Genius.

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,140
The power of the soul.

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,920
Real American heroes.

43
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,760
Today we salute you, real American heroes.

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,520
Don't stay in too long, or everyone will shout.

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,000
Finish quickly and come back.

46
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,060
Man, I love church.

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
I just love church.

48
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,180
Bob.

49
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,460
Bob.

50
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
Love church.

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,120
Totally.

52
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes.

53
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,200
Giving.

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,820
Yes.

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,520
Giving.

56
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,240
Yes.

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,400
Bob.

58
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,920
I love this guy.

59
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,240
Come join the fun.

60
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,640
All of you have heard of Bob.

61
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,940
Love church.

62
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,280
I gotta tell you, it makes you feel real big.

63
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,060
Go, go, go.

64
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,400
Love church.

65
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,080
Bob.

66
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,960
Yes.

67
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,060
Giving.

68
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,840
Yes.

69
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,500
Giving.

70
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,300
Yes.

71
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,360
Love church.

72
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:57,900
Bob.

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,900


74
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,900


75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,900


76
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,900


77
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,900


78
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,900

00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,900


80
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,900


81
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,900


82
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,400
Yes.

83
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,120
Yes.

84
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,720
Yes.

85
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,480
Okay.

86
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,100
Yeah, it's a lot.

87
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,600
Yes.

88
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:02,860
Yes.

89
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,420
It is hair.

90
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,300
Yes.

91
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,740
Yes.

92
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:11,540


93
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:11,760
Yes.

94
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,440
Right.

95
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,120
Yes.

96
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,420
That's right.

97
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,460
Yes.

98
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,460


99
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,480
That's right.

100
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:16,480


101
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,880
It's a lot of hair.

102
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,140
It is.

103
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,660
It is.

104
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,760
told to leave California's Yellowstone National Park. President Obama is a Jewish teenager. Bob

105
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,040
is traveling with the president after being beaten last night. Meanwhile, Bob jumped a river and it

106
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,020
will be secured early this week. Iran has expanded its mass trial of PR news in Washington. And boom,

107
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,900
Bob's your uncle. It's like having a countercultural Wikipedia in a non-linear narrative,

108
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:56,060
fictional form. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fifteen pounds. Thirty dollars, twenty euros. Decently large.

Yeah.

118
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,300
I don't think you get

119
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,980
what this whole portraiture thing is about.

120
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,980
This is how we want to be remembered.

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,000
Like Nefertiti and things like that.

122
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,160
This is not what actually happened to our...

123
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,780
Well, I'll get my head shot

124
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,780
that I did for the famous...

125
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,460
We're going to shuck.

126
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:03,960
These are...

127
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,040
This outside thing is not what I am.

128
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,140
So we're just going to unzip it.

129
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,980
We're going to unzip our external shell

130
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,080
and show the glorified self,

131
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,580
that glorified state

132
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,440
that we all want to...

133
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,780
Forget about the glorification.

134
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,300
About the romance.

135
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,420
I admire, too.

136
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,820
The romanticification.

137
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,720
Forget about it all.

138
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,400
Okay, I forgot.

139
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,360
Not with the real life.

140
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,220
I forgot.

141
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,980
Freezing Bob and stuff like that.

142
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,540
Not that useless stuff

143
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,740
that you are used to

144
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,940
in your everyday mundane,

145
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,880
stupid life.

146
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,580
Murder us.

147
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,100
The normal life.

148
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,340
The Bob way of life.

149
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,420
The way that Bob sees you

150
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,420
and your...

151
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:46,740
The life.

152
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
My hair.

153
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,980
Would you like to be like that?

154
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,420
Wouldn't you like to be like that?

155
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,020
Oh, he's taking over.

156
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,120
What is that?

157
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,760
Those free wings.

158
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,640
What was that?

159
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,620
Well,

160
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,940
that was an enlightened caller,

161
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,380
but I don't know what happened to him.

162
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,980
Yeah, I think he went around the dark side.

163
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,420
How refreshing it was to him.

164
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,000
I hope he's going to be

165
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
at the beautiful little

166
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,640
October Portland thing.

167
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,740
Me too.

168
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,960
Because, uh...

169
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:24,760
Yeah.

170
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,980
Hello, hello.

171
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,200
We're here at the devotional.

172
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,860
It's winding down.

173
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,700
The Spud Boys are playing.

174
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,180
Unfortunately,

175
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,360
Bob Casale had to leave early.

176
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,220
Things got a little delayed

177
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,780
and he didn't get to play with the band,

178
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,780
but what's the difference?

179
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,460
They sound just like Devo did anyway.

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
Fantastic show.

181
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,100
Great show.

182
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,120
My favorite part about the devotionals

183
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,760
are all the cute nerd girls

184
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,040
with big glasses.

185
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,460
Trans doivent.

186
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:21,460


187
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,020
I hope you enjoy it.

188
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,640
Came...

189
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:40,860
We touched everything together

190
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,500
and you were as mellow and mellow

191
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:41,500


192
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:41,500


193
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:41,560
and my mom's back.

194
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:41,700


195
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:41,940
We seem completely sort of

196
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,240
on the same track.

197
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,860
It is so much different than what was performing

198
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,420
a year ago all along.

199
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,200
We as bongs like an ape, bongs like an ape, do what a monkey do.

200
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,800
Just make men, but a monkey's right to do.

201
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:13,600
We are Devo.

202
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:19,420
We must repeat.

203
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,080
We must repeat.

204
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,700
We must repeat.

205
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,340
We must repeat.

206
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,000
We must repeat.

207
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,940
Okay, let's go!

208
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,580
Something out the way you taste

209
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,040
Makes you wanna clear my throat

210
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,540
There's a message to your number

211
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,480
It really gets my gut

212
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,740
I'm in the city lightning

213
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,800
But you're right to the core

214
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,180
I had to say that I could take it

215
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,160
No, I can't take it no more

216
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,520
Got a good feeling

217
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,440
Got a good feeling

218
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,420
Got a good feeling

219
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,840
Feeling

220
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,160
No, no, no, take me no

221
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,720
No, no, no, take me no

222
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:51,720


223
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,720
Not that Nestled

224
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Me, not that Nestled

225
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,160
No, no, no, don't need you

226
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,780
A tim 탄

227
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,580

No, I'm lucky

234
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,400

237
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,520
Da

238
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,600
Thank you.

239
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,760
Thank you.

240
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,260
Thank you.

241
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,020
Thank you.

242
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,400
Thank you.

243
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:49,780
Thank you.

244
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,080
Thank you.

245
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,600
Thank you.

246
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:19,880
Thank you.

247
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,420
Thank you.

248
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,360
Thank you.

249
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,400
Thank you.

250
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,400
Thank you.

251
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,380
Thank you.

252
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,420
Thank you.

253
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,160
Thank you.

254
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,920
Next week, maybe, we'll play the introduction that explains the mystery of the Bergie Boys.

255
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,060
I have a poopy, necropondy song.

256
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
In fact, I have two of them queued up.

257
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,340
Oh, I called too early then.

258
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,200
No, no, you didn't.

259
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,280
I won't play them anyway.

260
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,380
Well, I just, I was looking at...

261
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,120
I'll play them next week, or maybe at the end or something.

262
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:47,040
I was looking at Mark Monkey Ball's little red book here, which he used to wave around like a mouse and stuff.

263
00:19:47,040 --> 00:20:04,080
And there is a, not a picture, an old-style medical stool, school, medical stool, illustration of a small baby man crawling into a female orifice with something hanging off its back.

264
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,200
And I just wondered, you know, there's Boogey Boy and Boogie Boy.

265
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,280
And what that has to do with Bob, for crying out loud, if anything.

266
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,240
The evolution.

267
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,620
They're both...

268
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:22,740
The Church of the Subgenius and Devoe are predicated on a deteriorating mental environment.

269
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,960
Well, a perfect example of...

270
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,920
And dirty pictures.

271
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,160
Yeah, a few pages after, this is a perfect example of a deteriorating mental...

272
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,400
There's a huge potato having sex with a nurse.

273
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,240
Right.

274
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:44,180
Yeah, we reprinted some stories from that and Mark's illustrations in Three-Fisted Tales of Bob, which is out of print.

275
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,420
It had all...

276
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,020
It had the most famous writers in it.

277
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:56,560
William S. Burroughs, Robert Anton Wilson, a couple of rock stars, several science fiction famous guys, John Shirley, Lou Shiner.

278
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,360
Nobody bought that book.

279
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,720
Our first book that's done entirely by nobodies is in its 20th printing.

280
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,360
So go figure.

281
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,200
That's the subgenius way.

282
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,700
Scrawled on what you call a paper, on kindergarten paper with some paint.

283
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,140
That'd probably sell the best.

284
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,160
Also, our friend Reverend Steve Sinek was at the devotional.

285
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,280
He's always everywhere somehow.

286
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,820
There's all those cute college students from Ex Day, one of whom you said is in a class with you.

287
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,000
Was in a class.

288
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,780
Right.

289
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,980
It was a class on hirsutism.

290
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:39,940
We were all learning what makes people hairy, what makes them calvo, as they say in Spanish, or palau, baldies and stuff like that.

291
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,840
And I don't think that has anything to do with Bobby.

292
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,200
I thought Dave was in a class all of his own.

293
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,520
Yeah.

294
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:45,780
I am.

295
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,880
Yeah.

296
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,780
Someday they'll teach a class in Dave.

297
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,960
I look a little bit like Melvin Laird.

298
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,800
I have a master's in Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

299
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,440
Third degree.

300
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,060
And then they would speak all in Dave speak, much in the way in your movie everyone will speak in Stang speak.

301
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,240
Well, we have to weave the Dave speak and some normal speak in between.

302
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,240
Because if it's all in Stang speak, it'll be like a rise, which is like being hammered.

303
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,600
Our subgenius.

304
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,480
Our subgenius video, a rise.

305
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:16,840
It's.

306
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,680
Altering behavior.

307
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,640
What?

308
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,020
Extending our control over mind and body.

309
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,620
We wire the animal.

310
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,560
We wire the human.

311
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,280
With every new step.

312
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,200
Behaviorism.

313
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,060
The consequences for human life become magnified.

314
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,080
I knew this was about behaviorism and Pavlovian research.

315
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,760
I knew this all along.

316
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,160
Well, you're right.

317
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:43,520
I have been reading interesting articles about the placebo effect lately.

318
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,520
And I read.

319
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,920
I read an article today about the Internet creating more literacy.

320
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,860
Well, and now it's funny, though.

321
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,600
Think about it.

322
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,460
Let me actually.

323
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,080
Of a new speaker.

324
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,600
Right.

325
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,300
I get this.

326
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,260
I hate to admit it, but I read this in Wired magazine.

327
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,020
Oh, well, they're the protagonists of such a thing.

328
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,580
Well, yeah, but there's.

329
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,280
OK, when the Internet.

330
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,460
When I first realized what the Internet was, I had a theory that that turned out to be somewhat wrong.

331
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,940
And now it's turning out to be right again.

332
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,960
Somewhat right.

333
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,620
My theory was this is going to change everything.

334
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,980
And that part was correct.

335
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:33,980
But I thought it's going to divide the world into those who can read and are literate and those who can't.

336
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,060
Because at that time, the Internet was text based.

337
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:45,360
In 1994, the most brilliant subgenius computer scientist that I knew, when I asked him if I could make a flushing noise on my website.

338
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,260
When somebody pushed a button, they said, no, absolutely no way.

339
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,540
There'll never be enough bandwidth for music or sounds on the Internet.

340
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,200
Of course, now we watch TV on the Internet.

341
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,900
When it started turning into TV, I thought, oh, no, there goes that literacy thing.

342
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:08,660
But as it turns out, despite all the pundits griping and complaining about how texting is going to ruin these kids ability to write.

343
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,120
Somebody decided to check it out.

344
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,620
And they did a study at Stanford University.

345
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,320
They had a.

346
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:26,280
Big project where they looked at all the student writing samples of all kinds for five years from in-class assignments, formal essays and journal to e-mails, blogs and chat sessions.

347
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,020
And her conclusions are stirring.

348
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,380
Now, don't get upset, Dave.

349
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,680
She says, I think we're in the midst of a literacy revolution, the likes of which we haven't seen since Greek civilization.

350
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,660
So Greek.

351
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,020
I wonder what that has to do.

352
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,780
Anyway, she says that people young people today.

353
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:44,960
Right.

354
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:54,440
Far more than any generation before them, because so much socializing takes place online and it almost always involves text.

355
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,940
Thirty eight percent of the writing kids do take place outside of the classroom.

356
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,280
Now, before the Internet came along, most Americans never wrote anything ever.

357
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:11,740
That wasn't a class assignment unless they got a job that required producing text.

358
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,640
When we know how much those pay, Dave.

359
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,260
They'd leave school and virtually never construct a paragraph again.

360
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,920
But now everybody's writing.

361
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,040
They actually have an audience.

362
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,760
We didn't.

363
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,540
You know, if you were a normal American, you didn't used to have an audience.

364
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,380
You write a letter to one person.

365
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,900
Now you actually have a reason to write more stuff.

366
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:43,020
And what they discovered was out of all those essays and things, they kids aren't really using text abbreviations in their school papers.

367
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,640
However, they don't.

368
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:49,020
They don't quite understand why they're doing the school papers because only one person reads them.

369
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,540
The professor.

370
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,400
Well, I don't suppose that's a point well taken at all.

371
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,980
I think that people are over mediated.

372
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,900
You have to agree with me, wouldn't you?

373
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,720
That Americans are the most mediated people in the world.

374
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:13,840
Well, a lot of the ones that I deal with certainly do seem to spend more of their life watching other people have lives than they do having a life.

375
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,360
Yes.

376
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,960
That's permeated with media, eh?

377
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:17,480
Yes.

378
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:17,820
Okay.

379
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,500
So they're over mediated.

380
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,320
They're saturated with all this material.

381
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,360
But it's the material that they're being fed.

382
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:29,700
Now, in some cases of the wild and free Internet, they're being fed things that we would find quite delicious and delightful.

383
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,860
But on the other hand, they're being fed a lot of pablum and other soft cereals.

384
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,840
And so what they're writing about is basically soft cereal content.

385
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,760
So although they can write them letters real good, maybe the content.

386
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,660
And maybe their grammar is even kind of good, but the content is still stupid as hell, you know?

387
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,240
Well, we're back to Devo again.

388
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,060
De-evolution.

389
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,260
So a whole generation of retarded Hemingways.

390
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Devo was right about everything.

391
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,260
Everything except for what the Church of the Subgenius was right about that didn't overlap.

392
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,760
And then that part confuses me too much to know what you're talking about.

393
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,020
Well, it's not one envelope.

394
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,020
It's a vast series of interconnected cyber envelopes.

395
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,820
And in your case, you have access to all their material.

396
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,000
They have access to all yours.

397
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,780
So you can plagiarize each other.

398
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,940
It works for me.

399
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:32,960
What the hell?

400
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,840
Onan knows I plagiarize him all the time.

401
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,500
In the background, we faintly hear the Gadgeto album.

402
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,760
I guess Gadgeto will be playing.

403
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:44,760


404
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,880
He's playing at the Portland DeVival.

405
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,320
Onan!

406
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
And Princess Wee's going to get to go to that.

407
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:50,900
Yeah!

408
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,960
But she's not going to be with the famous keyboard masturbator himself, is she?

409
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,040
Who, Onan?

410
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,600
Yes.

411
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,260
Not for...

412
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,200
No, I'm going to keep...

413
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,500
I'm a bird dog, that stuff.

414
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:02,880
Yeah.

415
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,900
You know I'm always a bird dog, that stuff.

416
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,000
You better keep an eye on your own, you know?

417
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,480
Yeah.

418
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,200
Yeah.

419
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,560
Now, it was at Princess Wee couldn't go to the devotional last night, and everybody

420
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,700
asked about her.

421
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,860
They asked after her.

422
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,420
Oh.

423
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,460
Because they love...

424
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,000
Everybody loves Princess Wee.

425
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,360
Oh.

426
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,980
As I heard Rob say on his show one time, a lot of people like Princess...

427
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,600
They think Stan's a jerk, but they like Princess Wee.

428
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,440
I'll never forget that.

429
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,380
That's at least the second time I've referred to her.

430
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,700
I don't think you'll ever forget that, no.

431
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:33,940
But...

432
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,860
Oh, yeah, Dave, I'm sorry.

433
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,140
You couldn't have been there either, because you probably would have...

434
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,840
You were always ready to enjoy the DeVos, weren't you?

435
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,600
I...

436
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,680
The last one I was at was like...

437
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,480
I was at the DeVos, like, five years ago.

438
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,160
But I certainly enjoyed it, and I enjoyed all of the bands that sounded and looked just

439
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,060
like DeVos for the brief moment of time they did.

440
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,620
And the culture that came, that was everywhere, the atmospherics of the place brought back

441
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,420
something and recreated something and created something new.

442
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,140
Those guys were pretty influential.

443
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,680
Mm-hmm.

444
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,940
They influenced me to break my toe last night.

445
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,020
Right.

446
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,900
Doing the doo-doo dance?

447
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,360
Get...

448
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,220
Here's the names of the bands that played that I saw.

449
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,060
I didn't get there till 3 o'clock.

450
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,740
I missed KRK Rydin's thing.

451
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,940
But we just played a clip from Fart Barf from L.A.

452
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,060
The Mutant Mountain Boys, you know.

453
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,780
They've done Bob songs, and they're the best-looking of the bands.

454
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,660
The Weird Paul Rock Band.

455
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,240
That's the name of a band.

456
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,180
The Weird Paul Rock Band.

457
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,060
And they did great old-school Devo covers.

458
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,440
But there was no Weird Paul, though, was there?

459
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,640
Yes, I think there was.

460
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,240
I think...

461
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,820
But I don't know which one he was.

462
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,560
Now, they...

463
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,360
You know, like most of the bands that I ended up getting to know, they all wear masks and

464
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,300
have funny names.

465
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,860
Now, wasn't there one year where they were all dressed up in, like, Betty Page and stuff

466
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,420
like that?

467
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,020
No, I think you're thinking of GWAR or the Amino Acids.

468
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,000
They dress as Betty Page every now and then just to surprise everybody.

469
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,080
The Bergy Boys.

470
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,760
The Bergy Boys played.

471
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,560
They had bergy hats, or bergy hats.

472
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,720
But what is a bergy or a bergy?

473
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,280
What's a bergy or a bergy?

474
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,640
It turns out that...

475
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,540
And Poopy Necropondy explained this to me.

476
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,260
A bergy or bergy is a type of flag.

477
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,460
And the Ohio State flag, unlike all the other square flags at one time...

478
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:34,900
Is it bergy?

479
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,920
...was kind of...

480
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,640
It's like it had a V-shaped wedge on the far end of it.

481
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,360
And it also came kind of narrowed down.

482
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,920
It wasn't a perfect square.

483
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,400
It was like a pennant.

484
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,220
Yeah, like a pennant.

485
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:47,420
Pennant.

486
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,660
Very much like a pennant.

487
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,520
And these guys had copies of these old flags on the top of their bergy hats.

488
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,140
Because it's true.

489
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,040
If you're going to play at the devotional, you really have to have some kind of a funny

490
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,860
uniform and goofy names and all that.

491
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,840
And yes, it was great.

492
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,620
Oh, I got a recording of some idiots finding my tapes.

493
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:09,860
I got a tape recorder.

494
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,180
Well, that sounds very interesting.

495
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,960
Yeah, I haven't had a chance to edit this stuff yet, but they...

496
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,340
I mean, I just had left it sitting on a table recording the bands while I danced.

497
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,680
And somebody, for some reason, decided it must be lost since there wasn't anybody sitting

498
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,380
next to it.

499
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,200
I'm a trusting idiot, you see.

500
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,620
And I got to hear them have an argument about whether to smash it on the ground.

501
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,440
And then they decided not to because that would be bad karma.

502
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,400
Well, that's when nylon...

503
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:45,240
Zafat Intelligence is taking your equipment and implanting it with different kinds of

504
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,820
devices that they can either listen to you or look at you or just maybe at some time

505
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,920
implode your house while you're away or there.

506
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,140
Well, I really should just start tying my tape recorders to the top of my head.

507
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,140
Don't tie your shoes together anymore.

508
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,200
That didn't work.

509
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:00,760
Well, I can't.

510
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,820
I got a broken toe now.

511
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,160
I taped my toe to the other toe as a splint.

512
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,380
That's actually what you do, by the way.

513
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,900
way, kids, listeners. If you

514
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,240
bust your toe,

515
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,220
the doctor will x-ray it just

516
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,000
to make you feel better, but

517
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,260
really about all you

518
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,340
can do is just tape it to the next toe over.

519
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,380
Put a popsicle stick in between

520
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,340
each one of them, half of a popsicle stick,

521
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,680
and then tape your toes together.

522
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,240
I think that's for fingers and for your

523
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,080
tongue. If you break your tongue,

524
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,480
you put a splint on it.

525
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,840
Then you talk like this.

526
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,200
I've been surprised how

527
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,180
many people get into radio

528
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,140
who have a 50-pack.

529
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,100
Sometimes it works

530
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,880
for them, though. I mean, look at Barbara Walters

531
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,680
and some of those newscasters.

532
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,200
Well, some of them have a

533
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,800
palate cleft and so forth, but I

534
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,960
guess what those sticks are very best for

535
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,880
is for uterine enslavement.

536
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,360
Oh.

537
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,740
Some people still have that.

538
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,220
I know it's 2009,

539
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,600
but American health care isn't that great.

540
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,360
What? What? What?

541
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,560
Say that year again.

542
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,240
Irrigational

543
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,020
It's 2009, did you say?

544
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,080
2010 it is. Now I forgot.

545
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,180
Which is it?

546
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,780
10 or 9?

547
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,040
Number 9?

548
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,320
I don't know whether

549
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,360
I've been in the future or the past.

550
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,620
You're still smoking the Holy Sevens?

551
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,780
Seven Heavens.

552
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,260
Seven Heavens.

553
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,920
I've been visiting the Seven Hells

554
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,820
and I try to see the pipe smoker.

555
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,080
I try to see his face

556
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,940
in my mind to see if that'll

557
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,600
give me any form of slack

558
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,540
and it doesn't work.

559
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,240
Just turns into another demon head

560
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,800
just like in one of your graphics, man.

561
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,220
Bummer.

562
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,080
Would it do you any good if I sent you

563
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,300
a nice 8x10 of Bob?

564
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,420
Heck yeah.

565
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,140
Did you ever actually send your $30

566
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,840
into the Church of the Subgenius, Dave?

567
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,520
I sent you $45 and you said

568
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,200
don't worry about it.

569
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,180
Oh, good. So I didn't send you anything.

570
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,160
You gave me money and I didn't do anything.

571
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,340
I like that way best.

572
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,780
You know, I was griping to Bob Casali

573
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,500
about how the other Devo guys

574
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,280
had not actually paid their money.

575
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,880
They kind of, you know,

576
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,840
they might have done soundtracks

577
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,120
for our videos and stuff like that,

578
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,580
but they never actually paid that $30.

579
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,640
I did. I actually did that one time

580
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,440
just before in 1997.

581
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,040
And we were such a big company

582
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,840
then I didn't even have to endorse the check.

583
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,140
Yeah.

584
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,500
We're not requesting anything like that

585
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,620
from our listeners, by the way.

586
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,920
This show is completely...

587
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,460
completely free.

588
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,840
Free, free, free.

589
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,500
Free of everything except restraints.

590
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,460
Free thought. Free association.

591
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,220
Free laundry.

592
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,080
Free toes.

593
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,280
Free utilities.

594
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,460
Free paychecks. My paycheck is free

595
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,520
that I get from the station.

596
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,920
Unfortunately, it has zero on it.

597
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,480
The zeros are in front.

598
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,360
Yeah, right.

599
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,240
But that's the best kind of radio to do,

600
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,020
you know, because

601
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,480
if somebody's paying you,

602
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,720
they're going to want you to say certain things.

603
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,320
Right.

604
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,180
And all we have to do is be careful

605
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,080
not to say certain things.

606
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,420
And we get unpaid.

607
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,620
They give us demerit points

608
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,240
and we have to sort albums and stuff.

609
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,160
And say you actually owe money

610
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,460
for a piece of material or music and stuff

611
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,120
that wasn't yours, even if it was,

612
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,080
or something.

613
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,860
I tried not to think about that.

614
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,680
Oh, by the way,

615
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,540
speaking of legal ramifications

616
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,920
of using other people's...

617
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,300
Mark Hosler

618
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,020
from the infamous

619
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,240
appropriators,

620
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,060
Negative Land, is going to be speaking

621
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,860
at the CIA,

622
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,060
Cleveland Institute of Art,

623
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,500
not the Home Security people.

624
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,440
Not the Culinary Institute of America.

625
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,080
Right, no.

626
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,680
On Wednesday night,

627
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,580
it's CORE.

628
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,900
It's for something called CORE

629
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,660
and I don't know what CORE stands for,

630
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,780
but he's going to be talking about legalities

631
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,660
of sampling and all that kind of stuff.

632
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,400
But Negative Land kind of

633
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,340
made their fortune on you, you might say,

634
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,980
after they were completely crushed

635
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,600
and destroyed by the lawyers of U2,

636
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,260
the band U2.

637
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,640
Not you and Princess Wee,

638
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,020
but those Irish guys

639
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,640
that are incredibly rich

640
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,460
and sing about how sad it is

641
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,000
that so many people are incredibly poor.

642
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,620
I've never actually heard any of their music,

643
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,400
to tell the truth.

644
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,580
But I do know that they let their lawyers

645
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,760
crush my friend.

646
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,140
In Negative Land.

647
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,160
Who, by the way, did their second live show

648
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,920
of all time the night Bob was shot

649
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,220
at the Subgenius show in 1984

650
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,600
where Bob was shot.

651
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,360
That's why Bob doesn't come to the devotionals

652
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,040
hardly ever.

653
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,620
I've seen him at Amino Acids.

654
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,260
Right.

655
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,000
If he comes to a pure Subgenius show,

656
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,200
you know, I mean,

657
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
he himself told us,

658
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,420
if you see me on the highway, kill me.

659
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,280
But he does show up

660
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,660
occasionally at Amino Acids

661
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:07,900
concerts.

662
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,860
He's not as tall as I always expect him to be.

663
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,900
Well, it's perfectly right.

664
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,260
His head is huge.

665
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,840
It's gigantic.

666
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,200
It's just enormous.

667
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,620
Yeah, he makes Reverend Back It On Up,

668
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,160
the famous big boss Subgenius woman,

669
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,060
look like a pinhead by comparison.

670
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,440
Bob does.

671
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,700
His face is so...

672
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,120
It's not just his cranium.

673
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,300
It's his whole face.

674
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,640
It's just gigantic.

675
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,040
Well, you'd have to say his face is bigger than his cranium.

676
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:37,640
He looks like a big boss.

677
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,660
He looks kind of dwarfish,

678
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,300
but yet he's normal height.

679
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,500
He looks like a macrocephalic.

680
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,340
Come on and admit it.

681
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,460
Yeah, exactly.

682
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,640
A big-headed...

683
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,380
I can see why his portraits

684
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,780
that are spray-painted all over Cleveland

685
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,920
only show his head.

686
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,340
A lot of people thought that Bob was nothing but a head.

687
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,780
Yeah.

688
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,980
Because they never saw a body.

689
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,540
I've actually seen...

690
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,900
I'm afraid I've seen Bob undressed,

691
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,140
and it's about as scary

692
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,220
as seeing Mark Mothersbaugh undressed.

693
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:07,660


694
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,300
Which is another thing I saw one time.

695
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,540
It's etched in my...

696
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,100
My God, I wish I hadn't thought of that.

697
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,160
And you know that guy gets more...

698
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,780
Oh, what's the polite term?

699
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,940
Nookie, I think, than anybody.

700
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,860
You have to have an enormously scary body

701
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,000
to get lots of nookie.

702
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,160
I think that's what women are attracted to.

703
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,660
They'd like to be frightened by your body.

704
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,460
They like to go,

705
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,360
uh, uh, I'm going to run away,

706
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,440
and then, you know...

707
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,460
That explains a lot.

708
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,340
That's why I envy monsters

709
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,660
You know, you're right.

710
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,220
Every time...

711
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,900
Every monster movie poster,

712
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,380
what's the monster doing?

713
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,480
Carrying a girl around.

714
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,220
A nice-looking lady

715
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,920
with her clothes ripped up.

716
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,640
Right, because it was in the days

717
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,980
when it couldn't actually show

718
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,380
full frontal sexual activity.

719
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,620
You couldn't see the monster

720
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,660
actually engaging in coitus

721
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,900
with one of the mini-bevvies.

722
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,540
But you can...

723
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,840
Not back then.

724
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,500
Now you can.

725
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:02,980
Yeah.

726
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,560
In fact, now you have to.

727
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,300
They had to sleep in separate beds.

728
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:06,700
Hard not to.

729
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,080
Hard not to.

730
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,220
Hard not to.

731
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:07,300
Hard not to.

732
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:07,320
Hard not to.

733
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,320


734
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,320


735
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,760
Rodan swiped that one

736
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,980
Japanese babe and stuff,

737
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,740
and they had her in the motel room.

738
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,360
They had to have twin beds

739
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,100
because of the standards

740
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,400
and practices.

741
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:17,760
Right.

742
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,060
And in Mothra,

743
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,180
they had to have three beds

744
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,180
because they were twin,

745
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,860
little, tiny, miniature

746
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,220
monster singers.

747
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,900
And they could never show them

748
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,340
in a close two or three or four

749
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,000
or whatever it was

750
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,840
because it would, you know,

751
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,800
look like perversion.

752
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,440
Like, what's that big, big monster

753
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,500
going to do with those...

754
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,560
Those six-inch-high little

755
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,160
islanders.

756
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,540
Mothra islanders.

757
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,700
Finger candy, I guess,

758
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,740
is what they would call it.

759
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,100
Well, I've told you how I wish

760
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,600
King Kong would use me.

761
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,920
But I have a thing for Kong.

762
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
The Peter Jackson Kong.

763
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,920
So you want to be abducted

764
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,100
by a large gorilla.

765
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,900
A large male gorilla.

766
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,540
A large male gorilla

767
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,680
taken off to some mountain lair

768
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,500
and fondled for hours

769
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,780
with a hand that is

770
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,460
bigger than your whole body.

771
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,480
I don't want to go into

772
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,500
too much detail because

773
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,860
even though it doesn't involve

774
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,560
bad words, it verges on obscenity.

775
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,280
And that's not cool.

776
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,000
So I'll just leave it up

777
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,520
to the imagination of the listener

778
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,180
as to what I want King Kong

779
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,140
to use me for,

780
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,260
which will probably be a lot worse

781
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,260
than what I was thinking.

782
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,360
You should read the fine print.

783
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,820
Maybe he just needs to use you

784
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,580
for endorsements.

785
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,240
I think you probably,

786
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,920
maybe you got that in your head.

787
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,380
He wanted to use you.

788
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,460
When you read the letter

789
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,500
from his legal staff

790
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,220
that he wants to use you

791
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,060
and that way you were just

792
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,700
kind of projecting

793
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,280
your own adolescent feelings

794
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,580
towards being fondled

795
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,380
by a big monkey

796
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,660
into his thoughts of saying,

797
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,180
hey, all my Kong friends

798
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,260
think Slack is cool.

799
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:53,900
Praise Bob.

800
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,000
I, you know.

801
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,860
King Kong?

802
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,340
Well, yeah.

803
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,440
He still exists in the mind.

804
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,420
He was the last of his kind,

805
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:01,880
unfortunately.

806
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,320
Even before Skull Island

807
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,360
vanished beneath the sun,

808
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,620
the waves in 1940,

809
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,260
that Mega Primatus Kong

810
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,580
was the one that they had

811
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,900
in New York that was killed.

812
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,180
That was the last one.

813
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,100
The only fact...

814
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,460
I can smell the Studebaker

815
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,180
in the background

816
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,780
rising at the tree.

817
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,360
I heard you say that.

818
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,980
The, uh...

819
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,940
What I was saying was

820
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,180
that the only...

821
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,380
It's hard to imagine,

822
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,540
but the only fossils

823
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,240
that remain from Skull Island

824
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:34,940
are the skeleton

825
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,040
of that giant ape.

826
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,700
At which you're at the basement

827
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,100
of the Smithsonian now.

828
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,360
But there were three expeditions

829
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,380
after the famous

830
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,940
denim expedition,

831
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,440
and they were...

832
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,880
Hardly anybody survived.

833
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,940
And now it's gone.

834
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,280
Now it's at the bottom

835
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:52,840
of the ocean.

836
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,200
Did the Blue Jeans...

837
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,420
The Levi Strauss Company

838
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,240
back that denim expedition?

839
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:00,960
I...

840
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,600
It seems to me

841
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,580
there would be a lot

842
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,300
of opportunities

843
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,460
for something...

844
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,200
This is Carl Denham

845
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,320
for Denim Slacks.

846
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,560
Check me out

847
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,880
and look right behind me

848
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,080
in the beautiful foreground.

849
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,160
There's a huge, huge

850
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,160
paleolithic-looking animal

851
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,820
with plenty of hair

852
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,600
all over his body.

853
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,500
He's about to grab me,

854
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,140
scoop me up,

855
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,540
and put me in his denim.

856
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,300
The eighth wonder of the world!

857
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,020
And then you'll really have slacks.

858
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,380
This is Bob Dobbs

859
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,740
for Hellman's Mayonnaise.

860
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,700
Don't just eat that, Hellman's.

861
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,560
Eat the hell out of it.

862
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,200
Man.

863
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:36,680
Yeah.

864
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,100
That's a fake ad

865
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,240
that would be in our movie

866
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,340
to show how the church

867
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,260
has sold out.

868
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,180
That's, I think,

869
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:45,820
worth pursuing.

870
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,240
But the cool thing is

871
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,960
we might be able

872
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,800
to get Hellman's

873
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
to actually, you know,

874
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,180
give us product placement money.

875
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,260
Yeah, just think like,

876
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,460
you know, five, ten years,

877
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,260
you're driving

878
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,100
through New York City

879
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:57,800
or you're driving

880
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,740
out in the country somewhere

881
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,620
and there's a billboard

882
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,420
and there's a little boy

883
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,160
eating a sandwich

884
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,420
and there's a dad

885
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,220
kind of like

886
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,340
in the Devo,

887
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,300
little red book

888
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,300
and stuff overlooking

889
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,180
over his shoulder

890
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:08,920
instead of pointing

891
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,660
to his anus

892
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,160
or whatever he did there

893
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,500
saying,

894
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,920
your anus is over there, son.

895
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,740
He's saying,

896
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,220
don't just eat that hamburger.

897
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,420
Eat the hell out of it.

898
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,000
Man.

899
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,380
Oh, no.

900
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,280
I'm sorry.

901
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,020
I'm sorry.

902
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,360
That was wasted air time.

903
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,080
Oh, no.

904
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,700
Not wasted air time

905
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,640
on the hour of slack.

906
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,140
I was just thinking,

907
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,740
Hellman's,

908
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,420
we talked about

909
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,080
Hellman's Mayonnaise

910
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,000
so much just now.

911
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,880
They should pay us

912
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,820
for product placement

913
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,460
for mentioning

914
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,300
on this,

915
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:34,560
uh,

916
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,300
syndicated college

917
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,060
radio show.

918
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:37,560
Yeah,

919
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,780
technically it was illegal

920
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,680
or necrophiliac

921
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,620
or something like that

922
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,620
to do it on the air

923
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,660
without saying

924
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,800
We were joking, though.

925
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,220
Right.

926
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,860
We were doing a subgenius.

927
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,080
This is just part

928
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,240
of the satire, friends.

929
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,000
We do not

930
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,220
import any product

931
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,540
other than slack.

932
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,360
Yeah, the lead enemas,

933
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,120
that's all just part

934
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,980
of the satire.

935
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,380
As Bob said.

936
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,720
Before we laughed

937
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,860
at satire,

938
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,400
instead we

939
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,600
Isn't this church

940
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,580
a joke or something?

941
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,220
No.

942
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,180
How did,

943
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,120
how did it be

944
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,420
if Bob were to give you

945
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:07,980
a lead,

946
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:08,900
hot lead enema

947
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,080
as part of the satire?

948
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,740
You want to see

949
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,760
how funny it is, buddy?

950
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,600
Bend over there.

951
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,000
That's right.

952
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,180
I had to do it.

953
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,220
I had to go through that.

954
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,200
You did?

955
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,780
I was trying to make sure.

956
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,180
Did I drop all the names

957
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:19,900
I was supposed to

958
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,660
about who was at

959
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,000
the Devo show?

960
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,440
I said,

961
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,520
I mentioned that one guy.

962
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,520
I mentioned,

963
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:24,700


964
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,000
Reverend can't remember

965
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
his name right now.

966
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,460
I mentioned that girl

967
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,220
Princess We is jealous of.

968
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,320
And, uh,

969
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,020
superhero,

970
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,540
uh,

971
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:34,540


972
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,560
Oren from WCSB.

973
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,820
I just wanted to make sure

974
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,700
I got all my plug.

975
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,180
Oren was the only one

976
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,160
that you hadn't mentioned.

977
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,600
Now you've done him justice.

978
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,500
He's always at that

979
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,300
Greek festival.

980
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,340
I wonder what that means.

981
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,700
Maybe he's in the hood.

982
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,780
Maybe he's twisting his oranges.

983
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,760
Yeah, it could simply mean

984
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,440
he lives in the same

985
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,300
neighborhood as us,

986
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:55,620
I guess.

987
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,880
But I prefer to think

988
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,380
that there's a

989
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,940
deep conspiracy

990
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,700
of the dry core show

991
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,360
against the hour of slack show.

992
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,700
Well, you have claimed

993
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,460
that you've seen him

994
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,880
staring at his palafi,

995
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,440
his cut to palafi

996
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,040
for hours,

997
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,720
mumbling weird things.

998
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,220
Well, everybody does that

999
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,040
at the Greek festival.

1000
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,680
And they're sequestered,

1001
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,380
taken away

1002
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,020
and put in little rooms.

1003
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,320
I don't know why

1004
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,320
you guys still keep going

1005
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,380
after being, uh,

1006
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,500
sequestered,

1007
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,060
so to speak,

1008
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:23,720
so many times.

1009
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,360
I have Stockholm syndrome.

1010
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,240
I like being abducted.

1011
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,480
I think that's pretty clear

1012
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,520
to the audience by now.

1013
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,740
Well, everybody loves

1014
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,780
to be abducted

1015
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,120
by elderly Greek ladies.

1016
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,340
You know how to make moussaka.

1017
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,740
Actually, there's, uh,

1018
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,300
there's a little Greek lady

1019
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,740
that I have trouble

1020
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,240
taking my eyes off of.

1021
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,240
I have to really be

1022
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,700
disciplined to not stare

1023
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,700
because, uh,

1024
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,560
have you ever heard

1025
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,480
the term gilf?

1026
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:50,700
Gilf?

1027
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,260
Yeah.

1028
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,860
Like gilf only

1029
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,740
with an F on the end?

1030
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,640
Sort of.

1031
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,060
No, G-I-L-F.

1032
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,060
It's related to the term

1033
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,760
milf, M-I-L-F.

1034
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,220
But at our age,

1035
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,000
we probably,

1036
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,600
we probably should set

1037
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,600
our sights higher

1038
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,480
age-wise.

1039
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,420
Well, that was very obtrusive.

1040
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:13,620
No, no.

1041
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,280
I'm saying, you know,

1042
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,200
I go to, say,

1043
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,740
I'm at X Day or Devotional

1044
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,360
or one of the,

1045
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,040
or Starwood.

1046
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,380
Those are the three places

1047
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,720
that I leave my house for.

1048
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,900
Or here.

1049
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,200
I'm a guy.

1050
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,040
I'm a regular guy.

1051
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,320
I got an eye for the ladies.

1052
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,060
Princess Wee has to keep me

1053
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:29,760
on a leash.

1054
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:30,700
And, uh,

1055
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,080
actually, she doesn't.

1056
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,580
I only have hands,

1057
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,260
for Princess Wee,

1058
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,400
as I have told them.

1059
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,700
But I do, I do, uh,

1060
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,740
but it's,

1061
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,900
it's not usually

1062
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,140
the young ladies

1063
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,220
that I'm eyeballing.

1064
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,620
It's usually their moms.

1065
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,440
And if you think about it,

1066
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,180
what that means is

1067
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,380
I'm well-adjusted.

1068
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,320
Because I'm,

1069
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,540
I just turned 56.

1070
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,100
Aren't you about

1071
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:55,820
to have a birthday?

1072
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,500
You're going to be like

1073
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,600
89 or something?

1074
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,080
I'm going to be a bird.

1075
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:00,900
And, uh,

1076
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,560
our, our pre-host,

1077
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,540
uh, Charleston,

1078
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,100
just became a bird.

1079
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:04,100


1080
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,120
He became a daddy again.

1081
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,200
Oh, my God.

1082
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:06,860
He's get,

1083
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,360
yet another little child

1084
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,000
that is born

1085
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,100
with the same name

1086
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,060
as all the little,

1087
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,660
all the little boys

1088
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,600
in my family.

1089
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,660
And my family.

1090
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,240
And close to the same birthday.

1091
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,100
Yeah, and her family.

1092
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:17,960
The exact same names

1093
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,360
as my family.

1094
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,340
They all have the name

1095
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,460
with an X in it.

1096
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,180
And Zix, Zix, Zix, Zix.

1097
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,300
I thought that was

1098
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:24,860
a little weird.

1099
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,520
He's stinking.

1100
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,140
Xerxes.

1101
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,460
Xerxes.

1102
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,320
Xavier.

1103
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,880
Zix, Zix, Zix, Zix.

1104
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,560
Yeah, Mixel,

1105
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,800
Mr. Mixel Splix.

1106
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,100
Zix, Zix, Zix, Zix.

1107
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,660
I don't think

1108
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,700
I'm pronouncing that right.

1109
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,400
Only Hal can pronounce

1110
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,340
certain things right.

1111
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,000
Did you know that Cthulhu,

1112
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,100
the famous monster

1113
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,820
of Lovecraft lore,

1114
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,560
is actually in,

1115
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,500
Lovecraft pronounced it

1116
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:49,940
Clulu.

1117
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,060
Clulu?

1118
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,200
Yes, Clulu.

1119
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:52,780
Clulu.

1120
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,460
I was Clulash of that.

1121
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,260
Yeah, it sounds silly.

1122
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,400
It's a silly name

1123
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,640
for a monster, isn't it?

1124
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,420
I, well, what if you

1125
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,300
would like to go back

1126
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,440
to the ancient Greek theater

1127
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:02,900
where you call

1128
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,560
Agamemnon,

1129
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,100
and you're like,

1130
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:04,540
eh, eh, eh?

1131
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,760
Let's go back

1132
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,200
to that ancient Greek theater

1133
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,300
now and look in

1134
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,980
on this strange play

1135
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,220
with half of the characters

1136
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,260
wearing concrete smiley masks

1137
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,580
and the other half

1138
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,880
wearing concrete tragedy masks.

1139
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,240
And look above there.

1140
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,580
You'll notice far above

1141
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,920
the actual proscenium itself,

1142
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,600
there's hundreds and hundreds

1143
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,760
of people with masks

1144
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,660
ready to descend

1145
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,600
as a part of the

1146
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,760
Foctus Dei

1147
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,140
or the Agnus Magnus,

1148
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,280
whatever it's called,

1149
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,220
when the large flying machine

1150
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:33,860
comes down

1151
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:34,420
and saves

1152
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,760
zig-zig-zig-zig-zig-zig-zig-zigs

1153
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,000
from Thermopolis,

1154
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,280
the overheated

1155
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,960
pretender to the throne.

1156
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,720
Although he was doing his best

1157
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,600
and wasn't pretending.

1158
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,560
If you can't come up

1159
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,960
with a good ending,

1160
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,100
just have God appear.

1161
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,720
Isn't that what we're doing

1162
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,740
with our movie thing?

1163
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,180
Only it's not God,

1164
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:56,860
I don't think.

1165
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,040
It's Jehovah One

1166
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:58,780
and the Exus

1167
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,400
and all the alien space monsters

1168
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,020
that pretend to be God

1169
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:03,840
to come back.

1170
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,320
Kooks.

1171
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,720
Well, the Deus Ex Machina

1172
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,460
actually is a God machine

1173
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,800
coming from the land of X

1174
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,200
right into your dining room table

1175
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,420
and ready to evacuate

1176
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,720
your entire neighborhood.

1177
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:15,460
Right.

1178
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,720
It's an old trope

1179
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,280
with a grand history

1180
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,560
going way, way back

1181
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,800
in theater.

1182
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,320
We can even speculate

1183
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,840
that perhaps many of these,

1184
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:27,820
you know,

1185
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,080
the Feast of Three Monkeys

1186
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,520
and the Isle of Women

1187
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,700
and all these other ones

1188
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:32,720
by Sarfra Cleese

1189
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,740
and Agamemnon

1190
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:34,660
and Socrates

1191
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,600
and Socrates

1192
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,880
and all these different

1193
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,340
wonderful playwrights

1194
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,580
or maybe we just mentioned

1195
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,900
philosophers anyway

1196
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,640
that the actual machinery

1197
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,400
they used

1198
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,300
was created by these

1199
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,600
Exus themselves

1200
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,780
and perhaps,

1201
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,000
perhaps Greek mythology

1202
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,740
is a cargo cult

1203
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,340
of not of Bob,

1204
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,040
what should we say,

1205
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,680
of the knowledge,

1206
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,120
the knowledge

1207
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,840
their lack thereof.

1208
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,540
Yeah, sure.

1209
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,920
Whatever you say, Dive.

1210
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,380
Well, do you think that too?

1211
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:03,840
Of course.

1212
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,440
Could be possible.

1213
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,640
What if in the days

1214
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,680
of Idiad and the Olysees

1215
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,580
and them guys like that

1216
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,440
were all hanging around,

1217
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,120
shailing around

1218
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,600
and the Exus appeared to them?

1219
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:13,700
Testostocles

1220
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,540
and his men

1221
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,200
and the Barfonauts

1222
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,200
searching for the

1223
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,880
silver toilet paper

1224
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,240
on the Tree of Knowledge.

1225
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,120
Mm-hmm.

1226
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,860
The toilet paper of the gods,

1227
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,280
softer than a gooseneck.

1228
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,680
And nay, that Hecate

1229
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,640
would come down

1230
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,600
from a mountain

1231
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,740
to spill her ideas

1232
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,820
upon these poor lost men.

1233
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,140
Oh, for they might

1234
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,140
never return

1235
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,740
to their beloved homeland,

1236
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,580
but instead turn,

1237
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,920
turn, turn in the ocean.

1238
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,340
I have a friend

1239
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,420
who was, um,

1240
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,700
turned,

1241
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,580
it was reading

1242
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,920
about Greek mythology

1243
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,220
that turned him

1244
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,560
into an atheist.

1245
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,920
Because, uh,

1246
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:56,760
he was,

1247
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,220
I'm actually talking about

1248
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,860
St. Palmer Vredes,

1249
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,000
just about the most famous

1250
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,580
of all the

1251
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,080
subgenius illustrators.

1252
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,180
When he was about six,

1253
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:07,800
he read about

1254
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,700
these Greek gods and stuff

1255
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,700
with all these monsters.

1256
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,860
And he made the connection.

1257
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,040
He went,

1258
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,180
this, okay,

1259
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,280
this is ridiculous.

1260
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,920
So how,

1261
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,280
what does that tell me

1262
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,780
about Jesus

1263
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,400
walking on water

1264
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:22,960
and coming back

1265
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:23,960
from the dead and all that?

1266
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,080
Now, I'm not saying

1267
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:25,920
that didn't happen.

1268
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,680
The church's subgenius

1269
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,680
has a Jesus.

1270
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,380
I have a Jesus.

1271
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,680
I've got a woman, too.

1272
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,240
Way across town.

1273
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:34,980
Treats me good.

1274
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,940
I don't, I don't,

1275
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,520
I don't need no Jesus

1276
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,560
because I've got Leora Watt.

1277
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,780
I think it's,

1278
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,020
I didn't have any

1279
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,160
Wise Blood quotes

1280
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,100
to play for this show

1281
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:45,780
so I had to do them

1282
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,360
from memory.

1283
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,780
So you remembered

1284
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,740
to bring the blood clots

1285
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,100
tonight?

1286
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,880
No, but I did pick up,

1287
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,440
I bought the book

1288
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,400
Wise Blood

1289
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,980
by Flannery O'Connor

1290
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,540
and read it

1291
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,480
in about two days

1292
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,780
and it is hilarious.

1293
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,840
That is one of the funniest

1294
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,820
books I've ever read

1295
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,460
in my life.

1296
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,200
While I'm doing book reviews,

1297
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,280
I also should mention

1298
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,760
that if you're from Texas,

1299
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,080
Larry McMurtry's Texasville

1300
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,280
is absolutely hilarious.

1301
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,700
I understand they made

1302
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,900
a terrible movie of it.

1303
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,680
But I got to reading,

1304
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,900
I found it at my dad's house

1305
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,720
and I started reading it

1306
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:16,800
going,

1307
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,980
everybody in here

1308
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,100
talks like my family.

1309
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,640
They're the most sarcastic

1310
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,640
bunch of Texans

1311
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,780
you ever saw in your life.

1312
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,060
Dry, but sarcastic.

1313
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:27,640
And I thought,

1314
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,700
this is it, man.

1315
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,480
No wonder Larry McMurtry's

1316
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,980
incredibly rich and famous.

1317
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,260
I never read any of that guy's

1318
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,000
books before.

1319
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,620
Yeah, that's part of it.

1320
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,220
There's a lot of text.

1321
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,160
You know, I'm not really

1322
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,040
a Texan, Dave.

1323
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,100
I wasn't born there.

1324
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,580
You were born in Connecticut?

1325
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,340
I was born in the belly

1326
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:45,940
of the beast

1327
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,300
in Washington, D.C.

1328
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,720
You know, the Antichrist

1329
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,400
will be born

1330
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,520
in the seat of government,

1331
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,180
the prophecy says.

1332
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,880
I was a part of the diaspora.

1333
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,920
You had a mauled foot

1334
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,280
and your aunt and nanny

1335
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,840
took care of it for so long.

1336
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,680
She milked you every day

1337
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,780
and wrapped you up

1338
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:02,760
in gauze bandages

1339
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,180
and gave you a lot of milk.

1340
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,140
They put little fried eggs

1341
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,740
on your head.

1342
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,480
And if it hadn't been for her,

1343
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,800
you wouldn't be there.

1344
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,260
Actually, it's my dad

1345
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:10,120
you're talking about.

1346
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,860
He's the one who had a nanny.

1347
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,860
A nurse, a nursemaid, I think

1348
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:15,680
he even had.

1349
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,080
An actual nursemaid?

1350
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,180
Yeah, he was,

1351
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,320
he grew up in South Carolina

1352
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,200
in the 1920s,

1353
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,900
which was sort of like

1354
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,900
growing up in South Carolina

1355
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,500
in the 1820s.

1356
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,500
Pappy knows his southern cooking,

1357
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,160
that's for sure.

1358
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:32,780
I can,

1359
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,880
I could use a nursemaid right now

1360
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,480
and she doesn't have to be lactating.

1361
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,540
I mean, I would prefer it

1362
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,120
if she wasn't.

1363
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,980
I was thinking about that very thing

1364
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,600
about eight times today.

1365
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,380
And just think of the many

1366
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,060
different strange vegetables

1367
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,160
they make down there

1368
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,600
as a part of the solar cuisine.

1369
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,620
The soul food land?

1370
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,440
Yeah, well,

1371
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,300
Mammy will chop up some collards

1372
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,540
and mix them with her own mother's milk

1373
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,000
so the children grow up strong and brave

1374
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,160
and can fight for the confederate viewer.

1375
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:01,760
My Mammy,

1376
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,660
I actually,

1377
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,140
I was raised calling my mother Mammy

1378
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,100
and my Pappy, Pappy.

1379
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,280
When I say that,

1380
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:09,900
I'm not kidding.

1381
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,920
I used to be embarrassed

1382
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,720
when I was a little kid.

1383
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,600
We'd be in the grocery store

1384
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,980
and I'd want to call out,

1385
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,640
Mammy, I want this toy.

1386
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,160
But I was afraid to say it.

1387
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,760
And I'd go,

1388
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,660
I want this toy.

1389
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,300
And she knew that I was doing it

1390
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,420
and then would humiliate me even more.

1391
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,000
But then that's where I learned

1392
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,380
how to humiliate.

1393
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,380
Yeah, well, you're not,

1394
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,700
you're just not just a nut.

1395
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,040
You're a pecan, I guess,

1396
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:35,960
or something like that.

1397
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,840
Well, you know, now I've got a,

1398
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,560
now my kids called me Dad.

1399
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:42,520
I had them call,

1400
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,860
they called us Mom and Dad.

1401
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,040
My father, Pappy,

1402
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,000
was disgusted with that, by the way.

1403
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,640
That we didn't, that he,

1404
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,520
they called him Pappy,

1405
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,160
but I wasn't going to have him call me Pappy.

1406
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:53,900
He was Pappy.

1407
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,940
I'm D-Doll.

1408
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,880
And Princess We is Weemaw.

1409
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,360
Weemaw.

1410
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,560
Actually, we're whatever

1411
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,260
the grandson pronounces.

1412
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,500
Whatever he ends up calling us,

1413
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,160
that's probably what will be called

1414
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,520
by all subsequent descendants.

1415
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,160
Yes, I'm Yee for Ye Old Man.

1416
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,000
Yee.

1417
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,680
Note Yee Dave yonder.

1418
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,960
He is a lean and hungry man.

1419
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,620
Like Falstaff.

1420
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,120
Oh, no, Falstaff was tubby.

1421
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,900
Yeah, Falstaff was fat and happy.

1422
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,360
Who was the lean and,

1423
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,300
Cassius.

1424
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,120
Wasn't it?

1425
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,340
John Cassius is that guy.

1426
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,240
It's been a long time

1427
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,460
since I read that comic book.

1428
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,880
Yeah, I thought he had a staff

1429
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,020
and he looked yeomanly

1430
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,660
like he was guarding a plow

1431
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:42,700
or something like that

1432
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,100
and he was staring at the stars.

1433
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,180
I've got the,

1434
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,400
we've got a copy of the

1435
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,320
Marlon Brando Julius Caesar.

1436
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,400
You do?

1437
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,280
Yeah, yeah.

1438
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,500
I haven't, haven't looked at it.

1439
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,880
I haven't seen it since high school.

1440
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,560
Wow.

1441
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,980
Friends Roman countrymen,

1442
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,340
lend me your ears.

1443
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,120
And after he was stabbed mortally,

1444
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,680
he went, not my night,

1445
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,740
not my night.

1446
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,040
I ate too much Brutus.

1447
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,220
That's a joke.

1448
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,960
And I thought my jokes were bad.

1449
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,660
I'd like to go bob hunting someday

1450
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:20,040
and strap on AK-47,

1451
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,100
which is my right under the Second Amendment

1452
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,960
of the First Christian Articles of Faith

1453
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,280
and Humorous Dispatch.

1454
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,820
That's right.

1455
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,980
And see if I can see that big head walking around.

1456
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,540
I mean, who needs to wait?

1457
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,360
For the highway to bring forth a bob to shoot

1458
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,240
when the bob is probably hiding in your backyard somewhere.

1459
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,100
That reminds me.

1460
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,460
He might show up at that Dragon Con thing in Atlanta.

1461
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,520
It's a big geek fest.

1462
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,320
It's more geek,

1463
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,800
more comic book and monster fans

1464
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,260
than it is subgeniuses.

1465
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,540
Although obviously there's a certain amount of crossover.

1466
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,620
I, by the way, am a monster fan,

1467
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,640
not so much a comic,

1468
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,340
but a comic book fan.

1469
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:05,120
I make a real distinction between those two groups.

1470
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,880
And I'm not going to go into the reason for it

1471
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,900
because it would sound homophobic

1472
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,600
and I'm not really that way at all.

1473
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,280
But it's a great joke.

1474
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:15,840
Here's okay.

1475
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,800
I'll go ahead and say it.

1476
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:17,940
What's the image?

1477
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,000
We were talking about this earlier.

1478
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,160
What's the standard monster movie image?

1479
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,620
A big monster carrying a cute girl.

1480
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,880
What's the standard comic book image?

1481
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,780
Two guys in tights grappling with each other.

1482
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,660
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

1483
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,260
I'm probably missing out on something.

1484
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,440
No, I think you're pointing right at the right vesicle.

1485
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,640
I think many of our superheroes

1486
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,500
are latent heroines.

1487
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,340
They sure turned me on some of them.

1488
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,360
They said pretty boys.

1489
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,780
That bulge.

1490
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,480
They got such power.

1491
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,680
Who was it that had the bulge?

1492
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,540
The bulge.

1493
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,020
That was the name of the...

1494
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,180
He was a villain that fought the Hulk.

1495
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,480
It was called the bulge.

1496
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,440
He was a short-lived one.

1497
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:00,640
He was a short-lived one.

1498
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,240
A marvel didn't really go far with the bulge.

1499
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,660
His short hammock was bigger than Batman's.

1500
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:06,820
And was...

1501
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,380
Hence the...

1502
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,220
The snorkel.

1503
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,180
But I...

1504
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,380
No, I remember it was Daredevil or some...

1505
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:17,120
One of the X-Men wore one of those real tight body suits.

1506
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,800
And it had a large package visible to all the...

1507
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,900
Soon-to-be homosexualized young men.

1508
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,600
It was just...

1509
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,200
It was horrible.

1510
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,480
That's why I'm glad they had the comics code.

1511
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:28,220
Hey, man.

1512
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,580
I've still got that first issue.

1513
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:30,640
I'm sure you do.

1514
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,660
It's not in very good shape because, well, you know...

1515
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,820
Pretty dog-eared by now.

1516
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,760
I'm kind of page-stuck, you might say.

1517
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,780
I'm having to click my tongue much too much on this show.

1518
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,200
Well, just don't put your heels together and will your guys to another state.

1519
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:50,400
Hey, speaking of which, it's time for this show to end.

1520
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,440
What do we have here to get out with?

1521
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,620
What music were you playing?

1522
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,280
Was that you?

1523
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,300
Was that some of your music, that last one?

1524
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,260
Was some of your cut-ups?

1525
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,320
That was pretty nice.

1526
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,460
Well, last three of them.

1527
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:08,680
No, everything I've had on the background was Gadgeto, which is probably at Gadgeto.com.

1528
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,140
G-A-D-G-E-T-T-O.

1529
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:19,400
The other stuff I was playing is all from the devotional, basically.

1530
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:26,400
Friends, in my religious fanatical excitement, I forgot to credit the collages that were at the beginning of the show.

1531
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:30,180
A lot of that was by The Large.

1532
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:36,000
The very first thing was Gadgeto, with a little G. Gordon Gordon in it.

1533
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:42,620
We heard some Lemur, especially in the titles, and Norrell Preff collagery.

1534
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:47,840
And there was a clip of the Puzzling Evidence show with Dr. Philo Drummond there.

1535
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:53,400
Friends, this is the Hour of Slack from subgenius.com.

1536
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:53,900
Praise Bob.
