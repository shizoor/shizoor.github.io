1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
Let's see if we can...

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,880
Well, friends, I hate to admit, once again,

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,100
we broke the show on the way to the station.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,300
We don't know whether it's really going to work or not.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,600
Starting these things up is so difficult.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,080
Look at this. The headphones don't even work.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,540
But that's okay.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,420
God, nothing works in here.

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,520
We'll flip some switches, turn some buttons.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,260
You're just going to come across one while you're talking

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,460
from one side of the plate, but when you start to use them, both sides.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,960
Oh, how interesting.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,580
Oh, so we've got mono for the voice tonight, huh?

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,580
Right.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,580
Okay, everyone.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,720
As Dr. Willman said last week, put your recorders on stun.

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,200
Don't put them on disintegrate yet and hang in there.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,860
If I push this button and we hear sound,

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,900
then we've got success.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,320
Success.

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,920
To be a good man.

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,580
And to turn on the machine, this is Radio Yerevan.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,300
My name is Hans Ivanovich Hagen, and this is the news.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,980
Thank you.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,840
I'm Bob Smith, radio operator.

26
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,880
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,400
I have some nuggets!

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
No trouble.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,580
Just get set and get going.

30
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,080
Amen.

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,840
Recording.

32
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,240
Everything's going fine.

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,200
No trouble.

34
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,620
Bob?

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,240
Bob?

36
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,160
Bob?

37
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,060
Bob?

38
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:56,380


39
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,700
The message is now part.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,720
I've been registered in your subconscious mind.

41
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,660
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

42
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,160
What about slack?

43
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,480
That's your key phrase.

44
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,920
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

45
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,620
Wake up, puppet boy!

46
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,500
Welcome to the subgenius radio.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,600
We'll be right back.

48
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:30,600


49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,160
Hour of Slack.

50
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,180
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

51
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,460
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge

52
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,500
of the Church of the Subgenius.

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,920
With Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

54
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,480
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

55
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,980
Before the subgenius, you will be able to access the radio station.

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980


57
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:07,060
The sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of slack and saint of sales.

58
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,880
On planet Earth.

59
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,000
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,220
This is it.

61
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,320
The only faith that promises action, thrills, success in sex and business.

62
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,180
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

63
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,500
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,040
Bob is a way of life to millions, yet half of them don't even know it.

65
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:44,160
He's the one true living slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through

66
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,760
the locked doorway to financial heaven.

67
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,820
He is the one real shortcut to slack.

68
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,160
Now, the subgenius radio.

69
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,160


70
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,160


71
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,160


72
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,160


73
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,160


74
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,160


75
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,160


76
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,120
See another dimension on your TV.

77
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,760
Uh, yes, and praise Bob, my friend.

78
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,400
Uh, please listen and stay tuned here for the instructions for your new subgenius radio

79
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,340
ministry hour of slack radio show.

80
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:15,940
Praise Bob.

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,120
The luck plane has brought you into possession of a subgenius hour of slack show.

82
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,980
This could be the greatest thing that has ever happened to you.

83
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,060
An unsurpassable, beautific experience.

84
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,140
And it's a great thing to do.

85
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,140


86
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,140


87
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,140


88
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,380
And to be honest, it's not a great experience.

89
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,720
Or it could be your worst mistake.

90
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,760
A one-way ticket into an insane universe from which there is no escape.

91
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,180
Improper listening techniques can lead to dependency, severe mental and physical addiction,

92
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,560
seizures, brain fits, chromosomal damage, priapic conditions, overnight glandular mutations,

93
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,780
and even the gousing or erasure of the soul.

94
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,000
You can also be arrested for possession of this show in certain ways.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,120
And if you're interested in this show, please visit the website at www.thebizpodcast.com.

96
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,440
It's free.

97
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:57,440


98
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,500
I'm off.

99
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:57,500


100
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:57,500


101
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:57,500


102
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:57,500


103
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:57,500


104
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:57,500


105
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,600
However, if you follow these instructions and trust completely in Bob.

106
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,420
However, you are in for hours days weeks and probably centuries of listening pleasure

107
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,440
as this song and this show never end.

108
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:10,840
Oh, you end it.

109
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,640
Oh, oh.

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,300
Oh, oh.

111
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:12,300


112
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,180
Use anisen mandatory through stereo headphones who will enter the fourth dimension,

113
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,540
4th to find the power, will transfigure you in fact if you don't plan to listen in headphones

114
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,800
at least for the first time.

115
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,880
Just keep going.

116
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,080
Throw this show away now.

117
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,320
Sound quality will be enhanced several thousand percent from Mac 8.5 to Mac 6.9.0.

118
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:46,280
After all, this is no compact disc, friends, but a primitive earth show made under conditions of extreme conspiracy financial correctness in an era of persecution.

119
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,820
Ah, yes, listen to that.

120
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,640
Yes, that's beautiful.

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,640
I wonder if there's anything about the friends.

122
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,300
Pastor Nick, it hasn't shown up tonight, but tonight we've got the Hell Swami satellite weavers here.

123
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:14,480
And if we can just avoid having any mid-air collisions with any of those pirate shows in California, we'll be just fine.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,620
Dr.

125
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,360
Hell Swami.

126
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,140
You see, if this sound effect over here works, we'll pop you on.

127
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,600
Ew.

128
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,100
Yes.

129
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,740
Okay, good.

130
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,060
Before we're receiving that other show.

131
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,080
You really asked us to use their names.

132
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,620
That's right.

133
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,000
We're all confused here, okay?

134
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,280
We can't remember.

135
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,400
Yeah, who we're supposed to be is what the joke is.

136
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,240
Which page we're on.

137
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,520
I hate that president.

138
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,600
But if we were in California, it'd be exciting.

139
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,600
No, we're here in Dallas.

140
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,000
That's pretty normal.

141
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,400
Yeah.

142
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,220
Here in Northwest.

143
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:54,780
I woke up yesterday morning, and the world was in a lot of trouble.

144
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,980
And I opened up the refrigerator, and there were starving children inside.

145
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,560
And I walked down the street, and there was no education.

146
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:09,560
And the people of different ethnic backgrounds were back at each other's throats after 20 years of progress.

147
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,680
I hate that president.

148
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,660
Yeah.

149
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,900
That's down near Belt Springs, right?

150
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,980
That's right.

151
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,360
I got in a hurry the other day.

152
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,120
I hate that, Ivan.

153
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm that demon.

154
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,100
Yeah, we can play quotes for that.

155
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,320
Yeah, that's all.

156
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,480
Well, we might have a tape full of quotes here.

157
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,340
Maybe a good 10 minutes of stuff that's non-radio payable.

158
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,380
We're going to have to remove the bad words from the tape before we can use it in California.

159
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,740
See what I mean?

160
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Well, I think I'll just go over to White Rock Lake and do some fishing.

161
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,860
Oh, yeah.

162
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,900
You should see the urge.

163
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,020
They're beautiful.

164
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,120
The most absolute beautiful yard I saw down there.

165
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,440
Statue of Bob.

166
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,660
As if it were.

167
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,240
300,000 cubic yards of grass dumped at Bob's feet.

168
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,880
Serving Greater Arlington, Fort Worth.

169
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,080
Is this not KNON?

170
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,060
Are we not KNON?

171
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,340
In Texas.

172
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,920
Dallas?

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,960
Are we not radio?

174
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,620
EU radio.

175
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,200
We are not.

176
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,000
We are going to be.

177
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,820
And I'm going through these channels.

178
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,280
And I get on this channel and I hear Bob.

179
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,520
Yep, that's a Bob channel.

180
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,660
You're tuned into the etheric airwaves, my friend.

181
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,600
Bob said about all that.

182
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,240
Bob said, if you have to ask, you're never going to know.

183
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,760
Bob is the lesson which cannot be taught.

184
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,920
Just open yourself up to Bob, friend.

185
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,980
Just feel the Bob energy.

186
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,540
Open up to the isness of the business.

187
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,220
The very beingness of Bob.

188
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,420
Can you put your hands on the radio tonight?

189
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,160
Can you lean in?

190
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,700
Can you sit in there and breathe on that radio?

191
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,920
Can you suck that power off of Bob?

192
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,660
It's coming through.

193
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,160
It's coming through the air.

194
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,560
You need to put your hands on the radio, directly on the speakers.

195
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,200
Are you doing that, friend?

196
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,800
Are you on?

197
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,020
Yeah, my hands on the speaker.

198
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,380
Okay.

199
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,860
Okay, now, now, when you have an electrical socket nearby, urinate into it.

200
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,740
Can you do that?

201
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,300
Urinate into my ass?

202
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,660
No, don't do that.

203
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,540
That would hurt you.

204
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,740
Do you have a t-shirt on or do you have a regular shirt on?

205
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,440
I don't have no shirt on.

206
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,260
All right.

207
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,780
I'm on the pipe.

208
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,080
Then just pull the radio to your chest.

209
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,080
Yeah.

210
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,140
The pipe is necessary.

211
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,360
Got it?

212
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,720
You got it there?

213
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,580
Clench tight?

214
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,240
Yeah.

215
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:16,960
Okay.

216
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,540
Now, um, hold that radio and take your hands and snake them around it and, and grab your

217
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:23,860
waist.

218
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,940
Reach into your pocket and pull out your wallet.

219
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,060
Send us a dollar.

220
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,080
Love that radio.

221
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,080
You can make love with that radio.

222
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,700
And here we go.

223
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,280
Switcheroo.

224
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,280
Hello.

225
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,100
The love of Bob can kill more than us.

226
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,320
KBFT, you're on the air.

227
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,520
Let's have it.

228
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,380
Are you with us?

229
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,840
You are with us.

230
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,040
Are you against us?

231
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,060
Are you against us?

232
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,200
Come on.

233
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,760
Wake up.

234
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,080
Pull the wall over your own eyes.

235
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,420
You're being ripped off every day.

236
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,440
Learn to enjoy it.

237
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,700
Mr. Dobbs, uh, your pizza's ready.

238
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,600
Thank you.

239
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,620
Bob?

240
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,080
All right.

241
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,580
Hello?

242
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,060
Hello?

243
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,100
You are on the air.

244
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,680
I know two people named Bob and I'm just confused which one is the real one.

245
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,700
There's many false gods.

246
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,460
It's the right one.

247
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
The one on the right.

248
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,500
There is only one right Bob.

249
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,700
Because they're both named Bob and I'm really just confused which one is the real one.

250
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,700


251
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,700


252
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,700


253
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,700


254
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,700


255
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,700


256
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,700


257
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,700


258
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:14,700


259
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,680
I'm just, I don't know what to, I'm just confused.

260
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,740
This raises an important question.

261
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,100
There is, there is a good Bob and there is a bad Bob.

262
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,600
A bad Bob.

263
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,360
All right, friend.

264
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,180
We'll help you.

265
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,440
We can help you, friend.

266
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:30,980
We can minister.

267
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,460
Can I minister to you, son?

268
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,700
No, Bob.

269
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,540
I'm not ministering.

270
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,320
Can I minister to you?

271
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,440
What, who?

272
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,540
Now, can you tell which of these guys wears a black hat and which one wears a white hat?

273
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,680
That's the clue.

274
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,200
The good one is Bob.

275
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,400
They don't wear hats.

276
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,220
But they have the same kind of haircuts.

277
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,960
Do they both look like Bob?

278
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,040
They're both named Bob.

279
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,740
Do they both smoke a pipe?

280
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,280
At least that's what they tell me.

281
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,220
Which one smokes a pipe?

282
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,640
This guy's all frothed up.

283
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,040
Thanks.

284
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,900
Bob will kill you to save you.

285
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,560
Don't just eat a hamburger.

286
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,420
Eat the hell out of it.

287
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,600
She is a harlot and a fornicator.

288
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,380
My kingdom is on the edge.

289
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:14,380


290
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,420
The only thing I want is to see you.

291
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,520
Not that I want it.

292
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,040
Sorry about what you're doing.

293
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,820
A good deal is in the wallet of the beholder.

294
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,420
I know you this.

295
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,020
Knowledge at birth, taken of the moon, not of the sun.

296
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,760
Extremism is the defense.

297
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,640
In money is great, but no bias.

298
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,220
Through my discipline, the mind is a confines.

299
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,960
A harlot will bribe thee with the rent.

300
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,660
I'd rather be lying than to be any day.

301
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,580
My giving of any service is unclean and shall be due to perdition.

302
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,380
The divine king will be king of all.

303
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,380


304
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,380


305
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,380


306
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,380


307
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,380


308
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,380


309
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,380


310
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,380


311
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,380


312
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,060
He who doesn't cross the wise known grounds, darkness will fall.

313
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,400
The dust on.

314
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,560
Rain.

315
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,480
If you act stupid, don't treat it as evil.

316
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,580
The word of the spirit shall come indeed, and with every breath that comes.

317
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,860
And in due course, the demons from below the hollow earth shall come forth.

318
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,580
And my devils, under him the voices, shall reach the sky, and you shall see.

319
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:14,060
Friends, we're here once again, attending the new Christmas show, and one chance will

320
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,360
make you happy.

321
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,360


322
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,360


323
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,360


324
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,360


325
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,360


326
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,360


327
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,360


328
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,360


329
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,800
I guess if we turn this light on all the way.

330
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,100
Yes, friends, it's Christmas time again, and this is another hour of Black Christmas show.

331
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,360
And we're going to service also not just the Santa Clausians out there,

332
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,680
but also those of others.

333
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,920
You have to have a different experience to worship things and toys and new goods around Christmas time.

334
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,300
There are eight steps of darkness.

335
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,240
This is, I think, friends, the only show here,

336
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,920
Bob and the Dillon Tones, lovely version of White Christmas.

337
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,520
Friends, this is Bob and his band, the Dillon Tones.

338
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,880
I think you should enjoy it.

339
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,680
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

340
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,460
Just like the ones I used to know

341
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:27,420
Where the treetops glisten and children listen

342
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,640
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

343
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,720
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

344
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,280
With every Christmas coming to an end

345
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,280


346
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,260
I write

347
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,180
May your days be merry and bright

348
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:51,460
And may all your Christmases be white

349
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,720
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

350
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,820
With every Christmas coming to an end

351
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,260
May your days be merry and bright

352
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,040
And may all your Christmases

353
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,380
All your Christmases

354
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,960
All your Christmases

355
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,860
All your Christmases

356
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:37,860


357
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,060
May all

358
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,280
All your Christmases

359
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,340
All your Christmases

360
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,240
Be white

361
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,780
Be white

362
00:14:51,780 --> 00:15:10,260
Be white

363
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,200
Today'sanas

364
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,660
Tuesdays and Friday throughout

365
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,620
Monday with the

366
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,980
the Hiroshima bomb. But what has this got to do with... Patience, young man. Patience.

367
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:54,260
And now, screen number three. Another rocket. And four. And five. And six. There you are.

368
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,660
The whole picture. Five multiple head rockets. All tied to the controls in the war room of

369
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:05,760
the Pentagon and targeted on our enemies. But the only person authorized to push the

370
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,560
button is... Yes? The President of the United States. Precisely. But we're not at war and

371
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,560
he's not about to push that button. Quite right. Not that button and not knowingly.

372
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,520
But there are buttons and buttons. I still don't... Like the button that will turn on

373
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:29,400
the light on that beautiful Christmas tree. On the White House lawn? Right. You mean to

374
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,780
say that button is tied into the rocket launch system you just showed me? Now you're getting

375
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,020
it.

376
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,740
It is.

377
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,580
It's tied in by a remote control circuit I secretly installed. And when the President

378
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:48,660
pushes the button that lights the tree... Good Lord. For a brief moment, the lights

379
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:55,340
will go off. And then a bomb concealed in one of the tree ornaments will detonate, destroying

380
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:03,280
everyone in the immediate area. Including the President? Especially the President. And

381
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,720
simultaneously, five beautiful...

382
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,540
The rockets will soar like avenging angels through the night sky. And when they reach

383
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,180
their targets, they will light up the whole world.

384
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,840
Now the President is safe at least. But I was too late to prevent the rockets from being

385
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,680
fired. Got to stop them somehow.

386
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:35,900
Okay.

387
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,940
Catch these guys.

388
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,060
Oh God.

389
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,120
He's always scared.

390
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,120


391
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,660
Okay.

392
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,440
He's sorry, 선생님.

393
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,720
Add a button to the starship.

394
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:13,760
The great creator became my savior.

395
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Now all God's fullness dwelleth in him.

396
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:35,420
Down from his glory, ever living story.

397
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,220
Friends, try to imagine.

398
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,060
My God and Savior.

399
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:48,380
Somewhere in the snowy north, the Santee Bob trudging mindlessly through the Himalayan snows,

400
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,020
driven by strange forces to complete.

401
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,940
His nameless errand.

402
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,840
And he may show up at your house, my friend.

403
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,100
If you've been a bad subgenius or a halfway subgenius.

404
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,500
Or if we keep getting tangled up in these other shows and have strange microphone situations.

405
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Oh, hell swami?

406
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:16,540
I was wondering, I didn't mean to cut off your, uh, your, uh, hymnal there.

407
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,240
I didn't mean to interfere with your freedom of religion or anything.

408
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,100
Well, I know Dr. Stanky.

409
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,620
I know that you would, if your heart's due to something as big as that.

410
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,840
No, I wonder what happens if I push this, though.

411
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,260
It's, it's supposed to close the gateway that'll keep those other shows out.

412
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,760
Tasty it was, too.

413
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,420
Down near the Biblical Arts Center.

414
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,280
Just down there where all, where all those nice people live.

415
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:46,720
Well, if you came over to our neighborhood, Ivan, you'd find, you'd find out in the Batmobile that we got a lot of scary girls.

416
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,880
There, we got rid of them, folks.

417
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,880
We got our show back to ourselves.

418
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,160
And I just mean, hi, girls.

419
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,860
This is...

420
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,420
Don't forget, if you drive around listening to this show...

421
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,860
This is the false, the falsest of all possible...

422
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,340
Speed limit on most of our streets is 30 miles an hour.

423
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:58,740
Hi, girls. Hi, girls.

424
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,120
I hate that demon.

425
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,520
That hoot.

426
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,620
Uh, uh, oh.

427
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,640
Uh-oh, look, it broke the show again.

428
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,240
Drinking Budweiser.

429
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,240
And watching Bob R. T.V.

430
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,180
These guys are doing some sort of a...

431
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,540
I hate that non-radio.

432
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,140
This is about as non-radio as it can be.

433
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,080
Yes, it is.

434
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:30,040
Because it's hard to be you or us even when here at Psych, I'm still a little me, even though I'm mostly you right now.

435
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:30,620
That's right.

436
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,840
And where we're really waking up is people are waking up here, getting ready for work.

437
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,720
That's right.

438
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,100
Thinking they're supposed to be somewhere, but where we're being listened to, everybody's getting ready to go to sleep.

439
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,620
And they thought they'd give that hour of slack that was listed in the false folio.

440
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,900
Maybe I'll give that thing a listen and see what this Ivan Stang and Buck and New Kid have to say.

441
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,720
Well, y'all ready to rock it away?

442
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,040
Correctively adapted to the under...

443
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,740
Come on down, come on down to Dave's Request.

444
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,240
I wish we could. We're gonna be rocked.

445
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,560
Stuck in the world of old show.

446
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,580
The new president.

447
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,400
Never new stuff. Just show after show after show.

448
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,820
Laird on, Latherd on.

449
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,600
We realize here in Texas...

450
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,720
Completely covered up.

451
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,080
People are sensitive about shooting the president in the head with a crack gun.

452
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,480
You just turn it off because there are too many voices and you can't understand any of them anyway.

453
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,240
I realize it.

454
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:17,720
Yeah, I know.

455
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,040
I have to keep trying here.

456
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,780
Happens quite often down here in Seattle.

457
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,160
We talked about...

458
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,980
Ah.

459
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,760
Ha ha ha ha ha.

460
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,960
We got rid of those fools.

461
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,300
That was a good one.

462
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,820
Okay.

463
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,420
Well, I'll tell you. This is really a difficult microphone situation, friends.

464
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,280
They change it every...

465
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,960
The conspiracy gets into here.

466
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
These little conspiracy bugs.

467
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,680
Gremlin-type creatures.

468
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,680
They come out at Christmas, I've noticed, in mythology.

469
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
But, um...

470
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,020
Friends, we've got to do a PSA here.

471
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,980
And this is...

472
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,980
This is very important that you, uh, listen closely to the worst microphone.

473
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,300
So, you knew the big banks were ripping off low-income folks.

474
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,380
Want to help us find out how much?

475
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,380
ACORN, the National Community Organization of Low and Moderate Income Neighborhoods,

476
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,640
is much like the one we're broadcasting from, the ones we live in.

477
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,020
Uh, ACORN is doing a study of home loans to rich and poor neighborhoods by the year.

478
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,960
And it's done by Dallas Banks.

479
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Um, I assume that means there's, uh, some difference in the type of loans that are given to rich neighborhoods and poor neighborhoods by Dallas Banks.

480
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,640
We're looking for five volunteers for either day or evening help with the library and phone research on this campaign.

481
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,560
We will try and...

482
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:41,980
Please call ACORN at, uh, 823-4580.

483
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,140
I'm gonna give that number again.

484
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,860
You can...

485
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,140
You...

486
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,380
Friends, this is...

487
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,140
This is true.

488
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,600
They...

489
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,200
They, uh...

490
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,800
I think ACORN probably has a good reason for looking into this.

491
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,880
And you can help out.

492
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,780
I know they need help.

493
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,580
And that number again is 823-4580.

494
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,840
And, uh...

495
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,100
Our brothers in our fight against the conspiracy.

496
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,940
Yes, well, uh...

497
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:08,360
At least we've done our duty there to the, uh, station, uh, above and beyond.

498
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,760
Let's see.

499
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,100
What else in the way of...

500
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,020
Of Christmas?

501
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:14,960
Yeah.

502
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,440
Uh...

503
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,640
I'll tell you what, friends.

504
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,120
There's been, uh, all sorts of serious problems in the Church of the Subgenius.

505
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:29,740
Many of which include trying to find the right equipment in the radio station, uh, uh, with

506
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:36,660
so many confusing issues at hand, including whether or not the...

507
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:36,960
The...

508
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:44,380
The Santa did actually die at the hands of the cavalry, uh, that day on the Mount of Skulls.

509
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,620
Or whether...

510
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,120
Uh...

511
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,860
The over-modulation can be helped at some time in the far future.

512
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,700
So, uh...

513
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,600
Friends, this is a song by...

514
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,700
Oh, I see.

515
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,180
I see.

516
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,700
I can control the hiss that comes in and out of here.

517
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:00,980
Um...

518
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,360
Learned how to control the hiss.

519
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,180
We can now control the hiss.

520
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:13,580
That means that their minds can likewise be controlled by subliminal messages planted in the hiss that goes out with this show.

521
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,020
Ha ha ha ha.

522
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,900
But, uh, as I said earlier, we've got to minister not just to the...

523
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,640
Those who are celebrating Christmas, but those who are also celebrating the pagan solstices.

524
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,500
This is a, um...

525
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,300
A tune by Magic Mosen and his Royal Rockers.

526
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,940
I doubt if you've ever heard this one.

527
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,660
It's a pretty obscure one.

528
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,840
Um...

529
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:44,100
But this is Blind Sam, uh, great old Blind Sam and Reverend, uh, G. Andrew Maness of the Church of the Subgenius.

530
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,780
I believe this was a live cocktail lounge song for those who believe.

531
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,120
For those who try to believe.

532
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,840
For those who must believe or die in the case of this church.

533
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,300
Say, do we have any druids in the audience?

534
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,960
Well, hi, yeah.

535
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,520
This one's for you.

536
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:23,420
Have yourselves a groovy little solstice.

537
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,360
Mithras won his fight.

538
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:41,960
From now on, the days are longer than the nights.

539
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:57,580
Yeah, have yourselves a groovy little solstice.

540
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,980
Nosh out on druid food.

541
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,140
Yeah, make little pigs of yourselves.

542
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,940
Then we'll all dance day and night.

543
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:11,940


544
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:11,940


545
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,960
And we'll all be naked in a festive groove.

546
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:37,860
If you are a dazzling urbanite, a smug suburbanite, hey, that's cool.

547
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:55,040
Ooh, you don't have to lead a boring country life to groove on natural life as a rule.

548
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:06,000
Someday soon, we'll all dance nude together.

549
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,960
If utility rates allow.

550
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,760
You know, those funky Boston Edison guys, you know.

551
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:25,640
Until then, we'll don our ritual robes and bow.

552
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,980
To have ourselves a groovy little solstice.

553
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:42,400
Have yourselves a groovy little solstice now.

554
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,820
Take it away, guys.

555
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,640
So, are you all having a good time this evening, huh?

556
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,820
Are they putting booze in the drinks tonight, huh?

557
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,940
Well, remember, folks, the more you drink, the better we sound.

558
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,340
Yeah.

559
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,280
The Royal Rockers, ladies and gentlemen.

560
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:28,980
Aren't they wonderful?

561
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
All right, thank you.

562
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,500
I've had one of the greatest moments of my life.

563
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:33,620
I'm not sure if I can say it enough.

564
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:33,620


565
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:33,620


566
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:33,620


567
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:33,620


568
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,420
I'll do it again.

569
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,400
I'm going to ask Rudy Ray Moore to introduce the world's greatest.

570
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:45,480
The world heavyweight champion of humor, Rudy Ray Moore.

571
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,540
Right on.

572
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,600
Right on.

573
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,660
Right on.

574
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,440
Right on.

575
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,640
I am yours truly.

576
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,620
Rudy Ray Moore.

577
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,380
bold and still beautiful.

578
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,960
Baby, I want to talk to you for this Christmas

579
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,080
because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.

580
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,260
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmastime.

581
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,200
I can remember me and my brother

582
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,060
when I was about six years old.

583
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,120
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece

584
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,300
and the health department made us take them down.

585
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,220
Baby, me and my brother wore tennis shoes so long.

586
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,140
Now, let me tell you how long we wore them, baby.

587
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,580
We wore tennis shoes Indian summer, Easter, Thanksgiving,

588
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,560
Halloween day, New Year's, and Christmas.

589
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,460
Baby, we wore our tennis shoes so long

590
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,180
till we wore them out up to the name on the ankle.

591
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,260
When we got ready to lay down,

592
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,280
we didn't take our shoes off until we were about six feet tall.

593
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,280


594
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:57,800
We didn't take them off.

595
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,060
All we had to do was fold them back, baby.

596
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,800
I remember my father well, you know.

597
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,820
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.

598
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,260
He used to have... You know what caused it, Ben?

599
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,760
He used to put a stocking cap on his head

600
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,520
and put a knot right in front of it.

601
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,220
Daddy would wake up with that thumping headache.

602
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,260
And he said, the kids would say, my head's hurting so bad.

603
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,500
I said, I don't know what Santa's gonna get y'all for Christmas,

604
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,680
but he's gonna bring you something.

605
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,860
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside

606
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,120
and shot up in the air and come back inside

607
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,260
and told us the biggest lie I ever heard.

608
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,460
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

609
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,780
On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me

610
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,680
a tab of yellow sunshine LSD.

611
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,160
On the second day of Christmas,

612
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:56,900
my true love gave to me

613
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,500
two hundred reds and a tab of yellow sunshine LSD.

614
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,500
On the third day of Christmas,

615
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,580
my true love gave to me

616
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,660
three pounds of grass,

617
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,380
two hundred reds,

618
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,780
and a tab of yellow sunshine LSD.

619
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,200
On the fourth day of Christmas,

620
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,780
my true love gave to me

621
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,800
four grams of hash,

622
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,320
three pounds of grass,

623
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,980
two hundred reds,

624
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,520
And a tab of yellow sunshine LSD

625
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,900
On the fifth day of Christmas

626
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,560
My true love gave to me

627
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,620
Five Valiums

628
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,580
Four grams of hash

629
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,080
Three pounds of grass

630
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,600
Two hundred vets

631
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,340
And a tab of yellow sunshine LSD

632
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,780
On the sixth day of Christmas

633
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,440
My true love gave to me

634
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,480
Six joints of smoke

635
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,080
And five Valiums

636
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,020
Four grams of hash

637
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,520
Three pounds of grass

638
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,040
Two hundred vets

639
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,860
And a tab of yellow sunshine LSD

640
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,280
On the seventh day of Christmas

641
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,900
My true love gave to me

642
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,420
Five Valiums

643
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:24,680
Four grams of hash

644
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,760
Three pounds of hash

645
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,420
Two hundred vets

646
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:28,420


647
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,440
And a tab of yellow sunshine.

648
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,560
LSD

649
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:29,640
For Junior מה

650
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,360
This deutlichbefore

651
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,000
an upright eb니까

652
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,580
E good

653
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:42,780
for an upright longer

654
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:42,780


655
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,180
for the assisted Univers

656
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,220
We did get one of these lovely soundtrack albums,

657
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,700
the first movie soundtrack ever recorded in our house in France.

658
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,660
It was a beautiful holiday.

659
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,160
We had this one of Charlie Manson's boys,

660
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,700
and he was very sad.

Okay, well...

676
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,820
You can call us here at...

677
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,460
Not K-N-O-N, non-right...

678
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,040
Bombastic. Bombastic.

679
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,840
Brimming lymphiness of it all.

680
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,420
Here in our area code, which is, of course, actually 214.

681
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,360
Hey, somebody's twisted your toe, buddy.

682
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,940
So call 823-7490.

683
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,540
Oh, by the way, something very serious for all of you listeners.

684
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,580
No matter what state you're in right now, we'd like you all to support this.

685
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:19,160
Save the Cat Caver Fund at Box 5444 North Little Rock, Arkansas.

686
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,100
What is it, 7521?

687
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,020
If you have any fraud, we're very serious about that.

688
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:33,060
Send anything you carry, money, record albums, books, clothes, anything you can get together,

689
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:41,300
please send it to Box 5444 North Little Rock, 72119 in the 501 area code.

690
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,320
Save the Cat Caver Fund is an actuality that you won't hear on the air.

691
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,300
But it's true.

692
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:57,440
The Cat Caver area was under attack during the last show, the last subgenius show on Sunday, last weekend in Seattle.

693
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:07,180
During that show, the actual timing of that show, there was a gorilla attack in North Little Rock on the main plant there.

694
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,240
And all of the products were squeezed out.

695
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,080
Everything was kind of slumped as far as I could tell.

696
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,600
Everything in the kitchen, everything kind of laid down.

697
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,940
I wanted to sleep forever and ever.

698
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,600
And so anything...

699
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:27,820
Anything you can send in that direction to that box number, that's Box 5444 North Little Rock, 72119, would be appreciated.

700
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,640
Good humor.

701
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,920
That's up there right under KPFA, you know, helping this station to stay inflated.

702
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,860
That's right.

703
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,260
And above the original box number in Dallas.

704
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:43,000
Well, most people probably are already tied up in their own political or sexual group movement

705
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,880
and don't have the sympathy to send this poor family the punk rock albums.

706
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,900
Or the Al Boni.

707
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,280
Or the horrible tapes of doctors for Bob performances.

708
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,660
And now he'll get four neat postcards.

709
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,060
Yeah, like somebody will send the KK refund.

710
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah.

711
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,200
Subscription to the mall.

712
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,040
It's enough.

713
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,680
It's enough.

714
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,380
See, I can...

715
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,760
We finally figured out a way to get this California show out of our Texas airwaves, friends.

716
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,500
There's no excuse for this sort of thing.

717
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,640
I mean, particularly in a situation where I don't even know where I'm going.

718
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,440
I'm going to stare at...

719
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,780
Listen to these sound effects.

720
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,100
I mean, this is all we've got.

721
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:29,640
Those California guys have vast armies of engineers that read out of Thesaurus' in the background constantly

722
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,840
and play all sorts of background effects.

723
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:39,000
But all we've got is the sound of the cassettes falling in and out of the machines,

724
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:45,440
the echoes of the microphones, the squeakings of the chairs in the little stations.

725
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,860
And friends, what those guys...

726
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,360
What those guys were talking about is an actual subgenius pledge drive.

727
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:59,800
The Pope of Little Rock, Pope Sternok KK, discoverer of the Janer device,

728
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:05,800
and one of the founders of Doctors for Bob, this great individual,

729
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,340
was preaching with us on the West Coast.

730
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:16,680
And he got home from this incredibly grueling marathon, atomic preach-a-thon,

731
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,740
to find his house burned.

732
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,620
Burned to the ground.

733
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,320
Yes, yes.

734
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:27,480
The first feces-megagog-fist-temple lodge of the Church of the Subgenius in Arkansas.

735
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,520
Burned by the conspiracy.

736
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,980
The home of Doctors for Bob, friends.

737
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,060
Friends, gladiolus weren't even wilted.

738
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:35,680
Uh-huh.

739
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,440
Not only that, but while their house was burning down,

740
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,000
on the other side of town, somebody broke into their car,

741
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,820
smashed all five windows, and stole all their laundry.

742
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,240
So, Doctors for Bob.

743
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:52,140
The creators of this song, shot a limited key out of me,

744
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,300
which we won't stop playing.

745
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,780
Why, why do you all be mad?

746
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,320
You say you're not mad at all your friends.

747
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,520
You're just part of the song.

748
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,900
I think not.

749
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,340
I'm not mad.

750
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,500
I'm very ordinary.

751
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,680
Of course you think you are.

752
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,240
But here's a particular happiness.

753
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,160
My particular happiness includes machine gunning a .127.

754
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,600
Here's the trouble.

755
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,240
If that's bad, go ahead, lock me up.

756
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:15,380
Four.

757
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,220
Four.

758
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,540
Four.

759
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,240


760
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,280
Just because I enjoy washing my face in the blood of the infirm?

761
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,500
Is there any reason to lock me up?

762
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,200
No.

763
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:25,660
No.

764
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,420
I think not.

765
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,220
I just, I've even got a piece of paper that says my mind's still okay.

766
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,020
Hell, I bet that guy got it from a company agent

767
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,500
who wouldn't give me a job.

768
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,740
Just because I've been locked up one time,

769
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,420
that he ain't got those papers that his mind's still okay.

770
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,280
Hell, I tried to tell them it was not me.

771
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,080
It was me.

772
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:47,220


773
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:47,220


774
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,920
Green energy demons, but they merely laughed at me.

775
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,200
Look out, those green energy demons are ruling the planet.

776
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,020
They're not messing quite so hard now, are they?

777
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,660
Without what's killing them, that is a time they

778
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,560
shock the living gee out of me.

779
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,820
I tried to explain it was not me.

780
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,480
It was the brain, the brain of our old former,

781
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,080
which is controlling my mind via laser beams,

782
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,100
via the FBI, via the CIA, via the Communist Party,

783
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,240
via satellite.

784
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,240
It was the demon, the demon that forced me to do the deed.

785
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,760
But that wasn't me.

786
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,440
Doc, doc, doc.

787
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,280
Who's doing this?

788
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,340
It's just, I'm not insane.

789
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,020
I'm more sane than Son of Stan and Charles Manson put together.

790
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,360
How many people must I kill to prove I'm not insane?

791
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,860
But that wasn't ever as bad as that time they...

792
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,000
Shock.

793
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,260
The living gee out of me.

794
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Right in my face, they shocked the living gee out of me.

795
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,820
My jacks, I don't enjoy this.

796
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,920
They shocked the living gee out of me.

797
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,640
It's that time they ran out of my face today.

798
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,860
They took a look at me, oh yeah, I was fine.

799
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,940
That time they cut me in half with barbed wire.

800
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,200
They didn't even have to peel the band-aid off my...

801
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,740
My hands and they did the horrible, oh yeah, I was fine.

802
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,900
That time they scared me alive.

803
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,660
They called me dirty name.

804
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,300
Woo-ha, that was a big old cocaine party.

805
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:26,280
That one time, they converted my entire body into a wall of membrane.

806
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,140
Whose only purpose was to feel pain.

807
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,000
You know, that time they converted my entire body into a wall of membrane.

808
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,820
Attached to a human brain.

809
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,280
Whose only purpose was to feel pain.

810
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,240
And then applied the flame.

811
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,300
Oh yeah, that was fun.

812
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,720
That time they converted every cell in my body.

813
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:44,960
Into the flame.

814
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:52,840
to the same hermit Duck stompin, male testicles enlarges each cell through the size of a sun.

815
00:43:53,100 --> 00:44:04,900
And then inserted huge, sun sized frills, into each of these sun sized male testicle cells.

816
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,100
Woo.

817
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:10,200
La-la-la la-la la-la, la-la-la la-la la-la.

818
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,100
La-la-la la-la la-la-la la-la, la-la-la la-la la-la la-la.

819
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,020
When you're driving 16 hours, think of Bob.

820
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,140
Think of Bob.

821
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,300
When you use your mutant powers, think of Bob.

822
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,300
Think of Bob.

823
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:29,900
When your blood is low in sugar, when you're picking up a girl, when you shoot him with a luga, think of Bob.

824
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:30,880
Think of Bob.

825
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,180
When you're outside exercising, think of Bob.

826
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,060
Think of Bob.

827
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,540
When you're using sex devices, think of Bob.

828
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:39,500
Think of Bob.

829
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,740
When you're walking through the woods, when you make out with the girls.

830
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,040
When you're beat up to the hood, think of Bob.

831
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,240
Think of Bob.

832
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,680
Big, bad, big, Bob.

833
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,320
Big, bad, Bob.

834
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,440
Big, bad, Bob.

835
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,560
Big, bad, Bob.

836
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,540
Oh, man.

837
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, man.

838
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,700
Oh, man.

839
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

840
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:15,380
Oh,

841
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:15,780
Oh.

842
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:16,580
Oh,

843
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,480
Big,

844
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,400
Oh,

845
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:31,800
Oh,

846
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:31,800


847
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:31,800


848
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:31,800


849
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:31,800


850
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,020
Oh,

851
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,060
Not, not, not, not B, not B

852
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,220
Not, not, not B, not B

853
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,360
Not B, not B

854
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,060
Not, not, not, not B, not B

855
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,020
You see a flock of birds, think a bob

856
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,080
Think a bob

857
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,340
When you just run out of words, think a bob

858
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,400
Think a bob

859
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,700
When a ring goes from your collar

860
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,640
When you hear a given ha

861
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,960
When your eye ticks for one dollar

862
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,960
Think a bob

863
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,160
Think a bob

864
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,160
When you write to be subgenius, think a bob

865
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,100
Think about

866
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,580
B.O. Box 14306

867
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,420
Think about

868
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,020
When you cast your mojo headers

869
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,140
When you ride through Dallas, Texas

870
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,200
With your heart

871
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:24,840
Think about

872
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,080
Think about

873
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,200
One dollar

874
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,160
One dollar

875
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,440
One dollar

876
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,780
One dollar

877
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,980
One dollar

878
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:39,040
One dollar

879
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,020
One dollar

880
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,040
One dollar

881
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,920
One dollar

882
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,120
One dollar

883
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:43,560
One dollar

884
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,320
One dollar

885
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,400
One dollar

886
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,480
One dollar

887
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:47,820
One dollar

888
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,020
One dollar

889
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:49,180
One dollar

890
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,780
One dollar

891
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,380
One dollar

892
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:52,940
One dollar

893
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,160
One dollar

894
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,160
One dollar

895
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,160


896
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,160


897
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,900
One dollar

898
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:13,760
B-O-E

899
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,440
B-O-E

900
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,520
B-O-E

901
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,180
We'll take it too

902
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,520
That big bad bob

903
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,500
Heaven in the sky

904
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,420
B-O-E

905
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,380
That's right

906
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,000
Just send us your

907
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,300
One dollar

908
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,700
Send it, it's tax

909
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,940
I guess you could say

910
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,300
It's tax free

911
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,380
You get a lot more for your money

912
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,860
Heck, one dollar

913
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,940
You get bobbed

914
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,000
Think about

915
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,320
Yeah, think about

916
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,640
Well, I'll think about

917
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,020
Yeah, he makes us

918
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,820
Think about

919
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,800
Everybody's thinking about

920
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,640
Everybody wants to think about

921
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,640
Yeah, I'll think about

922
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,360
Yeah, I'll think about

923
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,460
Fuck about

924
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,240
Yeah, I'll think about

925
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,740
If I think about

926
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,560
Everybody's thinking about

927
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,020
Friends, that was Dr. Onan's

928
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,960
Wotan Band

929
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,360
As Dr. Onan's been cranking that stuff out

930
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,740
And, uh

931
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,680
I think we're okay, finally

932
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,460
We'll

933
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,660
Here they come, stay down, here they come

934
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,060
Scary little ugly things

935
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,520
That's a heliopter

936
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,180
I don't understand why

937
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,320
Our own church sends these things in

938
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,020
To try to kill us on our own show

939
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,400
Well, it's part of the dogma

940
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,880
Your own show

941
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,380
Will try to kill thee

942
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,060
There's little babies back there

943
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,320
It's little holographic babies

944
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,420
I'm going down

945
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,440
And I can't kiss

946
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,720
If I can't whoop it again

947
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,180
If I can't talk, off-mode

948
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,340
Goodbye, sir

949
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,720
Uh, yes, friends

950
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,040
They'll vote

951
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,480
You know, there's been

952
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,860
A certain amount of, uh, suspicion

953
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,960
Let me, let me first start off

954
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,760
For those who don't know what they're listening to

955
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,660
This is the subgenius radio ministry

956
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,440
Hour of Slack

957
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,860
This is a church

958
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:32,660
And, uh, our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs

959
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,020
Was assassinated, brutally assassinated

960
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,560
Uh, almost two years ago now

961
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,700
At that time

962
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,280
Uh

963
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:41,600
There were

964
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,560
The church fell into

965
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,600
Disuse for a long time

966
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,900
And we seem to live less

967
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,940
Our living in the heart of Slack

968
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,040
Laying dead

969
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,040
Uh, you know

970
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,740
Preserved in loose side

971
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,060
Of the Interfirst building

972
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,520
But there's been telling lately

973
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,100
Of various types of

974
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,700
Resurrections

975
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,640
To schools of thought

976
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,940
In the church of the subgenius

977
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,140
Those who believe that Bob is not dead

978
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,840
You've released the foulness that dwells

979
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,160
In all men's minds

980
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,440
You have infected millions

981
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,080
With your twisted fantasies

982
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,440
Now if you don't pay his pardon

983
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,060
So

984
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,480
That's nice of you

985
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,340
Anyway, it's been

986
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:26,680
The theory has been advanced that Halley's Comet

987
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,720
Uh, could

988
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,040
Actually contain

989
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,680
A sort of a Bob resurrection

990
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,280
Power in it

991
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,340
Uh, that this year

992
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,400
As well as a, as a

993
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,760
As a Bob resurrection, Halley's Comet

994
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,640
Could be the end of the world

995
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,880
So we could both get our guru back

996
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,600
And at the same time

997
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,240
Uh, see the

998
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,980
Hideous society of the Pink Boys

999
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,900
And the Normals which we so hate

1000
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,020
Finally destroyed

1001
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,920
And so

1002
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,480
We travel ahead

1003
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,640
To that wondrous day

1004
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,760
Where archaeologists will unlock

1005
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,760
This show from an old box

1006
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,100
To find out

1007
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,820
Since before recorded data

1008
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,680
It had swung

1009
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,760
Through the universe

1010
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,300
In an elliptical orbit so large

1011
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,360
That its very existence

1012
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,460
Remained a secret of time

1013
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,540
And space

1014
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,120
But now

1015
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,840
In the last few years of the 20th century

1016
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,680
The visitor

1017
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,180
Was returning

1018
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,080
The citizens of Earth

1019
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,620
Would get an extra Christmas present this year

1020
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,580
As their planet orbited through the tail of the comet

1021
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:49,960
Scientists predicted a light show of stellar proportions

1022
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,340
Something not seen on Earth

1023
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,600
For 65 million years

1024
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,760
Indeed

1025
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,120
Not since the time that the dinosaurs disappeared

1026
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,160
Virgin Mary

1027
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,160


1028
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,160


1029
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,160


1030
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
Actually overnight

1031
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:09,940
There were a few who saw this as more than just a coincidence

1032
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,580
But most didn't

1033
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,000
In 1910

1034
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,380
Halley's comet returned

1035
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,200
And everybody thought they were going to die then

1036
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,540
Who's that?

1037
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,620
Look!

1038
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,140
It's a comet

1039
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,140


1040
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,140


1041
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,140


1042
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:56,140
The Black Yukon

1043
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,100
Realization

1044
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:00,140
In 1993

1045
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:13,800
could help me with all Bob. All Bob. It's been a long time Bob. Since you've been back. Have you

1046
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:24,280
got my answers? Did you bring my slack? I got a few extra questions and a special wish. I got a

1047
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:36,180
whole lot of problems you could help me with all Bob. Hello Bob. It's been a long time Bob. Nice to

1048
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:48,280
see you back. Thanks for your help. Thanks for your slack. And now I've got no problems that I

1049
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:53,280
can't solve. I'm a Bob Dobb doctor and I'm having a ball. Hello Bob.

1050
00:53:54,460 --> 00:54:07,740
Nice to see you back. Oh hello Bob. Thanks for the slack. It's been a long time Bob. It's been a

1051
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:15,380
long time Bob. It's been a long time Bob. It's been a long time Bob.

1052
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:33,760
That was Reverend Jim Erickson of Glass Madness. Ah yes that old him. And now for the news.

1053
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:47,480
Hurricane Bob. World Briefs. National Weather Service Miami, Florida. Sunday December 22nd.

1054
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,180
Renovating this government in use only. Discussion subject Hurricane Bob.

1055
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:53,840
Norad.

1056
00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:01,060
Recon Air Force search plane spotted first Dobbs manifestation at sea 60 miles east of Brunswick, Georgia.

1057
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:08,180
Surface winds up to 170 knots reported emptying into a whirlpool for which radiant huge spinning spokes of light.

1058
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:14,520
High anti-grav readings near the black hole at center. Now tracking Bob at the same speed.

1059
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:20,300
The highlight of Bob reaching the coast. We just upgraded the storm Bob to hurricane.

1060
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,160
Interest rates are still low.

1061
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,140
Actual situation.

1062
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,240
Label top secret.

1063
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,220

1064
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:29,740
Washington.

1065
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,200
Location unknown.

1066
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,540
The ice clone activity.

1067
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,160
The wind is.

1068
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,800
The wind is.

1069
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:41,740
The wind is.

1070
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,220
The wind is.

1071
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:42,220


1072
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,440
The wind is.

1073
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:43,440


1074
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:43,840
The wind is.

1075
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,080
The wind is.

1076
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,900
The wind is.

1077
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,520
Eastern South Carolina,

1078
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,320
and the government's prepared to use small nuclear-tipped

1079
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,560
organs of gravity flux

1080
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,780
and black hole punches to clear stuff

1081
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,040
Bob physically materializes

1082
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,300
in the 21st century.

1083
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,000

1088

night simultaneously with slack center

00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,960
Government and disaster officials

1092
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,060
are not being notified

1093
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,140
unless it is ascertained that Bob

1094
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,400
will continue to grow in force.

1095
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,820
State agitators

1096
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,440
are starting to criticize the state

1097
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,660
of Marshall Log,

1098
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,300
declared in subgenius free zones

1099
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,800
along the East Coast

1100
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,400
for people to do a black-blaster reaction.

1101
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,560
More news

1102
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,040
and pictures are coming.

1103
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,400
Music

1104
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,740
Your local station in conjunction

1105
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,620
with the relevant federal authorities

1106
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,020
would broadcast the following

1107
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,260
pre-recorded announcement.

1108
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,980
Dumb-dumb, deedle-dumb-dumb

1109
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,740
deedle-dumb-dumb

1110
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,420
deedle-dumb-dumb

1111
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,680
There was a turtle

1112
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,420
by the name of Bert

1113
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,300
and Bert the turtle

1114
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,940
was very alert

1115
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,220
When danger threatened him

1116
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,560
he never got hurt

1117
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,400
He knew just what to do

1118
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,040
He ducked

1119
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,020
and covered

1120
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,620
ducked

1121
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,480
and covered

1122
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,620
He did what we all must learn

1123
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,560
to do

1124
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,220
You and you

1125
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,040
and you

1126
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,400
ducked

1127
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,360
and covered

1128
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,800
Be sure and remember

1129
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,760
what Bert the turtle just did friends

1130
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,320
because every one of us

1131
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,160
must remember to do the same thing

1132
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,200
Remember what to do friends

1133
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,760
Now tell me right out loud

1134
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,740
What are you supposed to do

1135
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,800
when you see the flash?

1136
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,060
Duck and cover

1137
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,900
Duck and cover

1138
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:15,400
Duck and cover

1139
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,960
Duck and cover

1140
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:18,960


1141
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:20,780
Duck and cover

1142
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:22,980
Duck and cover

1143
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:23,480
Duck and cover

1144
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:24,820
Duck and cover

1145
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,060
Duck and cover

1146
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,720
Now I've got a cousin

1147
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,780
on my daddy's side

1148
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,800
He was a single boy

1149
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,940
and doing fine

1150
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,280
Until he met a waiter

1151
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,180
who took him for a ride

1152
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:41,740
He's a hubby now

1153
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,320
besides the Paul of nine

1154
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,780
All of the monkeys

1155
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:48,860
ain't in the zoo

1156
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:53,100
There's some running loose around me and you

1157
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:57,340
Just watch when you're in a crowd and you'll agree too

1158
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:01,840
That all of the monkeys ain't in the zoo

1159
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,060
Oh, the women on the budget always tickle me

1160
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,480
They're as tight as ticks and worry all the time

1161
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,840
And then a traveling salesman sweeps them off their feet

1162
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,220
They give a dollar for the brush that's worth a dime

1163
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:24,540
All of the monkeys ain't in the zoo

1164
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:28,860
There's some running loose around me and you

1165
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:33,200
Just watch when you're in a crowd and you'll agree too

1166
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,660
That all of the monkeys ain't in the zoo

1167
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:41,480
guitar solo

1168
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,820
Now there's some on the budget

1169
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,280
Awful smart men that run the USA

1170
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,080
They hit the list of some of our great men

1171
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,500
And then there's some others who had a big shot brother

1172
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,780
Elected they were just put in

1173
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:06,340
All of the monkeys ain't in the zoo

1174
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:10,620
There's some telling us what we can do

1175
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:15,020
Just watch when you're in a crowd and you'll agree too

1176
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:15,820
guitar solo

1177
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:15,820


1178
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:15,820


1179
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,520
That all of the monkeys ain't in the zoo

1180
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:24,980
I used to tell my girl when she'd get married on her mind

1181
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,320
That she'd never make a monkey out of me

1182
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,860
But I was just a country kid and I didn't know the game

1183
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,220
And I guess you know what happened to me

1184
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:42,860
All of the monkeys ain't in the zoo

1185
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,820
There's some running loose around me and you'll agree too

1186
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:51,560
Just watch when you're in a crowd and you'll agree too

1187
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:56,080
That all of the monkeys ain't in the zoo

1188
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,560
guitar solo

1189
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,140
guitar solo

1190
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,600
guitar solo

1191
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,880
guitar solo

1192
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,740
guitar solo

1193
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:10,140
guitar solo

1194
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,200
guitar solo

1195
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:51,140
guitar solo

1196
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:51,140


1197
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:51,140


1198
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:51,140


1199
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:51,140


1200
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:55,940
Friends, is someone else getting your illicit sex?

1201
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,200
Come on now, think about it.

1202
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:05,400
Other people are getting all those goodies that you ought to have.

1203
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,260
Why?

1204
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:11,100
Why does that other guy have that Porsche?

1205
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,980
Cocaine? Better sex? All that dough?

1206
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:15,260
What?

1207
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:18,020
with you that's right with him.

1208
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:25,700
You know, it might just be that he's latched on to that one thing that you thought was

1209
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,760
too stupid to make any difference.

1210
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:35,560
Maybe he joined the church of the subgenius while you didn't because it was bad for your

1211
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,060
image.

1212
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:44,080
Maybe he plugged into the vast, bottomless slack that is the birthright of the subgenius

1213
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:49,600
while you continued life as an inconsequential schlep.

1214
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:59,180
Perhaps he sent for information to PO Box 14306, Dallas, Texas, 75214 for the inspirational

1215
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:06,500
words of the great mega-prophet J.R. Bob Dobbs, thereby totally changing his life forever,

1216
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:13,340
turning him into a macro-evolved overman while you spent that dollar.

1217
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:14,900
Video games.

1218
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:23,460
It's even possible that he joined the clergy of that arcane sect, the church of the subgenius,

1219
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:29,980
giving him seemingly godlike powers and confidence for less than the price of a tank of gas.

1220
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:37,680
You, on the other hand, spent five times that much last year on the Kraft macaroni and cheese

1221
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,040
business.

1222
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:39,700
Didn't you?

1223
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:41,720
No.

1224
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,880
I don't want to say that...

1225
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:49,940
Because of this seemingly minor oversight on your part that your life is total garbage.

1226
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:50,880
No, no.

1227
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,320
I'm sure your mother likes you just fine.

1228
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:04,420
But at the same time, did you ever wonder, is someone else getting your illicit sex?

1229
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,360
Look, friend, there's still time, but not much.

1230
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,840
Write for information from the church of the subgenius before it's too late.

1231
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,440
Horrible things are going to happen to this planet soon, and we can tell you what to watch out for.

1232
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:23,360
The world ends tomorrow, and you may die, friends.

1233
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:32,380
So write for information from the church of the subgenius, PO Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75215.

1234
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:36,360
And we'll be reading that number again.
