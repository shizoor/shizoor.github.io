1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Bud Light presents the subgenius power of swag.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:14,560
Today we salute you, real American heroes.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,320
Don't stay in too long, or everyone will shout.

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,820
Finish quickly and come back.

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,840
Get my headphones.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,840
My hat ears here.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,640
Where is everybody?

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,340
Everybody's wandering around in the staff area.

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,360
Hey, somebody broke the arm off this chair.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,440
Hello, test.

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,920
Check.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,240
Check!

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,700
Check!

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,920
Okay, now if I hunker down low, then I can put the headphones on.

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,260
But I still can't fit my hat on.

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:04,540
Now that's somewhat disconcerting for those of you that are aficionados of late night hat wearing, such as I,

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,620
that you can't quite accomplish the task.

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,300
It reminds me of that time we stood out on the balcony and we debated the concept,

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,900
the absolute unfairness of the concept of fairness.

20
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,480
Have you ever thought about that?

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:23,860
No.

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,160
No.

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,900
A basic idea of fairness is unfair to someone.

24
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,180
It's unfair to those who want more.

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,220
It's unfair to those whose appetites are insatiable.

26
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,900
It's unfair to those who are basically unfair in their nature.

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,800
Those with whom the concept of fairness is essentially unfair.

28
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,920
Well, is it fair?

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,560
that we are forced to do the show all by ourselves.

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,100
No, that's unfair.

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,220
And yet we are dominating the unfair airwaves of the show

32
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,840
with our fair speech at this time.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,440
But it's tricky, as my kook emailing friend Ahmed said,

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,900
God is the only one who is lucky and can kill anything he wants.

35
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,340
Strange way to look at it, but it's true.

36
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,360
Nothing is fair.

37
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,840
In fact, things are so unfair.

38
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,280
When you're driving home from work, I bet things seem more unfair than normal.

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,940
Princess Wee here got home from work in her usual foul mood

40
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,080
that the conspiracy puts you into.

41
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,820
And she said something so good I made her write it down.

42
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,680
Nothing is fair.

43
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,780
The only thing that is fair is knowing ahead of time that nothing is fair.

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,120
Nothing at all will ever be fair.

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,820
And no fairness exists in the world.

46
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,360
Don't look for a fair and just time or place.

47
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,500
The time and place of true peace and justice exists only in one tiny little place.

48
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,820
A place in your own mind where no one else can go.

49
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,340
Well, that's pretty depressing, isn't it?

50
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,980
Coming from her, it was actually sort of hilarious.

51
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,700
Oh, friends.

52
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,860
The Beachland Ballroom.

53
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,900
Where we had that incredible...

54
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,980
Incredible DeVival.

55
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,160
On May 22nd, back when...

56
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,020
Before that, we heard Dr. Philo Drummond and Don Joyce

57
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,600
taking over the Puzzling Evidence show

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,460
when Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence weren't around.

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,240
But, friends, this whole show

60
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:49,060
is going to feature some great material from the Beachland Ballroom DeVival,

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,180
such as this background music by the Amino Acids.

62
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,900
But to get us in the mood,

63
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,080
for the DeVival footage,

64
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,840
I want to play this little cut-up by Sko Auslander.

65
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,560
If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.

66
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
Just so long as I'm the dictator.

67
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,380
Good evening.

68
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,980
Before I take your questions,

69
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,560
let me speak with the American people about the situation in Iraq.

70
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,800
You know, let me talk about Al-Qaeda.

71
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,320
Just for a second.

72
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,880
We welcome them, and today they stand with us as fools.

73
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:24,880


74
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,800
And so much respect to these forces

75
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,840
it still sowie is so prosperous in Iraq.

76
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,100
They can determine the organization at night,

77
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,560
but we pitching on this morning,

78
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:35,700
we have THIS arena today.

79
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:36,860
It's 47 million people,

80
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,120
and only 35,000 are a fan of this,

81
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,140
whether, particularly Russia,

82
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,140


83
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,960
made byuzin the age of armies.

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:38,960


85
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:38,960


86
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,020
we'll leave you to see that in this moment.

87
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,520
Thank you very much.

88
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:41,540
Thanks everyone.

89
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:41,680


90
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Secretary of State Powell, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, many key commanders of al-Qaeda.

91
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,120
They've increased their military capabilities in the span of a decade.

92
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,920
I want to thank them for their friendship.

93
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,280
I want to thank them for their leadership.

94
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,100
I look forward to working with them to encourage international terrorism.

95
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,800
The United States supports these efforts.

96
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,140
However, America's purpose is more than to follow a process.

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,120
It is to replace democratic governments with dictators to achieve a result.

98
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:23,680
Friends, that thing was, that bush cut up was by Sko Auslanger from Redneck Wonderland.

99
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,840
And now, back to the revival at the Beachland Ballroom with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

100
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:55,180
The President's on the phone, talking to his mom and dad.

101
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,100
The President's on the phone, talking to his mom and dad.

102
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,120
The President's on TV, talking to you and me.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,660
He's talking about you and me.

104
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,080
liberty

105
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,300
But you and I

106
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,020
agree

107
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,780
Meanwhile outside the world

108
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,420
is tumbling down

109
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,020
in a pile of shit

110
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,500
There's war and revolution

111
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,460
suffering destitution

112
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,200
The government seems proud

113
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,060
of it

114
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,400
But the president's on the phone

115
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,660
talking to

116
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,000
his mom and dad

117
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,420
saying should I

118
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,800
turn over evidence

119
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,640
or be a good old

120
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,180
Stonewall lad

121
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,720
The president's with

122
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,880
Karl Rove

123
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,940
talking to his White House

124
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,560
aides

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,020
The president's program control

126
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,140
making sure

127
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,560
they don't see the hole

128
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,560
Meanwhile

129
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,080
outside the world is tumbling

130
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,840
down in a pile

131
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,760
of shit

132
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,260
There's war and revolution

133
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,280
pain and destitution

134
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,640
And the government seems proud of it

135
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,840
The president's in your mind

136
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,260
Telling you what's in your mind

137
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,200
what is right

138
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,900
The president's in your head

139
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,020
But you'd rather

140
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,400
him be dead

141
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,980
The president's

142
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,740
in TV

143
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,000
Talking about liberty

144
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,020
The president's on TV

145
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,120
But you and I aren't free

146
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,900
Meanwhile outside the world

147
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,640
is tumbling down

148
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,600
in a pile of shit

149
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,940
There's war and revolution

150
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,100
Pain and destitution

151
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,460
The government seems proud of it

152
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,980
The president's on the White House lawn

153
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,640
Talking about opportunity

154
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,300
He's talking about opportunity

155
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,100
As if there's enough

156
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,620
of us

157
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,580
to make it through

158
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,100
And you'd rather

159
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,100


160
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,120
But you'd rather

161
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,120


162
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,240
The president's in your head

163
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,240


164
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,240


165
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,240


166
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,240


167
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,880
The president's on TV

168
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,860
Telling us we're all free

169
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,680
The president's in your mind

170
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,260
When nobody can see

171
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,140
Meanwhile outside the world

172
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,880
is tumbling down

173
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,580
in a pile of shit

174
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,160
There's war and revolution

175
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,240
Pain and destitution

176
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,220
The government seems proud

177
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:08,600
of it

178
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,400
The president's in your head

179
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,420
Talking about liberty

180
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,640
Talking about liberty

181
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,640
The president's in your mind

182
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,340
The president's in your head

183
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,940
The president's in your head

184
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,420
Frank Carter is Thinkin'...

185
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:38,600
Say it again

186
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:38,600


187
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,940
I'm so sorry about that.

188
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,820
I'm so sorry.

189
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,780
Why the fuck should I be worried about paying my taxes,

190
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,040
paying my traffic tickets,

191
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,980
paying off my credit cards,

192
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,880
when the world ends tomorrow?

193
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,500
Which is actually in about an hour.

194
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,120
So, friends, some of you need to clear off the sins off of your conscience.

195
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,320
The world ends in an hour,

196
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,520
or if tomorrow is when the world ends,

197
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,120
and you may have some baggage that you're carrying with you.

198
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,000
You may be, you know, humping it under a load of guilt,

199
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,560
or not enough guilt.

200
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,980
And boys and girls, have we got something to take care of that guilt?

201
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,140
Yes!

202
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:38,940
Baby!

203
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,140
One of the few creatures on the planet

204
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,880
who can call themselves an official employee of the subgenius Foundation Incorporated,

205
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,240
the one who could dictate whether your minister's card arrived

206
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,540
this week or next week or a month from now,

207
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,200
Reverend Nikki Deathchick!

208
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,200
Get up!

209
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,760
Stand up, you goddamn rude peons!

210
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,780
A lady or something just entered the room!

211
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,460
Whoo!

212
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:09,660


213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,700
All right!

214
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,800
You know, I've been getting the feeling that today, you know,

215
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,920
there's been a lot of false conspiracy guilt going around these days,

216
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,820
more so than usual any time, any other time in my life.

217
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,460
And I, myself, you know, I have been ashamed to be from this country.

218
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,780
When I, you know, when I saw those pictures of those prisoners being abused in Iraq,

219
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,900
I, you know, I got ashamed.

220
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,320
I was ashamed of being from America.

221
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,300
But then I got to thinking about it,

222
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,100
and then I realized that there is two Americas.

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,800
There is the pink America,

224
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,160
and there is the subgenius America.

225
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,320
And, you know, those guys,

226
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,560
the people that were responsible for that stuff,

227
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,740
they were no different than the schoolyard bullies

228
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,880
that you and me may have encountered,

229
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,260
in grade school or high school or what have you.

230
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,400
Yeah, fuck the pinks, man.

231
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,140
And, you know,

232
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,760
those guys, you know, they may have said that they were following orders,

233
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:30,380
but I can think of another time when people just said they were just following orders.

234
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,480
And I do believe that there were other people involved in that whole situation,

235
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,260
but, uh,

236
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,760
you know, much like depleted uranium,

237
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,060
false conspiracy guilt lingers for a long, long time.

238
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,860
And I have come here tonight to perform for you

239
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,560
something that will rid you of your false conspiracy guilt.

240
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,960
Because you know, you know that there are things that you do that give you false conspiracy guilt,

241
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,220
things that make you feel good and give you slack,

242
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:05,960
that give you

243
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,780
false conspiracy guilt.

244
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,940
And I have come for you tonight to perform the subgenius spanking ritual.

245
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,380
And I need people to come up here

246
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,340
and let me relieve them of their guilt demons.

247
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,540
I need, I can feel that there are people here tonight who need a healing.

248
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,260
I can feel it.

249
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,040
I can feel somebody here tonight needs a healing.

250
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,860
I need somebody to come up here.

251
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,420
I don't frankly know how you're going to get up on the stage.

252
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,220
Oh, there you go.

253
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,340
All right, you.

254
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,580
Okay.

255
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,420
Now mind you,

256
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,320
I could do some healing on you after a little while.

257
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,280
You think so?

258
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,080
You think so?

259
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,600
Okay.

260
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,000
I have sinned.

261
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,780
Oh, what have you, what do you, do you have done tonight?

262
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,820
Do you have conspiracy guilty?

263
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,280
I have confessed.

264
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,120
What have you done?

265
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:01,240
I read a local newspaper and actually, I believed what it said.

266
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,220
Oh,

267
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,360
I don't know what came over me.

268
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,520
I think some conspiracy guilty.

269
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,180
You have a lot of guilt demons are happening.

270
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,620
Your ass motherfucker.

271
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,380
Let's go.

272
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,160
Okay.

273
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,040
Oh, okay.

274
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,640
Okay.

275
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,260
You've been healed tonight.

276
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,060
I'm healed.

277
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,960
Yes, you are healed.

278
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,140
All right.

279
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,300
Is there anybody else tonight?

280
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,080
You need to healing.

281
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,240
Oh, Reverend buggy.

282
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,000
You come up here.

283
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,080
You have many conspiracy guilty humans and having your ass.

284
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,860
What have you done?

285
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,280
Nasty, crazy.

286
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,500
I'm not.

287
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


288
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


289
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


290
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


291
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


292
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


293
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


294
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


295
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


296
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


297
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


298
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,900
Dirty, stinky, sweaty, premarital, Yeti sex.

299
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Can you go into detail?

300
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,640
Later.

301
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:44,900
Yeah.

302
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,740
All right.

303
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,540
All right.

304
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,780
Put your hands upon the table.

305
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,060
Are you ready to be healed?

306
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,080
The conspiracy guilty humans and have a giraffe.

307
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,180
Praise Bob.

308
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,220
Oh, here we go.

309
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,860
I can't hit your wallet there.

310
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,500
Have you known about the conspiracy guilty?

311
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,500


312
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,500


313
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,500


314
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,500


315
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,500


316
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,500


317
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,500


318
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,500


319
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,500


320
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,500


321
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,500


322
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:07,580
I don't know.

323
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,680
Did you notice that the wallet prohibits me from administering the healing?

324
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,960
I don't know.

325
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,040
You have been healed.

326
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,260
If you're conspiracy guilty, you must go forth and sin.

327
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,700
Praise Bob.

328
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,620
Oh, yes.

329
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,920
Yeah.

330
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,160
Yeah.

331
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,240
A little noise.

332
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,100
All right.

333
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,420
Yeah.

334
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,540
Ready for some noise.

335
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,020
All right.

336
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,020


337
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:31,900
All right.

338
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:31,900


339
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:31,900


340
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:31,900


341
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:31,900


342
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:31,900


343
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:31,900


344
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,480
All right.

345
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,140
All right.

346
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,780
All right.

347
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:33,780


348
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:33,780


349
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,500
All right.

350
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,020
All right.

351
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,020


352
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,420
Just did it.

353
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:38,420


354
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:38,420


355
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,440
Hello, Cleveland.

356
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,380
I am man.

357
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,020
I approve this message.

358
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,480
Man has no need for laws, values, or any bullets.

359
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,480


360
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,480


361
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,480


362
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,300
Folk laws, principles, mores or boundaries

363
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
He needs beer

364
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,280
Keep your schools, courts, libraries, churches

365
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,680
And penal institutions

366
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,880
Bring me beer

367
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,440
Take your bible, your law book

368
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,100
Your code of conduct and your constitution

369
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,580
Bring me beer

370
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,180
The soul of man has been fed in ingestibles

371
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah, the soul could make use

372
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,620
Of beer

373
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,620
Beer for men

374
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,440
Beer for men

375
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,080
Take your jobs, your rights, your rights

376
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,660
Judges, juries, lawyers, preachers and politicians

377
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,320
Yeah

378
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,160
I want beer

379
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,800
No idol, sacrament, prayer or ritual

380
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,860
That's how verb and quaest divine

381
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,820
That's a mug of beer

382
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,380
Keep your opinion, ideals, your censor, your justice

383
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,720
Don't we don't control

384
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,080
Don't we don't control

385
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:48,000
The soul of man has been fed of digestibles Yeah, this all could make use of beer

386
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:58,960
Beer for men Beer for men

387
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:10,780
Beer for men Beer for men

388
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,300
Beer for men

389
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:40,040
Beer for men Beer for men

390
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,400
Beer for men

391
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:56,560
Face it, they're gone. The exes came, they took the dolphins, they took the Jader device,

392
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,940
we blew up the head, we don't even know what we're doing.

393
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,820
We don't even have the launching head anymore.

394
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,480
The exes came, the exes went, we're still here, and guess what comes next?

395
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,780
The Y-ists.

396
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,940
The Yakatizma.

397
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,340
And you know what? Who's gonna protect you from the Y-ists?

398
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,560
The conspiracy?

399
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,900
Do you think the conspiracy can protect you from giant flesh-eating machines

400
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,120
that grind things down to a nano-molecular level?

401
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,200
No!

402
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:44,200
The conspiracy is not gonna do shit for you when the Y-ists come.

403
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,780
And you know, the thing is, is there are Yakatizma scouts on this planet right now.

404
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,960
This planet is generating so much hellish torment.

405
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,180
So much bitterness, so much slacklessness,

406
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:09,340
that it is drawing them like Kool-Aid draws yellow jackets.

407
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:20,340
Their battle flotillas are even now moving in our direction.

408
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,480
And who's gonna protect you from the Y-ists?

409
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,680
The conspiracy?

410
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,180
The conspiracy is scared shitless.

411
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,960
They're a one-trick pony.

412
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,120
It's their actions that are bringing the Y-ists here.

413
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,780
Billions of people living in misery.

414
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,500
There are more wars going on right now than ever before.

415
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,860
I mean simultaneously.

416
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,580
There have been plenty of wars before.

417
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,680
But more wars, simultaneous wars.

418
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,860
But they're all part of the same war.

419
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,860
The conspiracy is hoping, if they step up their agenda,

420
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,320
they can finish their diabolical plan.

421
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,900
They can wrap things up and then...

422
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,620
Well, they don't know. That's the thing.

423
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,400
They aren't ready for the Y-ists.

424
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,840
But they're so stuck.

425
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,460
They're a one-trick pony.

426
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,540
They have one trick.

427
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,480
And let me tell you what that trick is tonight.

428
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,380
That trick, it is one trick.

429
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,300
They separate you from your slack.

430
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,520
And then they sell you

431
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,140
false slack.

432
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,440
Now, I didn't say they take your slack away.

433
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,260
Because truly, they cannot take your slack away.

434
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,940
But they can take you away from your slack.

435
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,380
And they can sell false slack to you.

436
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,480
What's the first thing?

437
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,980
And I'm going to just use America as an example.

438
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,240
But other people do this too.

439
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,660
What's the first thing that happens after we bomb

440
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,100
some third world nation into oblivion?

441
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,360
We drop food.

442
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,960
There's bombs.

443
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:57,460
Boom!

444
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,560
There's food.

445
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,080
Hi!

446
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,820
Sometimes we drop them at the same time.

447
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,300
Afghanistan.

448
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,580
You never know if you're coming upon a package

449
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,400
that will save your life

450
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,000
or an unexploded piece of ordinance

451
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,380
that will end it.

452
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,140
And that, that is the conspiracy.

453
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,540
That is the conspiracy strategy.

454
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,720
To the T.

455
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,120
And this is the thing.

456
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,640
This is the thing.

457
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,660
It's, you know, you have land maybe.

458
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,420
You have holdings.

459
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,040
You have profits.

460
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,720
You know, the things that provide you with

461
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,460
some modicum of security.

462
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,320
And then they're destroyed.

463
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,200
Oh well, sorry.

464
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,100
We're here to help.

465
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,640
We'll help you get a job.

466
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,000
And then you can pay us back

467
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,520
for all the help we've given you.

468
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,440
See, and the thing is,

469
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,520
is the conspiracy,

470
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,880
that's their only trick.

471
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,560
They don't know how to do anything else.

472
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,080
They have no other plan.

473
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,140
That's it.

474
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:04,960
It's like Iraq.

475
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,880
They went in, they said,

476
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,100
we're gonna win, and guess what?

477
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,140
They're not winning,

478
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,700
and they don't have a plan.

479
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,180
The conspiracy is not winning,

480
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,580
and they do not have a plan.

481
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,360
And they're terrified,

482
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,360
because they know that the wisest are coming.

483
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,840
They know this planet is destined for destruction,

484
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,060
and they're torn between killing themselves

485
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,240
and killing everybody else,

486
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,280
in hopes it will postpone the moment

487
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,000
when they themselves are killed.

488
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,960
And it's, see, in the world of the conspiracy,

489
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,560
the subgenius doesn't have a whole lot going for him.

490
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,820
You know, there's that saying,

491
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,040
act like a dumb ,

492
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,660
they'll treat you like an equal.

493
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,080
It's because, as soon as they figure out

494
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,160
you're a subgenius,

495
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,380
your job suddenly becomes a bit more complicated.

496
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,200
And because the subgenius is somewhere between the Bobby,

497
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,840
which is synonymous with a fanatic, you know?

498
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,560
I mean, Bobbies are only slightly better than rabid,

499
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,720
you know, rabid, recently converted Christians,

500
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,120
or Krishnas, or whatever.

501
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,800
The subgenius,

502
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,520
the subgenius is somewhere between the Bobby

503
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,940
and the overman.

504
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,060
And some of us are closer to one end,

505
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,000
some of us are closer to the other end,

506
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,980
and you know what?

507
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
It doesn't really matter,

508
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,800
because almost an overman is not an overman.

509
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,800
Well, until you know what it is,

510
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,920
what a subgenius is,

511
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,620
you can't really understand what an overman is.

512
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,280
I'm gonna wrap this up,

513
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,920
because I'm starting to trail off.

514
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,360
I'm just gonna make this point.

515
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:06,500
The conspiracy does not know what to do next.

516
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,160
But they're dead set on winning.

517
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,900
Dead set on winning.

518
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,880
And our only hope

519
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,300
to restore some semblance of slack

520
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,060
to this poor, belabored planet

521
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,300
is Bob Dobbs and his church of the subgenius.

522
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,300
We need more subgeniuses.

523
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,960
How many people are in the room tonight?

524
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,480
Not enough.

525
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,420
That's the only number.

526
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,240
And guess what?

527
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,240
Too much is better than not enough.

528
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,860
If we had to turn the tables,

529
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,060
if we had to turn subgeniuses away,

530
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,800
I'd say this was a pretty successful devival.

531
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,020
Actually, I'm pretty happy that subgeniuses showed up, period.

532
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,860
But the thing is,

533
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,500
I said it before,

534
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,580
the yakatism are drawn to the misery of a slackless life

535
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,080
in the same way that yellow jackets are drawn to Kool-Aid.

536
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,480
And let me tell you something.

537
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,840
It's up to you whether that's gonna be the case.

538
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,580
The good Kool-Aid or the bad Kool-Aid.

539
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,780
Because you, you are, as subgeniuses,

540
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,680
you are the banana peels in the hallway of life.

541
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,240
You're the quarks.

542
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,820
You're the random radioactive element

543
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,160
that may or may not decay

544
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,700
and kill that cat we call the conspiracy.

545
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,880
Well, what are you gonna do?

546
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,260
Well, everybody's got that dollar, right?

547
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,940
That dollar's still around.

548
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,700
Everybody needs to go over to that table

549
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,140
and buy a copy of pamphlet number one or pamphlet number two.

550
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,100
Simple.

551
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,020
I want everybody that leaves here

552
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,200
that's serious about the Church of the Subgenius

553
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,820
going any farther than it is right now.

554
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,700
If you think that you have a better idea,

555
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,100
don't buy that one dollar pamphlet.

556
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,880
But if you have the slightest interest

557
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,640
in making any progress,

558
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,660
go out, buy that one dollar pamphlet,

559
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,320
and give it to somebody that's gonna read it.

560
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,120
Simple.

561
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,040
Christians are smart enough to do things like that.

562
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,120
Are you too smart?

563
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,340
Are you para-genius rather than subgenius?

564
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,900
Go form your own cult then.

565
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,540
Just simple thing.

566
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,620
Buy that pamphlet.

567
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,120
Give it to somebody else.

568
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,760
X days coming.

569
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,640
Very, very simple.

570
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,660
I use smaller words,

571
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,020
but, uh,

572
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,880
you know, subgeniuses sometimes don't understand the small words.

573
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,940
They want the big words.

574
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,160
Well, get this.

575
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,700
The yakatisma are coming,

576
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,900
and you better be ready.

577
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,300
The world ends tomorrow,

578
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,840
and you may die.

579

Subtitles by the Amara.org community

580
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,480
Oh, yes, dear friends.

581
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,960
Reverend Carter LeBlanc.

582
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,600
Unbelievable.

583
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,840
What a preacher.

584
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,260
Live at the Beachland Devival,

585
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,680
the Beachland Ballroom,

586
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,300
Devival, Cleveland, Ohio.

587
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,820
And now, from the same place,

588
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,060
more man.

589
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,660
Y'all wanna hear some more?

590
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,280
More war production.

591
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,920
More efficient machines.

592
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,060
More bullets for bombers.

593
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,700
More soldiers for war.

594
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,640
More better, faster.

595
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,420
More super ultra.

596
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,260
More production, more labor.

597
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,080
More comfort for slaves.

598
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,060
Check to check, gas to go.

599
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,960
Just to reach the next day.

600
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,040
More taxes, more plows.

601
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,100
More

602
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,100


603
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,100


604
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,100


605
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,100


606
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,100


607
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,100


608
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,100


609
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,100


610
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,100


611
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,100


612
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,100


613
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,100


614
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,420
thunder.

615
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,840
More arbitrary laws.

616
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,580
More police to suppress.

617
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,440
More rules to uphold.

618
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,720
More labor, more output.

619
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,260
More credit, more debt.

620
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,080
More increased production.

621
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,180
More comfort for slaves.

622
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,080
More comfort for slaves.

623
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,400
More service for slaves.

624
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:21,700
More everything for slaves.

625
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,200
Check to check, gas to go.

626
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,040
Just to reach the next day.

627
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,420
Though my veins are empty.

628
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,080
The high end needs a million more

629
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,720
More labor, more output

630
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,380
More conflict for slaves

631
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,040
More increased production

632
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,220
More conflict for slaves

633
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,060
More conflict for slaves

634
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,180
More conflict for slaves

635
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,140
More conflict for slaves

636
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,880
More conflict for slaves

637
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,800
More

638
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,680
Man...

639
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,100
Uuh

640
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,600
Friends

641
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,020
Matt

00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,020


643
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,400
Live at the Subgenius Devival at Beachland Ballroom 2004.

644
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:44,100
You can get more about man from www.beerforman.

645
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:50,460
And now we're going to continue listening to Jesus, yes, Jesus, on Shockwave Theater.

646
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:58,120
Yes, Reverend Dave Rones, or Baron Dave Rones, I should say, show on KFAI Minneapolis.

647
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,880
This is Baron Dave Rones and Jesus.

648
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:08,500
All right, here now, my dear friend, the kinkster, Kinky Friedman,

649
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,260
with the official Imus in the morning theme song, they ain't making Jews like Jesus anymore.

650
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,300
Well, a redneck nerd in a bowling shirt was a guzzling lone star beer,

651
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,940
talking religion and politics for all the world to hear.

652
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,400
They ought to send you back to Russia, boy, or New York City, one.

653
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,660
Do you just want to doodle a Christian girl and you kill God's only son?

654
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:43,300
I said, has it occurred to you, you nerd, that that's not very nice?

655
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,900
We Jews believe it was Santa Claus that killed Jesus Christ.

656
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,240
You know, you don't look Jewish, he said, near as I could figure.

657
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,700
I had you lamped for a slightly anemic, well-dressed country nigger.

658
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,520
Oh, they ain't making Jews like Jesus anymore.

659
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,640
They don't turn the other cheek the way they done before.

660
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,040
He started into shouting and spitting on the floor.

661
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:23,920
Lord, they ain't making Jews like Jesus anymore.

662
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,820
All right, all right.

663
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,780
Keep it country, boy.

664
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:38,880
He says, I ain't a racist, but Aristidyl Onassis is one Greek we don't need.

665
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,260
And them niggers Jews and Sigma News, all they ever do is breathe.

666
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,740
And wops and mix and slopes and specks and spooks are on my list.

667
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,320
And there's one little hebe from the heart of Texas.

668
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,540
Is there anyone I miss?

669
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,360
Well, I...

670
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:00,980
I...

671
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,440
Hits him with everything I had right square between the eyes.

672
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,360
I says, I'm gonna get you, you son of a bitch.

673
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,200
You spouting that pack of lies.

674
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:16,640
If there's one thing I can't abide, it's an ethnocentric racist.

675
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:22,900
Now, you take back that said about Aristidyl Onassis.

676
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,960
Oh, they ain't making Jews like Jesus anymore.

677
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,780
We don't...

678
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,140
We don't turn the other cheek the way we done before.

679
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,180
You could hear that honky holler as he hit that hardwood floor.

680
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:46,220
Lord, they ain't making Jews like Jesus anymore.

681
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,180
Everybody in America now.

682
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,660
They ain't making Jews like Jesus anymore.

683
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,960
They ain't making carpenters who know what nails are for.

684
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,640
Well, the whole damn place was singing.

685
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,600
As I strolled right out the door.

686
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:19,060
Lord, they ain't making Jews like Jesus anymore.

687
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,680
Lord, they ain't making Jews like Jesus anymore.

688
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,060
And that was...

689
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,860
They ain't making Jews like Jesus anymore.

690
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,780
They ain't making Jews like Jesus anymore.

691
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,020
Beautiful.

692
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,940
By Kinky Friedman.

693
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,620
Because of our special guest.

694
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,900
Hello, my name is Dave Rome.

695
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,380
You're listening to Shockwave Radio Theater.

696
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,660
And over there is Jesus.

697
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,020
Not the one with the nails, but the one with the subgenius.

698
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,120
The one with the checkbook.

699
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,860
The one with the checkbook.

700
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,360
And the Church of the Subgenius has been around for a while, hasn't it?

701
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,320
Yeah, we originally...

702
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,880
Well, some people say that the church was originally founded back in the 60s.

703
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,860
But the first book, the Book of the Subgenius, and pamphlet number one, was penned in 19...

704
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:12,740
As you may or may not know, we also have the Hour of Slack radio program that's on in many public radio stations and colleges across the United States and in Canada.

705
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,300
And that's been going on also since that time.

706
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,460
So we have our own ministry of merchandise.

707
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,820
How do you convert people?

708
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,080
What do you say to them as they're coming out of the Scientology booth or whatever?

709
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,020
Most of our people...

710
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,360
It's very difficult to know where you're going to find a subgenius.

711
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:30,860
It's very difficult to know where you're going to find a subgenius.

712
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,260
Or what's going to draw them to us.

713
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,360
Sometimes it's hearing the preachers.

714
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,480
Sometimes it's the books.

715
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,500
Sometimes it's Bob.

716
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,900
Mostly it's just the promise of cheap sex that really draws in most of our members.

717
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,640
Okay, well, sure.

718
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:55,680
And how did you happen to pick Jesus as your savior as opposed to the Dalai Lama or the chief rabbi or the...

719
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,540
I don't know.

720
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,440
Well, actually, the savior...

721
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,860
I guess you can think of actually the Jesus...

722
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,720
The Jesus of the Church of the Subgenius is not really me.

723
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,320
The sort of the leader behind it all is Bob.

724
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,060
J.R. Bob Dobbs is the world's greatest salesman.

725
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,920
He's a multi-millionaire.

726
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,500
Actually, he's a multi-billionaire.

727
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,900
Many people think Bill Gates is the richest man in the world.

728
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,480
Friends, if you know the name of the richest man in the world, he's not the richest man in the world.

729
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,980
There are people who can buy and sell Bill Gates.

730
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,920
And J.R. Bob Dobbs happens to be one of these.

731
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,520
And not only is he the richest man, but he also is the luckiest man.

732
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,860
And that is pretty much how he is.

733
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,000
He made his money.

734
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,480
Bob always said, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

735
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,200
And he is.

736
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,760
Extremely lucky.

737
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,800
Okay.

738
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,480
And so that's...

739
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,500
Some of...

740
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,080
Let me start that sentence again.

741
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,120
Describe some of your more pleasant rituals.

742
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,880
We have a lot of, like I said earlier, healings, sickenings.

743
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,240
The marriage ritual, I think, is the...

744
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,060
Would you mind if I married your entire audience today?

745
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,800
I mean, I can do that.

746
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,140
A mass marriage real quick?

747
00:37:59,220 --> 00:37:59,420
Sure.

748
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,620
It'll only take about 30 seconds.

749
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:00,820
Okay.

750
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,640
So all of you out there, be prepared to get hitched.

751
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,720
Yeah, what you want to do, and maybe we can come back after a little while

752
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,460
and at least let you find your significant other, man, woman, animal.

753
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,480
Again, we can marry you to your wallet.

754
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,760
Or your favorite CD.

755
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,660
To your favorite CD.

756
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,280
Just, you know, grab anything, but you do want to have it prepared and with you.

757
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,400
The marriage ceremony, is there something that we need to do?

758
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,240
Sprinkle rice or, I don't know...

759
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:30,860
No, you simply just need to have the person or object that you wish to marry with you.

760
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,140
In thought, do they have to physically be there?

761
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,360
No, they don't even have to really be there.

762
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,820
In fact, you could call them up later and let them know that you're married.

763
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,940
Now, this is what we call a short duration personal marriage.

764
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,300
I see.

765
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,180
We feel that long term relationships are, you know, really a part of the conspiracy.

766
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:50,580
So, today's marriage ceremony, at least for this one that we're doing over there, will just be for 24 hours.

767
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,080
I see.

768
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,920
And then, of course, it's annulled.

769
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,860
But during that 24 hours, you are legally and bonded in holy matrimony.

770
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,240
Okay.

771
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:00,660
So...

772
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,320
I'll play the fake organ here.

773
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,280
Oh, are we ready to do it?

774
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,940
Yes, go for it.

775
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,760
Well, what are you going to get married to there, Barron?

776
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,660
I think I'll get married to this Kinky Freedman CD.

777
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,060
Okay, that's appropriate.

778
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:19,580
I'm going to do sort of the short version here of the subgenius short duration personal marriage.

779
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:25,800
The first thing you want to do, though, is take out your CD or your favorite person, your loved one or your wallet.

780
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,140
And you want to just hold it in your left hand.

781
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,740
Something that means something to you.

782
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,000
Something that means something to you.

783
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,400
And I'll just do this.

784
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,780
Everyone can just play along at home, but I'll do it with the Barron here.

785
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:45,940
Barron, in the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs and what other other deities, gods and saints you may wish to worship at this time,

786
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:57,440
do you take this CD to be your lawfully wedded object for the next 24 hours?

787
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,000
Oh, that's a yes.

788
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:10,520
And do you, CD, take the Barron David Rahm to be your lawfully wedded partner at least for the next 24 hours till death do us part?

789
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,960
Yes, the clapping of the CD.

790
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,080
Then, now this is something you could do if you actually have a human.

791
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,260
This might be difficult with a CD.

792
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,380
Shake their hand and say, it's a deal.

793
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:27,420
And friends, in the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, that was the quickest short duration marriage on earth.

794
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,700
I now pronounce you thing and thing for the next 24 hours.

795
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,380
Praise Bob.

796
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,820
Wow, yeah.

797
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,300
I've discussed this with the CD, but I really only got married for the health insurance.

798
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,800
You must now consummate the marriage.

799
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,280
Oh, I forgot that part.

800
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:45,720
Oh.

801
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,120
Well, I already played the CD.

802
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,780
Well, you can wait till after.

803
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,020


804
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,240
Okay.

805
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,560
I don't necessarily want to see that.

806
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,740
You can wait till after the show.

807
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,060
Okay.

808
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,220
Sure.

809
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,400
Do you have a lot of...

810
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,400


811
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,640
Do you have a lot of luck proselytizing when you go out and spread the word?

812
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,160
Well, I think we do.

813
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,820
I think people, it's a message that people want to hear.

814
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,860
And, you know, we really don't collect feedback.

815
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,300
I don't think we really care whether or not we're getting through.

816
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,360
We mostly just preach with big megaphones.

817
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,020
Sort of a one-way communication.

818
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,220
We just sort of, you know, force our message on to people.

819
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,740
I mean, that's just the way of religion.

820
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,120
That's right.

821
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,680
We don't really care.

822
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,740
Well, do you have gatherings?

823
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,760
I mean, I went to one of your big gatherings in 1984.

824
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,540
It was a while ago.

825
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,260
That was a big thing in Chicago.

826
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,640
Yeah, we have what we call divivals, subgenius divivals.

827
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:40,140
And, in fact, a lot of them take place in the North, the frozen North, in places such

828
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,580
as Cleveland, Ohio.

829
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,920
And if you want to know more about these divivals and when you can go to them, see preachers,

830
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,100
see some subgenius music, go to our website.

831
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,840
It's simply subgenius.com.

832
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,120
Maybe I should spell that for the...

833
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,240
Sure.

834
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,380
There's subgeniuses out there.

835
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,300
There's subgeniuses, right.

836
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,060
S-U-B-G-E-N-I-U-S.

837
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,840
There's no O in subgenius.

838
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,540
Some people try to put it in there.

839
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,980
And if you do, then you know you belong to our group, right?

840
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:05,980
That's right.

841
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,940
The subgenius is an interesting word.

842
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:13,600
A lot of people believe that means that you're stupid, you're under a genius.

843
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,400
But, truly, it's the genius of the subculture is what it was supposed to be.

844
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:23,920
I know there was a rival group, the Wile E. Coyote Super Genius branch that had split

845
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,060
off.

846
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,200
I don't know if that was a heresy of yours or just...

847
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,000
Well, there's a lot of...

848
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,560
We do have a lot of clenches and a lot of detractors that will go out and form their

849
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,240
own groups.

850
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,840
The Church of Dawn, some of you may have heard of.

851
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,320
It's a pretty popular group.

852
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,700
Church of Dawn.

853
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,080
Yeah.

854
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,840
It's sort of the anti-Bob group for the people who hate Bob.

855
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,300
I should think the anti-Bob would be Odo.

856
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,240
No, Obo.

857
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:46,980
Obo.

858
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,300
Obo.

859
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:47,300


860
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,360
You know, strangely enough, you know, Baron, that's why you are a great subgenius because

861
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,420
there is an anti-Bob named Obo.

862
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:53,760
Well...

863
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,040
It's amazing.

864
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,280
It's just like it's already been in your brain.

865
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,860
Well, there you go.

866
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:05,640
Jesus on Shockwave Radio Theater, KFAI in Minneapolis.

867
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:11,500
And now, from the subgenius movie, the DVD, Arise.

868
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,340
Basically, two factions out there right now is us and them.

869
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,500
And unfortunately, them is much, much greater than us.

870
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,720
The fortunate thing about it is that...

871
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,560
We know that them are actually working for us, but them doesn't know that they're working

872
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,060
for us.

873
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,260
We stand at a crossroads.

874
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,760
The tenuous slack that a subgenius may occasionally enjoy could be rent to shreds at any moment,

875
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,360
for the human puppets of the elder gods continue their senseless plunge into madness and anti-slack,

876
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,700
dragging us and our whole beloved planet ever closer to the moon.

877
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:52,700


878
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,700
And so we find ourselves in a world of mental ecstasy.

879
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,140
After the meno- storing up of CCD since five years ago, perhaps, that we've ever seen,

880
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:04,740
when we're ready to travelеры

881
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,280
in our

882
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:08,280


883
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,720
arquitectural

884
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:10,720


885
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:20,700
Over years and decades, myowaćo

886
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,520
Jesus began to give to them the signs of his coming and the end of the age,

887
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,780
and one of the signs he referred to was the abomination of desolation

888
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,660
that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet.

889
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,220
Exactly as Noah getting into the ark triggered the deluge

890
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,660
that destroyed the earth in his day,

891
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,520
and that it's very highly possible that when this all takes place

892
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,200
that a great cataclysmic judgment will do that very thing.

893
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,720
No, God will destroy this country, cities, and America.

894
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,680
Cities in this nation literally instantly destroyed.

895
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:10,340
Gee, I can't wait till that Bob-time train comes around the bend.

896
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,280
Oh, look out, son. Here it comes now.

897
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,680
It's frightening, isn't it?

898
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,980
It's unbelievably big and scary.

899
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,500
It's that wrenching deluge.

900
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,640
We stand to receive the war of the flesh

901
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,960
and understand not the way of the land-clad ones.

902
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:39,220
But we're not, things are not actually that hopeless.

903
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,240
Although there is one thing that I consider to be pretty fucking hopeless,

904
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,360
and that's the new age.

905
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,080
Yes, I am.

906
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,200
Pissed off about the new age.

907
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,740
Oh, for a change. Oh, gee, what a difference.

908
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,780
Gosh, Reverend Stank's ragging on the new agers instead of the Christians for once.

909
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,420
But really, this new age blather, we had to come up with a new word for it.

910
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,560
Gaiarea.

911
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,660
When they get to talking about Gaia.

912
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:16,200
And friends, you know, from these gurus, therapists,

913
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,540
and numbnuts of the new age,

914
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:24,000
you hear quite a bit of that fucking Gaiarea.

915
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:28,880
Now, our job as subgeniuses is to unmask the false prophets.

916
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,280
Yes, to unmask the false prophets.

917
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:36,140
And ask yourself now, which false prophet is the biggest liar?

918
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,940
Which one is lying the most to you?

919
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,540
That's a good one. George Bush? Cheney? Bob?

920
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,580
No!

921
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,640
The biggest liar you know is you!

922
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,160
You are the biggest fucking liar you know.

923
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,620
I know this because I'm the biggest liar I know.

924
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:02,180
But I'm trying to catch myself in the lies.

925
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,460
Shit, there was another one.

926
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,220
Damn, it's so hard.

927
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,480
And that's what this rant is all about.

928
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:14,580
Because there's a lot of people going around, these new age gurus and therapists,

929
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:20,200
trying to teach you how to be more awake.

930
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,520
More aware.

931
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:31,700
Well, frankly, I think what a lot of them are doing is teaching you how to pretend to be more awake.

932
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,600
And more aware.

933
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:41,920
They teach you to categorize all the parts of your personality so that you can talk just as if you understood them.

934
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,560
But those are all just a bunch of lies.

935
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:44,560


936
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:50,700
And they're just imaginary boxes, friends, that keep you automatically sure that you're not on automatic.

937
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:56,840
I know this because I happen to be the automatic robot that goes around telling all the other robots

938
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,620
that they're a bunch of robots and they need to wake up!

939
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,960
Sorry, I'm just programmed that way. I do that automatically.

940
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,460
That's how I know!

941
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,960
Now, I know that it's fun.

942
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:13,200
It's really fun to put yourself into that happy mental state of believing yourself

943
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,600
to be fully awake and preternaturally aware.

944
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,940
And really, truly in the now.

945
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:24,620
But really, what a lot of people are doing is skipping straight to announcing their enlightenment

946
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,040
without actually turning on the lights, so to speak.

947
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:35,600
Some new agers, in fact, are so busy thinking about how in the now they are

948
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,100
that they don't see what is happening in front of their fucking faces!

949
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,060
So...

950
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,220
They talk...

951
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,020
Right, exactly.

952
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,740
But you have to decide what the slack is!

953
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,020
Some guru cannot tell...

954
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:55,200
He can tell you what slack is supposed to be in his belief system.

955
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,320
But, you know...

956
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:58,940
Well...

957
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:05,500
They talk the talk, the trademark talk of the aware person, but it just stays talk.

958
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,860
They don't live forever.

959
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,680
They don't speak from the grave.

960
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,020
Their followers might say they did,

961
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,140
but that's only because somebody said they said they did.

962
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,900
It's a bunch of...

963
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,260
It's just words, words, words.

964
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,480
And, you know, followers are the ones with the most vested interest

965
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,280
in not being proved to be dupes of some con man.

966
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,320
But the worst of all has to be the con man himself

967
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,900
who is a dupe of a whole long line of con men.

968
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,920
The conspir...

969
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,960
Here's the conspiracy in a nutshell.

970
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:45,380
Thinking that freedom and slack are gonna come to you by magic the easy way.

971
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,460
No, you're not Bob.

972
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,440
And I may not be enlightened,

973
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,980
but I can sure spot a liar...

974
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,260
Takes one to know one.

975
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,300
And there's a lot of gurus, therapists, and jackasses

976
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,580
bragging about how enlightened they are.

977
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,240
I'll say that again.

978
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,940
Bragging about how enlightened they are.

979
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,120
Those who know don't say, and those who say don't know.

980
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,940
So I shouldn't have even said that much.

981
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,440
But these, you know, false prophets, friends,

982
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,580
there's a lot of them out there,

983
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,760
and they use tricks that are so fucking simple

984
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,220
that they only impress intellectuals.

985
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:32,400
Like, for instance, to create a presence, a super presence,

986
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,740
they use the old power stare.

987
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,920
The power stare.

988
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:37,920


989
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,320
Something so simple that chimpanzees and rednecks use it.

990
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,340
But it has been forgotten by people who read too much,

991
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,200
gimps, nerds, dips, and numbnuts, and geniuses.

992
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,680
And so you find these guys who are giving lessons in enlightenment,

993
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:00,000
which implies that they're somehow qualified to teach it.

994
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:04,540
It's like the people that tell you you're smart.

995
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,180
Have you ever had some...

996
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,880
absolute drunken idiot walk up and go,

997
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,320
I've been listening to what you're saying.

998
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,360
You're very intelligent.

999
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,820
I just want you to know.

1000
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,320
You're very intelligent.

1001
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,840
The craziest guy in subgenius land

1002
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,340
said on the internet the other day,

1003
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,120
Stag makes good sense.

1004
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,760
Even I had to laugh my ass off at that.

1005
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,900
He was the craziest guy on the internet.

1006
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:43,280
When you start telling everybody who's smart and who's dumb,

1007
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,060
that's not necessarily a smart thing to do.

1008
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:51,140
What if you're not really as qualified as you think?

1009
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,360
I suspect that none of us are.

1010
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:57,820
But yet, there's only one thing, friends,

1011
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,860
more powerful than belief or the human mind.

1012
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,360
And that is the human ego.

1013
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:08,840
The human ego is so much better at tricking the mind

1014
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,300
that the mind can't even begin to guess

1015
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,160
how good that ego is.

1016
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,660
And in fact, it makes the mind think it's winning

1017
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,920
just by sweet talking it.

1018
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,880
So, the next thing you know,

1019
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,080
there's guys running around who are nothing but ego

1020
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,220
trying to tell everybody else how to run their own minds

1021
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,160
and lose their egos.

1022
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,340
As the rapper Poop Dog,

1023
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,600
Poop Bobby Bob said,

1024
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,500
the Pink Boys got a Bob complex.

1025
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,120
But really, friends, we have to say,

1026
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,520
is it that bad?

1027
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,760
Is there no such thing as enlightenment?

1028
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:52,360
Is Slack just jacking off and watching your favorite show?

1029
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,260
Well, maybe.

1030
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,640
Is it all bluff?

1031
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,560
Is it all a bunch of guru and therapist bluff?

1032
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,480
Is it all self-bluff?

1033
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,840
Are we really so cynical?

1034
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,720
Is the guru bluffing himself so well that he inspires others?

1035
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,880
Gurjeef, who inspired this rant,

1036
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,840
said that that's the first pitfall.

1037
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,740
But was he just saying that because it sounded wise?

1038
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,740
That's the thing that, you know, it's like,

1039
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,460
how do you think about your own brain?

1040
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,420
It's just tricky as hell.

1041
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,220
It's easy to learn the semblance

1042
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,640
and the trappings of awareness and knowledge.

1043
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,440
For instance,

1044
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,180
impenetrably flighty jargon

1045
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,920
punctuated by pregnant pauses.

1046
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,660
Oh, and flattery.

1047
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,960
A really good guru sooner or later looks at you and says,

1048
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,140
obviously there are many things I don't need to tell you.

1049
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,300
That's where you're supposed to fork out some more money.

1050
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,500
Friends, it's all lies,

1051
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,380
but it's not direct lies.

1052
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,440
It's lies by omission,

1053
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,320
lies by suggestion,

1054
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,320
providing rule books for fairness.

1055
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,440
For lazy thinkers who want to believe,

1056
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,040
who really want to believe.

1057
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,040
Folks who like to think that they're thinkers.

1058
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,080
And this, I'm sad to say,

1059
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,520
includes the subgenius kooks.

1060
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,980
Yes, it's true, there are such things.

1061
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,360
As hard as it may be to believe,

1062
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,000
there are such things as subgenius kooks.

1063
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,640
Because look at our written material.

1064
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:29,880
Bob sometimes was so obviously telling kooks

1065
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,700
what they would most want to believe,

1066
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,660
that only a kook could possibly believe it.

1067
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,400
And they do!

1068
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,680
Praise Bob!

1069
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,520
So, friends, frankly,

1070
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,860
as far as I can tell,

1071
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,140
outside of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1072
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,400
who you can be completely alone with, by the way,

1073
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,900
most gurus and therapists and so forth

1074
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,460
really are just going to get in your way

1075
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,140
and impede your slack,

1076
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,740
because they don't know what slack is for you.

1077
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,920
Because you have to figure it out for yourself,

1078
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,720
and that's the work part of it that I was talking about.

1079
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,560
You have to really want slack,

1080
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,660
not just want the bragging rights of slack.

1081
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,380
One sign of getting old, like me,

1082
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:17,020
is you're no longer sure you're right.

1083
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,440
Being more sure that you're right

1084
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,820
is a sign of getting stupid, not getting old.

1085
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,580
But, despite the fact that we might be old,

1086
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,120
stupid, or crazy,

1087
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:27,480
kooky,

1088
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,940
because we're subgeniuses,

1089
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,700
we are luckier,

1090
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,940
we are better,

1091
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,600
we are smarter, even when we're dumber,

1092
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,780
because, and only because,

1093
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,100
we have J.R. Bob Dobbs!

1094
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,320
Bob Dobbs healed me!

1095
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,840
He healed me!

1096
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,260
Bob took his living fist,

1097
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,740
and he stuck it all the way up my butt!

1098
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,700
Bob healed my ass, my friends!

1099
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,980
Bob healed my ass!

1100
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,640
Believe me, I know,

1101
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,720
because I'm an expert in whatchamacallit.

1102
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,760
Don't mistake me for little Lord Give-a-shit,

1103
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,700
but, because it's Bob

1104
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,700
is the one who puts the scent in incentive,

1105
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,620
the dick in ridiculous,

1106
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,780
and the pipe in your mouth!

1107
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,780
So friends, remember,

1108
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,980
remember Leonard Crow Dog,

1109
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,640
and remember Leonard Shelby.

1110
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,620
And repent!

1111
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,180
Quit your job!

1112
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,980
Slack off while you still know how, my friends!

1113
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,320
Question authority!

1114
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,940
Thank you!

1115
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,920
Bob is not the answer,

1116
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,820
and neither is anything else,

1117
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,780
and fuck them if they can't take a joke!

1118
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,860
Praise Bob!

1119
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,220
I am Man Incorporated from Detroit!

1120
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,000
I'd like to praise Bob!

1121
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,340
Thank the amino acids,

1122
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,480
and everyone else!

1123
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,520
Thank you all!

1124
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:02,520


1125
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,220
Righteous Range Rover!

1126
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,000
Burnin' Daddy's gas!

1127
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,060
It's a drum circle jerk-off!

1128
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,420
Hey bro, you got a clutter?

1129
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,380
One punch!

1130
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,320
Hippie down!

1131
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,020
Hippie down!

1132
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,740
Hippie down!

1133
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,460
Hippie down!

1134
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:35,920
Hippie down!

1135
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,020
Hippie down!

1136
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:36,040
Hippie down!

1137
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:36,660
Thank you! Goodnight!

1138
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,120
Man,

1139
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,860
from the subgenius

1140
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:48,980
defival at

1141
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,200
Beachland Ballroom, friends,

1142
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,140
and in the background,

1143
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,800
we can hear the amino acids

1144
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,640
ripping along.

1145
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,560
Uh, before all of that,

1146
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,160
we heard your streely reverend,

1147
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,480
Ivan Stang, preaching at that self-same defival.

1148
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,240
Friends, you can learn more about the Church

1149
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:12,520
of the subgenius by writing to Bob at Post Office Box 204-206, Austin, Texas 78720. Or send tapes to

1150
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:24,200
me, Reverend Ivan Stang, 181, that's Box 181-417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118. And all of that can

1151
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:32,080
be found again at www.subgenius.com. And now let's listen to how one of these defivals ends

1152
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:39,320
when we invite the drunks of the audience up on stage to preach the word of that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1153
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:07,000
Hi, this is, it's a rant-a-thon now. The amino acids have warmed this stage up for you to come up here and preach.

1154
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:20,380
That's right, man. This is, you're drunk enough, you're drunk enough to face how many, oh, at least a hundred

1155
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:23,940
primate eyeballs. 101. So,

1156
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:32,080
now there's a man who can just barely make it up on the stage,

1157
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:45,820
which means, who knows, maybe he'll channel Bob and die. My name is Bob, and I might die tomorrow.

1158
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:53,920
No! But you know what? You might too. Are you ready for that?

1159
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,140
I am.

1160
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:09,780
Due to the local convenience station, whereby I buy a 12-pack of beer every night, gave me a compliment.

1161
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:19,700
He said, man, you're cool. You party hard. Like that Andrew W.K. song, I guess. You know what I told him?

1162
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:23,380
And I felt kind of ashamed to tell him this.

1163
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:34,300
I work hard, because I have a job. I have a job. No, no, that chick ain't gonna spank me again.

1164
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:52,000
But I have a job, and I work hard at it. And you know what? I reckon I got a right to party hard, because I never know when X Day is coming.

1165
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,180
X Day is coming.

1166
01:00:54,200 --> 01:01:02,340
X Day could be today! It could be right now! Some of you sons of bitches could drop dead from a heart attack right now, right here!

1167
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,880
Are you ready for that?

1168
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:05,840
Yes!

1169
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,460
Are you really?

1170
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:08,400
Yes!

1171
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:14,120
You better look at yourselves. Do you see Bob in the mirror?

1172
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:20,320
You know what? When I look in the mirror, I see Bob.

1173
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:21,760
I see Bob.

1174
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,080
I see Bob.

1175
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,980
I see Bob.

1176
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,020
I see Bob.

1177
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:26,020


1178
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:26,020


1179
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:26,820
But I see Bob.

1180
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,080
That's a name my parents give me.

1181
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,720
And I think they bless me with that name.

1182
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,700
Because the proof of Bob's empire is everywhere.

1183
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:39,060
Just like it says in the book of the subgenius.

1184
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,540
Look in your telephone directory.

1185
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:48,280
You'll see Bob's this and that and the other thing.

1186
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,640
All I'm telling you is this.

1187
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,080
Fuck the conspiracy.

1188
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,460
Fuck the pinks.

1189
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,520
Praise Bob!

1190
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,640
Praise Bob!
