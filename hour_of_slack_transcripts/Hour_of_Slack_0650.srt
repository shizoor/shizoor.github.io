1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,380
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sets adjusted. We're having operating difficulties.

2
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,600
I feel good.

3
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,400
The subconscious will listen and absorb this message.

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,600
Exactly.

5
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,380
Hey, what's going on here?

6
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,100
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,100
Welcome to the Eddentons, boys and girls.

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,060
We're going to shock shock the house, put your brain in a whirl.

9
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,840
Bob is getting down with you here tonight.

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,140
Bob is getting down to help your plight.

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,200
Bob is coming here to ease your strife.

12
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,220
Come on, suckers, let Bob into your life.

13
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,160
Big fan, Bob.

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,080
P.O.

15
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,340
P.O.

16
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,920
This is Walter.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,900
This is Walter Teasdale, reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases.

18
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,940
But truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,140
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

20
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,360
Here's your host.

21
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,760
Who sits on the right hand side of Bob?

22
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,260
None other than the Reverend Ivan Stang.

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,160
The sexiest man on earth.

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,960
A young Adonis who's irresistible to women.

25
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,020
I can't wait a moment longer.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,540
I've got to have sex with you.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,380
You shall have sex.

28
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,360
You shall be rich.

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,680
Rich and limitless sexer.

30
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,060
You've got me all worked up again.

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,820
I'm out of the nest.

32
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,520
Bob is sex.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,240
Well, this is public radio.

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,780
This is public educational public radio.

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,160
That's right.

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,580
You cannot say that we're not fulfilling our covenant with the public to provide entertaining and educational programs.

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,200
Yeah, it's just like nature or National Geographic.

38
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,840
Yeah, National Geographic with the naked, topless pictures of the Micronesian girl.

39
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,220
Look at the music.

40
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,840
Look at the music we play and look at the pictures, you know, we encourage you to look at on the Internet.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,660
It's a rainbow, multi-ethnic educational thing.

42
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,020
We're very anthropologic down here.

43
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,540
Yeah.

44
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,060
Yeah, it's like Margaret Mead.

45
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,520
Could have a field day with us.

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,840
Margaret Mead meets the bonobo monkeys.

47
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,660
And we hire lots of minorities.

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,140
We hire talented people.

49
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,180
Bob.

50
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,820
Bob.

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,360
Bob.

52
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,140
Bob is sex.

53
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,040
That's your key phrase.

54
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,640
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

55
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,920
We are controlling transmission.

56
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,140
Sponsored by the Chalk.

57
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,140
We are the subdominant.

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,880
Three, two, and one.

59
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,920
Now to continue with the tape recording.

60
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,480
Set.

61
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,040
It's going.

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,600
Amen.

63
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,020
Recording.

64
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,120
Everything's going fine.

65
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,720
No problem.

66
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,500
All right.

67
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,240
Yeah, pretty good.

68
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,860
How are you?

69
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,420
All right.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,800
New shows coming in.

71
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,100
All right.

72
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,360
Set them up over there, Joe.

73
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,520
Giant record boxes now lowering CD.

74
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,220
Full floors of CDs.

75
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,820
Moving.

76
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,340
Boy, what I wouldn't give for some of them CDs.

77
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,260
That radio strong water.

78
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,780
It is a perfect show.

79
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,440
Bob.

80
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,080
Well, you know, it tries.

81
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,700
It strives for perfection, knowing that that is something which in this imperfect world

82
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,080
we cannot attain.

83
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,320
Yes, God is the measure of that perfection.

84
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,140
Being superhuman and superhuman.

85
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:33,400
God inhabits space in a vast, unilateral direction.

86
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,700
In which there's not much between those words.

87
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,260
Nothing at all, in fact, sometimes.

88
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,340
And you're out there floating in space.

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,120
Only a few scant hydrogen atoms.

90
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,340
Wanderers in the interstitial spaces in the universe.

91
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,120
Nothing else between the oases of planetary systems and the brightness of space.

92
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


93
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


94
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


95
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


96
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


97
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


98
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


99
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


100
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


101
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


102
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


103
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,120


104
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,400
stars, with the endless backdrop of nothingness, darkness eternal.

105
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,920
Choppers.

106
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,560
Hal.

107
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,860
Dr. Hal.

108
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,160
He may have a way with words.

109
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,200
But, uh, who cares about that?

110
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,740
So let's, uh, go, uh, have another, uh...

111
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,940
Stuff, dear friends, uh...

112
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,920
That was a little bit of Dr. Hal and, uh, puzzling evidence there on KPFA.

113
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,340
Hey, what happened to my...

114
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,620
Friends, what happened to my mic here?

115
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,500
There we go.

116
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,400
You have to treat some of those tapes differently.

117
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,400
And then you have to come back from their reality into this reality.

118
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,900
And, uh...

119
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,700
Oh, speaking of Dr. Hal and KPFA...

120
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,680
Let me, uh...

121
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,880
Don't want to get my sound up too, too...

122
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,320
Too...

123
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,320


124
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,320


125
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,900
Too loud, you know, and hurt y'all.

126
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,380
But, uh...

127
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,940
Dr. Hal has, uh...

128
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,820
Wrote me this letter here.

129
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,660
He says...

130
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:10,600
My dear Ivan, here on the left coast, I have been besieged, as you should be less than surprised to hear,

131
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,540
by whimpering gimme bobs, all complaining about the post-X-Day world.

132
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,720
To these, I have the same reply.

133
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,180
Upon reflection, I thought I should share with you this doctrinal rebuke to these...

134
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,780
Poor wandering livestock, which I hereby humbly set before you.

135
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,900
Dear Seeker, please calm yourself.

136
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,280
It's not the end of the world.

137
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,940
Although neither I nor any other subgenius owe you an explanation,

138
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,880
there is information at the sub-site.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,040
The official line is a tissue of flat doodle involving a misreading of the launch date as scrawled by Bob himself.

140
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,260
On the back of an...

141
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,500
An envelope?

142
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,940
Allegedly.

143
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:06,080
Stang read the year upside down, so that the year 8,661 A.D. was thought by the sacred scribe to be 1998.

144
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,340
This would have the effect of giving the church more time to accomplish its mission.

145
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Uh-huh.

146
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,540
Uh, Hal writes on...

147
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,500
The rupture did indeed take place according to schedule at 5 A.M. our time in California.

148
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,620
Were you awake?

149
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,860
In a twinkling of Bob's eye, the faithful, which I trust includes you,

150
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,660
were caught up in the clouds in the so-called saucers and returned in time for breakfast.

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,260
All predicted changes are happening and will happen, but not according to human standards of time,

152
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,920
but rather in accordance with the movements,

153
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,240
whether in epicycles, or in the world of the universe, or in the universe itself.

154
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,240


155
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,240


156
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,240


157
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,340
The universe is a

158
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:03,860
cosmic clock, which may only be read by superhuman optic or other sensory organs.

159
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:14,020
A religion that could be completely comprehended and fully interpreted would be a toy fit to be encapsulated and folded up to be put in one's pocket.

160
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,740
But behold, we show you a mystery.

161
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,220
Isn't it universally accepted that one of the few things you do know about the universe is that it's a mystery?

162
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,220


163
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,220


164
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,220


165
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,220


166
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,220


167
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,220


168
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,220


169
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,220


170
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,220


171
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,220


172
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,220


173
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,780
That the aliens are the ones who abduct you, and that they always put you back?

174
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,280
That the abductees do not immediately remember the details?

175
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,540
What in the name of Whitley Streber were you people expecting?

176
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,360
Without springing for a conspiracy psychiatrist, look back!

177
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:49,720
Recollect in tranquility, if you will, a dare to disturb with a ripple of self-inquiry the deep pool of your unconscious memory.

178
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,040
Now then, are you sure you can...

179
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,860
completely account for your activities at 5 a.m. on July 5th, 1998?

180
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:10,080
There is an alternative hypothesis, one so terrible that I hesitate to set it before you, seeker, yet I shall.

181
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,840
This hypothesis is...

182
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,520
Bear with me now.

183
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,940
This hypothesis is that the promised rupture did not happen...

184
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,260
for you.

185
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,980
For you.

186
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,780
For you.

187
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:24,780


188
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:24,780


189
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:24,780


190
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,380
I'm sure you were just too pig.

191
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,280
Happy post-X Day.

192
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,880
Austerely yours, the doctor, Howland Owl.

193
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,540
So, uh...

194
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,260
I can't believe it.

195
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,500
Satan pulled him out of the box.

196
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,040
It's been very, very, very...

197
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,820
Geez, we didn't know he was ready for a nervous breakdown.

198
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,440
Well, he's not ready for a nervous breakdown.

199
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,260
But I don't care.

200
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,780
Dammit.

201
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,180
I still believe in Bob.

202
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,920
I don't care if the Xs don't come in 99.

203
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,320
Just point to the usual thing.

204
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,120
I don't care.

205
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,040
Bob says they'll come in 2000.

206
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,200
Have you talked to Bob since X-Day?

207
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,000
I still believe in Bob.

208
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,120
Have you talked to Bob?

209
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,380
There you go.

210
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,840
Gotta admit, the man has faith.

211
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,920
Have you talked to Bob since X-Day?

212
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,860
This is not KPFA.

213
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,100
Speaking of Bob, have you talked to him since X-Day?

214
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,580
No.

215
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:09,740
Who?

216
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,420
Bob.

217
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,180
Who?

218
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,420
He says who?

219
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,020
I think Gordon had a short conversation.

220
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,080
A very short conversation.

221
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,720
What did he say?

222
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,140
He said, oops.

223
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,180
He said, oops.

224
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,560
I would say that was a major flopper.

225
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,280
Well, not according to Bob.

226
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:36,900
According, now at one point, the divination was that all of X-Day was a necessary diversion,

227
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,720
sort of what you might call an old lady sneezing in the crowd during the showdown on Main Street,

228
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,800
diverting the evil Jack Palance, Yaka Tisma's attention just at the moment of the draw,

229
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,280
so that the X-ist, Gary Brighton...

230
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,520
Heidi Murphy or whatever could blow away the...

231
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,120
could win the day.

232
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,200
Well, that's beautiful.

233
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,460
That's a beautiful thought.

234
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,000
In other words, we were just bit players.

235
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,700
Our belief in X-Day was a necessary prop in an elder gods scenario.

236
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,760
Well, I feel like I miscreant some sort of vagabond while I was at your X, X-Day.

237
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,280
Did you know that a giant X appeared in the sky over Sherman at quarter to seven,

238
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,340
just before our limousine pulled in?

239
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,620
I think that was when you were face down on the railroad ties there,

240
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,560
and you had hallucinated.

241
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,240
They didn't actually tie me to the railroad ties,

242
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,080
but if there had been a railroad, I would have also been tied.

243
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,200
Did they put, like, real chicken feet on you and stuff when they tarred and feathered you?

244
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,760
No, just the little pink feathers.

245
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,140
Pink feathers, how appropriate.

246
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,400
Did you not see the climax of X-Day, the 7 a.m. moment?

247
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,240
I didn't come at the same time.

248
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,240
The great countdown.

249
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,440
No, I...

250
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,940
In fact, we counted down twice.

251
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,260
Twice.

252
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,400
Okay.

253
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,540
One more chance.

254
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,280
After the first countdown.

255
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,220
I was sound asleep.

256
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,480
We tried.

257
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,440
We counted down again, and I still didn't come.

258
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,860
I was sound asleep on my command module.

259
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,120
Sensitive.

260
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,100
He's a whimpering dog.

261
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,360
He's lost his faith.

262
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,740
We got the boy.

263
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,600
We gotta get some money.

264
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,520
That dirty, purgish, hark-a-pack, flackin' wharton, fill-a-buck-a-barton, purg-a-bark.

265
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,200
What do you gentlemen like to escort?

266
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,080
Reverend Stang-Out, and lock him out of this place.

267
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,560
Oh, you got to see what he is.

268
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,780
He's a maniac.

269
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,980
Out to rule the world.

270
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,080
What can I do to make you understand him?

271
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,820
I love you.

272
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,460
I love you.

273
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,840
I love you.

274
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,060
I love you.

275
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,320
I love you.

276
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,340
I love you.

277
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,480
Have I already said, ah, yes, dear friends?

278
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,320
The rewards are worth the effort.

279
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,880
Ah, yes, dear friends.

280
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,640
The harvest.

281
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,540
There, okay, now it's...

282
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,740
45 minutes.

283
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,660
Q, night of slack shooting tape.

284
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,600
Oh, yeah, the 45-minute hour of slack intro.

285
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,480
Q, and then we'll only have to do 15 more minutes worth of this.

286
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,840
My friends, here you are.

287
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:00,900
Hello!

288
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,840
I'm...

289
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,220
Sir!

290
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,720
Hey!

291
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,820
We are not ready.

292
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:18,400
To tell the truth, Chaz, when the X-Stake moment came and it was 10 seconds to rupture,

293
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,720
you know what I really wanted more than anything?

294
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:20,720


295
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,420
Anything else?

296
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,020
I want to know.

297
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,000
To go to bed.

298
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,880
As soon as I was ruptured onto my escape vessel, I was just going to manifest a big bedroom,

299
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,720
not like the one at the end of 2001.

300
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,160
Wow.

301
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,320
And lay down and go to sleep.

302
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,180
You could watch yourself in a jar.

303
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,140
A little baby had you look just like a little baby in 2001, and you could watch yourself

304
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,040
in a jar as you...

305
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,900
I'd watch myself grow a new body.

306
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,340
I'd lay in my old tired one and watch a new one grow.

307
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,720
And you could hallucinate about it.

308
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:50,720


309
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:50,720


310
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:50,720


311
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:50,720


312
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:50,720


313
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:50,720


314
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:50,720


315
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:50,720


316
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:50,720


317
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,860
I'd watch myself down and watch you grow.

318
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,160
A baby could never get to slump because you your soul isしょ interlocked with its body.

319
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,280
If you were supposed to go to bed on a thin grass blanket, you would hang on to a piece

320
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,940
of sea wirklich fast.

321
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,900
Maybe you should get laid first and not show it to someone else.

322
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,360
Your soul has gone backwards.

323
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,520
That was an episode I couldn't finish but you already played it.

324
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:11,520


325
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,320
I said, let me turn with him.

326
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,740
You're mogues.

327
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,700
You've been around to cause violence with the UFO.

328
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,600
Could you bring me my life?

329
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,180
pleasure starship?

330
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,560
Are you one of the

331
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,500
frightened? Do you know

332
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,480
the law? Do you know

333
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,160
the laws of planetary

334
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,920
motion?

335
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,200
Are you one of the

336
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,920
disappeared?

337
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,920
Children,

338
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,320
build your own

339
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,040
ships.

340
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,220
Ha ha ha ha ha!

341
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,900
Ha ha ha ha ha!

342
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,500
Uh, yes, thank you

343
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,240
Chaz, because

344
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,140
as Kenneth

345
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,180
Starr,

346
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,160
the Starr, uh, the Starr

347
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,240
man, said

348
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,120
on 60 Minutes with

349
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,200
Diane Sawyer in 1987,

350
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,960
public media

351
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,240
should not contain

352
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,160
explicit or implied descriptions

353
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,100
of sex

354
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,360
acts.

355
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,740
Our society should be

356
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,040
purged of the

357
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,620
perverts who provide

358
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,240
the media with pornographic

359
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,680
material while pretending

360
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,280
it has some

361
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,440
redeeming social value

362
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,940
under the public's

363
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,520
right to

364
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,080
know.

365
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,940
Pornography

366
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,200
is pornography

367
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,000
regardless

368
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,740
of the source.

369
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:45,900
Again,

370
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,640
that was

371
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,820
Kenneth Starr in

372
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,800
1980.

373
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,980
In 1887, on an interview

374
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,600
with Diane Sawyer,

375
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,020
thank you.

376
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,540
Speaking of songs,

377
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,520
I've got a song here

378
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,540
based on a chapter

379
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,800
from the Apocryphon.

380
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,060
Who played that, Chaz?

381
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,180
Would you like to hear it?

382
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,200
Well, yeah, but we don't

383
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,420
really want to believe in Jesus.

384
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,100
We wanted to know.

385
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,360
Wait a minute, which chapter?

386
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,860
Uh, there's only one sin.

387
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,060
I had a feeling that

388
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,180
a population with a

389
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,020
monster population

390
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,840
would be that bad.

391
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,080
Adultery with an adult tree.

392
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,640
There you go.

393
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,100
All right.

394
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,060
You can sing along if you want.

395
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,820
It's not too bad.

396
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,840
It's a song about

397
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,020
adultery with an adult tree.

398
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,860
It's kind of bassy.

399
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,740
I got to EQ it.

400
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,300
Oh, wow.

401
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,440
Sounds great on the song.

402
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,960
Yeah, it's kind of like for,

403
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,160
you know.

404
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,040
Chaz, I have to pull

405
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,620
the bass down

406
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,720
to make it not

407
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,620
sort of .

408
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,140
That's real bassy.

409
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,760
People, what do you say?

410
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,520
Devolving into

411
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,780
little fat lumps of clay.

412
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:47,560
Ha ha.

413
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,440
Hey.

414
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,900
The TV

415
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,140
is calling.

416
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,600
Please don't go away.

417
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,520
The children are bawling.

418
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,660
But you can't go out and play.

419
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,540
There's only one sin handed down

420
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,540
from above.

421
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,200
People dying in guilt instead of

422
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,440
living in love.

423
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,020
People, where are you going?

424
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,960
On each Sunday morn.

425
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,820
While you pray to your monster.

426
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,620
The kids are home watching porn.

427
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,420
And do they really see?

428
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,120
Yon rose crowns of thorns.

429
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,720
That the mall that they're building.

430
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,700
Is where my red brother was.

431
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:49,880


432
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,320
I'm just going to go to the

433
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,320


434
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,320
There's only one sin.

435
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,880
You've got to get a

436
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,060
.

437
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:56,960
.

438
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,000
Handed down from above.

439
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,000
That's the hook line.

440
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,380
People dying in guilt.

441
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,120
Instead of living in love.

442
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:07,900
Yeah.

443
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,280
There's only one sin.

444
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,040
There's only one sin, child.

445
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
Handed down from above.

446
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,800
It's handed down from above,

447
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,940
from the mountain top.

448
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,320
Yeah.

449
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,980
People dying in guilt.

450
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,200
People dying in guilt.

451
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,860
Yeah.

452
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,840
Instead of living in love.

453
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,660
It's actually a Timothy Leary line there.

454
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,260
People dying in guilt.

455
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,980
Instead of living in rub.

456
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,960
People dying in guilt.

457
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,700
I got too much time on my hands.

458
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,220
.

459
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,900
Instead of living in love.

460
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,600
That's beautiful.

461
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,280
Wow.

462
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,160
The problem is I don't have too much time on my hands,

463
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,820
but I sit up until 4 in the morning working on this silliness.

464
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,740
Well, but wasn't that a Perry Como hit?

465
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:49,860
Yeah.

466
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:49,860


467
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:49,860


468
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:49,960
What?

469
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,160
Oh, I, um, um, what, that song itself?

470
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,580
Yeah.

471
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,900
That's, I'm, I'm sure that I, I remember, uh, Perry Como singing that on TV when I was a

472
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,200
kid.

473
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:58,840
Yeah, me too.

474
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,780
With those, with those words?

475
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,340
Yeah.

476
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:00,640
Yeah.

477
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,000
Really?

478
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,180
Well, maybe it got sewn into my, what year would that have been?

479
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,220
That would be, uh, 57.

480
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,700
Oh, actually the early 60s, I guess.

481
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,220
Yeah, like 62.

482
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:07,860
Yeah.

483
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,040
I'm, I'm, yeah, I may have been plopped in front of a TV at that point and it could have

484
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,200
gotten in then and maybe not.

485
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,520
Yeah, he sang, he was talking about child masturbation there on the, on the, when he

486
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,560
sang on Ed Sullivan.

487
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,440
Yeah, it was the first time they showed actual.

488
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,560
Well, he also said he got that from Bob's, uh, teaching.

489
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,900
It was the first time they showed live masturbation on the Ed Sullivan show.

490
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,120
Yeah, they didn't do it again after that either.

491
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,180
No, I guess, I guess, yeah, that was like the first and last time, wasn't it?

492
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,040
They sold it, yeah.

493
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:33,780
Yeah.

494
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,820
The big, uh, Vaseline, uh, ad campaign going on then.

495
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,480
Right, right.

496
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,080
That was something to do with.

497
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,040
That was no, that was Wildwood's, you know, people don't remember that.

498
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,420
I mean, that was a big scandal, the whole Perry Como child masturbation thing.

499
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,080
Well, he was a barber, remember?

500
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,540
He was a barber.

501
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,840
He was originally a barber, and that's how he got involved with Vaseline.

502
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,080
Oh, right, right.

503
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,720
He was, he was.

504
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,920
Oh, well, you remember in, in like, about the time I was in fifth grade, there was this

505
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,020
little song going around, Perry Como was a homo, and he ran through this land.

506
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,660
Remember that?

507
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,220
Oh, yeah.

508
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:01,380
Oh, yeah.

509
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,900
I mean, I'll sing that from Brooklyn to, uh.

510
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,460
Well, yeah, but we had a different melody.

511
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,860
It's Perry Como was a homo, and he ran through the land, and he, da, da, da, da, and he,

512
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,900
da, in his hand.

513
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,160
Something about, something about, and if you don't, you know, it's sort of like a boogeyman

514
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,520
thing.

515
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,740
Pulled up the train, and he's.

516
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:15,840
Yeah.

517
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,440
If you go out tonight, kids.

518
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,540
We had a good one.

519
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,260
Perry Como might be there.

520
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,660
Yeah.

521
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,360
So watch out.

522
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,180
We had a good one about, uh, Davy Crockett.

523
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,960
Well, I can't sing it on the air.

524
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,840
Yeah, same here.

525
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,720
We had, we had several about Davy Crockett and the Alamo.

526
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,640
Yeah.

527
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,980
Actually, you know, I was always interested in, in the actual evolution of, of the Miss

528
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,660
Lucy song.

529
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,540
Like, when did people first start singing Miss Lucy?

530
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,120
All they ever did around me was going, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're a real blank up, yeah,

531
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,000
yeah, yeah, you're.

532
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,820
No, no, no, no, it was like, uh, Miss, Miss Lucy.

533
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:45,820


534
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:45,820


535
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:45,820


536
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:45,820


537
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:45,820


538
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:45,820


539
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:45,820


540
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,240
Miss Lucy had a steamboat, the steamboat had a bell.

541
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,340
Miss Lucy had a head, uh, had, uh, went to heaven, and the steamboat went to hello operator.

542
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,080
Ding, ding.

543
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,200
Please give me number nine.

544
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,740
And if you disconnect me, I will kick in your behind the frigerator.

545
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,120
There is a piece of glass.

546
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,260
Uh, Miss Lucy sat upon it, and it stuck into her.

547
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,420
Ask me no more questions.

548
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,800
Tell me no more lies.

549
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,580
The boys are in the bathroom, and they're pulling down their flies.

550
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,400
They're in the pantry.

551
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,780
Bees are in the park.

552
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,240
The boys and girls are kissing in the D-A-R-K.

553
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:13,940
Dark, dark, dark.

554
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,460
That was like.

555
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:15,720
Wow.

556
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,520
Man, that's pretty, uh, I thought we were about to get bleeped every other line.

557
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,940
I thought bleepo was gonna get bleeped.

558
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,700
No, it was all clean.

559
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,000
It was all FCC approved.

560
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,760
That's, that's an okay song to sing now.

561
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,960
On flats and slats.

562
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,180
How?

563
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,480
And some seemingly left to die or to dive in to another existence because.

564
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,440
So far the reading has not been positive.

565
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,640
So friends, it is tricky sometimes to, uh, to get by with the FCC.

566
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,480
You know, they're, they're picky about certain things, and, and we like to be tricky, tricky

567
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,660
about other things.

568
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,720
Because, you know, happy.

569
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:45,800
Happy.

570
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:45,920
Happy.

571
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:45,920


572
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:45,920


573
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:45,920


574
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:45,920


575
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:45,920


576
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:45,920


577
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,780
Like if X day, if it, if it can't be X day, then we'll just have to make due with sex

578
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,260
day.

579
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,420
When they're not looking, well you're, cause you never know when they might just suddenly

580
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,280
decide to broadcast what, what they know about you.

581
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:11,620
I was reading this history of Russia and my friend, man, I can't believe how bad they

582
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,240
had it there.

583
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,720
It was almost worse than a science fiction.

584
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:24,080
movie. That novel 1984 that's actually based on Soviet Russia was actually soft peddling it,

585
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,140
if anything. It was like people would rat on their own friends just so they'd look good to the regime.

586
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:38,240
It was like an insane huge junior high run by peevish 12-year-old boys with whole armies at

587
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:46,280
their disposal, only they were really fat old men that could do anything to silence any opposition.

588
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:55,020
You see, if some opposition guy started to look good, they'd find some sexual peccadillo or whatnot,

589
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,440
trump that up, and suddenly have it splashed all over the secret police-controlled press, and

590
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,180
the whole time they'd be saying it was for the good of the state and the good of the children.

591
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,000
They were actually ultra-puritanical as far as laws and stuff,

592
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,960
you know, before the crash. But they'd always managed to provide tons of pornography to the

593
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:23,480
proles in the guise of stuff like, oh, take a close look at what this evil opposition Dumas guy

594
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,740
did with this young girl. Oh, shameful! Take a closer look so you can see how really, really

595
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,680
shameful it is. Look at these films we made of him right after they had just finished doing it.

596
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,480
And look, here she is right after the interrogation, crying about all those awful things.

597
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,100
He

598
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,100
made her do it. You know, if I lived in a country like that where the secret police

599
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:48,400
could be that blatant, you know what I'd do? I'd probably just keep my mouth shut and

600
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,100
not complain, because I'd be afraid it might be me next. And I'd probably just get in line

601
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,360
with all those other good citizens and start hollering along with them about how evil that

602
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,140
Goldstein guy is.

603
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:06,740
Ah, but friends, my lips are... Oh, whoa, whoa! My lips are still flapping, and my tapes...

604
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,080
My tapes are cracking.

605
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,580
That was F.I., by the way, not Helioscopium. Helioscopium is the name of the CD, and F.I.

606
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:26,260
is the name of the band at Box 93765, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53203. Anyway, friends, the...

607
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:34,080
Oh, what have I got here? It's a... Put the... Chazzit. Oh, the ESO X-Day jam in the background

608
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,060
here. Friends, my lips are flapping. Flapping and crapping. Oh, my lips are flapping. Oh,

609
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,180
boy, are they

610
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,180


611
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,540
Got to get talking, kids!

612
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,140
Simmon and Crackin'?

613
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:46,880
Because I'm recuperating from this third nostril repair surgery I had and snot amputation,

614
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,880
friends. It was supposed to cure my brain problem of vertigo.

615
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,560
And I've been on too many painkillers to do much work that requires brains, skill, talent,

616
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,620
or the barest modicum of technical know-how, but luckily, that doesn't preclude subgenius

617
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,860
audio and video editing, so...

618
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,040
It would be good, if you could if you could.

619
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,040


620
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,040


621
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,040


622
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,040


623
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,040


624
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,040


625
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:25,340
Even though I'm in the midst of this eight feet underwater haze of drugs and bandits changing, I managed to edit a mass, friends, of audio and videotape from all the preaching and jamming that we did in the final months before the first end of the world.

626
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:40,820
But a couple of days ago, friends, the witch doctor removed the cerebronasal splints and took a pair of pliers and yanked from my right nostril a plastic tube the size of a child's finger.

627
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:52,440
And from my left nostril, he withdrew with great effort a thick plastic semicircular plate about two and a half inches long and an inch high.

628
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,240
Those objects had been inside.

629
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,360
My head for the last week.

630
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:07,320
Those and gore and ever oozing font of thick black congealed blood, my friends.

631
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:18,140
And this black blood is still oozing, but it runs down the back of my throat now instead of into the gauze pad, which is strapped onto my nose even as I speak now.

632
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:25,040
Yesterday, I woke up puking up all the black ichor and the bitter.

633
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:32,640
Well, let's not go there, friends, but praise Bob.

634
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,120
I can snort again.

635
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,100
I can snort again.

636
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,780
Friends, the new Stark Fist of Removal magazine went to the printers.

637
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:49,300
Praise Jesus Christ and all who have worked on that, Craig Mitchell and so on.

638
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,220
And it includes catalog pictures of our new line, an incredible new line of subgenius wear t-shirts.

639
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:00,240
And you'll ape when you shirt these shirts out of you, my friends, as Jesus said.

640
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,720
So, okay, okay.

641
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,740
Well, you guys are sick, you know, like you already said before.

642
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,260
No, man, we're just a reflection of what of society.

643
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,320
You have to cover it with your moon pants.

644
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,620
Yeah, we're a reflection of the moon pants of society around us.

645
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,500
Cover it with your moon pants.

646
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,460
I like the little dighty moon pants the best.

647
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,660
Yes, seekers.

648
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,780
Yes, seekers.

649
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,720
If you were really cool, you'd wear great big, huge moon pants.

650
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,320
They're like, and what are moon pants, you ask?

651
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,540
They're the pants like the astronauts wear on the moon with great big diapers.

652
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:46,260
So you can just lean back and just float and just let go.

653
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
And fill up the whole space suit.

654
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,460
And your underwear is liquid cooled.

655
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,280
Speak about underwear and all.

656
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,080
What are moon pies?

657
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,180
That is an old southern delicacy.

658
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,000
That actually comes out of an astronaut's underwear.

659
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,700
Moon pies.

660
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:05,560
Well, I ground up the moon pies and crammed them into the Coke bottles and shook it up and then drank it.

661
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
That's what I did.

662
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,880
There goes your esophagus.

663
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,680
There goes your bowel.

664
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,200
There goes.

665
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,460
Yeah, well.

666
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:23,580
I'd rather drink the sperm from one of your sequels outside the window than drink that drink, whatever you're talking about.

667
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,000
Now, what?

668
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,620
The important thing is that you're not drunk.

669
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,740
All right.

670
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:53,620
Well, I think that's correct.

671
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,320
I mean, aren't you unnecessarily confident, like?

672
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,780
unknown, led by a man who, for all I knew, was mad.

673
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,200
A second door, located in the outer shell of the

674
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,160
knot of a slid back, and in another moment, I was treading the floor of the

675
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,100
ocean. Oh, my dear friends, how can I describe the sight

676
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,020
that met my eyes? A fantastic dream? No, more like

677
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,420
an emotion. Yes, an emotion, that's it.

678
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,140
I moved through unbelievable beauty, no longer feeling the drag of

679
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,780
my clothing and weighted shoes. The water acted like a prism

680
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,840
for the early morning sun, so that we walked in the radiance of the

681
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,560
seven solar colors. The Navy has been recording

682
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,440
the ocean for sonar reasons for hundreds of years.

683
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,900
And you can play those tapes back, and the sounds

684
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,820
inside the ocean, when played back at like four or five

685
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,040
times normal speed, it sounds just like a forest.

686
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,960
The fish and the whales.

687
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,640
Chirp and whistle and

688
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,800
the sound that comes off of the underwater trees

689
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,700
and so forth. And the nuclear submarine.

690
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,860
Superior mutants,

691
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,440
repent, quit your job, slack off.

692
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,980
The world ends tomorrow.

693
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,260
And you may die.

694
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,060
Well, no, probably not. But whatever you do, just keep listening.

695
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,580
The end times is here.

696
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,240
You're pretty bad.

697
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,220
At last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

698
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,920
This is it. The only faith that promises

699
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,780
action, thrills, success in sex and business.

700
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,180
Having all the guilt, but none of the sex.

701
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,640
I did not put you here to suffer.

702
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,400
No, I did not put you here to whine.

703
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,740
I put you here to love one another.

704
00:30:59,880 --> 00:30:59,900
Yes!

705
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,940
And did I have a good time now, now, now?

706
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,980
Let my people go, go, go.

707
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

708
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,660
Let my people go, go, go.

709
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,520
Hey, you gotta, oh, you gotta.

710
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,320
Let my people go, go, go.

711
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,040
You gotta let my people go, go, go.

712
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,860
Or they're destroyed.

713
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,300
Are we controlled by secret forces?

714
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,440
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

715
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,720
Do people think you're strange?

716
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,180
Do you?

717
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,720
Then you may be on the right track.

718
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,440
Are you abnormal?

719
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,220
Then you are probably better than most people.

720
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,200
Yes, your time shall triumph.

721
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,620
See, the more you get going on here,

722
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,620
the more you get going on here, the more you get going on here.

723
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
That's a New Orleans accent.

724
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,920
Could I not hear that?

725
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,080
That's really driving me crazy.

726
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,760
.

727
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,240
.

728
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,720
.

729
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:07,720


730
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,600
.

731
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,460
.

732
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:15,460


733
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:15,640
.

734
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,660
.

735
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:20,740
. . . .

736
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,260
. . . . . . . . . . . .

737
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,120
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

738
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,660
.

739
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,780
A partially obstructed license plate and some tests you got.

740
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,860
I like a partially obstructed face in the back of my hand.

741
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,420
So he asked me to step out of the vehicle.

742
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,320
And lo and behold, there's a canine unit right there.

743
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,900
Coincidence? I think not.

744
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,520
So they send the dog into my vehicle.

745
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,480
And he starts rooting around, sniffing at this.

746
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,220
And all of a sudden he stops.

747
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,240
And he looks at the cop.

748
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,140
And he looks at me.

749
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,600
And he says, whoops.

750
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,460
You want a piece of me?

751
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,580
You want a piece of me?

752
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,560
You want a piece of me?

753
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,500
Well, come on, dog.

754
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,640
You want a piece of me?

755
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,660
You want a piece of me?

756
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,760
You want a piece of me?

757
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,800
You want a piece of me?

758
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,160
I'll kick your little canine butt over this freeway.

759
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,820
You may make more money with me, but you're still a dog.

760
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,440
So, upon the suggestion of this dog,

761
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,440
the police just start tearing apart our entire vehicle.

762
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,840
Just going through everything, showing no regard,

763
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,220
looking for something that's just not there.

764
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,560
You see, they had apparently mistaken me for some kind of a drug dealer.

765
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,820
Running drugs up and down I-71,

766
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,320
giving drugs to all of Ohio.

767
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,920
But that's not me.

768
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,100
And that's not the people that I run with.

769
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,320
And slowly, I think the police were starting to realize that I'm one of the good guys.

770
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,520
That I care about people, and this country, and for what it stands for.

771
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,780
And then they found my ball.

772
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,360
So this cop gets right back in my face.

773
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,460
He's like, what's this, huh?

774
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,560
What's this, sonny?

775
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,040
I thought you told me you didn't have any.

776
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,860
Why'd you lie to me?

777
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,880
Why'd you lie to me?

778
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,260
I'm like, wait a minute, man.

779
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:13,800
I told you I didn't have any.

780
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:13,800


781
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,120
Father pleasures studying are 13-10 states.

782
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,920
I never lied to you.

783
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,440
I told you I didn't have any.

784
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,580
I never, like, told you I never, ever smoked any.

785
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,900
Besides, there's nothing in there.

786
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,640
I scraped it myself.

787
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,040
You want a piece of me, you want to piece of me?

788
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,080
You want a piece of me?

789
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:24,860
Well, come on, cop.

790
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,140
You want a piece of me?

791
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,160
You want a piece of me?

792
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,240
You want a piece of me?

793
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,340
You want a piece of me?

794
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,260
Come on, man.

795
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,460
You want a piece of me?

796
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
You want a piece of me?

797
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,500
You want a piece of me?

798
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,380
Can't let a galaaa dig inside myosaic.

799
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,400
This is just unhealthy.

800
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,460
It's opened, objection is esque.

801
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,800
You give a little girl the call, and a girl's a faggot.

802
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,340
I was just glad about this time.

803
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,540
This cop actually expects me to thank him for letting me go.

804
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,320
After judging me.

805
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,400
Thank you, officer. Have a nice day.

806
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,780
It oozes like a farm-fresh prairie squid on a hot, slick platter.

807
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,880
If you buy one, you get one free.

808
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,600
Big money, fast luck.

809
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,840
All yours for only a buck.

810
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,320
It's so cute and cuddly,

811
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,860
it can smash a cow's skull with a single swipe.

812
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,240
UFOs surround you constantly.

813
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,020
Constantly breaking the tolerance barrier.

814
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,300
UFOs surround you constantly.

815
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:22,220
And the problem occurs out of theresent.

816
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,200
The epidemic has become a more obviousrhpsw sociedade,

00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,260
pakai a pl perishagpera.

818
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:24,300


819
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,040
Wake up and smell a sodium pentothal.

820
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,080
Sit still

821
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,700
Stop thinking.

822
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,920
Shut up!

823
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,000
Get out.

824
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,200
I am yesterday, today, tomorrow.

825
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,800
All things are one in Yotzefala.

826
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,620
Buy an egg without haggling.

827
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,140
Surgical operations and dancing girls

828
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,760
are fruitful fields for the beginner.

829
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,500
There are bewitchments galore at your local store.

830
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,680
Bewitchments galore at your local store.

831
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,680
Bewitchments galore.

832
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,500
But you tried everything.

833
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,340
You ain't seen nothing yet.

834
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,020
Learn to think big.

835
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,060
Develop the tricks of length extension.

836
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,900
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

837
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,820
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

838
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,040
Get sacked and fall a cane every day.

839
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,200
The student of Dobbs' training is practically forced

840
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,400
to bring his strangest desires into rampaging life.

841
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,040
I used to get embarrassed about my glass madness.

842
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,800
Now I get paid.

843
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,120
The pinks pay me for that.

844
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,220
They pay me fabulous sums of money

845
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,320
for what they used to put me in jail for.

846
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,040
Thanks to Bob.

847
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,120
Dobbs is seen to it that he exercises this abnormality.

848
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,780
To do otherwise, he teaches,

849
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,660
would be nothing short of spiritual suicide.

850
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,740
This just in.

851
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,080
Three astronauts of the ill-fated Mars mission X

852
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,680
are hopelessly adrift.

853
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,180
The explosion in their primary fuel tank

854
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,820
has put them on a trajectory out of the solar system.

855
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,800
We now join the Capcom coverage in progress.

856
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,860
It looks like...

857
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,820
The wires are gonna break.

858
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,740
Make sure you don't break the wiring there.

859
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,120
It's very tender stuff.

860
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
They don't use a lot of...

861
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,360
It looks like any of the pictures, though.

862
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,600
Spin them around.

863
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,580
Oh, there.

864
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:05,700
There.

865
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,120
There.

866
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,640
There.

867
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,760
It looks kinda like that one there.

868
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,380
Now that looks like...

869
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,320
I can make that out almost.

870
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:10,860
It's yellow.

871
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,560
Why is it yellow?

872
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,440
It's okay.

873
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,500
It looks red.

874
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,600
Why is it red?

875
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,280
Why is that?

876
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,340
It means it's infected.

877
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,800
It's red?

878
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,380
It's yellow.

879
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,860
Am I seeing the wrong thing or right or what?

880
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,200
But it's breathing normally.

881
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,060
I don't think it's infected.

882
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,000
I think it's from another species.

883
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,800
My gosh, man.

884
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,740
Are we seeing the same thing?

885
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,540
Mine's like yellow and it's breathing like something.

886
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,300
Your future's slightly different from my future

887
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,600
because you're over there and I'm over here.

888
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,200
So you're all red but you're breathing normally.

889
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,920
I'm yellow but I'm breathing fast.

890
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:39,840
Right.

891
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,500
So like over here, if a bird flaps its wings in Brazil,

892
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,480
it affects you.

893
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,200
Over where you are, like a bird has to flap its wings in Brazil

894
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,700
for it to affect you.

895
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,260
Mob is a way of life to millions,

896
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,700
yet half of them don't even know it.

897
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,320
He's the one true living slack master

898
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,980
with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through

899
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,580
the locked doorway to find the truth.

900
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,940
In financial heaven, he is the one real shortcut to slack.

901
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,100
I'm tired.

902
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,200
You see, there's this little nine-year-old boy in Florida

903
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,580
who has a terminal illness and his last dying wish

904
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,980
is to be remembered in the Guinness Book of Records

905
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,020
for being the recipient of the most greeting cards

906
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,880
in the whole world.

907
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,620
And I was out collecting greeting cards

908
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,920
for my little buddy Jimmy and it was getting dark

909
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,080
and this car came towards me that didn't have its lights on.

910
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,260
So I flashed my headlights at them

911
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,500
and the next thing I knew, my windshield was shattering,

912
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,040
my back glass was shattering,

913
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,940
and my car came to a complete stop.

914
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,600
Turns out, there's this gang that has an initiation

915
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,620
where they ride around with their lights out

916
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,100
and when someone flashes their headlights on and off at them,

917
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,980
they shoot them.

918
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,740
Well, they managed to put a couple slugs into my engine block,

919
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,100
so the next day I was reading the want ads,

920
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,440
and there I saw it.

921
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,360
1965 Chevy, $250.

922
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,700
And I said to myself,

923
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,900
well, that might just be able to get me down to Florida

924
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,640
so I could deliver the thousands of greeting cards

925
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,000
to my little buddy Jimmy so he could fulfill his dying wish

926
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,260
and be remembered in the Guinness Book of Records

927
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,760
for being the recipient of the most greeting cards

928
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,720
in the whole world.

929
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,720
So I called my friend and asked him to drive out

930
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,420
and look at the 1965 Chevy.

931
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,180
He said he'd come right over,

932
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,580
and I started watching the Phil Donahue show,

933
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,420
and they had the president of a large corporation.

934
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,820
I won't say which one.

935
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,540
Don't ask me which one it was,

936
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,420
because I'm not going to tell you.

937
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,800
But they had the president of a large corporation on there

938
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,180
saying his company's profits were being used to build satanic churches.

939
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,200
Well, my friend honked his horn,

940
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,420
and I told him I wasn't leaving until I threw out all my cake mix,

941
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,700
and I took about ten minutes to throw out my satanic cake mix,

942
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,080
and I wish I would have waited for him.

943
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,360
I was just so sad because when we finally arrived

944
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,360
at that place where the 1965 Chevy was advertised,

945
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,580
we saw a 1965 cherry red Corvette in mint condition

946
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,720
pulling out of the driveway.

947
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,720
So we asked the little old lady if the 1965 Chevy was still for sale,

948
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,140
and she said she just sold it to a fellow who stopped by five minutes ago,

949
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,720
and he drove it out of the driveway just as we pulled in.

950
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,700
Well, I was feeling pretty sad,

951
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,040
having just missed out on a brand new 1965 Corvette,

952
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,980
for $250,

953
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,060
and I was wondering how I was going to get my greeting cards down to Florida

954
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,540
for my little buddy Jimmy,

955
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,540
so he could fulfill his dying wish

956
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,660
and be remembered in the Guinness Book of Records

957
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,840
as the recipient of the most greeting cards in the whole world.

958
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,060
And we were driving back home on the highway,

959
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,840
and we saw this car that had something on the roof.

960
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,100
Well, we got a little closer and saw that it was a baby in a baby carrier.

961
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,120
So we pulled up alongside this man and woman and said,

962
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,200
Hey, you got a baby on your roof.

963
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,980
And they looked at us, and they looked at each other,

964
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,200
and they looked at us, and pulled over to the side of the road.

965
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,300
Turns out this young couple were on vacation with their baby

966
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,940
when they got a call from home,

967
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,040
so they turned right around and drove and drove and drove.

968
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,140
And they had the baby sitting between them,

969
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,860
and when the man got tired of driving,

970
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,780
he pulled over to the side of the highway and they switched drivers.

971
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,460
But when they did, the man put the baby on the roof

972
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,680
so his wife could just slide over,

973
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,940
and then he ran around to the passenger side and climbed in,

974
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,520
and they took off and forgot about the baby on the roof.

975
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,780
They said the reason they were in such a hurry to get home

976
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,340
was that someone called and told them about a Corvette that was on sale for $75,

977
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,440
and they were so grateful for telling them about the baby

978
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,460
that they would just give us the address of the woman selling the Corvette,

979
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,580
and from then on they'd start thinking more about their baby

980
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,860
and start thinking less about Corvettes.

981
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,880
So we were all set to look at the Corvette,

982
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,060
but we had to run by the drugstore

983
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,960
so my friend could get his pictures of his Jamaican vacation.

984
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,480
So he picked up his pictures,

985
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,720
and the funny thing about those pictures,

986
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,560
my friend and three of his buddies were vacationing in Jamaica,

987
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,360
so one day they went down to the beach,

988
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,340
and when they got back to their hotel room,

989
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,460
everything was gone except their toothbrushes and my friend's camera.

990
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,840
Well, they felt fortunate enough,

991
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:34,320
at the time, because at least they could brush their teeth while they were in Jamaica,

992
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,020
but when my friend got his film developed,

993
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:44,480
there was this one picture of a fat Jamaican's rear end bending over for the camera

994
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,640
with four toothbrush handles sticking out of it.

995
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,660
I felt bad for my friend, but we couldn't linger on it,

996
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,880
because as soon as we got to his house,

997
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,540
there was his Rottweiler with a dead rabbit at his feet.

998
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,420
We got out of the car and looked at it,

999
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,200
and it was his next door neighbor's prized Belgian hair.

1000
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,440
Well, we couldn't have his neighbor lady coming down hard on my friend's Rottweiler,

1001
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,220
because she was this old crazy woman with a beehive haircut,

1002
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,260
and you don't ever know what someone with a beehive haircut might do,

1003
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,740
because if they're crazy enough to get a beehive haircut,

1004
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,920
then they're crazy enough to do just about anything.

1005
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,380
So we took the rabbit inside and washed the mud off of it

1006
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,960
and blow dried it and propped it up in his cage,

1007
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,660
just as his neighbor lady was pulling in the drive.

1008
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,540
We sneaked away before she could see us and went back to my friend's house

1009
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,280
when we heard an ungodly scream coming from his neighbor lady's yard.

1010
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,540
We ran over to her house, and his neighbor lady was in tears,

1011
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:49,180
so we asked what's the matter, and she said she buried her rabbit just that morning,

1012
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,760
and some sicko had gone and dug it up and put it back in its cage.

1013
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,940
Where I rode, I saw a rabbit.

1014
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,360
I rushed my friend along before some other lucky sucker came by

1015
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,740
and bought another Corvette before I could get my hands on it.

1016
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,460
So we rushed over to where a woman was selling a chartreuse Corvette

1017
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,020
with pink racing stripes for $75.

1018
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:16,000
Friends, does that tape make you feel like you're going completely insane?

1019
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,040
Like you're going mad?

1020
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,960
Well, we've been playing stuff from

1021
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,200
Oh Hither and Yon.

1022
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,860
Obviously, I finally started playing tapes that people have been sending in.

1023
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,640
Let's see. We started with, on this side, with Mandala,

1024
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:38,860
that heavy, heavy song, Piece of Me.

1025
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,120
You want a piece of me?

1026
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,840
That was Mandala, a Cleveland band that I don't know at all.

1027
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,060
I don't even know where that tape came from, if they mailed it to us or what.

1028
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,100
Here's their address.

1029
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,100
P.O. Box 470.

1030
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,700
441 Cleveland, Ohio.

1031
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,460
44147.

1032
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,200
There was that song, Prairie Squid.

1033
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,620
Well, it wasn't exactly a song. It was sort of talking over a thing.

1034
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,940
That's a mysterious tape.

1035
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:20,540
It's a tape from something called Likewise in Tacoma, Washington.

1036
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,780
It was all lines.

1037
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,860
Mostly lines.

1038
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:23,940


1039
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,860
It's from Book of the Subgenius.

1040
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:33,620
I've been running a lot of Media Barrage stuff from the old Hour of Slack 79 work tape.

1041
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,240
A lot of Media Barrage 10's intro barrage.

1042
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:41,140
And of course, Einstein's Secret Orchestra radio.

1043
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,500
Quite a bit of Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1044
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,580
And that very last thing, Urban Legends,

1045
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,740
is from a tape called Frank Tyro, Unplugged.

1046
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,360
And that's all I know about that one, too, friends.

1047
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,700
I don't know how much longer that set of Urban Legends goes on.

1048
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:05,020
But now we know who all those legendary things happened to.

1049
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,360
Let's go back to this Prairie Squid song, which continues.

1050
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:10,820
Bored.

1051
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:14,900
Confused.

1052
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:16,740
Lonely.

1053
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,380
Weird.

1054
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,260
Your clandestiny can be changed.

1055
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,340
It's cheap at any price.

1056
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,880
Learn incredible truths at bargain prices.

1057
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:40,020
Or continue to gallivant, lollygag, and spend money senselessly.

1058
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,420
Bob.

1059
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:43,980
Bob.

1060
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,060
Bob.

1061
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:45,900
Bob.

1062
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,340
Bob.

1063
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:46,560
Bob.

1064
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,060
Let figure off.

1065
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,400
They'll be choking on our dust come morning.

1066
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,800
You fools, both of you.

1067
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,720
You're being used, don't you see?

1068
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,560
As Pastor Buyer Smith here is taking up the slack.

1069
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,560
Oh, you want slack?

1070
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,700
I'll give you slack.

1071
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,280
You're not putting me out for Pastorello, I quit.

1072
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,820
Consider this my resignation.

1073
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,480
Effected immediately.

1074
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:06,600
Cling, scodka.

1075
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,440
I'm a free man.

1076
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,400
I'm a free man.

1077
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,440
Have you heard?

1078
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,660
It's in style.

1079
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,440
The original words are still true.

1080
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:15,780
Black.

1081
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,220
Black, black.

1082
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:16,320
Black, black.

1083
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:16,320


1084
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,540
Next July we collide with Mars!

1085
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:22,240
The world ends this July 5th.

1086
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,740
Well, did you ever?

1087
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:31,680
Did you ever see a dream walking?

1088
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,600
I did.

1089
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:39,260
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

1090
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,500
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

1091
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,280
Become physically attractive overnight.

1092
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,680
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

1093
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:56,520
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior

1094
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,500
to explore new ways of going over the edge.

1095
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,460
My name is Onan Canabite.

1096
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,160
Between 1982 and 1998,

1097
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,260
I was a member of the Church of the Seventh,

1098
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:15,940
a subgenius.

1099
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:20,180
I organized subgenius resistance cells

1100
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,900
among my family, friends, and coworkers.

1101
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,300
I distributed subgenius literature

1102
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,860
and redirected community resources

1103
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,140
to the Subgenius Foundation.

1104
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,960
But since my enrollment in the human re-education camp,

1105
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,760
I have seen the error of my ways.

1106
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:55,140
I have made this recording of my own free will

1107
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:01,940
to urge those few remaining subgeniuses to come forward.

1108
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,780
Our alien masters have kindly offered a general amnesty

1109
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:15,260
to all subgeniuses who entered their local human world.

1110
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,800
Our instructors seem to augment the effect of their educationinka

1111
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,320
into anнуть their 시작ling Stand.

1112
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,900
ôWeeds After renovations were started,

1113
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:19,900


1114
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:19,900


1115
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,620
The preemptive individuality to rails

1116
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:27,320
Those who attended the Reiem Order Center

1117
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,120
were expected to receive an additional ten percent

1118
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,200
which was predicted to be aام

1119
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:29,280
a reasonable half second pequeña

1120
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:29,280


1121
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,920
Ingeme after reHAHA.

1122
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,480
ufگ Behave as erabic we.

1123
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:40,760
Oh!

1124
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,620
Jesus.

1125
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,700
I have to live in a flyover zone.

1126
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,360
Open channel duty, please.

1127
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,360
Hey, Reverend Rockinghead.

1128
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,140
Yeah, Reverend Susie the Floozy here.

1129
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,960
Uh, yeah, I'm, uh...

1130
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,600
I'm experiencing some really weird phenomena here.

1131
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:14,200
Yeah, ha, ha, ha. I mean, really.

1132
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,520
It seems to be localized in my closet.

1133
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,720
I thought you and the lymph node institute techs

1134
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,840
might want to come on over with some equipment and take some readings.

1135
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:29,120
You know, I was just spending the afternoon running an inventory in my closet.

1136
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,940
You know how I'm clothing impaired,

1137
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,760
so I have to have everything all numbered and all,

1138
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,120
and...

1139
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,480
all of a sudden, I noticed something was out of the ordinary.

1140
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,780
I mean, up until a point, everything was fine.

1141
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,020
It was just hung perfectly.

1142
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,380
Yeah, ha, ha, ha.

1143
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,000
No, I mean, hanger after hanger,

1144
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,160
hanger one, hanger two, everything was perfect,

1145
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,420
all the way up to number 17.

1146
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,060
But when I got to the next one,

1147
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:02,020
my chupacabra-skin hot pants, remember that outfit?

1148
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,940
It was all covered with some sort of wadding.

1149
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,340
I mean, it was all just a weird, gooey ectoplasm.

1150
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,340
No!

1151
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,720
Reverend, you don't understand what I'm trying to tell you!

1152
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,200
Something is seriously wrong with hanger 18!

1153
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,060
No, no, I don't watch the X-Files.

1154
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,140
At least not since I realized that it wasn't the triple X-Files.

1155
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,720
Hello?

1156
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:30,880
Hello?

1157
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:31,980
.

1158
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,960
We've been cut off!

1159
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,560
I tell you, Seekers, it's...

1160
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:50,480
It's like it's some sort of conspiracy or something.

1161
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,960
We're not here to be loved

1162
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:01,960


1163
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,640
We're here to destroy

1164
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:08,180
We are here to imply

1165
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,080
And let the truth be known.

1166
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,020
Truth, a truth unlike the Roswell incident,

1167
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,440
Hanger 18, and so on and so forth.

1168
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,180
Bermuda Triangle stuff they have.

1169
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,320
And for the Philadelphia experiment,

1170
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,320
and on and on and on, it just goes on.

1171
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,300
And let the public know.

1172
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,680
If you're listening to your ham radio,

1173
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,160
or as they say, amateur radio,

1174
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,740
and you get some kind of strange signals on your radio,

1175
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,560
and you're turning them in, and you're tuning them in there,

1176
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,600
and you hear something that sounds a little something like this.

1177
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,340
Welcome, Seekers, to Bob's Slapdunk Funhouse.

1178
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,500
Now, if the FBI doesn't get you, or the FCC,

1179
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,520
the KGB surety.

1180
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,040
But anyway, that's what you do if you get there.

1181
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,600
No one would be stupid enough to believe that.

1182
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,280
A conspiracy bigger than the prophecies.

1183
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:20,340
The Bible says there is coming a world government at the end of the age.

1184
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,820
It'll last for three and a half years.

1185
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,040
It's going to be an absolute dictatorship,

1186
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,100
and it does not give the names,

1187
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,260
but we're watching world news.

1188
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,380
It's going to be through the United Nations organization.

1189
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:39,240
But how did this world government get its foundation?

1190
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,320
How did it begin?

1191
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,360
In 1776, a man by the name of Adam Weishaupt,

1192
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,260
that you see on the screen with me,

1193
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:52,220
founded the modern-day version of the Illuminati.

1194
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:56,520
Adam Weishaupt was a member of the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church,

1195
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,440
and the Pope suspended that order,

1196
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,400
because of atrocities and dealing in demonic activities,

1197
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,360
and witchcraft, and Satanism.

1198
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:10,180
This man believed in Lucifer as God and worshipped him.

1199
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,900
So Adam Weishaupt actually founded the modern-day Illuminati.

1200
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,580
Illuminati means illuminated ones.

1201
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,080
They were illuminated by Satan the devil.

1202
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,940
They preferred to call him Lucifer.

1203
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,940
And so the modern-day version of the Illuminati

1204
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:31,240
was founded May 1, 1776,

1205
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,080
approximately the same time

1206
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,440
when the United States of America was being formed.

1207
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,140
He put the accent on American,

1208
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,040
as opposed to the world socialist revolution

1209
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,480
now smothering the American people.

1210
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,200
The world communazi revolution, which, he reminded me,

1211
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,580
was launched in Germany May 1, 1776.

1212
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,840
From precisely the same post office box

1213
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,220
as the Church of the Subgenius.

1214
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,680
That post office box number which I am about to give.

1215
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,880
And that number is Bob.

1216
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,000
At post office box,

1217
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,000
140306,

1218
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:08,740
Dallas, Texas,

1219
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:12,660
75214.

1220
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,780
That's Bob at P.O. Box,

1221
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,340
140306,

1222
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,680
Dallas, Texas,

1223
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,260
75214.

1224
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:29,320
Ah, yes, and thank you, Susie the floozy,

1225
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,460
for that wonderful beginning barrage there

1226
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,320
on the Illuminati.

1227
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:38,440
Um, that was one of Bob's earliest experiments,

1228
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,300
of course.

1229
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,500
Which came first, you know, the chicken or the egg?

1230
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,960
Well, whichever one got across the road

1231
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,940
was the first into Bob's pocket.

1232
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,240
My friend, will you be the next into Bob's pocket?

1233
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,760
We'll find out next week.

1234
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,780
Dobbs Willie.

1235
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,940
Karl Marx was actually contracted by the Illuminati

1236
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,460
to update their program for world government.

1237
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,420
He put it in the form of the Communist Manifesto.

1238
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,320
It laid down their goals and their programs.

1239
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,680
A few of those goals was to have public education

1240
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,800
for all students,

1241
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,200
so that they would be able to propagandize

1242
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,420
and to socialize the mind of those individuals

1243
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,700
who attended those public schools.

1244
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:34,560
Growling a nation of television viewers into hysteria

1245
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,800
to sweep us up into the White House

1246
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,220
with powers that will make martial law seem like anarchy.

1247
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,380
Who controls the British crown?

1248
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,400
Who keeps the metric system down?

1249
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,380
We do.

1250
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,460
We do.

1251
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:55,580
Who links Atlantis off the maps?

1252
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,700
Who keeps the Martians under wraps?

1253
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,680
We do.

1254
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,220
We do.

1255
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:05,400
Who holds back the electric car?

1256
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,420
Who makes the Gutenberg a star?

1257
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,300
We do.

1258
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,120
We do.

1259
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,280
Who robs state bishops of their site?

1260
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,240
Who rigs every after night?

1261
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,780
We do.

1262
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,980
We do.

1263
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,140
We do.

1264
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,020
We do.

1265
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,980
So it is, international communism, socialism,

1266
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,360
under the control of the Illuminati,

1267
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,780
worshippers of Satan the devil.

1268
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,960
Flawless, soulless, spiritless, corporate little bitches,

1269
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,500
suckers of Satan .

1270
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:40,420
Suck it.

1271
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,740
It's only your dignity. Suck it.

1272
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,520
You have to breathe the smell.

1273
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,100
Well, there was no way I could buy that car,

1274
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,940
because I couldn't drive all the way down to Florida

1275
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,000
to deliver my greeting cards to my little buddy Jimmy,

1276
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,040
so that he could be remembered in the Guinness Book of Records

1277
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,800
as the recipient of the most greeting cards in the whole world,

1278
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,080
with my head out the window all the time.

1279
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,420
And we had to get going, because my friend works at the airport.

1280
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:11,180
And the day before, they had a package that came in from New York City,

1281
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,820
and it got crushed.

1282
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,880
And when they opened it up, they found a little black poodle inside.

1283
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:21,740
Well, my friend and his coworkers all felt bad,

1284
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,800
and my friend decided to make it up to the owner.
