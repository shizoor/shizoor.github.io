1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
From PR News in Washington, I'm kicking and screaming for golf outings.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,180
Inscreations, children cry, troops fines, growing dissent against President Bush's no-child law.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,580
One man says it's about time.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,720
Security police prison arrested, detained, on our king clerics, tribal suicide kidnappings.

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,320
Taking a look at figures on Wall Street, 2, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,340
This is PR.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:32,400
Inside a courtroom in Wichita, Kansas, protesting Jewish settlers took turns lashing out at PR News, Washington.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,080
Let's go to the Gigolo Club over in Yancey.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,500
They've got a...

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,100
Some genius, powerful, smart.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,400
I say this calls for action, and now, nip it in the bud.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,420
Ah, shut up.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,600
Here it is, kids.

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,760
Are you tired of being a square? Are you tired of a dull, dull, dull existence?

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,460
Well, for one dollar.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,280
The tenth pot of a sawbuck.

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,720
Try kelp's cool tonic.

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,300
The life of the party.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,160
He's right, kids. It's a gasser.

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,240
Step right up, folks. Be somebody. Be anybody.

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,140
Only trouble was, nobody got killed.

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,320
No, Mr. Boob, that's me.

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,560
B-double-O-B, Boob.

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,520
The reason for this hearing is to promote outrageous filth.

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,120
Pornography. It's outrageous filth.

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,240
So I'll be looking.

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey!

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,840
Weaver!

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,140
Starring Barbara the Weaver.

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,000
Something has just come up.

31
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,120
Oh, boy.

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,020
Ooh, get a kiss?

33
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,600
Sure.

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,340
Watch.

35
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,320
Hey, the ass is...

36
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,920
Oh, a little squircums.

37
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,160
To the dog.

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,960
And a squircum.

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,220
Yeah!

40
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,580
Oh, squircum fun.

41
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah.

42
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,600
Mom?

43
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,460
Oh.

44
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,440
Get over here.

45
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,520
Get over here.

46
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:54,900
Mom?

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,940
He's a local boy.

48
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,560
Uh, he's just terrific.

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,060
He's our new leader.

50
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,640
Leader?

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,380
He's like too much.

52
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,520
Like too much what?

53
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,640
He's one of the truly great swingers of all time.

54
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,840
We now present Bob, internationally known founder of Bob University.

55
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,860
Sitting down down down rising.

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,100
Up up up up.

57
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,700
You know, Filipino boy.

58
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,860
I always... I knew it. He's nice fella.

59
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,360
I had another talk with a young fella yesterday.

60
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,420
And... I knew it. He's nice fella. I had another talk with a young fella yesterday.

61
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,320
And as I probed him, I found out he could have, uh, fooled me.

62
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,380
He didn't know.

63
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,920
It's hard probing that and you get to pull things out.

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,940
Strange about people.

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,780
And, uh, you can think things.

66
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:45,740
Did you know it's the hardest thing in the world for a man in analyzing his own impulses to know what Filipino boy wants him to do?

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,860
Do the dang job.

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,760
Do the dang job.

69
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,980
Never leave it unfinished.

70
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,900
Don't walk out and leave an unfinished job.

71
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,800
Then...

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:52,980
Job.

73
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,380
And then, you know, I've learned a few other little things too.

74
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,520
You did his hard-on, Bob.

75
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,140
What?

76
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,860
Sounds good, doesn't it?

77
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,600
If you'll pay me a thousand dollars more, I'll be glad to come.

78
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,120
You know, a little chill went up and down my back.

79
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,740
Wait a minute.

80
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,540
You have just heard Bob, internationally known founder of Bob University.

81
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,100
This program is sponsored by Bob.

82
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,360
The history of sexuality is as long as the history of man.

83
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,960
From the glory that once was grown, sexuality has been both despised and idolized.

84
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,820
Though nothing new, sexuality is having an upsurge since the war.

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,900
Whether it is an actual increase or merely an increased public acceptance is a point to be argued.

86
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,400
One male out of six is sexual.

87
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,420
Sexuals no longer hide in shadows, giving secret signals of recognition to each other.

88
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:52,120
But rather, they have joined together into groups or clubs in an attempt to seek freedom.

89
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,840
...land July 5th, 1998, as it was so ordained in the pre-scripture.

90
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,860
Your name is not in the book of Job's pro-crime.

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,960
RAH!

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,440
The second ecclesiastikies, uh...

93
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,740
That's Bleeding Head Colossians 4, 1398.

94
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,220
For lo, the veil of Moab was lifted.

95
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,460
In the valley of Moab.

96
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,600
In the 80 million lambs of Moab.

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,920
In the 80 million tribes of Moab.

98
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,880
The Moabites.

99
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,060
Who bit that Moab?

100
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,380
Get that Moab out of your mouth, boy!

101
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,580
We got some lambs to slaughter here.

102
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,080
First you whip your dictionary out, then you put your Moab in your mouth.

103
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,260
Put your Moab on it, then you put those lambs on the altar, and you just slit them a little bit.

104
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,060
Right there underneath the throat.

105
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,740
The blood.

106
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,760
The bit of nickel comes out, the blood starts flowing down that...

107
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,020
GLA-CINE.

108
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,540
The blood.

109
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,580
The blood.

110
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,840
But it's the blood that cleanses.

111
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,480
It's the blood that makes things right.

112
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,040
It's the blood that provides the ultimate salvation to which you've attached yourself.

113
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,080
All these years.

114
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,640
It's the blood that we make that...

115
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,820
A special antidote for the...

116
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,120
You know, those bats that get on your face.

117
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,540
You know what they do to your face.

118
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,100
Special bats.

119
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,440
Just put your dictionary away now, children, and we'll tell you about the bats.

120
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,680
That book is kind of heavy.

121
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,160
It's a heavy book.

122
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,040
The frontal cerebral fornicating bat.

123
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,180
And the...

124
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,060
That's ejaculate.

125
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,220
We won't talk about them, no.

126
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,940
No, we can't.

127
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,160
We can't talk about them.

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,040
We can't get too specific about them.

129
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,040


130
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,060
We can't talk about what those bats do.

131
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,980
You may as well just stick your finger in a light socket.

132
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,020
But the Church of the Subgenius provides the only way...

133
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,980
Without the light bulb.

134
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:36,220
It provides the only proscribed and tested by time instructions for de-beaking the prairie

135
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,180
squid, which is all the practices that you'll need, children.

136
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,100
Yeah, I talked to my...

137
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,760
In order not to get...

138
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,480
...by those bats.

139
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,620
My step-neighbor-in-law, Porky, was telling me that story one time about Moab.

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,420
And he was...

141
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,040
Well, I hate to tell you this, but he was...

142
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


143
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


144
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


145
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


146
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


147
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


148
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


149
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


150
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


151
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


152
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


153
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,040


154
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,320
I hate to say this, but Porky didn't say no.

155
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,180
He forgot to say no.

156
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,700
So he was not in the state of mind he might have been in other lives.

157
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,980
He had launched ahead in years.

158
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,380
He had launched ahead in...

159
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,020
Oh, Lord knows how long.

160
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,360
He'd never been in a doctor van.

161
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,200
Yeah, he never realized the glories of doctors and priests and bats, accordingly.

162
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,520
He'd never...

163
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
His own...

164
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,560
Ever.

165
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,740
Boy, that's...

166
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,140
Willa Dobbins is quick on that.

167
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,020
Oh, sorry.

168
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,020


169
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,020


170
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,020


171
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,020


172
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,020


173
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,020


174
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,020


175
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,020


176
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,340
Yeah.

177
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,180
I knew who was coming down tonight.

178
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,480
Will.

179
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:34,860
Well, that was Willa Dobbs, friends, guest hosting on an ancient subgenius radio show

180
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,360
with Dr. Philo Drummond and Pope Sternodocs Kekever as guest stars.

181
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,380
That was on an hour of slack back in the 80s.

182
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,300
I wasn't even there for that show.

183
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,000
Heck, I'm not even here for this show, which is number 147.

184
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000


185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000


186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000


187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,220
2013.

188
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,180
One-oh-one-three.

189
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,880
Well, that spells I-OB.

190
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:05,340
Anyway, this is a sexy episode, if only because I've been tossing sexish audio files into

191
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:12,780
this one folder until it equaled 600 megabytes, which equals one show, one sinful show.

192
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,260
And we'll be hearing more Bobulus collages from Mr. Fernand and Andy Lemur, from Reverend

193
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,100
Norrell Preff.

194
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,020
All kinds of devos and more Philo and Sternodocs.

195
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,980
And this background music here is by Lemur Devotee.

196
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,200
So listen up and you'll find slack or else you'll learn what it is or who it is that

197
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,080
you need to get slack.

198
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,800
Imagine me needing someone.

199
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,280
Back on Earth, I never did.

200
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,720
Oh, there were women, lots of women, lots of love making, but no love.

201
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,080
That's the way it is.

202
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,080


203
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,500
That was the kind of world we'd made.

204
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,320
So I left because there was no one to hold me there.

205
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,520
Did I tell you about Stuart?

206
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:05,360
I mean, there was a lovely girl, the most precious cargo we brought along.

207
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,660
She was to be the new Eve with our hot and eager help, of course.

208
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,180
I can accommodate either sex and any combination of people.

209
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,080
I'm also programmed with all the appropriate sex.

210
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,080


211
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,040
I have a large catalog of sexual exhalations, a large catalog of moans, groans, howls, squeals,

212
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,400
grunts, and purrs.

213
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,380
Really?

214
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,540
I'm not programmed for disinformation or lying.

215
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,620
What else can you do?

216
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,820
I also have a number of pleasure features, including three vibration stimulators placed

217
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,160
strategically in the oral, anal, and vaginal orifices.

218
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,460
My nipples are programmed to harden under manual or oral stimulation.

219
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,820
I salivate, secrete, and spurt appropriately.

220
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,080
I'm not programmed for that.

221
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,080


222
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,080


223
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,720
Here's an exchange for all seasons, huh?

224
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,700
And there's a beautiful girl…

225
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,540
And there's a beautiful girl holding a paintbrush…

226
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,220
And there's a beautiful girl holding a ticket…

227
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,860
High boots, hipster miniskirt…

228
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,780
Brief…

229
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,920
Very brief…

230
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,760
She's…

231
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,300
Neat.

232
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,280
Petite.

233
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,940
Swinging gear…

234
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,100
Wild…

235
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,080
Longουμε…

236
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,920
Long, long, straight.

237
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Couldn't be much bigger.

238
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,520
The big sex pact.

239
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,140
And there's a beautiful girl all over it.

240
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,700
There.

241
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,760
It's creamy.

242
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,080
Looks like she's ready for a happening.

243
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,280
I'm a lesbian.

244
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,260
The sociologist says I'm a self-absorbed narcissist.

245
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:45,860
Narcissist.

246
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,920
One troubled individual.

247
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,440
Willing to destroy any institution.

248
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,360
The destruction of human life.

249
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,480
Put that down.

250
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,960
Don't you feel that I'm a lesbian?

251
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,540
Don't you feel it rather interesting that every time you have a story about terrorism,

252
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,880
it is linked to Christian extremists.

253
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,800
Christian extremists teaches violence.

254
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,380
Osama bin Laden is their great hero.

255
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:12,960
Yes.

256
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
Christian extremists blew up trains.

257
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,980
Christian extremists assassinated film producer.

258
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,020
Christian extremists blew up a crowded shopping center.

259
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,100
And the Christian extremists, it's always Christian extremists.

260
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,040
And it's time we recognize it and begin to deal with it.

261
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,840
I'm a lesbian.

262
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,700
Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape.

263
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,340
I'm a lesbian.

264
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,380
Fornication.

265
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,120
Sodomy, fellatio, and cunnilingus.

266
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,960
And bridal concupiscence on every street corner.

267
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,040
Lord, sir, you make me quite nervous.

268
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,500
Indeed, ma'am.

269
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,960
It is not so bad as that.

270
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,080
Indeed it is, sir.

271
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,620
I wouldn't venture nearer the Capitol than Litchfield.

272
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:06,940
Buggery.

273
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,680
Incest.

274
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,480
Bestiality.

275
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,160
And it was a splendid buggery that they endured.

276
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,120
I believe.

277
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,400
But after 300 years, it got revived.

278
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,540
It was a fantastic concert surface vào

279
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,120
there was a laboratory

280
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,360
there is an extraordinary buggery

281
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,680
political place back there in the laboratory the little of the laboratory

282
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,620
i thought it was in the conservative but that's what i was about to go over

283
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,060
recovery i'd ever experienced

284
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,660
all all this call

285
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,540
it was a little more so it's not

286
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,640
leave it with me

287
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,520
eight years

288
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,260
pictures

289
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,620
pictures

290
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,780
it was a conspiratorial buggery brought about

291
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,620
by lack of faith in bob children

292
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,360
iran

293
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,820
romantic

294
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:17,820


295
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:17,820


296
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:17,820


297
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,220
are

298
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,420
mantel

299
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,140
don't

300
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,560
it's all right

301
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,620
did you bring it back?

302
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:41,880
don't know?

303
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,280
He can't keep his mind on nothing else

304
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,640
Stay in the barn for the good things found

305
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,260
In his hands that he can't sit

306
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,700
She can't do no wrong

307
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,360
Rose and red is his best friend

308
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,480
He can't put her down

309
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,460
When a man wants a chicken

310
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,040
Spend his very last dime

311
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Buying her fresh corn

312
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,780
Down at the grain and feed

313
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,580
He'll build a nest for her comfort

314
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,020
Sleep out in the cool

315
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,340
If she says that's the way

316
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,280
It's got to be

317
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,660
Well, this man loves his chicken

318
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,620
She lays him all the eggs she has

319
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,860
Tells him all about nothing going on

320
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,800
Believe me, she's cocky

321
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,440
Just cause she says

322
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,300
When a man wants a chicken

323
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,680
Some people think that it is wrong

324
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,880
He shouldn't stick his beak

325
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,120
In where it don't belong

326
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,240
Just when a man wants a chicken

327
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,600
I know exactly how he feels

328
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,520
Hey baby, baby, baby

329
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm your cocky doo-doo

330
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,360
When a man wants a chicken

331
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,560
You know exactly how he feels

332
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,800
He shacks up into his house

333
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,380
With the good things found

334
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,220
When a man wants a chicken

335
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,000
People think that he's insane

336
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,720
But all he can do is wing it

337
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,020
For the one he loves

338
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,020
You're the man who loves a chicken

339
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,880
I'm going to give you a little

340
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,460
In the morning, I would immediately get annoyed.

341
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,820
I just think, roosters, you know.

342
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,800
Why do I have to even think about roosters?

343
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,640
Already, I just got up and already I'm thinking about roosters.

344
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,100
I don't want to think about roosters.

345
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,100
You may be angry.

346
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,640
What's the matter, Colonel Sanders?

347
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:37,940
Chicken?

348
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,480
I found a way to cook chicken deep down

349
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,860
And get that crispy

350
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,840
Let it

351
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,660
Real crispy chicken crust

352
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,660
Yet it's entirely different

353
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,580
No, no, no

354
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,860
Real crusty, real what?

355
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,580
What kind of damn?

356
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,400
Crispy crust

357
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,040
Crispy crust

358
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,100
You don't want me to sing, do you, for Christ's sake?

359
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,260
I'm not getting anywhere with this damn thing

360
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,060
Okay, fine

361
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,860
I hated the Colonel with his wee beady eyes

362
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,300
And that smug look on his face

363
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,920
Oh, you're gonna buy my chicken, oh!

364
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,940
America is my country and I love her

365
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,880
I wouldn't enter her in any way that's unnatural

366
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,060
Actually, if anybody else wants to have something they want to say or argue about

367
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,560
This is the best music I've ever heard

368
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,380
That's the, this music is the touching

369
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
It's so poignant

370
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,240
Menu music for this new DVD

371
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,900
Share the Load 7X Day

372
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,620
Which is actually

373
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,320
A two hour DVD

374
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,840
This reminds me of a

375
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,520
I know this is gonna sound crude, Reverend Stang

376
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,700
But this reminds me of a porno movie I saw in the 70s

377
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,120
Yeah, that's where we got the

378
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,840
It sounds like the poignant, heart-rending story

379
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,240
Of the woman with the world's largest breasts

380
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,220
Who meets the man with the longest dick

381
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,720
It was so tragic

382
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,240
I could barely make myself watch the whole thing

383
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,240
So sad, so fresh, the day is the dawn of the moon

384
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,820
They were just such parodies of human things

385
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,820
Of exuberance, of life and life efforts

386
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,400
And his, I'm not kidding you, his dick was like this long

387
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,460
It's just way beyond normal

388
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,920
It's incredible what they can do with special effects these days

389
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,780
I walk down the block

390
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,040
And I see walking towards me

391
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,140
A beautiful young lady

392
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,680
And the closer she gets to me

393
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,280
The older she starts to look

394
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,200
And the closer she gets to me

395
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,900
The more virtues she leaves behind

396
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,700
And the closer she gets to me

397
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,700
The further she ventures from her youthful past

398
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,180
And the closer she gets to me

399
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,240
The closer she gets to her own death

400
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,140
And mine!

401
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,820
And I see it!

402
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,880
And I pity her for the things that I know personally

403
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,040
And I pity myself for the times when I didn't think fast

404
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,660
And I pity her more for the humdrum thing she is wearing

405
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,120
And I smile as she sniffes when she realizes I am staring

406
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,120
And I feel so ashamed of myself

407
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,120


408
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,080
For the arrogant way that I scrutinize

409
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,840
I can tell for a fact she is my age

410
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,620
And the further she gets from me

411
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,580
She lessens her chances of becoming my bride

412
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,100
And the further she gets from me

413
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,380
The more I love her

414
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,820
All kidding aside

415
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,620
And the further she gets from me

416
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,520
The further I am taken back to the days

417
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,780
Of my sister's friends in high school

418
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:47,220
In her former class

419
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:55,620
In some way or other

420
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,540
I am willed to pronounciation

421
00:19:59,540 --> 00:19:59,540


422
00:19:59,540 --> 00:19:59,540


423
00:19:59,540 --> 00:19:59,820
Otto

424
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,720
Bastima

425
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,840
A one year old

426
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:02,900
A redneck

427
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,860
A rich

428
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:03,860


429
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:03,940
Just like you

430
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,500
during those bottom-down implications

431
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,500


432
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,900
Where are your horns?

433
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,560
Good evening to you, madam. Would you care to join us?

434
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,660
You get no joy from him.

435
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,520
I loved her dearly once.

436
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,220
But she's a whore.

437
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,960
Not by necessity of a bank commission.

438
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,300
Well, she owns 51% of the bank's stock, for Pete's sake.

439
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,760
Don't tell me your wife believes all that Luther Hegg's hogwash.

440
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,000
With all her heart, she came home last night and vibrated for an hour.

441
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,540
The father of that little girl, she didn't know anything about Bob.

442
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,800
She was begging me to tell her about Bob.

443
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,760
She paid me $20 for one word of Bob.

444
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,120
I gave her a silver about a dictionary.

445
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,940
She gave me my first dictionary.

446
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,800
She was only 13 and I was 83.

447
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,340
That's time control.

448
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,620
Back when we went back early, way back in time,

449
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,740
we were back there, just a couple of amoebas flipping our flagellas around.

450
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,100
Next thing you know, we were progressing through time.

451
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,920
She ended up in a freezer bag.

452
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,920
If I recall my course of events correctly,

453
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,340
I believe that it was dinner time in Dobbs Town.

454
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,800
Yep. Dinner time.

455
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,280
Wasn't it?

456
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,700
Or maybe supper time.

457
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,100
I don't know.

458
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,340
Supper time in Dobbs Town.

459
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,020
Dinner, supper.

460
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,240
And she'd suffer a serious freezer burn.

461
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,460
And it was all because of her lack of faith in Bob.

462
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:31,980
And then she died.

463
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,720
She wouldn't put her soul stint in Bob's hands.

464
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,140
She couldn't bring herself to face the facts.

465
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,700
Then after lunch we have lupper, which is kind of like a brunch between dinner and supper.

466
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,060
She had problems with a bit of the stud genius dogma.

467
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,960
She had problems with slack.

468
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,280
And sinner is not the sinner you would think of.

469
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,280
It's actually a meal that we have between dinner and supper.

470
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,840
Sinner on rise.

471
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,500
Supper.

472
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,680
Sinner on rise.

473
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,920
Then we have pupper at night.

474
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,440
Late at night we have pupper.

475
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,540
And then we sin.

476
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,600
We get to sit there and sin.

477
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,540
That's all we do.

478
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,400
We don't have to do anything to sin.

479
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,760
For the church of the subgenius, we think sin.

480
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,460
It doesn't want to eradicate sin.

481
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,200
It's not because we want to.

482
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,180
It's not because we want to.

483
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,600
It's because we have to.

484
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,800
The church of the subgenius, we have to.

485
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,260
Because we have to bear that sinful burden of mankind.

486
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,200
Justifies sin.

487
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,680
Of the normals, the pinks.

488
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,260
They're sinning all the time.

489
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,560
It's their sins that we kind of ride on like the mudflame.

490
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,220
Like a wave in the mudflame.

491
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,560
Riding like cosmic surfers.

492
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,300
You know?

493
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,120
Looking at the words and the ways of Britney Spears.

494
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,540
A religious leader.

495
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,360
The way she's used her body.

496
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,140
Offers us sexuality all the time.

497
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,560
Gee.

498
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,880
But you know what?

499
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,700
Britney Spears flaunts her sexuality in all of its forms.

500
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,280
Now, what do you say?

501
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,180
An adulteress!

502
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,540
Is it right to kill her?

503
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,340
Go now.

504
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,380
I am so quick.

505
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,560
I'm so quick.

506
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,180
Flop.

507
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,840
Flop.

508
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,240
Flop.

509
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,600
Flop.

510
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,980
All over the ground.

511
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,000
Creates another feeling in me perhaps.

512
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,780
And also perhaps in you.

513
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,980
And that is a feeling of enormous awe.

514
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,740
Awe.

515
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,300
Awe.

516
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,500
Enormous awe.

517
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,520
Enormous awe.

518
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,000
Awe.

519
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,320
Awe.

520
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:18,420
Awe.

521
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,240
Britney Spears.

522
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,680
She flaunted her body in ways that creates another feeling in me.

523
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:28,140
You know and I know Britney Spears kissed Madonna, another woman, on live television.

524
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,100
Her body.

525
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,640
Throw her down as a tool.

526
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,300
Come on silk sheets.

527
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,240
Illicit sexuality.

528
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,400
Over here.

529
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,900
Caught in the act.

530
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,020
Britney Spears bent two feelings in me.

531
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,120
Two feelings in you.

532
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,820
Fool for Britney Spears today.

533
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,240
I was praying last night when an angel broke the light.

534
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,900
He said I'm gonna have to put you on hold for a time.

535
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,220
I said hold like hell.

536
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,120
Let me be.

537
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,560
Talk to the boss.

538
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,740
He said sorry.

539
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,280
Slut.

540
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,080
Sinner.

541
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,160
It's the boss's day off.

542
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:13,180
And I realized then that the wages I sent was two bucks an hour and working weekend.

543
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,660
I was ignoring the fee.

544
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:22,320
He was latched to the crawlers and cried help me get this son of a bitch off.

545
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,940
I said I would if I could.

546
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,260
I can't so I won't.

547
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,120
Well I won't.

548
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


549
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


550
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


551
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


552
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


553
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


554
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


555
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


556
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


557
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


558
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


559
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


560
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


561
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


562
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


563
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


564
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


565
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,120


566
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,200
Today's the day.

567
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,960
I wouldn't want you messing your hair up.

568
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,860
So don't.

569
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:38,880
And I realized then that the wages of sin was all the lumber you can carry.

570
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,980
All the nails you can bend.

571
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,300
The wages of sin.

572
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,640
The reward I feel

573
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,140
Is worrying and fretting

574
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,380
Every second of the year

575
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,520
And heaven is guilt

576
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,780
No sex and no show

577
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,100
And I'm not sure

578
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,420
If I really wanna go

579
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,780
guitar solo

580
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,400
The wages of sin

581
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,500
The price that you pay

582
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,260
Is worrying and fretting

583
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,420
Every second of the day

584
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,700
The church and the state

585
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,060
You've got in country kind

586
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,880
One gives you

587
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,320
Your body

588
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,760
The other gets your mind

589
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,880
Mary, Mary Magdalene

590
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,220
How about a date?

591
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,460
You've been wasting your time

592
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,760
Staying up so late

593
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,840
Your boyfriend's dead

594
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,600
The word is you're a whore

595
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,720
Just about then

596
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,120
I heard a knock on the door

597
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,360
And I realized then

598
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,620
That the wages of sin

599
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,660
Was a bad reputation

600
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,780
And too many

601
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,100
Need 불리� disproportionate

602
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,220
Like a hooligan

603
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,620
And the only way

604
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:23,780
I could put all myñana

605
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,920
You wasted all my time

606
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,640
tooling up

607
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,160
You wasted all your time

608
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,280
Friended good

609
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,460
Was touching done

610
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,960
The wages of sin

611
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,640
The Waging Wounds of Sin

612
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,420
The Waging Wounds of Sin

613
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,920
The Rainmakers, Wages of Sin

614
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,060
Friends, we also heard some Philo Drummond

615
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,800
and Sterno Kekever, Pope Sterno Doc

616
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,640
and some clips via Jacques Pate

617
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,260
and great cutting by Noral Preff

618
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,100
and Fernand and Andy Lemur

619
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,360
more of that coming up and also coming up

620
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,580
Nikki Death Chick

621
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,700
It is written that man does not live by every word

622
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,580
that proceedeth out of the mouth of God

623
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,520
but by bread alone

624
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,120
We invite you to study the scriptures with us

625
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,400
to learn about bread alone

626
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,180
We would like to hear from you

627
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,760
and we pray in the name of bread alone

628
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,780
Thank you for listening to this message

629
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,840
There I am

630
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,600
Thanks again

631
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,360
and may the love of bread alone

632
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,820
abide in you and yours forever and ever

633
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,420
Amen

634
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,520
You are healed

635
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,800
Go forth and sin again

636
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,620
Oh yes

637
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,760
I think I've had quite enough healing tonight

638
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,740
Every one of you

639
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,500
you must remember

640
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,540
that the conspiracy guilt demons inhabit your ass

641
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,260
and if you can't get me to spank you

642
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,420
you can always pay someone else to do it

643
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,440
Thank you very much

644
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,680
Reverend Nikki Death Chick

645
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,960
I heard that you were feeling ill

646
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,280
headache, fever and a chill

647
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,800
I came to help restore your pluck

648
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,620
cause I'm the nurse who likes to

649
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:52,060
Stage 2

650
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,200
Warm liquid goo phase beginning

651
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,540
Warm liquid goo phase complete

652
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,380
Stage 3

653
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,940
Armrat Mar Pearson

654
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,000
Actually I just crossed the line

655
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,840
The danger that tastes like hot Womenころ

656
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,400
hello

657
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,120
I'm a early man and I wrote a book called

658
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,580
cleavage and swords

659
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,780
It's hot and cold

660
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,440
Thank you for watching

661
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,140
for more talk about womenrepthestogiver.com

662
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:32,780
we had a eleven ton radio

663
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:39,940
act confident even if you aren't what was his name you mean the one you couldn't get to

664
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:47,700
this is the second time that you've been here

665
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,620
when you're slapped you'll take it and like it

666
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,920
i was sure that he would ravish you but he was not long enough with you to complete a full

667
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:06,020
full ravishment but i'll warrant he offered you some gross indecencies am i right no indeed sir

668
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:13,860
he was most genteel showed you his virile member forced you to touch and play with it on pain of

669
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:19,800
death and so forth in the usual way no doubt no i assure you nothing of the kind strange

670
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:28,260
strange i heard only the other day of three old ladies in a coach who were subjected to the most

671
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,900
unscrupulous

672
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,540
unspeakable indignities the first offense

673
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,480
i am not well

674
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,660
well love takes a backseat to life

675
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:57,740
oh when a man runs away from his wife that's when you know he's in the world

676
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,800
when a guy tries to run up his mate i thought she's gone and it's getting late

677
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,320
that's when you know he lost his girl

678
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,580
so it happens all the time

679
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:26,920
don't get low just stand in line take your turn now make your move and crush that down

680
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,900
huh with a ton of love

681
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,960
you

682
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:47,180
when a man takes a backseat to man she has to tell him where they go if she can

683
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,640
and she decides to wear his ring

684
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,920
so it happens all the time

685
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,900
the man's got a ring on his back he's got a ring on his throat

686
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:58,900


687
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,340
Take it low, just stand in line

688
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,540
Take your turn, now make your move

689
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,260
And crush that doubt

690
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,900
With a ton of love

691
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,360
Times a girl with the face of a clock

692
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,080
And move forward till you can't stop

693
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,420
She comes from above with a ton of love

694
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,240
With a ton of love

695
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,680
With a ton of love

696
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,500
As if you didn't know, that was Devo from the old days

697
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,820
And you're listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack

698
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,480
At the age of twelve I received my first scribe

699
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,900
At the age of fourteen I received my first scribe

700
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:58,900


701
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,500
At the age of fourteen as a roastery named Vilma

702
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,280
Ritualistically shaved my testicles

703
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,580
Ritualistically shaved my testicles

704
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,300
There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum

705
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,780
It's breathtaking, I suggest you try it

706
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,000
It's breathtaking, I suggest you try it

707
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,320
You know, we have to stop

708
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,460
Say, did you see the skid marks out here?

709
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,160
They go at a direct right angle to the direction of travel

710
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,380
They go at a direct right angle to the direction of travel

711
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,820
And let the record show that Mr. Hank Hill really knows his pornography

712
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,620
Thank you, your honor

713
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,540
I shall be sorry to see you swing or shell

714
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:28,720
I shall be sorry to see you swing or shell

715
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,760
I miss you, Mo

716
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,620
I miss you, Mo

717
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,940
Oh, the chaplain sends his apologies

718
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,840
He was going to come and pray for you but he's been took up himself

719
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,980
Robbing the collection and buggering the altar boys

720
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,180
Well, every man to his taste

721
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,960
Oh yes, Lord, making hard

722
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,900
Oh yes, Lord, making hard

723
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,260
Lord, you and I come together

724
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,300
Right now, right now

725
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,020
We've been thinking

726
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,760
Oh, oh, oh, have a life

727
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,600
Now listen to this, change your thinking

728
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,320
Come, begin to come

729
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,260
Come, done

730
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,800
Blood on the doorpost, eat that all night

731
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,520
Bondage and feeble premature

732
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,260
Follow me, I'm the head behind

733
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,200
Follow me, I'm the head behind

734
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,820
I'm a tell and I will

735
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,360
Now listen close, take it

736
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,700
Number one, let me tell you something

737
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,000
Heaven, member, my dear member

738
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,800
Stop it, I don't know

739
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,640
We are as, we are what we think we are

740
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,080
You are what you think you are

741
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,160
Stop it

742
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,900
And let me tell you something right now, there's nothing wrong with that

743
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,520
There's nothing wrong with one, my dear member

744
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,600
For once you've tasted, my dear member

745
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,060
Now listen closely, listen to me

746
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,480
Direction, our power

747
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,920
Hello

748
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,820
Let me tell you something

749
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,700
Listen to me

750
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,340
Bah, bah, bah, bah, hachanda

751
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,860
You realize that your food

752
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,240
Even now, I am touching you

753
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,420
My dear member

754
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,760
Prick power, prick power, our world

755
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,920
My dear prick

756
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,080
Now let me say something to you again

757
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,900
I want you to remember, cuss a candle and go to hell

758
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,700
Number two, number two

759
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,800
Gaba, gaba, gaba, the power of the tongue

760
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,480
Open your mouth wide and I will fill it

761
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,460
I got to get your mouth open

762
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,540
I got to get your mouth open

763
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,420
Hello, listen to you

764
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,520
Listen to me

765
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,740
I'm talking to you

766
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,160
I am a cannibal, a camel, dog, monkey

767
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,680
We become carnal minded

768
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,960
I found out that secret place

769
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,100
I don't know if I passed out under exhaustion

770
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,140
Or what in my closet

771
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,820
But I was in there a long time

772
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,900
I've had a lot of fun

773
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,900
But they call it a too late

774
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,180
It's just a way to show you

775
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,640
That our world

776
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,380
Is different

777
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:41,720
I think I'm in the right place

778
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:49,240
Hurt and pounding

779
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,140
There are people like that

780
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,620
Who just

781
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,620
Close and rightly so

782
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:56,960
And not know

783
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,900
Oh, listen to me

784
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:58,900


785
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:07,000
the end. Part again. All. After about an hour of that, I can't forget this. I can't forget this.

786
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,960
I can't forget. We'll just use it. It'll grow. Those devils, those lying devils that get on

787
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,960
television and radio newspapers, they'd say all. Those devils, those lying devils that get on

788
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,540
television and radio newspapers, they'd say all. The devil tried to get me to believe the fairy

789
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,760
lies. The devil tried to get me to believe the fairy lies. Oh, oh. Favor, favor, favor, favor.

790
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:33,920
It grew. I just can't help it. Believe it. Believe it. What do you want? What do you want?

791
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,780
What do you want? What do you want? Day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day,

792
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:47,180
every day, every day, every day. Oh. Dumb and blind to everything around you. Are you ready?

793
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:53,380
I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. Pervert. I am.

794
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,740
The Grand Wizard of...

795
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:03,020
The Clue Close Clam. Nonsense. I'm going to give it to you. Now, listen to this. I want you to

796
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:08,800
open your mouth. You need to make a check out for $5,000 and send it in today. Get some more meat

797
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,880
here in this. Get your mouth open to some more meat right out of check today. Six, six, six.

798
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,940
Crack that την!

799
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,120
Crack that tin!

800
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:43,800
Up in the Henfys to swim step on crack break you mama's back

801
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,940
If the � Palace is

802
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:46,940


803
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,960
When a problem comes along

804
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,220
You miss women

805
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,120
Before the extremes don't last long

806
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,160
You miss women

807
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,960
Well something's going wrong

808
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,120
You miss women

809
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,740
It's half a mile away from here that wants to smuggle

810
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:10,860
Now whip it, in the shape, shape it up, get straight, go forward, move ahead, time to detect it, it's not too late, to whip it, whip it good.

811
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:28,100
When it comes time to turn around, you must whip it, you will never live it down, unless you whip it, no one gets away, until they whip it, I say whip it, whip it good.

812
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,060
I say whip it, whip it good.

813
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:54,920
Crack that whip, if the piss is slim, step on the crack, break your moments back.

814
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:06,700
When a problem comes along, you must whip it, before the creeps come along, you must whip it, when something's going wrong, you must whip it.

815
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,000
Now whip it, in the shape.

816
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:27,960
Shape it up, get straight, go forward, move ahead, time to detect it, it's not too late, to whip it, in the shape, shape it up, get straight, go forward, move ahead,

817
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,040
time to detect it, it's not too late, to whip it, whip it good.

818
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,600
Now whip it, in the shape.

819
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,540
Offense to some people. Imagine that.

820
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:29,380
What do you think about them, what do you think about them, ah, wimp, subgeniuses on the coast that were upset by the preponderance of a protruding, protruding, blue veined swarm.

821
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:29,880
Right.

822
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,520
What do you think about that, Milo?

823
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,480
What about them subgeniuses out there on the west coast?

824
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:37,920
Why?

825
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,800
They just couldn't, they just couldn't deal with the new strong Bugün.

826
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,840
I mean, what do they got against it?

827
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,620
What do they got against it?

828
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,180
What do they got against those things sticking out everywhere?

829
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,440
Nasty.

830
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,600
Is that what they think it's like?

831
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,020
Juvenile.

832
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,560
It's a manly thing.

833
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,880
Yeah.

834
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,480
They can't see us or hear us right now.

835
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,640
Plenty of them.

836
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:08,320
The little far away subgeniuses still fighting those old...

837
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,740
Here's this letter I was talking about.

838
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,680
This old...

839
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,720
A letter to whichever one of you has the best British accent should read that one.

840
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,640
We just got this in the mail this week.

841
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,600
I think it's interesting.

842
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,100
You have to self-censor yourself.

843
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,360
See, we can't send a signal to where they are.

844
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,260
They can still send a signal back to us, though.

845
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,400
The latest church magazine is none of it.

846
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,600
They can't actually see or hear us anymore.

847
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,000
You can't make any excuses for the rape-fixated fantasies.

848
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,580
I can't even read this guy's writing.

849
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,300
You try to pass a...

850
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,040
You try to pass off as a celebration of sexuality.

851
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,660
That's so human!

852
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,240
That's so human.

853
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,560
As much as I've enjoyed the subgenius stuff over the years,

854
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,880
I don't want to receive any more of your and your...

855
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,800
and your contributors grow out of this adolescent...

856
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,120
until you and your contributors grow out of this adolescent arrested sexuality...

857
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,780
Beep!

858
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,320
You've lost it.

859
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,120
Chris Aton.

860
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,220
Well, Chris...

861
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,260
Let's just dissect this.

862
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,460
Let's just dissect this.

863
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,000
First of all, I want to say we're all missing word by word.

864
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,560
We didn't put out that last letter.

865
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,620
That's right.

866
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:24,900
That was a blatant attempt of the Citizens for Normalcy or some other underground organization...

867
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,020
to discredit the church and the subgenius...

868
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:31,660
by publishing that filth, that horrible, horrid filth...

869
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,760
that we will take no credit for whatsoever.

870
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,420
Although if we did, we would be gladly...

871
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,860
gladly, uh...

872
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,540
aligned with it.

873
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,480
We would support it to the fullest degree.

874
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,100
But unfortunately, I can't take credit.

875
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,640
Neither would Reverend Stang if he was here.

876
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,580
It's just an unfortunate thing that they did such a good job of imitating our style.

877
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,940
But I have to admit now, before we take any more unnecessary heat...

878
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:02,100
although we were trying to pick up the profits as well as we could...

879
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,480
which is...

880
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,920
You would normally expect that from us.

881
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,660
But I have to admit right now...

882
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:12,040
we had nothing, nothing whatsoever to do with that horrible, filthy...

883
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,420
stark filth of removal...

884
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,800
that you may have received after our mailing list was stolen from us.

885
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,740
That's right, it was stolen.

886
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,140
So...

887
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,820
First of all, let's just dissect this letter.

888
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,820
He starts out, Dear Subgenius...

889
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,320
Now we could dismiss him immediately.

890
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,540
What gives him the familiarity to call us dear?

891
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,820
How dare he say...

892
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,660
Okay, Dear Subgenius...

893
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,920
He doesn't know me well enough to say dear.

894
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,300
If we'd have been in a...

895
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,640
My wife doesn't call you dear.

896
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,140
Just read the letter.

897
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,160
We would have abandoned this immediately if I read...

898
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,740
Okay, you're stuffed.

899
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,320
It looks like shat.

900
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,740
He says, you're stuffed.

901
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,540
How can you call the primary excommunication with the exes and the word above, stuffed?

902
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,080
That just relegates it to some type of mundane...

903
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,160
Fingal tissue.

904
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,400
Okay, then he says, you're stuffed.

905
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,220
He cannot be equated.

906
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,520
You're stuffed used to be.

907
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,120
Stop!

908
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,840
Now, masters of time control don't even...

909
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,460
We don't even need...

910
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,660
Used to be.

911
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,380
Used to be.

912
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,900
What is this used to be?

913
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:21,660
Masters of time control have no need for such narrowly confining...

914
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,420
Form of time?

915
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,420
Used to be.

916
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,540
Used to be.

917
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,880
Clever, funny, and intelligent.

918
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,820
We've never been clever, funny, or intelligent.

919
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,260
There's no such thing as...

920
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,780
Look at the word.

921
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,300
It's subgenius.

922
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,600
We're not geniuses.

923
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:35,920
Clever.

924
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,800
I mean, if you take the C off, it's clever.

925
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,980
What is clever but just a simple machine?

926
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,940
We're like simple machines ourselves.

927
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,880
Can you take the C-L-E-V off?

928
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,500
It's just er.

929
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:43,680
Simpletons.

930
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,260
Take all of that.

931
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:50,020
We have nothing more complex than the basic wheel, inclined plane, and lever.

932
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,560
That's the most complex we get in anything we may even consider.

933
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,920
So, calling us clever, or funny, or intelligent is just an insult.

934
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,640
Okay, and then look at this word here.

935
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,000
The.

936
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:02,720
The.

937
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:02,880
The.

938
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,020
Did you get the words?

939
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,780
First letter starts the second sentence of his letter with the word.

940
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,180
Ha, ha, ha!

941
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:06,180


942
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,520
A three-letter word!

943
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,080
C'mon, is that a single word?

944
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,160
The?

945
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:10,800
I just saying.

946
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,400
Okay, the latest ...

947
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:12,760
The.

948
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,160
The latest church magazine.

949
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,080
You didn't even watch Cable TV.

950
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,680
How does he know it's the latest church magazine?

951
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,340
Looks to the publishing!

952
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:17,480
I guess not.

953
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,480
Did he get this morning's magazine?

954
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,660
Did he get the one we put out this afternoon?

955
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,020
Did he get the one that we're working on right now?

956
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,460
Indeed, the got, but asks for anotherexplaining.

957
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:24,480
I believe the skull.

958
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,580
Has he got the one that we're gonna do next week?

959
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,080
The utter skull.

960
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,320
The latest church magazine.

961
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,300
Three, two, one...

962
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,300
I just can't believe it.

963
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,580
Read the letter.

964
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,200
Is none of these.

965
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,280
It's all of those.

966
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:37,000
None of these.

967
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:37,640
None of them.

968
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,280
All of them.

969
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,280
It's only three or four of them at the same time.

970
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,360
It's a dozen of them as we sit here and 11 of them in the morning first thing.

971
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,840
Unless one of them gets wet and starts to swell up and he puts it in that box, what's he going to do?

972
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,640
Does he have that oaken box?

973
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,960
Does he have an oaken casket?

974
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,840
Does he have the arc of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer to put it in?

975
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,080
What's he going to do when it starts swelling up?

976
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,460
I just can't believe this.

977
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,460
None of these.

978
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,260
Okay, another three-letter word.

979
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:03,620
You.

980
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:04,980
How does he?

981
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,580
How does he?

982
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,440
He just thinks.

983
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,600
From PR News in Washington, I'm dragged out by police.

984
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,720
President Bush is destroying embryos.

985
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,340
In a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in Salt Lake City,

986
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,900
Mr. Bush reiterated his contention that the war in Iraq is directly linked to the global war on embryos.

987
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,740
We will finish the task that they gave their lives for.

988
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:27,960
Outside the convention.

989
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,340
Center hundreds of embryos staged an anti-embryo protest.

990
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,740
With less than an hour before a self-imposed deadline,

991
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,320
the last Jewish settlers stripped today, despite a strike by mechanics.

992
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,300
Wall Street at this hour, 210-577.

993
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,760
Northwest Airlines says they found ordinary skin and bone cells.

994
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,860
But employees and some outside observers say they found PR News in Washington.

995
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,200
You sound really pretty.

996
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,720
Let me tell you what I'm wearing.

997
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:07,040
I'm wearing brown pants, an old navy crew neck, and a pair of red Skechers.

998
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:11,940
Did I mention I'm also wearing a UGO baseball cap?

999
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,380
I'm lying on my floor playing with my model trains right now.

1000
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,660
I'm making tracks, baby.

1001
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,240
Oh, just lay back and listen.

1002
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,960
I'm small, but I know how to choo-choo.

1003
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,060
You could be my jungle gym and I'll swing around and climb.

1004
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,080
Let me get my trampoline, baby.

1005
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,500
Choo-choo.

1006
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,400
Imagine my tiny body crawling all over you, boo.

1007
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:43,120
Feel me snake my way all up inside and through you.

1008
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,460
You'd like that, don't you?

1009
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,960
So don't be afraid.

1010
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,160
It won't hurt much.

1011
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:50,240


1012
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,080
Bob appears to be just ahead.

1013
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,740
You never see him with arms and legs anymore.

1014
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,680
You might call him ahead of his time.

1015
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,560
Ha ha.

1016
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,340
But what else if it's Bob?

1017
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,420
He doesn't, you don't need arms.

1018
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,740
You don't need legs.

1019
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,460
You don't even need a brain.

1020
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,980
Because all you really need, friends, is slack.

1021
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,620
That's all anybody needs.

1022
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,460
When was the last time brains got you a good job?

1023
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:18,940
No.

1024
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,320
Lying on your resume or somebody else dying gets you a good job.

1025
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:24,940
When was the last time brains got you a good job?

1026
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:24,940


1027
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,320
When did being smart get you success on a date?

1028
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,740
Well, actually, if you're like me, that's about the only way to you.

1029
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,020
But, nonetheless, you know what I'm saying.

1030
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,940
Brain cells start excitation.

1031
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:24,940


1032
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:24,940


1033
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:24,940


1034
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,220
For me, spreading out so far away.

1035
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,020
I'd rather get allergic smelling, but...

1036
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,120
The stars are fresh as well.

1037
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,720
Do you know your daughter well, and do you know she's dreaming?

1038
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:59,760
Do you know your daughter well, talk to her soon.

1039
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,740
Oh, do you know your daughter well, and do you know she's dreaming?

1040
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,640
You know as well as I, she stays higher than the moon.

1041
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,620
And do you know your sister well, and did you know she's drinking?

1042
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,140
Do you know your sister well?

1043
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:24,920
Talk to her soon.

1044
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,480
to her soon

1045
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,480
Boy, do you know

1046
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,640
your sister well? You know I think

1047
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,420
she's losing. You know

1048
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,660
through other's eyes she stays higher

1049
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,460
than the moon

1050
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,600

1066
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,560
strange, they tell. Probably

1067
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,980
he'll go to hell

1068
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,520
Unless you steer him right

1069
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,580

1082
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,700

Call me

1095
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:24,540


1096
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,700
Well, yes, I know my daughter well

1097
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,660
And yes, I know she's dreaming

1098
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,340
Yes, I know my sister well

1099
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,760
That's the way it goes

1100
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,760
I know my sister all too well

1101
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,620
Yes, I know she's drinking

1102
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,540
How do I vision her

1103
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,720
For something she already knows

1104
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,560
And yes, I know my brother well

1105
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,580
And the company he's keeping

1106
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,100
Yes, I know my brother well

1107
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,600
He sings a different tune

1108
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,740
Oh, yes, I know my sister well

1109
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,500
Yes, I know my brother well

1110
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,880
I've heard it said he's queer as hell

1111
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,100
Pray that he's in love as well

1112
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,560
Fire than the moon

1113
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,780
Thanks for the information

1114
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,060
Thanks for no thanks for the information

Well, thanks for the information

00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,900
Thanks for no thanks for the information

00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:04,200
Thanks for no thanks for the information

00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,740
Cause information's got your number too

1121
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:15,820

Thanks for the information

00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,680
Thanks for the information

1125
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:48,260
Thanks for the information

1126
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:37,660
Thanks for the information

1127
00:55:37,680 --> 00:56:07,660
Thanks for the information

1128
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,440
No, life isn't like a clock

1129
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:12,740
Essaówy Ms. Zagreb

1130
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,260
Now here's something to think about

1131
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,240
Few minutes before

1132
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,240
Bitch, save Ms. Zagreb

1133
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,260
I like you

1134
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:19,800
Please do it

1135
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,540
No, you don't

1136
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,600
True

1137
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:21,600


1138
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,220
No, listen

1139
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:23,400
song

1140
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,800
Did you ever think about how important it is to

1141
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,100
What a shame

1142
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:27,620
Kiss

1143
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:28,620
What a shame

1144
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,120
Come out

1145
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:29,880
What a shame

1146
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:30,880
Come out

1147
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,540
Who cares

1148
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,140
And here's a funny thought

1149
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:35,820
I like Ur ána

1150
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:35,900
I like Ur ána

1151
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,520
Who cares who cares

1152
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:37,660
Who cares who cares

1153
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,960
Do you have a bathroom problem in your house?

1154
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,620
Eat it all, eat it all.

1155
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,240
He has, he has.

1156
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,160
Who cares?

1157
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,860
Nice, nice.

1158
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,700
Boars are an essential part of our lives, even more so than most of us realize.

1159
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:03,360
Boars enable us to enter our homes, our schools, our churches, and our places of business.

1160
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:09,080
Without Boars, we would be locked out of many comforts and joys of life in church.

1161
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,220
There are many kinds of Boars.

1162
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,880
There is a Boar to skill, which we have labeled discipline.

1163
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,140
The door to heaven. I am the Boar.

1164
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,820
By me, if any man enter in, he shall be self-righteousness.

1165
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,540
Heaven's Boar. The body of we are lost in such folly.

1166
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:29,180
None of us would build a home with special doors for each member of the family.

1167
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,260
We all use the same Boars.

1168
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,340
And of course, Boar which is true.

1169
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,540
It is large enough for the biggest one of the family, is large enough for the smallest too.

1170
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:43,040
It is large enough to permit the biggest, as well as the smallest sinner to enter,

1171
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:48,260
if he but come, but come, but come, come, come, come.

1172
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:53,740
Some Boars can be entered only after a specified entrance fee is paid.

1173
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,640
Some Boars are open only certain hours of the day.

1174
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,740
Boars enable us to seek shelter from the storms of life.

1175
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:05,980
It makes all the difference in the world which side of the Boar we're on.

1176
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,380
The inside or the outside.

1177
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,260
Which side of the Boar are you on?

1178
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,860
Most Boars permit us to carry anything through them.

1179
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,920
As we enter, pass through Heaven's Boar.

1180
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,640
What a joy it would be to come.

1181
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,260
Enter in.

1182
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,180
Heaven's Boar is still wide open.

1183
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,660
Won't you enter while you may?

1184
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:45,260
All visit is a great deal of sum parting.

1185
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:53,020
Our lent them верena Either you'll see the

1186
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:53,260
Holy Ghost 아니��

1187
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,040
which is over product or meal or payment.

1188
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,620
The Nieılごng

1189
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:00,480
a Judas

1190
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,380
Mr Ro狼

1191
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:01,720
Raqqa

1192
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,340
Wiggly World!

1193
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,280
Well, I'm a little, little Wiggly World!

1194
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:04,860
Wiggly World!

1195
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,820
Well, I'm a little, little Wiggly World!

1196
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,480
Wiggly World!

1197
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,300
Well, I'm a little, little Wiggly...

1198
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:10,060
Wiggly World!

1199
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,500
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

1200
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,880
Take these broken wings

1201
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:31,480
And learn to fly

1202
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,080
All your life

1203
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,040
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

1204
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,660
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

1205
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,860
Or when, in my mind, the men come in their six black shiny ships,

1206
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:58,760
do they come?

1207
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,580
Do they come in your mind, too?

1208
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,840
Very funny diarrhea

1209
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,920
Very funny diarrhea

1210
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,160
Yes

1211
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,400
Yes

1212
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,560
Yes

1213
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,360
Very funny diarrhea

1214
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,200
Very funny diarrhea

1215
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,660
Yes

1216
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,280
Yes

1217
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,780
Very funny diarrhea

1218
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,660
Very funny diarrhea

1219
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,860
Yes

1220
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:20,720
Yes

1221
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,020
Irritation in the rectum

1222
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,860
Irritation in the rectum

1223
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,400
Constipation

1224
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,860
Hemorrhoids

1225
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:29,040
Hemorrhoids

1226
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,220
Hemorrhoids

1227
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:31,040
Constipation

1228
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,200
Hemorrhoids

1229
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:33,940
Hemorrhoids

1230
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:34,220
Hemorrhoids

1231
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:34,280
Hemorrhoids

1232
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,140
Anything in the rectum

1233
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:36,660
Not my job

1234
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,260
I'm on fucking fire

1235
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,200
I'm on fucking fire

1236
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,220
I'm on fucking fire

1237
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,200
I'm on fucking fire

1238
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,300
I'm on fucking fire

1239
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,200
I'm on fucking fire

1240
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:48,720
I'm on fucking fire

1241
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,560
That's the way I feel

1242
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,000
I don't expect to go to sleep for a year

1243
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,280
I'm on fucking fire

1244
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:52,820
Music

1245
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:53,880
Music

1246
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:55,640
Music

1247
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,840
And what we saw tonight was a physical demonstration of a professor's knowledge of the decades of the body's life

1248
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:58,840


1249
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:58,840


1250
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,580
An inexplicable physical phenomenon

1251
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,340
When what we saw tonight was a physical phenomenon

1252
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:10,580
An inexplicable physical phenomenon

1253
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,460
But the way I feel, I don't expect to sleep for a year

1254
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,820
I'm on fucking fire

1255
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:17,460
But the way I feel, I don't expect to sleep for a year

1256
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,880
I'm on fucking fire

1257
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,460
But the way I feel, I don't expect to sleep for a year

1258
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:22,860
I'm on fucking fire

1259
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,980
I bet you don't know what to do in case of a nuclear attack.

1260
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,360
You know what to do?

1261
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:33,080
You put your hands behind your head, put your head between your knees, and kiss your ass goodbye.

1262
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,040
Definition of indecent.

1263
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,720
If it's long enough, hard enough, and in far enough, it's indecent.
