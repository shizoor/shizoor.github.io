00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,540
So, you will be greedy.

2
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,520
Now I'll tell you a story about a mouse who was greedy and came to a bad end.

00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:11,620
Joe Doakes was just a guy who liked to tinker around his barn.

8
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,740
Some people thought Joe was lazy.

9
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,980
Some even thought he was nuts.

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,080
But one day, he had an idea.

11
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,900
I thought I was good.

12
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,260
I thought I was good.

13
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,120
I was mental.

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
Very mental.

15
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,200
A couple of ladies' eyes.

16
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,840
Very mental.

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,620
Mental.

18
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,380
Very mental.

19
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,840
You just get motionless to you.

20
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,500
You get a phone call.

21
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,300
It sounds great.

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,820
You're mental.

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,320
Forget about that phone call.

24
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,840
Whether it happens or it doesn't happen.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,900
You better be mental.

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:02,960
Hello.

27
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,560
You better be mental all the time.

28
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,440
I'm blessed being mental.

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,620
That's the way I see it.

30
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,180
No matter what you say about me, I think I'm mental.

31
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,240
That's what you gotta be.

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,600
Mental.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,920
And if it ain't good enough for the person next to you, that's just unmental.

34
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,100
Very unmental.

35
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,280
Another word for unmental is you're mental.

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,920
Willing spirits as well.

37
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,500
That's trying to look good.

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:24,920
I'm a gay chick.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,820
I'll do my therapy.

40
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,580
Drop that beep.

41
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,300
You know?

42
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:28,780
Mental.

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,420
Very mental.

Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,040
Maybe that's all Bob is.

46
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,760
I'll say hello later.

47
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,500
Golly!

48
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,000
Bob.

49
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,820
Bob.

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,160
Bob.

51
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:55,740
Bob.

52
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,260
Bob.

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,440
Exclusive.

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:58,860
Exclusive.

55
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,200
Easy.

56
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,100
Full, comfortable, custom, perfect.

57
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,460
New!

58
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,060
Real hair.

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,380
Let's just step up.

60
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,500
Okay.

61
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,260
So here it is.

62
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,620
Now this is what happens.

63
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,640
Again and again and again and again.

64
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,620
And when it does, when they probably don't.

65
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,440
So there you are.

66
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Well, here's the problem.

67
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,860
But hey, sponsored by the Partnership for a Free America.

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,840
We go to my way to heaven.

In seven.

70
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,700
Seven.

71
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,480
I'm in heaven.

Yodel my way to heaven, to the Father, Jesus Christ.

77
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,520
You know, I ain't a church-going person, but I swear, that's going to be a thing of the past.

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,540
Um, let him be all right. I didn't hit him hard. He should still have one good one left in him.

79
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,600
Beloved, I wish above all things that it's mine. Flush it down the toilet, because it's mine.

80
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:21,400
How long will you sit? But it's mine. Sin, sin, it's mine. Hatred, it's mine. Bitterness, it's mine.

81
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,500
Covetousness, it's mine.

82
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,600
The Bible says that it's mine.

83
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,200
This little hunt found me excited.

Oh, baby.

91
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,980
Who gets the chance?

92
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,580
We want toد

Let's begin. According to the nursery rhyme, what term refers to a Roman Catholic?

108
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,240
Uhh, uh,

109
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,420
Yes. What letter found in 1937,

110
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,820
Uh. Old Golden Earl.

111
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,380
That's right?

112
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,780
Yes.

113
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,800
Oh, no.

114
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,060
Oh, a cat.

115
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,520
Yes.

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,020
B-b-b-b-bob filed for bankruptcy in October 2001.

117
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,160
Oh, uh, uh, uh, I don't know.

118
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,780
Yes. Uh, you've got a bunch wrong.

119
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,820
Oh, a f-king Bob.

120
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,440
Now let's see what you've got around here we can tax.

121
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,000
Hmm. Let's see.

122
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,180
What's going on here?

123
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,580
Say, what kind of a joint is this anyway?

1-11-7-9-3-5-13

125
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:39,780
My name is Coco, and the reason I do drugs is because I have Down syndrome.

126
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,780
Because having Down syndrome, I can't really tell what's right or wrong.

127
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,960
So I do drugs because I have Down syndrome.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,920
And I feel that I need to do drugs.

129
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,160
Spotted by PCP for Free America.

130
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,700
A nice lucky number.

131
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,180
Well, you better hope I don't.

132
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,880
You can't.

133
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,940
Oh, you can.

134
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:06,940
Right.

135
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,940
This man's drugs.

136
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,400
I know.

137
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,840
Yeah, well, watch it.

138
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,520
Whatever.

139
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,200
So he's trying drugs.

140
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,320
Alright.

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,340
He's spending more time with his loves.

142
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,140
Ah, yeah, don't mess with me.

143
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,480
And it works.

This is my last committee hearing as chairman.

147
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,980
And I hate education.

148
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,140
And I hate New York.

149
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,800
I hate Southeast Asia and Southwest Asia.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,540
And Colombia and every place else.

151
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
I hate younger and younger people.

152
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,680
And I hate families.

153
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,520
I hate kids in grade schools.

154
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,900
When you kill one, there's 10 or 20 or 50 waiting to take his place.

155
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,580
I hate society.

156
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,100
And I hate people like you.

157
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,120
But I have one question that nobody ever asks.

158
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,720
And that's this question.

159
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,320
What would happen?

160
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,980
What would happen?

161
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,340
What would happen?

162
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,040
I'd like for any of you to answer that.

163
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,520
There are some things you just do.

164
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,980
Like smoking marijuana.

165
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,620
Because when you get high, it's your mind you're messing with.

166
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,760
So what?

167
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,380
My brother Jeff's gonna drop at the mall tonight.

168
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,880

How's it going, dude?

171
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:46,860
I'm not sure.

172
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,460
I'm not sure.

173
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:47,520
I'm not sure.

I'm not sure.

180
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,100
I'm not sure.

181
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,140
I don't know if I'm actually gonna make it or not.

182
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,140


183
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,140

185
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,440
I'm really glad I wasn't able to make it.

186
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,660
No, I haven't, you see.

187
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,680
This is an energy spoiler.

188
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,560
So we're really happy with that.

189
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:02,800
I want people to know that.

So avoid hip-hop and left- reopening, you know what I mean.

192
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:02,940


193
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,360
I'd кожan somebody cause I'm in crisis.

194
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:04,800
But at the very least, it gets on the good side.

195
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:04,880
I'm not sure.

196
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,080
I mean I've got to check out the radio station thing at night.

197
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:17,900
My turn is it going eineutrop awakened forever and ever which is so funny to me.

198
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,120
and other people.

199
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,540
The ESO stuff on the show was done in early 2003,

200
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,240
a few days after the tragic Columbia shuttle explosion,

201
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,000
15 minutes before landing would have happened.

202
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,540
Although the space collage by Chaz Smith,

203
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,220
which you'll hear that's also in the show,

204
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,940
predates that.

205
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,920
It's from around 1998.

206
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,820
Conspiracy year.

207
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,620
Even though it sounds like it must have been assembled yesterday

208
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,260
just for the shuttle show of 2003.

209
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,700
Anyway, special thanks to all the Alt Binaries Slack artistes

210
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,000
from back in Usenet day who posted the collages,

211
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,020
especially Fernanda Nende-Lemur.

212
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,800
The Ghost Intro Show title mix was an Artemia Salina creation.

213
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
And now a piece of music,

214
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,960
by Aphex Twin,

215
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,820
which started with a recording of a bouncing ball

216
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,380
and all other instrumentation was electronically derived

217
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,660
from that simple sound.

218
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,280
Aphex Twin.

219
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,180
Both weapons had beaters of当!'s

220
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,180


221
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,780
birthright videol bringing Aphex Twin next year,

222
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:17,780


223
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:17,780


224
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:17,780


225
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:17,880
Do the American Party have a business

226
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:17,880


227
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:17,880


228
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,860
I'm going to show you how to do it.

229
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,860
I'm going to show you how to do it.

230
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,760
I'm going to show you how to do it.

231
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,800
I'm going to show you how to do it.

232
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:44,840
I'm going to show you how to do it.

233
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,920
I'm going to show you how to do it.

234
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:49,920


235
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:49,920


236
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:49,920


237
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,840
Uh, yes.

238
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,020
Listen to the wind.

239
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,180
Oh my God.

240
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,000
The wind.

241
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,360
I'm a machine.

242
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:56,880
She's jumping.

243
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,000
There.

244
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,060
God knows what the machine is supposed to do.

245
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,560
Coming in on a wing and a prayer.

246
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,940
Well, obviously the machine didn't do what it was supposed to do.

247
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,780
Step on into the chapel.

248
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,700
We're marrying men and women.

249
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,300
Okay.

250
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,600
Flower is a vegetable.

251
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,080
Come on.

252
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,200
Come on.

253
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:17,780
Come on.

254
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:17,780


255
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,620
and everything

256
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,060
to its own self.

257
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,700
A gift of

258
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,640
Roger Houston.

259
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,180
Stop.

260
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,920
Look up.

261
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,700
Hey, Houston, look up.

262
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,440
I think we got this.

263
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,380
Hub, hub, hub.

264
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,360
Hub, hub, hub.

265
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,020
You have no alternative.

266
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,500
You know it.

267
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
You know it.

268
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,340
Everything will be all right.

269
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,440
You are in my hands.

270
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,340
I am here to protect you.

271
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,200
You have nowhere to go.

272
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,000
You have nowhere to go.

273
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,220
Here at Truth Control,

274
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,280
we do our best.

275
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,740
Here at Truth Control,

276
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,560
we do our best

277
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,600
to keep you thinking

278
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,660
of the best things

279
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,500
you can think.

280
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,440
Here at Truth Control,

281
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,280
we do our best

282
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,240
to keep you not thinking,

283
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,540
to keep you asleep,

284
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,040
to keep you wandering

285
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,020
around in the dark.

286
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,960
Here at Truth Control,

287
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,040
we're here to help.

288
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,940
Hey,

289
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,440
we have no time

290
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,780
to be here.

291
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,020
Please come back.

292
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,680
You have nothing to be afraid of.

293
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,500
We have to go back.

294
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,860
And it is your last chance to return.

295
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,320
You have nowhere to go.

296
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,560
You cannot survive.

297
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,020
You cannot survive.

298
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,060
We only want to help you.

299
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,840
This is your last chance.

300
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,320
There can be other creatures in this alien environment.

301
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,460
Hunters.

302
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,480
Hunters are fast and maneuverable.

303
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,600
They eat the floaters, both for their organic molecules and for their store of pure hydrogen.

304
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:34,220
But there can't be many hunters, because if they destroy all the floaters, they themselves will perish.

305
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,760
But have we neglected one of the most important items necessary for being effective for the kingdom?

306
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:46,080
I have come upon an amazing and startling conclusion that this here great mass that we stand upon,

307
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,780
heaving and throttling...

308
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,460
sweeps through the land holding the land join masters,

309
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,640
is restricted to the land of speed,

310
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,060
I shall shake the gods' clanka.

311
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,080
The fire, horses, the mountains.

312
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,320
About men of last España.

313
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,240
步 steps now become a kingdom.

314
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,880
We are our senses to Це,

315
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,740
we are our hearts to this

316
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,580
world.

317
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,780
Let's rise up,

318
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:15,920
and advance.

319
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,740
You need fourえ

320
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:17,740


321
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:17,740


322
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:17,740


323
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,680
Here we go.

324
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,740
What do we do?

325
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,360
You ask that question now?

326
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,380
The Major in Longerat, you say?

327
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,740
You know the answer, Major.

328
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:34,740
Sure.

329
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,680
We'll circle around.

330
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,660
Then we'll crash.

331
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,100
No, no, no, no.

332
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,920
No, it'll be all right, my boy.

333
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,960
My word again.

334
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,380
Have peace forever.

335
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,600
Prophecy is an easy thing.

336
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,420
For rarely is the prophet brought to judgment.

337
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,640
Tonight I bring you a false prophecy.

338
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,620
The place of our story is a great rocket speeding away from the moon.

339
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,100
Now, as you notice, some of these ships are made of cardboard.

340
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,560
If you've got the will, if you've got what made America great,

341
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,040
if you've got a heart,

342
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,060
a heart as big as the sun and an ass as big as the moon,

343
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,360
you'll make it.

344
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,360
You'll storm on through those stars like a laser through butter.

345
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,640
Yeah, man.

346
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,660
Yeah.

347
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,500
Come on, come on.

348
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,780
Don't worry about that plastic wrap around.

349
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,820
It's not real plastic.

350
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,400
No, that's a solar shield, man.

351
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,120
That'll protect you.

352
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,400
It's not plastic and those cigarette wrappers on the floor.

353
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,580
That's insulation device for when you're in deep space.

354
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,020
But you've got to believe, you've got to believe, you've got to believe, Earth, that you're

355
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,020


356
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,020


357
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,020


358
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,020


359
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,020


360
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,020


361
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,020


362
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,900
a man, you've got to believe.

363
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,840
Deep space.

364
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,160
In the slash, slash, slash.

365
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,300
Yes, yes, yes.

366
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,000
Yes, I've always known.

367
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,100
Yes, I agree.

368
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,380
Man, it really makes it, yeah.

369
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,940
That's a real man.

370
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,700
It really makes it.

371
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,500
Susie?

372
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,040
Forget it.

373
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,480
You better run along out if you want to have your invasion before dark.

374
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,000
It is time.

375
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


376
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


377
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


378
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


379
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


380
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


381
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


382
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


383
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


384
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


385
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


386
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


387
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


388
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


389
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


390
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,020


391
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,940
I want you to tell me the truth.

392
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,220
What is this invasion silliness?

393
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,040
It isn't silly.

394
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,660
It's just a game.

395
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,160
That's all.

396
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,220
Whoa.

397
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,320
That was a funny little radio show, wasn't it?

398
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,520
Did you want the peaceful victim or did you want the...

399
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,020
That was a funny little radio show.

400
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,020
They thought I was...

401
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,020


402
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,020


403
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,020


404
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,020


405
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,020


406
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,020


407
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,020


408
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,660
I thought they wanted me.

409
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,360
Money.

410
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,760
I thought they wanted me.

411
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,540
Money.

412
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,220
I thought they wanted me.

413
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,220


414
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,860
I thought they wanted me.

415
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,440
Money.

416
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,420
They wanted me.

417
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:51,960
Money.

418
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,120
What was the issue?

419
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,220
Invasion?

420
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,220
Drill?

421
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,540
Zero hour?

422
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,260
There are a lot of kooks out there.

423
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:07,740
There are a lot of people that will use, you know, what the scripture says wrong.

424
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,560
They will interpret it in a way to benefit themselves.

425
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,020
And then I go and I fix the problem.

426
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,020


427
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,960
I cut the potato and then I cut the potato and I eat the potato and then I make another

428
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:29,040
potato into a potato flute and I go up the mountain and I yell to greet the new day and

429
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,360
then I yell to greet the end of the day.

430
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,740
That is my potato life.

431
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,460
I'm so full of happiness.

432
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,720
Hooked on something new.

433
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,140
Yeah.

434
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:06,200
Almost out of coolness.

435
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,960
Harvest fresh onions that you're

436
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,020
decentralized into fresh onions, because you're not supposed to go to place to aside

437
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,020


438
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,720
We can't spend as much time around the Earth.

439
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,060
That's what they were singing.

440
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,420
They came down that last 15 minutes of flight.

441
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,060
15 minutes from landing.

442
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,980
We set sail on this new sea.

443
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,900
Because there is new knowledge to be gained.

444
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,300
And this is my room.

445
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,980
And you're all here.

446
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,720
And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever, ever again.

447
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,960
So what's your theory about the...

448
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,140
I think they slapped the taste right out of Chaz's mouth.

449
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,820
Don't you think it's highly distasteful?

450
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,120
To talk about that jet.

451
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,140
What got the shuttle?

452
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,160
I think it was Zeus with his mighty blue thunderbolt.

453
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,400
They're talking about...

454
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
He's got some great thunderbolts this year.

455
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,540
Who's got blue thunderbolts besides Zeus?

456
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,640
I mean, it might be the Zeus liberation army.

457
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,640
Which I guess is very fundamentalist in their beliefs.

458
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,500
They go back to your zip.

459
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:30,960
I don't know.

460
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,120
I've heard that Ra has green thunderbolts.

461
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,520
No, but you notice the thunderbolts that rolled off good old...

462
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,460
And Bob has great big red...

463
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:41,960
Straps.

464
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,740
Great big bungee sticks.

465
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,260
He whooped the hell out of me, that thunderbolt.

466
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,740
For using a Chinese...

467
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:55,440
So I heard that NASA knew from the beginning of the flight that that was going to happen,

468
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,320
but didn't tell the astronauts because they couldn't do anything about it.

469
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,540
Oh, man.

470
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,600
What a grim thought.

471
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,660
You know, I had...

472
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,980
And then they made up this whole thing that they're going to do this big, you know,

473
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,960
the inquiry and all that to, you know, cover that off.

474
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:10,960


475
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,500
Oh, actually, I had an even more paranoid whole scenario unfold in my imagination.

476
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,520
Underwear?

477
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,180
Shortly after I heard the thing.

478
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,140
It was like a movie.

479
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,240
It was just like an action movie.

480
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,300
Well, imagine if those guys were up there and they're, of course...

481
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,080
Just having a smoke after some copulon.

482
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,460
Quintus interruptus.

483
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,900
Just check it out.

484
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,360
I'm listening.

485
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:33,840
I'm listening.

486
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,720
And...

487
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,040
Okay.

488
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,420
Okay.

489
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
The astronauts have been instructed to dump.

490
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,380
This mysterious cargo into orbit.

491
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:48,360
One of them does some homework and discovers that it's a doomsday privacy erasing device

492
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,340
to be put into orbit that could easily be used by the wrong hands to enslave all humanity

493
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,620
under fill in the blank.

494
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,560
The astronauts confer and decide not to activate the evil device.

495
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,240
But one of the astronauts is, of course, secretly with them, the big them.

496
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,640
And he pulls out a death ray or something on the other astronauts.

497
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,460
Now, stand up.

498
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:10,940
Stand back.

499
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,740
I'm going to bring this baby down.

500
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,940
But this one woman astronaut who he had knocked out earlier, she comes to behind him.

501
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,340
I didn't wake him up.

502
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,440
And she's just in time to clobber him from behind.

503
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,220
And there's this dramatic fight aboard the shuttle as it's coming in for a landing.

504
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:24,700
Wow.

505
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,480
Okay.

506
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:32,180
Now, the good guys, the good astronauts defeat the bad agent astronaut and have informed

507
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,480
mission control.

508
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:39,500
We're coming in for a landing with big news that will shake the world and shock everyone.

509
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,340
And that...

510
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:46,020
Is when they in Washington or Langley or wherever ordered the secret button push that makes

511
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:51,140
the shuttle explode upon reentry just as if a heat panel or something had been damaged

512
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,860
during takeoff.

513
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,100
And they even had fake footage of that standing by just in case of that kind of emergency

514
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,280
and sudden cover-up.

515
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:58,660
Wow.

516
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,480
And that makes me a real conspiracy theorist and made-for-TV movie director.

517
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,920
You think as a movie director they could come up with better prosthetics than fake feet?

518
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,820
Hey, who's on the line?

519
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,240
You know?

520
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,400
Man stank.

521
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,960
You've been working in the methamphetamine mines way too long.

522
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,940
It's time for you to find a new line of work.

523
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,940
Look at his fingernails.

524
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,440
They're all like Fu Manchu'd and long and have weird things sticking out.

525
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,640
I knew how dangerous it was when I went up there.

526
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,820
We all wanted to get off and those American, those brave Americans got off Earth.

527
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,660
Man is frozen as frosty spines.

528
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,800
Just a bunch of flaming monkeys falling from the sky.

529
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,840
I can't see out the window.

530
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,800
They're all glazed open.

531
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,900
Matt, have you ever saw flaming monkeys falling from the sky before?

532
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,760
Well, of course we've seen it numerous.

533
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,640
We saw it like 17 years ago.

534
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,100
Well, sure.

535
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,180
Back when the amphetamines were...

536
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,260
They were flaming.

537
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,320
Good reference, Strange.

538
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,220
He knows about flaming monkeys and amphetamines.

539
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,300
This whole thing gives me a great new idea to start up a whole new cottage industry.

540
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,700
A new burial technique for people with way too much money.

541
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,540
Cottage cheese.

542
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,460
Shoot their corpses up into orbit.

543
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,540
Cremation by re-entry.

544
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,240
Oh, I thought you were going to turn them into a cheese.

545
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,240
If you can't afford it, 100 grand will descend your head up and re-enter your head.

546
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,500
No, you don't even have to.

547
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,440
You just have to pump them up a little bit.

548
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:08,880
You know?

549
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,380
You don't even have to get them that high.

550
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,420
Why?

551
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,400
And they'll just come back down.

552
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,940
You could probably do it with a military device.

553
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,640
Why not leave them in the methamphetamine labs?

554
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,500
You just take their money and you throw their corpses on the heap with the rest of the rotting monkeys.

555
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,260
Why not re-amphetimate them?

556
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,140
You know what I mean?

557
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,380
Bring them back to life with the amphetamines we've created in our lab.

558
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,080
Admiral Timothy Leary, yeah, right.

559
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,920
And Admiral Posty Leary was honored by that type of cremation.

560
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,740
But he couldn't ejaculate at the wrong moment.

561
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,700
And so he was incinerated just the same.

562
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,580
Of course we believe in it.

563
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,300
You really believe we are?

564
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,280
We've actually been in space.

565
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,120
It's dog.

566
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,040
We've never been in space.

567
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,680
Hey, really, I don't believe we walked.

568
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,420
Nobody's ever made it outside the dome.

569
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,880
I don't believe we walked on the moon.

570
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,980
I don't.

571
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,000
You want to know why?

572
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,100
Nobody's ever really made it past those warehouse walls with Shell Beach painted on them.

573
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:01,480
Friends, the first half of this show, all those zillions of collages that mess with your head

574
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:08,500
were by the great cut-up of Alt.BinarySlack for NendeNendeLieber.

575
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:08,700
Mer.

576
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,280
Praise.

577
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,300
Leemer.

578
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,540
Of Leemuria.

579
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,440
And they were arranged by me.

580
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:21,700
In fact, friends, half of the next four shows will be the cut-ups from that great cut-up.

581
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:32,180
Now, there was also the long space collage preceding the talk of the sad shuttle situation.

582
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,020
And that collage was by the great Professor Chaz Smith.

583
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,380
Dances with rockets.

584
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:38,480


585
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
On ESO radio.

586
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,360
And, uh, friends, coming up, stay tuned for more, more, more.

587
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,640
Including this computer speaking by Heart Ignition.

588
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,180
Would you like to play a game of Genesis?

589
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,140
Would you like to play a game of Genesis?

590
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,820
Or maybe you would like to have sex?

591
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,560
With the dead body?

592
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,660
J.R.

593
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,240
Dock, you'll make that a reality.

594
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,660
Fruit is good.

595
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,320
Cheeks.

596
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:36,180
Sex with dead bodies is good.

597
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,640
So many of us posing is one thing.

598
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,100
In reality being something quite different.

599
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,340
Society, the highest claddom sort of self has been learning from London.

600
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,980
It might be been sleeping where he is.

601
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,060
However, as it would like to you and your to clear, and for you to be of his.

602
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,820
That's all I have to say.

603
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:07,000
I noticed that my capillaries are beginning to float to the surface.

604
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:07,800
I'm going to have to get a new one.

605
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:07,800


606
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,580
And they're starting to pop and roar like lamb's bread.

607
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,520
Lamb's bread.

608
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,820
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

609
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

610
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,140
Camera 5, you want to take down the shorts on the, uh, Numinator over there.

611
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,940
Looks like we've only got a high profile until a midway shot.

612
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,980
Looks like we need to go for a full shot of the...

613
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,900
A robotic flailer.

614
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,000
I don't believe...

615
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,120
Hey, how do you fix this robot, man?

616
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,120
On the moon.

617
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,200
I don't believe it.

618
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,040
I never could.

619
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,260
The robot's head exploded, dudes.

620
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,180
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

621
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,200
You know that...

622
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,660
Maybe Phil Spector actually grazed the shot, you know, Columbia as it was coming into our airspace.

623
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,660
As he was aiming at Xena's double.

624
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,620
He was already confused by thinking he was shooting at Xena.

625
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,240
He shot her double, but actually he fired five shots.

626
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,840
One went off the rim of the old canister there next to the neck, you know, neck...

627
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,120
So it was one of Phil Spector's...

628
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,180
...neck of the Philiac pool.

629
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,560
Ricochet bullets?

630
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,960
It might have been Phil Spector's Ricochet.

631
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,360
That brought down the...

632
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,020
Oh my God.

633
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,400
Think of it numerologically speaking.

634
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,300
Phil Spector has 11 as the numerological bedroom, which comes out to two.

635
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:16,660
Okay.

636
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,300
Needless to say.

637
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,160
All right, now two is an interface between the yin and the yang.

638
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,560
As we both know, it's a...

639
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:21,600
Right, right.

640
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,140
Duh.

641
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:22,840
Duh.

642
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:23,840
And everything.

643
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,140
Okay.

644
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,600
So you've got the yin and yang.

645
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,660
You've got a perfect balance.

646
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,140
And then he throws it out of balance.

647
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,800
And what have we got going on in space?

648
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,960
We've got a curry party.

649
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,020
We've got people talking about golf.

650
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,460
And next thing you know, the last...

651
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,540
Well, now how does Michael Jackson admitting to sleeping with the boy...

652
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:36,540


653
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,380
Boys have to play with it.

654
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,860
It's a hit.

655
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,220
These are all hits.

656
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,080
But did you...

657
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,480
The space shuttle was a hit.

658
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,560
Michael Jackson is having hits all over again.

659
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,760
His crappy albums are selling better than ever.

660
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,380
Okay, here's a conspiracy theory.

661
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,540
Did you hear that Michael Jackson, and the reason for his weird intolerance to sunlight

662
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,540
and his facial diseases, is that he was a former shuttle casualty?

663
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,340
Come to me.

664
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,760
I thought he was just an evil.

665
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,060
That's from a Canadian website.

666
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,560
That word come is an invitation.

667
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,520
Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson.

668
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:06,520


669
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:06,520


670
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:06,520


671
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,720
I'm not an alien or just a severely damaged astronaut.

672
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,120
Somewhere up there in the land of Pan, never, never land.

673
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,560
You know, like waiting for Captain Hook, I guess.

674
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,000
To come out of the sky and...

675
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,560
I'm Captain Hook.

676
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,100
You're Captain Hook, well I'm Peter Pan.

677
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,840
Come to me.

678
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,900
Tinker Bell, Wendy.

679
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,240
I am Captain Hook.

680
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,120
I am your father, Peter Pan.

681
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,760
Come to me.

682
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,940
Come and sit upon my pegged lap.

683
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,360
Come to me.

684
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,300
I will tell you the stories of seven leagues deep.

685
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,900
That word come is an invitation.

686
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,840
I'm the kind of pirate you've heard about, young Peter.

687
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:51,180
That's right, a modern pirate on a modern ship capable of taking down air force and

688
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,880
army weapons in...

689
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,200
Was that virtual too?

690
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:01,260
I mean, was that so-called nano-virtual or was that just like a...

691
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,380
I don't know what you're talking about, I didn't hear anything.

692
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,980
I'm talking about old blue eyes.

693
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,060
You know, talking about the lounge mood.

694
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,620
You're proud to be a ding-a-ling.

695
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,480
I am.

696
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,100
I'm past that cigar and give me a martini.

697
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,820
Proud to swing my ding-a-ling against your empty brain pad.

698
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,240
That's a just a ding-a-thing.

699
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,980
I'm not a baby dangler.

700
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,720
I'm not.

701
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,840
I'm not a baby dangler.

702
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,020
You're not a baby dangler?

703
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,420
I'm just hanging out with my kids.

704
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,460
He's not a baby dangler.

705
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:32,920
He's hanging out.

706
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,220
See, you can take that two ways.

707
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:34,760
Yeah, exactly.

708
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,100
That's very logical.

709
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,620
Because he's known to expose himself to the elephant or whatever the name.

710
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,640
If there is a God and he made everything beautiful, how'd you guys get here?

711
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,280
We came on the plane.

712
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,420
We came around the covenant nation.

713
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,160
We do not need people that are hung up this way.

714
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,360
That is the exact same grammatical form, obviously just reversed.

715
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,600
But I have a real problem.

716
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,720
If it means one and only one, obviously under 60, a person who is sober minded.

717
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,500
And if you can't handle that, we do not need people that are hung up this way.

718
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,140
You would get people more in tune with what may lie ahead.

719
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:24,140
I couldn't tell you what city it was or what, where everything started being somewhat civil

720
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,920
and pockets that are missing underneath civilization.

721
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,220
The upper floors of the high rises were just desolate.

722
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,580
Luster jumped bail two weeks ago, halfway through his date race.

723
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,060
He told the public, split, He

724
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:37,920
He said work can help you everywhere.

725
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,980
He said spiritual life is a these things you canilah isolate cream,

726
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:54,720
But it is real business, You know that?

727
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,320
That's what I help them enjoy.

728
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,000
University

729
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,380
Look out!

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,560


743
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,560

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,560

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,560

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,560


750
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,560

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,560

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:04,560


760
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,440
or three. Six and a half dozen of the

761
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,300
other. Patrons, Saints, Civilizations, and

762
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,520
parking meters.

763
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,180
Bet you didn't know that. You're not Catholic, are you?

764
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,580
So it's all like church stuff?

765
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,540
It's all church stuff all night long.

766
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,280
That's right.

767
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,500
Another hour and a half. Another hour and a half

768
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,320
in your ear. Church on one

769
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,760
channel.

770
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,500
You can roll over.

771
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,300
You can forget about us. Or you can call in now

772
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,640
and stop the show.

773
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,200
You can call in at

774
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,540
424-425 and stop the show now.

775
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,300
That's literally true, isn't that?

776
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,860
That's the way he would have wanted it

777
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,600
if someone would have given him a choice.

778
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,460
Yes, had they really

779
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,540
thought about it and dialed

780
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,840
010-484-425.

781
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,660
As many men could call in now

782
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,620
and stop this madness now.

783
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,660
That's right. That's the way he would have wanted it

784
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,380
if he wouldn't have wanted it that other way.

785
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,020
Ladies can call free.

786
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,460
Tell us there was not in this

787
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,680
horrible heat. Wait, that's you.

788
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,820
What the heck is going on?

789
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,760
No, that was my mentor

790
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,640
Jimmy Swagger.

791
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,980
Oh, they were animals and not human

792
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,540
beings.

793
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,120
He's talking about last week's

794
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,380
pinpoint.

795
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,120
Let's go eat some vegans for breakfast

796
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,960
after this show.

797
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,580
I give you my word, I will

798
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,040
smite this cancer.

799
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,920
Smite, smite, smite.

800
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,860
Smiting, some more smiting. Must be a band

801
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,640
thing. Smite you.

802
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,720
No, Smite was the guitarist.

803
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,640
He's the lead guitar guy.

804
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,480
Oh, I used to listen to the smites.

805
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,440
He may be a human,

806
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:34,860
but he's on the line.

807
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,740
On and on and on and on.

808
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,360
Never stop.

809
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,240
Although he may have a heart and a brain.

810
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,620
He lacks courage.

811
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,860
But all he...

812
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,700
What do they have

813
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,700
that he doesn't have?

814
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,460
They have medals of honor and valor.

815
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,960
We should not concern ourselves

816
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,280
about him because he has no legal right.

817
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,080
Bob had no legal right.

818
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,040
Bob was not a man

819
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,200
as we call men.

820
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,140
But let's leave.

821
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,760
But let's leave things of this world behind now.

822
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,660
Walk down the primrose

823
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,820
path of Bob

824
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,000
for this gauntlet of torture.

825
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,260
What?

826
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,940
Gabrochen. I can't say Gabrochen.

827
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,260
The Supreme Court said it better.

828
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,840
The Supreme Court said it better.

829
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,520
Don't call me a Gabrochen.

830
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,640
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stank.

831
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,720
Yes, these

832
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,760
wonderful moments of the past can be

833
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,660
yours today. If you call in now.

834
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,160
Call in now on the miracle of MP3.

835
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,980
Over 700,000 hours

836
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,460
of subgenius broadcast

837
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,220
on one CD.

838
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,940
More than you can listen to in an entire lifetime.

839
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,900
And you'll be forced to.

840
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,740
Incredible 7.5.

841
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,860
You'll be influenced by Dobstown.

842
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,180
Call in for a 4-4-2-1.

843
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,020
Dobstown.

844
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,540
Dobstown.

845
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,440
Dobstown.

846
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,260
Where am I going? Help me.

847
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,040
Why am I going to...

848
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,640
Did I win that CD?

849
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,420
Yeah.

850
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,000
Now listen to this song

851
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,300
and it's Hypno Theory.

852
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,540
Ironically

853
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,320
enough, the Dobstown song is from

854
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,280
Lee Murray. That's right.

855
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,060
I thought it was Wilbur Harrison.

856
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,860
He knows that.

857
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,440
I mean, we must brainwash our children.

858
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,200
What are you guys on

859
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,920
when you're doing that show, man?

860
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,440
Oh, yeah.

861
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,380
Come on, you can tell me.

862
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,880
I see you've done toilet on your floor.

863
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,100
A song?

864
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,380
I mean, this...

865
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,500
Song?

866
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,320
Caller.

867
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,860
My little son, caller.

868
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,980
This song is dedicated to you.

869
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,540
And your trippy amp today.

870
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,980
Can you just fast forward the whole show?

871
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,160
I want to get out of here.

872
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,780
No, down.

873
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,640
Just, you know, go down.

874
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,640
Down.

875
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,640
Just go down.

876
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,260
Down.

877
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,080


878
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,300
Down.

879
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,020
Down.

880
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,020
Down.

881
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,440
Down.

882
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:05,840
Down.

883
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,080
Down.

884
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,080


885
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,080


886
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,900
But I did go downtown.

887
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,220
No, come on.

888
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,380
Just go down.

889
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,300
Yeah, how's it going?

890
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:11,640
Just go down.

891
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,340
And then say, stereo.

892
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,780
I am a cave.

893
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,820
Fernando Mandela.

894
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,980
All those cutouts.

895
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,360
Yes, Burbid.

896
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,800
I just got into the studio.

897
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,020
No.

898
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,040
Slack mixes by you.

899
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,360
Rock music is leading our young.

900
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,960
people to drug addiction and promiscuity.

901
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,620
You seem a little nervous, my friend.

902
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,200
You're just a strange kind of fire, so...

903
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,840
You're selling me from beyond.

904
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,420
You'd better be ready

905
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,020
to speak your piece.

906
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,360
You can't...

907
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,360
Call me from beyond.

908
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,080
You disturb my rest of sleep

909
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,680
with your childish games.

910
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,680
You don't know what you're playing with.

911
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,880
This is not a game

912
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,840
for little boys and girls.

913
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,360
This is not a game

914
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,080
for little boys and girls.

915
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,460
This is a game

916
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:07,460


917
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,060
Look, we're not just another stupid heavy metal band.

918
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,740
Listen to your music backwards and reverse.

919
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,140
It's okay, world, but...

920
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,380
You can't do that.

921
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,840
Heavy metal, heavy metal, heavy metal.

922
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,780
I'm not saying I don't...

923
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,180
Well, you know, I'm kind of...

924
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,980
The bottom of the age...

925
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,300
Right.

926
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,380
I'm not saying I don't...

927
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,280
Heavy metal is heavy. Get it?

928
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,440
Cool!

929
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,540
You ran for me.

930
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,280
I used to be a nice guy just like you.

931
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,720
And then I found...

932
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,860
The truth is in the taking...

933
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,400
You know what's wrong with you.

934
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,620
I will need a lie.

935
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,520
I bet you have a spit in your face.

936
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,400
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,800
I'm sorry.

938
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,460
You ran for me.

939
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,860
Better be ready to face the consequences.

940
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,760
It's never too late to redeem yourself.

941
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,880
One last chance.

942
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,220
That's all you have.

943
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,220
It's up to you.

944
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,160
You ran for me.

945
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,360
No escaping my eyes.

946
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,000
You'll see them in every dream.

947
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,200
You'll see them in every dream.

948
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:58,560
You will see them in your dreams.

949
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,340
You will see them in your dreams.

950
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,340
A dream you can't ever see for real.

951
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,180
A dream you'll never see for real.

952
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,840
You'll see them in every dream.

953
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,760
You'll never escape the eyes.

954
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,880
A dream you can't ever see for real.

955
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:23,660
The sun will never shine in the eyes again.

956
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,780
Would you like to be my ex-girlfriend?

957
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,740
Oh yeah!

958
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,180
You'll still be my ex-girlfriend.

959
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:28,180


960
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,400
Ready for me from beyond?

961
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,900
You've got to be ready to face the truth, my friend.

962
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,720
I'm here for you, slow.

963
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,640
That was...

964
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,440
That was...

965
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,200
That was...

966
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,680
You rang from Reverend Bill T. Miller.

967
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:08,000
And you can get a lot of free Reverend Bill T. Miller music from...

968
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,160
www.billtmiller.com

969
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,380
www.billtmiller.com

970
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,420
When girls go by, then I play high.

971
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,000
I thrill them with each note.

972
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,400
Oh, how I get their goat.

973
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,260
I'm the fellow with the fiddle.

974
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,720
Oh, boy, I can play the best in town.

975
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,020
I make a smile from every round.

976
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,100
And every time I start to play,

977
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,560
I say the whole of Dorna Town begins to sway.

978
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,780
A-votey, votey, votey, and a-fretz-hat-say.

979
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,280
A-root-a-toot-a-toot-a, and a-raz-a-ma-taz.

980
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,420
When I play, though, the girls say,

981
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,520
Oh, and tremble like they're freezing.

982
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,960
I know that I'm the reason,

983
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,580
for I'm the fellow with the fiddle.

984
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,840
Oh, boy, I can play the best in town.

985
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,500
Oh, boy, I can play the best in town.

986
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:05,560
Oh, boy, I can play the best in town.

987
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,120
Just a little girl, she'd come in,

988
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,800
and she'd see, she'd notice,

989
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,260
and she'd run all around.

990
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,340
And she'd want to ask her mother for a fiddle.

991
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,920
And she'd learn to sing for her.

992
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,020
She'd tell her mother, say,

993
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,400
Sing for your fiddle and you can get it.

994
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,020
And she'd jump out in front of her and sing.

995
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,840
Give me a little fiddle.

996
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,700
No, a titty mama, titty.

997
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,800
Titty mama, titty.

998
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,160
Just give me a little titty, please, ma'am.

999
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,080
Just give me a little titty, please, ma'am.

1000
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,780
A titty on the hill, mama.

1001
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,060
Just give me a little titty, please, ma'am.

1002
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,100
Just give me a little titty, please, ma'am.

1003
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:39,960
Say it again.

1004
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,160
Titty mama, titty.

1005
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,260
Titty mama, titty.

1006
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,640
Just give me a little titty, please, ma'am.

1007
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,500
Just give me a little titty, please, ma'am.

1008
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,180
A titty on the hill, mama.

1009
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,160
A titty on the hill, mama.

1010
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,140
A titty on the hill, mama.

1011
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,700
A titty on the hill, mama.

1012
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:09,880
Friends, that was Mary McDonald, and I don't know anything more about that.

1013
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,160
Before that, we heard a little bit of Mel Blanc singing Fellow with a Fiddle

1014
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,460
from the Warner Brothers cartoon of the same name.

1015
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:24,540
This music in the background is from the amino acids from Detroit.

1016
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,820
Check out www.aminoacids.com.

1017
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,020
We're going to be doing a revival in Detroit soon with the amino acids.

1018
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,300
Ah, yes.

1019
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,860
And now this.

1020
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,540
Boy, he was quite a man, Bob Dobbs.

1021
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,960
Right, that Bob.

1022
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,240
Quite a woman, too.

1023
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,840
He was everything. He was an animal.

1024
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,060
He was an animal.

1025
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,360
He made a believer out of you.

1026
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,420
J.R. Bob Dobbs was an amoeba.

1027
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,040
He was an amoeba and a super genius.

1028
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:02,420
He was like the smartest amoeba that ever existed and the most mindless man.

1029
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,500
He was like Big Brother and Little Daddy at the same time.

1030
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,540
You felt like love-hate in one emotion at the same consternation.

1031
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,420
Right, like the tallest midget and the shortest giant.

1032
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,740
You knew both concepts at one time.

1033
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,300
You'd see him, you'd know height and small at the same time.

1034
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,000
You could feel it, you could smell it.

1035
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,960
He was like the essence of everything.

1036
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,600
Like the cleanest dirt.

1037
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,480
Oh, they used to use that clean dirt.

1038
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,340
Bob used to give off clean dirt that sprang flowers and little vegetables out.

1039
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,480
He was like the driest water.

1040
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,840
He was like Santa Ana winds blowing a big old polar bear.

1041
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,880
Try not to.

1042
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,480
He was like burning hot ice.

1043
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,920
He was like that polar bear in a bad dance club.

1044
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,220
He was like the furniture you can't believe in and yet you try.

1045
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,040
He was the source.

1046
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,380
He was the...

1047
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:52,940
He was...

1048
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,360
He was...

1049
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:54,980
Bob.

1050
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,380
Bob.

1051
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,300
Bob.

1052
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,220
Bob.

1053
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:58,680
Bob.

1054
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,040
He's gonna be back.

1055
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,160
I know he's gonna be back.

1056
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,440
I know he's gonna be back.

1057
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,600
He's gonna be back.

1058
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,860
J.R. Bob Dobbs, if you're listening to me now...

1059
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,780
I have faith.

1060
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:11,980
He's gonna be back.

1061
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,480
Faith in you.

1062
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,040
He made the salmon sweat.

1063
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,700
He made the eye cheese come out where it's not supposed to grow.

1064
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,520
He made the Eskimo buy ice.

1065
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,780
He made the ice for the sorcerers.

1066
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:29,680
And he kissed each and every one of them with an Eskimo.

1067
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,280
He sold hate to the Nazis.

1068
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,400
He gave love.

1069
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,200
He gave love wherever he could find a place to sit down.

1070
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:44,620
He sold hypocrisy to the Baptists.

1071
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:52,320
He sold retardation to the subgenius.

1072
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:52,620
Yes.

1073
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,560
Yes.

1074
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,520
Yes.

1075
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1076
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1077
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1078
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1079
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1080
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1081
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1082
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1083
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1084
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1085
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1086
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1087
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1088
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1089
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1090
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1091
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1092
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,520


1093
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,180
Sold water.

1094
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,660
He sold water to old St. Nick.

1095
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,080
He sold a fluoroscope to his uncle.

1096
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,120
And then he sold himself out of business.

1097
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,640
But he still kept on being and seeing and being the source.

1098
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,000
He had insurance, my friend.

1099
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,040
Bob had insurance.

1100
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:12,660
Do you?

1101
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,980
Do you have Bob's insurance policy?

1102
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,180
Bob is your insurance policy, my friends.

1103
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,480
And it's just one payment you make.

1104
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,520
The premium lasts forever and ever and ever.

1105
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,500
And never comes back.

1106
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,440
And if for any reason you should chance to die or drive into a car

1107
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,060
or perhaps just fall asleep and not wake up sometimes,

1108
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,920
that's your problem.

1109
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:36,940
And that's Bob too?

1110
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,960
He's your insurance policy?

1111
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,820
And he's what kills you both at the same time?

1112
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:48,660
Bob resold your insurance policy to a crooked bunch of weird scam artists at the Pentagon.

1113
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,200
Because he loved you.

1114
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,580
He had so much love for you.

1115
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,440
Look, look, look at his leg.

1116
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:55,540
He's...

1117
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,620
He needs a towel.

1118
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,260
He can't...

1119
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:02,360
Bob loves you more than you love anything.

1120
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,420
Oh, those chromosomes are so bleak.

1121
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:10,180
But at the same time, if you could just pack one little bit of that essence...

1122
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,500
They're rock hard, the chromosomes are.

1123
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,180
You'd be rock hard like those chromosomes.

1124
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,060
Oh, yeah.

1125
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,280
I'm not a baby dangler.

1126
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,640
I'm not a baby dangler.

1127
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,100
Bob's a baby dangler.

1128
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,520
He dangled you at the moment of your birth.

1129
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:25,120
He dangled me.

1130
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,260
And it's taken all this time for you to wake up.

1131
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,820
Is he gonna smack you?

1132
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,900
Are you gonna wake up and start breathing and being alive?

1133
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:32,660
Baby poop poop bait!

1134
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,880
...city probe scanner.

1135
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,620
Are you gonna just be...

1136
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,860
...across some illegal sexual activity?

1137
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,020
A reprobate.

1138
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,980
It should be on your DTO screen now.

1139
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:41,540
Reprobate.

1140
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,200
Pay close attention to the following transmission.

1141
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,020
Your eyes may become unfocused.

1142
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,300
You may feel heat around the back of your neck and shoulders.

1143
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,760
The forehead may become indented.

1144
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:53,840
Ooh, that feels good, Bob.

1145
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,360
Further down. A little further down.

1146
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,320
I'm phasing.

1147
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,120
I'm phasing now.

1148
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,400
Ooh, nope, I got...

1149
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,120
I...

1150
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,520
I got a squishy.

1151
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,720
Oh, that's perfect.

1152
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,040
Wait a minute.

1153
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,680
I'm gonna put it in my pants.

1154
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,120
Oh, that's perfect.

1155
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:09,620


1156
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:09,620


1157
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:09,620


1158
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:09,620


1159
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,280
Pipe down.

1160
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,640
Pipe down in there.

1161
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,580
Bob's trying to sleep.

1162
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:13,720
Hey!

1163
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:14,780
Pipe down!

1164
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,980
Bob's trying to sleep!

1165
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:16,660
Shh.

1166
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,140
Shh.

1167
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:17,600
Shh.

1168
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:18,980
Relax.

1169
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,820
Let go.

1170
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,040
Let go.

1171
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:23,820
Let go.

1172
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:23,820


1173
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,260
Oh, it's very, very easy.

1174
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,260
Talk to the leper first.

1175
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,520
You don't encourage the leper.

1176
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,460
You talk to the leper.

1177
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,760
It's hard for a leper to change its patches.

1178
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:39,360
Take it.

1179
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,000
You're in there.

1180
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,540
Okay, you're impaired now.

1181
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,580
Oh, disgusting.

1182
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,960
Your convolution.

1183
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:53,940
My

1184
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:59,080
Galena wants you to listen to this music with pride now.

1185
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:04,680
The music will make you hard and frightened.

1186
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,480
Frightened and hard.

1187
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:13,920
Take down those, take down those, take down those drops.

1188
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Who's there?

1189
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,860
It's the tax assessor.

1190
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,200
Tax assessor?

1191
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,880
Tax assessor?

1192
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,140
Tax assessor?

1193
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:09,280
A little music there from Fellow with a Fiddle, and now more from Reverend Cobblestone's collage.

1194
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,280
Yes, I'm just pleased about the loss of the manufacturing command and presence that we once enjoyed.

1195
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,300
It's gone the route of what everything else has in America.

1196
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,920
A global war of...

1197
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,980
One world order, the new world order, whatever you want to call it.

1198
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,140
The culture of death.

1199
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,360
The culture of death.

1200
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:36,940
You know, I guess I was vaguely weak, but until you said flat out, it hasn't been in my consciousness.

1201
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,340
Isn't that special?

1202
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,520
Well, I think you're right here.

1203
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:46,540
The effect of the sense of modernity, the American values, have some value.

1204
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,700
I'm not going to take that ride.

1205
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,360
No, I'm not going to.

1206
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,920
Let's have a moment of silence for the little twinkle twinkle.

1207
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,420
Twinkle little stars that burned up in the atmosphere.

1208
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,660
Yeah, that is kind of, you know...

1209
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,260
They got off.

1210
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,480
They got off.

1211
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,860
You know, I'm always so radical in my stanchies.

1212
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:08,280
I get all sheepy when I think of, what's your name, the Indian girl.

1213
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,400
Dave's got the hot...

1214
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,360
He's looking at the pictures.

1215
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,940
Well, I have. I have no necronomicon or whatever you call them.

1216
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,300
You know, I'm not a necrophiliac.

1217
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,300
Or affiliated with any of those.

1218
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,380
You're an asher.

1219
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,380
An asher.

1220
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,840
They like it dry, eh?

1221
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,300
They like it dry, don't they?

1222
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,300
Eh.

1223
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,680
Just add water and you're back to...

1224
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,740
All the basic ingredients, just make them up in your own mind the way you want them.

1225
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,980
A moment of silence is a kind of a heart...

1226
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:35,720
A little crack.

1227
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,740
When you have a day...

1228
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:38,080
Did you hear?

1229
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:39,760
A day.

1230
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,380
It's a moment of silence.

1231
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,320
God bless America.

1232
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,640
God bless the space program.

1233
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:52,480
And may we continue to shoot monkeys into space in the name of science.

1234
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,220
Yes.

1235
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:53,400
Yes.

1236
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,780
It's the best way...

1237
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:59,840
It's a better reason for killing people than some you can come up with.

1238
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:05,160
May we continue to hook small animals up to car batteries to see what happens.

1239
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,640
That's a taxpayer's expense.

1240
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,860
Works for me.

1241
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,840
After all, the shuttle program was funded by CIA drug money.

1242
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,160
I thought you were going to say CIA druggies.

1243
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,640
You know how good they are at fooling things.

1244
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,560
It's all funded by the CIA drug money.

1245
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,280
And Labrador's smuggling ring.

1246
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,140
Why do you think they called the first shuttle Columbia?

1247
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:23,920
Can I ask you a question?

1248
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:23,920


1249
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,560
Can I ask you a secret question?

1250
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,660
Are you a bonesman?

1251
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,800
They don't want you touching the wreckage.

1252
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,680
They're afraid you'll find the CIA stash that was hidden in the cargo bag.

1253
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,480
Bales of cocaine falling all over Midwest.

1254
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,080
The aliens.

1255
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,000
Well, I think Chaz had it right on the nostril.

1256
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,620
No, it was actually Stang who had the wrong nostril, right?

1257
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:40,960
You claim...

1258
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,820
They discovered the dangerous satellite they were putting out in the nick of time

1259
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:48,020
and were about to land and explain what had happened.

1260
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,880
And they were silenced by them.

1261
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:50,580
Good night.

1262
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,280
Good night.

1263
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:52,340
Good night.

1264
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,020
Good night.

1265
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:53,200
That's right.

1266
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,440
That's right.

1267
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,960
Till next week, keep your hat on tight.

1268
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,680
You're back to the wind.

1269
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:57,640
You're sacking the saddle.

1270
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,280
See y'all.

1271
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,960
Give your sack to Princess Wayne.

1272
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,820
Become an astronaut.

1273
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,800
Achieve your dreams in the sky.

1274
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,360
Look to the blue as your nostrils inflame.

1275
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,760
You will realize...

1276
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,700
Now the party's over.

1277
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,200
Now the party's over.

1278
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,880

1287
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:06,880
Good.

1288
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,240
Good.

1289
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,940
Ha ha ha.

1290

Ha ha.

1291

Ha ha.

1292
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,700
No, no, no.

1293
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,440
No, no, no.

1294
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,200
No, no, no.

1295
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,940
No, no, no.

1296
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,680
No, no, no.

1297
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,400
No, no, no.

1298
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,320
Good night.

Come in.

1300
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:29,740
Goodbye, dear Pietro.

1301
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:30,500
Oh.

1302
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,920
Goodbye.

1303
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:33,920


1304
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:35,420


1305
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:35,420


1306
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:35,420


1307
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:35,420


1308
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:35,520


1309
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:35,660
Goodbye.

1310
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:35,740
Goodbye.

1311
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:36,400
Goodbye.

1312
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,700
Why?

1313
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,600
Why?
