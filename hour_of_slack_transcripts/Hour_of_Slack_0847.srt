1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,240
If you are watching this video at the moment, you are the remnants of a lost planet.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
That is correct, the planet Earth, which has since been destroyed.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,420
Yes, destroyed, my friends, by the men from Planet X.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,360
Yes, but in the time that the Earth did exist, a savior came.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,080
And that savior's name was Bob.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,620
And he saved a small group of plentiful young people called the subgenius,

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,940
who were led by a crazed charlatan by the name of Reverend Ivan Stang.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,260
Yes, my friends, this Reverend Ivan Stang led this group of crazed charlatans,

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,080
the last real Americans to quote Pope David and Meyer,

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,160
to salvation, slack, and eternal happiness, pleasure, and ooze squirt.

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,980
Life dropped by the majestic bank.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,540
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,520
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag.

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,340
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.

15
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,060
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag.

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,160
Thank you for joining us.

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,360
I'm Bob Gold.

18
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,360


19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,420
We are the Black Black Space.

20
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,800
We are the Black Black Space.

21
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,280
We are the Black Black Space.

22
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,040
We are the Black Black Space.

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,420
Burn! Burn!

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,440
My favorite thing about this whole quest

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,760
is being able to wipe out as many people as you want

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,420
without guilt, without any feelings of remorse

27
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,840
or any feelings of having done something wrong.

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,260
Or at least to have fantasies of doing so without guilt.

29
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,240
Well, isn't it all a fantasy?

30
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,320
A big, fat, freaky...

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,100
Does this take you back?

32
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,880
To Club Tiki Banzai,

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,820
Thursday night.

34
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
I smell more than vomit.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,640
Every time I think about Club Tiki Banzai,

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,440
I want to puke.

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,600
It smells like banana vomit

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,940
mixed with a little bit of whatever kind of green stuff

39
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,700
they chew on in the forest.

40
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,560
After you told me,

41
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,420
when you found El Gordo and Princess Party Girl

42
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,740
in your van going at it...

43
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,920
Oh, I wasn't supposed to talk about that in public.

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,320
No, not in my van.

45
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,660
That's where I had to go to sleep.

46
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,760
El Gordo y La Flaca.

47
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,520
El Gordo y Princess Party Girl.

48
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,580
Y La Flaca.

49
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,820
I couldn't believe it, man.

50
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,780
I thought they were enemies.

51
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,120
They'd been screaming at each other earlier.

52
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,940
And then, man, to hear that...

53
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,680
I can't believe El Gordo lowered himself like that.

54
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,620
But, you know, Brushwood and the end of the world

55
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,300
combined have that effect on people.

56
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:08,780
You're right.

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,500
As our little social experiment is proving increasingly each year.

58
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,320
Lowering, yeah.

59
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,900
Leveling the IQ.

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,160
Many people could hardly lift their chins from the ground.

61
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,980
Everything has been flattened.

62
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,160
The eardrum hairs...

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,780
It has flattened.

64
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,960
The higher register, the heart...

65
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,540
In fact, there are still...

66
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,620
Well, I did not think it was...

67
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,400
...flattened into the quicksilver out there in Spumanti heaven.

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,260
I did not think it was a coincidence

69
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,880
that as soon as I get back from X-Day,

70
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,400
they make the announcement about finding the 7 million year old human.

71
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,460
Well, pre-human.

72
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,240
This just pushes the...

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,760
Well, yeah.

74
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,400
This is the most delightful thing I've ever seen.

75
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,180
I held it in my hand.

76
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,220
It pushes the divergence point.

77
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,340
I just couldn't believe it.

78
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,420
I was filled with delight.

79
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,600
I was squealing like a little girl.

80
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,400
About 2 million years.

81
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,260
It was not a simian in its purest form.

82
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,340
But it wasn't human.

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,980
But it was so smooth and round.

84
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,980
And I loved it.

85
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,400
And I tenderly held it.

86
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,920
And I thought of what it might look like without hair.

87
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,480
But it had plenty of hair, didn't it?

88
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,020
I don't know.

89
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,380
Which one?

90
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,700
The first bonobo from 7 trillion bazillion years ago

91
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,320
that they just found 2,800 meters from the Oldenby Gorge.

92
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,180
The champ just found it X-Day on his cot.

93
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,080
Yeah.

94
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,160
The throwback.

95
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,500
The original promo Anthropocus.

96
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,700
The first footed man.

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,260
What I want to know is...

98
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,240
Or woman in this case.

99
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Which I noticed was chasing you all over the place, Chaz.

100
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,300
Six-finger man.

101
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,640
But Chaz is six-finger man.

102
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,600
He don't mess with five-toe woman hanging from trees.

103
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,140
No.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
Five-toe woman kicking nose with feet.

105
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

106
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,000
Why did you guys stop the international...

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,340
Before drummer.

108
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:53,800
Before drummer.

109
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:53,800


110
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,020
Before staying.

111
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,060
Why did you stop the international Red Cross from entering the campsite is what I want to know.

112
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,260
Hey, man.

113
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,520
It's part of the adventure of X-Day.

114
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,060
It's the mental illness, the injuries, the bugs in the ear.

115
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,000
Did you hear about the guy who got a Dobson fly trapped in his ear?

116
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,780
The gynecologist from Baltimore?

117
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,600
St. Michael Dark Angel.

118
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,380
Dark Angel.

119
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,500
From Quijibo cartel.

120
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,860
Ended up screaming for hours.

121
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,720
Well, that was one of the...

122
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,200
He had a bug, a live bug in his ear.

123
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,640
That was one of the penile implants.

124
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,500
It's on the insects that you had to develop.

125
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,360
Well, that's part of the fun of X-Day.

126
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,400
It's a challenge.

127
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,940
You know, some of these kids don't know how to build a fire.

128
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,820
They can build a computer, but not a fire.

129
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,120
No, that's why they kept hanging out at Tranquility Bay.

130
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,520
That's right.

131
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,360
They got to go back to the basics.

132
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:40,880
Fire.

133
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,940
Let's go to where there's fire.

134
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,500
There's much the pagans can teach us about things like fires.

135
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,060
I couldn't believe they were so ignorant.

136
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,320
Many of the young Bobby children, I couldn't believe they were so ignorant of the common ways of the folk of the forest.

137
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,340
They're too goddamn high.

138
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,180
I'm sorry, Bob.

139
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,700
I'm a fucking Bob.

140
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,020
I'm the unscoring scourge, my Bob.

141
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
Bob Burr must have been.

142
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,300
I can't stand his presence.

143
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,400
Burning man, eat your heart out.

144
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:12,960
Yeah.

145
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,140
Follow Stan, children.

146
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,820
This music just takes me right back to the...

147
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,040
Those pulsing bodies.

148
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:40,740
Somebody told me that, well, several people who had been to Burning Man observed that your camp looked exactly like Burning Man, but with trees and nice weather.

149
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,300
Yeah.

150
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,940
Otherwise, the same thing.

151
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,800
Topless maidens all body-colored up, dancing around.

152
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,960
Isn't it crazy?

153
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,800
Except for the one thing.

154
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,600
We also had the, you know, the lame, the halt.

155
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,400
The spaz, the tard, the subgenius, you know?

156
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,400
The weird.

157
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,080
The down-home people.

158
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,060
The for-real down-home bulldagger.

159
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,640
The genetic misfirings of a race gone bad.

160
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,320
Yes, baby.

161
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,880
Yes, baby.

162
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,720
Surely, if the flutocrats were out that night in their black chompers, they would have vomited in their own stew.

163
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,060
And there was fire.

164
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:16,940
Fire.

165
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,080
It was fun.

166
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,420
Yeah.

167
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,360
The game was lighting some fires with that waffle maker.

168
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,680
From the Vulcan Earth.

169
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:22,980
It's...

170
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,500
Oh, you got...

171
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,800
You didn't even see the burning of the giant Dobbs icon.

172
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,840
No, I was getting ready for the show.

173
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,200
But that was, like, kind of stalling things a little.

174
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:32,760
But that's fine.

175
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,380
I didn't care.

176
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,860
I just was...

177
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,640
I was in my show head.

178
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,020
You were...

179
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,420
I worried about that a little bit.

180
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,760
You were getting ready for a show.

181
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:40,900
Yeah.

182
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,880
And suddenly, you know, I mean, there you were, pumping up.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,420
You were about ready to splort.

184
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,200
And suddenly, it was, you know, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

185
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,440
Can't go now.

186
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,320
Mission control.

187
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:50,840
Yeah.

188
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,000
Hold the bus.

189
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:52,820
Wait.

190
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,340
We got...

191
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,360
We got a hold on that launch there.

192
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:55,900
Yeah.

193
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,080
Now, what exactly...

194
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,480
Don't push the button yet, kids.

195
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,720
Did you shed on fire?

196
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,900
Was it a huge facial icon?

197
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,620
But I was in the...

198
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,780
I wanted to go down there.

199
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,340
It actually looked like his face.

200
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,320
I wanted to go see it.

201
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,440
You know, but I...

202
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,120
I just had to maintain what I was doing.

203
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,780
It was about an eight-foot high replica of the Dobbs icon, that symbol that Jesus invented

204
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,800
a couple of years ago.

205
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,760
You know, the one...

206
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,160
The goon says that.

207
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,120
You see all the time.

208
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,780
The goon says he made that and gave it to Jesus.

209
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,080
Well, what about the 42...

210
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,980
The 42-foot owl that was slept from Bohemia Grove?

211
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,360
Like him says.

212
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,140
That's a funny game.

213
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,860
He wrote it on a napkin or something.

214
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,440
That's a funny game.

215
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,380
I'm still tickled about that owl, man.

216
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,560
I never saw anything like that at a Church of the Subgenius Festival.

217
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:44,140
A 42-foot owl with all of the world's powerful elite dancing around in weird druid robes and

218
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,240
things like that.

219
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,480
It was truly a sight for a sword.

220
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:47,700
Yeah.

221
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,040
It was weird.

222
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,100
No, no, no.

223
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,400
No, no, no.

224
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,200
No, no, no.

225
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,420
No, no, no.

226
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:52,420


227
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:52,900
No, no, no.

228
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,060
No, no, no.

229
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,060


230
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,060


231
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,060


232
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,200
No, no, no.

233
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,260
Uh-oh.

234
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,500
It looks oddly like a satanic cross.

235
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,420
It now resembles an upside-down cross with an upside-down pipe.

236
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,040
Actually, it looks sort of like a rocket ship, man, with its thrusters and wings.

237
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:13,440
Yeah.

238
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,080


239
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,840
Yeah.

240
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,360
Yeah.

241
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,700
Yeah.

242
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:26,740
Yeah.

243
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:33,600
He who can only eat two beans, but he walked many miles.

244
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,720
What are you burning this year?

245
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
I'm burning...

246
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:46,420
Well, I was going to burn this, my Office Max employee ID card, but I decided to do

247
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,080
something else.

248
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,220
So I'm not burning anything except for inhibitions.

249
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,080
Anything related?

250
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:16,720
There was one thing definitely that talked about the end time a lot earlier.

251
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:16,740
Okay.

252
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,600
And I thought it might be really important for you to know that maybe we should think

253
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:18,600


254
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,380
Sorry, I can not take it.

255
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,800
Shout out?

256
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,060
...

257
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,060
Is it the fifth yet?

258
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,100
Did it swap?

259
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:25,920
No.

260
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,720
No?

261
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,080
Yes?

262
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,600
I don't watch.

263
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,780
Well, okay, when it is the fifth, when the clock strikes midnight, we have seven hours

264
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,300
left on this planet.

265
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,640
Seven hours left.

266
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,880
You have nothing to lose.

267
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,440
All bets are off.

268
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,320
You can say anything that you want to say.

269
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,900
All those little inhibitions, you should burn them like I burned my car last year.

270
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,940
Tomorrow, the world ends and we will die.

271
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:06,460
It's time for us to stand up and say what we want to say, such as myself.

272
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:13,120
I myself have been wanting to say this one thing to this person all fucking day since

273
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,000
I saw her.

274
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,020
I've just been too chicken.

275
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,420
Big Bad Two Beans is shy around.

276
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:20,960
Girl.

277
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,320
Yes.

278
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,480
But, but, is Rabbi available in the crowd?

279
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,760
Obviously not.

280
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,560
Rabbi?

281
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,540
Hi.

282
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,260
Hi.

283
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,980
I wanted to tell you that your eyes are amongst the most beautiful that I've ever seen in

284
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,380
my life.

285
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,380
And you put her.

286
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:50,380


287
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,620
Angels to shame with your beauty.

288
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,640
It's the power of Connie, bitch.

289
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,460
And you are the true manifestation of Connie Dobbs.

290
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,300
So, in other words, I really dig ya.

291
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,640
You're a cool chick.

292
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,900
I like ya.

293
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,880
Say it!

294
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,960
Praise Bob.

295
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,700
Praise Bob.

296
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,740
Praise Bob and praise burning inhibitions!

297
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:38,020
lie one Ly Exata-

309
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,640
You know, God hates you.

310
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,780
Stay away from him.

311
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:58,980
Licentiousness.

312
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,580
Just unbridled, uncontrolled excesses.

313
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,920
That was something he invented.

314
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,420
That was just my little bit of introduction for what I'd like y'all to do.

315
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,860
I mean, let's talk about getting off here.

316
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,480
Let's talk about loving oneself.

317
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
I mean, really, I mean, loving.

318
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,060
Loving oneself.

319
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,680
I didn't introduce myself really well, but I'm Priestess Pisces,

320
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,760
and I'm the founder of the little-known Wankers for Bob.

321
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,960
Wankers for Bob!

322
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,940
Wankers for Bob!

323
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:38,620
And I am going to talk just a brief bit about one of my favorite topics, masturbation.

324
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,580
I mean, where do we start here?

325
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,720
I mean, all you guys, you know, you pull the pudge, you spank the monkey,

326
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,260
choke the chicken, wax the dolphin, fist bang it a little bit, play pocket pool.

327
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:49,840
What?

328
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:50,820
What do we start?

329
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,380
Absolutely nothing, baby.

330
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,540
Absolutely nothing.

331
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:01,660
What I would like to say is, ladies, you've got to pet Miss Kitty every so often, okay?

332
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,200
Pet Miss Kitty.

333
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,420
Because if you don't pet Miss Kitty, you won't know how to make her purr.

334
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,280
Okay?

335
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,640
Pet Miss Kitty.

336
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,340
Pet Miss Kitty, but it takes porno.

337
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,900
I mean, God, porno.

338
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Isn't porno great?

339
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,500
I love porno.

340
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,720
Amateur porno.

341
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,020
Amateur porno, yeah, there you go.

342
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,200
You know, and there's a lot of, you know, feminazi psychos that would say,

343
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,860
oh my God, you're a woman and you like porn.

344
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,080
Yeah, I like strip clubs too, bitch, thanks.

345
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,940
But, and they would want to kill people like Larry Flynn.

346
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,320
You know, Larry Flynn is a saint.

347
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,060
Yeah.

348
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,140
I mean.

349
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,540
Yeah.

350
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,380
What?

351
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,040
He's not a saint.

352
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,280
Exactly.

353
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,740
He's a crazy, he's a marvered saint, nearly.

354
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,020
I mean, what you have to believe is that in the past 20 years, the development of pornography

355
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,360
has increased at such a beautiful rate.

356
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,800
In ways that your granddaddy's chaplain couldn't even have nightmares about.

357
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,300
I mean, we're talking everything.

358
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:07,080
There's a world of geek, of buffet for both men and women and men and men and women and

359
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,260
women and women and toys and men and toys and probably toys and toys, but I haven't

360
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,800
found it yet.

361
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,720
Farm animals.

362
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,220
Farm animals, yes.

363
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,920
I always forget the farm animals.

364
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,000
You know, and many of you ever want to send me porn.

365
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,680
I really don't like the farm animals.

366
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't like the farm animals.

367
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,360
I really don't like the farm animals.

368
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,860
If you think that's cool, just skip the farm animals for me, please.

369
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,980
Well, anyway, with all this said, what I'm trying to do is encouraging you to wank more.

370
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,100
You know, I did a little rally a little while back after the whole, you know, possible early

371
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,740
end of the world scare to wank for peace.

372
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,940
I was trying to get all you fuckers together so that you could all wank at the same time.

373
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,600
You guys are hard to find.

374
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,240
Don't talk to anybody.

375
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:50,740
Do you?

376
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,420
Yeah.

377
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,260
But, you know, wank for peace, wank for slack, wank because it gets you off, wank because

378
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,640
if you don't, you're going to fuck the next star named Rottweiler.

379
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,980
I mean, whatever.

380
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,660
Just, you know, the only way we're going to get off this planet is if we get off more.

381
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:16,420
Um, you know, my theory kind of is based on the fact that if you imagine all this subgenius

382
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,740
getting together and everybody is getting off.

383
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,700
We're all in a proximate same time.

384
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,800
The very stench of Getty's sex should be just enough to draw the saucers down from the heavens

385
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,620
like redneck to an Earnhardt shrine.

386
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,080
I mean, it should be just enough.

387
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,360
And so the whole reason I'm getting up here to sum up is telling you to please get off

388
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,920
so we all can get off the planet.

389
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,420
Just remember that as your mantra.

390
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,000
Get off so we all can get off the planet.

391
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,040
Thank you.

392
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,600
Yeah.

393
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,300
I heard it.

394
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:48,660
I heard it.

395
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:48,880


396
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,660
I heard it.

397
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,540
But this is how you deal with it.

398
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,820
Fornication and pornography.

399
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:58,740
Yes.

400
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,060
Yes.

401
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:01,920
Uncleanness.

402
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,480
Yes.

403
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:02,960
Yes.

404
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,340
Yes.

405
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,260
And licentiousness.

406
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,880
Yes.

407
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,320
Yes.

408
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:06,700
Yes.

409
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,340
In the Greek gushing.

410
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,000
Yes.

411
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,520
Yes.

412
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,120
Losing.

413
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:10,760
Yes.

414
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,460
Yes.

415
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,220
And there's pus.

416
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:12,800
Yes.

417
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,640
And junk all coming out of it.

418
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:14,880
Yes.

419
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,400
Yes.

420
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:15,820
Yes.

421
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,800
And it's almost as if he gives a blanket for his men, his boys.

422
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,200
Yes.

423
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,540
Yes.

424
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes.

425
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,360
Yes.

426
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,680
And that's why we should emulate the dolphin people.

427
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:33,020
See, we are neither of the banging head grovers or of the fish, or of the food people.

428
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,100
Not the fish people.

429
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:40,920
You know, for a bunch of people who scream about pinks, those bobbies and subgeniuses sure

430
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,920
did dance to Christina Aguilera.

431
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,440
When this came on, the big dance techno party.

432
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,460
Oh, sorry.

433
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,200
This has just been a little bit of a surprise.

434
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,200


435
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,200


436
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,200


437
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,200


438
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,200


439
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,200


440
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,200


441
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,200


442
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,200


443
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,200


444
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,200


445
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,200


446
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,620
Oh, yeah.

447
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,900
Well, now see, while you guys were doing that, there was woe tanning at the stage.

448
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,940
I don't know if you were aware of this.

449
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,700
Actual woe tanning?

450
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,260
Not at all.

451
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,280
Oh, my God.

452
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:05,100
There was weird experimental amateur music and improvisational dance, you might say,

453
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,220
that was weird as Bob.

454
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,440
Woo!

455
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,720
Woo!

456
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,020
Lingerie?

457
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,960
Oh, kill me!

458
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:16,880
Socks?

459
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,720
Oh, kill me!

460
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,300
Sir?

461
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,440
Oh, kill me!

462
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,060
Ah!

463
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,180
Oh, kill me!

464
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,180


465
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,180


466
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,180


467
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,180


468
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,180


469
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,180


470
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,180


471
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,180


472
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,180


473
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,180


474
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,180


475
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,040
Oh, kill me!

476
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,980
Slacks?

477
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,980
Oh, kill me!

478
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:23,680
Woo!

479
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,080
Woo!

480
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,580
�

481
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,200
Hey, man.

482
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,160
We burned the symbol of democracy.

483
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,120
That which represents our most cherished beliefs.

484
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,480
We did let him hang out.

485
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,380
Because that's what we think of our beliefs.

486
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,320
Now, wait a minute here.

487
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,120
I heard more episodes of Ace Bob during this event than I have ever heard it in previous X-Day.

488
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,540
People were saying blank Bob all over the place.

489
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,520
I counted like 12 times.

490
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,080
I let Bob.

491
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,640
Let me tell you the skinny on Bob.

492
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,460
Dobbs camped out at Tranquility Base like Legume did and a few other people.

493
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,840
They just sort of got there, set up tents elsewhere, and then came down and hung out at T-Base.

494
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,920
I saw him.

495
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,580
Yeah, he just found himself the most comfortable chair.

496
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:27,020
It was the one with the big arms and the cup holders.

497
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,300
I was the most comfortable chair.

498
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,460
And he just sat there, never talked to anybody.

499
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,420
Did he put anything in the tip drawer?

500
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,560
Never tipped the bar.

501
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,320
He drained his bladder.

502
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,220
Never tipped the bar.

503
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,980
He drained his bladder.

504
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,440
And just had that look on his face and the pipe in his mouth.

505
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,500
Big wet stain.

506
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,000
I think it was early in the week, really.

507
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:45,840
It was Thursday night.

508
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,760
His fingers were numb.

509
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,900
When I walked into a T-Base.

510
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,220
T-Base Hutch grabbed my trusty compound bow off the wall.

511
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,280
It was the weirdest thing.

512
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,020
I jacked two arrows into that man's chest.

513
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,420
And both arrows bounced off.

514
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,400
Well, that's the Teflon Don himself right there.

515
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,240
Everybody knows about Legume's breasts.

516
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,720
No, not Legume.

517
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,880
Oh, Dobbs.

518
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,620
Oh, Bob was.

519
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,900
Oh, Dobbs is already dead.

520
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,600
He was wearing a bulletproof vest.

521
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,780
So I jacked off a third round right into his head and it sunk right.

522
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,060
Right in.

523
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,780
So to speak.

524
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:26,120
Well, that's just another example of the alacrity and the lack of alacrity and the smegma.

525
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,560
I dumped the twang on the cable and...

526
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,820
Yeah, I noticed that he didn't stop smiling.

527
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,580
He had an arrow sticking out of his head the entire festival until he disappeared.

528
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,600
It didn't really affect him, yeah.

529
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,640
I saw somebody had hung him for a while.

530
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,780
Well, he did talk to you.

531
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,920
And then he disappeared, huh?

532
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,480
Really?

533
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,780
Yeah, I think Saturday night they hung him.

534
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,020
Someone told me.

535
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,240
No, but I mean Sunday before we left.

536
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,480
He was sitting in Ed Strange's camp one minute.

537
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,880
And the next minute he was about the time you and Legume left.

538
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,420
He was gone.

539
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:57,680
No, that's right.

540
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,320
He was over at Ed's.

541
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,440
By his own intestines.

542
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,000
And the arrow was gone, I think.

543
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,100
The hanging bias.

544
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,100
Someone had removed the arrow from his head.

545
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,160
The arrow was left in your camp.

546
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:07,820
Yeah, probably.

547
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,700
That's why I figured you had taken him.

548
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,400
Not at all.

549
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,700
See, they don't even take them as holy artifacts anymore.

550
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,560
I have a feeling he'll show up again.

551
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,180
Oh, yeah.

552
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:15,940
Bob will return.

553
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,000
Well, last year after X-Day, he was on TV.

554
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,980
He was on the top of my hutch.

555
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,640
He was actually circling around up there, waving to skybound things.

556
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,420
He was hiding up there for a while.

557
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,440
He couldn't deal with things.

558
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,960
And then they changed his heart.

559
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,040
He had a heart transplant or something.

560
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,260
He did mushrooms or something that year, didn't he, last year?

561
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,220
That was the year they...

562
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,520
And that's when he panicked and stayed up there.

563
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,820
And he wouldn't come down.

564
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,020
It took 45 minutes to get the sucker down.

565
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:40,960
And I guess he had sold his nostril shirt.

566
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,900
Everyone thought he was dead, so they did a heart transplant on him.

567
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,380
Or some kind of organ transplant.

568
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,660
Well, they wanted to put some weird organ.

569
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,400
They had to...

570
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:48,780
Inside of him.

571
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,080
That he struggled a lot under.

572
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,740
But this year, he was much more laid back.

573
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,740
Everybody was.

574
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,000
Soprifics will do that.

575
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,320
I think everybody had fun.

576
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,900
A Hursute Messiah like Bob.

577
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,020
Sometime or another.

578
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,200
They are chattering like magpies on the internet about what fun they had.

579
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,060
It was...

580
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,000
It just...

581
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,320
In fact, several of them didn't sleep until just today.

582
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,080
Well, magpies rarely rest.

583
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,680
They just nest for a while and...

584
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:16,760
And...

585
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,700
And...

586
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:17,740
And...

587
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:17,860
And...

588
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,000
And...

589
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000


590
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000


591
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000


592
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000


593
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000


594
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000


595
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000


596
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000


597
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000


598
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000


599
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,000


600
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,800
And...

601
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,780
And...

602
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,840
I've been up for 41 hours.

603
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,760
All right.

604
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,620
And time sleep.

605
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,160
I can't feel my legs either.

606
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,380
Can I feel your legs?

607
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,140
Howdy.

608
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,320
Howdy.

609
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,100
Pretend like you're in Kentucky.

610
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,160
Howdy.

611
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,080
Howdy.

612
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,980
Praise Bob.

613
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,840
Praise Bob.

614
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
Praise Bob.

615
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,460
Praise Bob.

616
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,920
Reference.

617
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:55,380
doctor of squire I be, I fight against the conspiracy. With the conduits, cheats, and

618
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:02,680
lies, their nature cannot be disguised. If pink it be, then pink it dies. Praise Bob!

619
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,420
Praise Bob!

620
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,960
Now I thought I'd start out here, now this isn't very long, but I thought I'd start out

621
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:18,000
here with a caution that appears at the very beginning of the book of the subgenus. So

622
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,040
we, the subgenus of the post-human race, in order to preserve life on this planet from

623
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:30,600
imminent destruction, reestablish intelligence, regain slack, cast out the false prophets,

624
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,640
smother forever the fear of fear itself, receive the questionable gifts of the before life

625
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,640
and the space dwellers, become as overmen, unmatch the conspiracy, grip the reins of

626
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,980
human evolution, control reproduction and mutation, decipher the code, and destroy the

627
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,200
dark, placate the stark fist of removal, achieve time control, see that which must

628
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,540
come to pass, become as gods, find the twins with the scissors of sight, avert the rupture

629
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:05,520
of the equilibrium, and secure the financial blessings of Jehovah One, the God of wrath

630
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,900
for ourselves and our descendants, to hereby admit ourselves as such and thus ordain this

631
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:17,140
advertisement of the subgenus race of earth. The world ends tomorrow, and you may die!

632
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,980
Praise Bob!

633
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,220
Praise Bob!

634
00:24:48,000 --> 00:25:18,000

Where is he?

668
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,400
Seconds remaining.

669
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,240
Oh, what time is it?

670
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,400
There he is.

671
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,660
Good morning, Stank.

672
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,660
Good morning, sunshine.

And goodbye.

674
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,200
It's 7 a.m.

00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,120
Yeah, seconds remaining.

676
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,500
Seconds.

677
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:13,980
Seconds remaining.

678
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,880
Oh, really? One second?

679
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,340
Yeah.

680
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:16,820
One!

681
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,420
Yeah.

682
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,160
Oh!

683
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,160
Yeah!

684
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,200
Yeah!

685
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,260
Yeah!

686
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,140
Woo!

687
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,540
Woo!

688
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:26,880
Woo!

689
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:27,800
Woo!

690
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,700
Woo!

691
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:28,980


692
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,040
Woo!

693
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,560
Woo!

694
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,000


695
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,940
Fuck you, Bob!

696
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,580
I told you this was gonna happen.

697
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,520
Well, I didn't tell you this was gonna happen.

698
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,120
Where have all the subgeniuses gone?

699
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,600
Long time passing.

700
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:45,860
Long time passing.

701
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:45,860


702
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,220
Gone to Brushwood, everyone.

703
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,840
Subgeniuses gone, long time ago.

704
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,720
When will they ever learn?

705
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,640
When will they ...

706
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,840
... ever learn?

707
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,240
Listen to me, you didn't get off enough last night!

708
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,800
You can't get off the planet.

709
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,960
Until you get off!

710
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,840
Until you get off!

711
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,100
Could this all just be some stupid joke?

712
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,600
Bobby, you missed the whole point!

713
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:30,720
Every year I see you standing there, looking up in the sky, waiting for the pleasure saucers and the sex gods to come down and take you away!

714
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,460
It's a f***ing analogy, you dumb mother f***er!

715
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,960
Every year you're waiting for the sex gods to come and take you away, you don't get it!

716
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,020
You are the sex gods!

717
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,660
Now start having more sex!

718
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
I, Bob Dobs, command it!

719
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,200
You're waiting for a spaceship with all your fantasies on it to come and take you away?

720
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:50,740
Yes!

721
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,200
If they had that, you think they'd want to pick your sorry ass up and take you in?

722
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,080
You gotta build your own spaceship!

723
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,500
We're once again, we're here, we're Bob, we're Bob!

724
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,520
Well, I can't imagine either.

725
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,740
That's gonna be a real problem when it comes to getting off here next year.

726
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,160
Yeah.

727
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,520
Cause I guess next year they say it's really gonna happen.

728
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:10,820
Oh really?

729
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,020
X-Day sex.

730
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,020
Yep.

731
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,480
X.

732
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,760
I was in a Woody Guthrie mood, that's why I brought this, you know, I was thinking about singing songs about X-Day.

733
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,720
I wish you would!

734
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,880
I wandered alone to X-Day

735
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,540
A pound of cheese in my hair

736
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,160
Stranded alone in Brushwood

737
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,340
With Jesus fornicating a deer

738
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:44,840
Oh shit, I mean

739
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,940
Oh, X-Day

740
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,520
Oh, X-Day

741
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,660
My friends got loaded and left me alone

742
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,220
Standing in the rain

743
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,900
They told my money and they took all my drugs

744
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,020
And shoved it in down in the rain

745
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,180
Oh, X-Day

746
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,200
Oh, shit, fuck it.

747
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,940
Excuse me.

748
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,700
Oh, man, I'm not supposed to say that yet, am I?

749
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,900
Well, it just causes a lot of extra work for me later on.

750
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,640
But that's okay, that's all right!

751
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,040
That's okay, it caused some...

752
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,600
So do you feel that your, your explungement was a success this month?

753
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,880
Oh, well, aside from not getting to destroy it, I think it was a success.

754
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,720
I mean, I didn't destroy the Earth and live forever for 30 bucks, it was great.

755
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,900
It was a really good deal aside from that.

756
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,460
I had a great X-Day.

757
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,480
I suppose that's kind of a disappointment, you know, if you really had your heart set on blowing 30 bucks

758
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:53,340
and getting not only eternal salvation and immortality, but, you know, the sex goddesses and so forth

759
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,380
and watching this place just be blown to smithereens, which was my favorite thing.

760
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:05,660
Well, we missed that this time, but you know, I mean, it may be better Bob's people than Heaven's Gate.

761
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,060
You know, it could have been worse.

762
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:14,440
We could have all killed ourselves for nothing, but as it is, we killed ourselves for something great,

763
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,800
something noble, something new in the world!

764
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:23,920
We killed our brain cells, each and every one, up until that very last one,

765
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,940
the one we left in Dave's head, heard now in the background.

766
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,440
Not, not much of a brain cell.

767
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,720
But, you know, that wasn't much of a brain to begin with.

768
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:51,560
Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob?

769
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,980
Well, first the good news. There will be an X-Day 6.

770
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,120
Yeah!

771
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,400
The bad news, of course, is that I'm standing here having to tell you the good news.

772
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:18,480
And those who've managed to peel themselves up out of bed at 7 o'clock, like I did, well, I feel stupid too.

773
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:25,940
And the Bob dummy is over there at Tranquility Base with an arrow through its head already.

774
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,880
And I think, now, don't hurt it too much.

775
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,760
Because we're going to hang it from a tree forever.

776
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:40,160
And every year that the X's don't get here, we'll go to the Tranquility Base sacred spot

777
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,300
and see how far the Bob dummy has rotted.

778
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,300
Bastard.

779
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:51,040
I still love Bob. I have absolute faith that every word Bob could say was true,

780
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:55,300
because, I mean, a holy man wouldn't lie or fuck up, would he?

781
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,420
Oh, yeah.

782
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,180
And, and, and, well, for those of you who weren't here at 7 o'clock this morning,

783
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,100
it was, I was almost, we were almost late.

784
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,740
The countdown consisted of a one.

785
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,120
And followed by the usual anticlimax, where everybody stares at me as if I was Bob.

786
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,480
And, uh, we, we, why didn't we get our saucers, man?

787
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:24,720
Here I am still trying to make, trying to make the best of the situation.

788
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,420
But I really feel like crying.

789
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,500
I wanted to, you know, be able to commit mass murder,

790
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
and have my own planet for 30 bucks.

791
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,080
Who wouldn't?

792
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,080
You know, you'd have to be crazy not to want that.

793
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,200
But, eh, oh well.

794
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,580
As I told them this morning,

795
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,760
I've got one thing to say, to quote the great Rudy Ray Moore,

796
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,600
I've got one thing to say, and it won't take long,

797
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,060
but Bob Dobbs done been here, took a good shit, and gone.

798
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,020
Cause I got no expectations

799
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,880
to ever pass.

800
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,380
And this is the way it ought to be.

801
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,120
Once I was a rich man,

802
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,960
now I am so poor.

803
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,940
Never in my weary life have I felt

804
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,800
like this before.

805
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:32,100
Your leather's like a diamond,

806
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,500
your passing words a swan,

807
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,220
and as I see you,

808
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,960
leaving me,

809
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,460
I cry.

810
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,260
I cry.

811
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,140
Oh, I cry.

812
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,260
I cry.

813
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,220
Don't they take me?

814
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,340
I cry.

815
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,260
Don't they hold me under that plane?

816
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,240
Cause I got no expectations

817
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,000
to ever pass.

818
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:10,600
This way again.

819
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,800
One, two, one, two, three, four.

820
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:22,540
I cry.

821
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:22,700
I cry.

822
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,400
I cry.

823
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,760
Don't they take me

824
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,460
to the entrance

825
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,720
to sell me

826
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,540
all the plays

827
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,120
Cause I got no expectations

828
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,280
Every day you're a part of me

829
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,100
Once I was a rich man

830
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,100
Now I am so poor

831
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,560
You'll never be mine

832
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,560
You'll never be mine

833
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:22,800
When you're just a slice of diamond

834
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,780
You pass your words to swine

835
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,560
And as I see you

836
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,160
You're crying

837
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,500
I'm just a poor man

838
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,580
When I'm just a slave

839
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,980
To the echo of your love

840
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,380
When I'm just a slave

841
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,160
I'm just a slave

842
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,600
To the echo of your love

843
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,360
When I'm just a slave

844
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,300
To the echo of your love

845
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:20,040
You better

846
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,820
Cause I got a slippery sensation

847
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,880
And I'm about to fall

848
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,580
Oh baby, baby I want you

849
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,520
I'm gonna turn into hell

850
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,300
Gonna burn away

851
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:54,380
Cause I got a slippery sensation

852
00:40:54,380 --> 00:41:01,320
And I'm about to fall again

853
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,540
Thank you.

854
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,440
Thank you.

855
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:27,220
Oh and by the way, Dr. Catan Lagube on barmonica solo there.

856
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,760
But what the hell, the good news is we still get to party down here.

857
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,360
I don't know about you, but despite the turmoil,

858
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,500
and the human ant bed, I've been getting more slack.

859
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,240
So much so that just me personally,

860
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,720
I don't mind waiting another year.

861
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,180
Of course, knock on wood.

862
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,780
You know, though, everybody has different ideas about

863
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,680
how come Bob didn't show up in Texas and all that stuff.

864
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,420
And I think the most logical one, of course,

865
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,800
is that it's simply not July 5th, 1998 yet.

866
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,720
And Bob said the saucers were gonna arrive at 7am July 5th, 1998.

867
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,500
That obviously hasn't happened yet.

868
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,240
They've been screwing with the dates for a long time.

869
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,280
But there was a peculiar theory,

870
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,080
it's just something to think about,

871
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,980
the theory of the piecemeal rupture.

872
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,140
That it started at July 5th, 1998, just as scheduled,

873
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,660
and we're all being ruptured, but it's like one organ at a time.

874
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,560
And for you young people don't notice,

875
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,540
because they're just taking a break.

876
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,760
And eyelashes here, eyebrow hair there,

877
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,840
colon bacteria and so forth.

878
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,600
It builds up though.

879
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,240
You know, enough X-days.

880
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:56,660
P. Kitty's insulin productivity was ruptured on X-day 98.

881
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,240
And my sense of balance was ruptured at the same time.

882
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:07,200
On X-day, Pastor Craig's collarbone

883
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,520
has been ruptured from this day.

884
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,380
And on this very place,

885
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,800
Lake Hume's Mercy was taken and ruptured,

886
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,960
as well as the regularity of his heartbeat.

887
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:24,020
The kidney stone filters of a number of male subgeniuses have been ruptured.

888
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,980
Princess Wee's memory was taken by the aliens.

889
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,040
The innocence of Papa Joe Mama,

890
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:35,100
the squarest, most conservative subgenius,

891
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,980
his innocence was ruptured.

892
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:37,580
Uh,

893
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:37,580


894
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,660
Ragnar's couth was taken.

895
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,840
Tom was a very couth-filled person.

896
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,260
And now he's like the rest of us,

897
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,860
has become completely uncouth.

898
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,720
Jesus' money!

899
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,000
The money!

900
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:51,880
Jesus!

901
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,880
Jesus had plenty of money!

902
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,420
But, you know what happened?

903
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,260
There's been times when he's had to get conspiracy work.

904
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,980
And friends, I'll tell you why Modemak ain't here.

905
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,340
Modemak's virginity itself was ruptured.

906
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,640
From this place.

907
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,720
That's why he didn't need to come back.

908
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,020
He was already getting something.

909
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,040
I don't want to hang around with those nerds.

910
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,060
So friends, we will!

911
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,440
I know that sooner or later,

912
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,900
even if he has to take, you know,

913
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,580
well, brain cells, let's not even go into that.

914
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:28,100
But, and certain recent memories, that kind of thing.

915
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,860
Nege gets a lot of that stuff.

916
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:34,440
But, friends, you know, we all know,

917
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,860
or we wouldn't still be standing here unless we were clasped.

918
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,580
Idiots!

919
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,820
I mean, it's Church of the...

920
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,940
Wait a minute.

921
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,700
Oh, I just sunk in.

922
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,260
You didn't call it Church of the Genius, did you?

923
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:46,760
No.

924
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,560
No wonder those news guys were laughing at us.

925
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,320
Anyway, friends, we will get our missing parts back.

926
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,420
We will get our dead rock stars back!

927
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:02,020
John Entwistle will ride the magic bus again, my friend!

928
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,860
Keith Moon shall rise again!

929
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,100
I see a Keith Moon arising!

930
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,040
Jimi Hendrix will play lead guitar in the Exosauces,

931
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,000
and Lenny Bruce will warm up the crowd!

932
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,480
Janis will be there!

933
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,360
Jim will sing!

934
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,440
John will sing again!

935
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,340
Kirk will sing!

936
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,720
Bradley!

937
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,280
Bradley Noel, the subgenius rock star, will sing again!

938
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,580
And, praise God, Frank Zappa will lead the orchestra!

939
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,780
That's right, here we come!

940
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,840
Kelly Sands!

941
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,920
The Follis will act again!

942
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,200
Boris Karloff and Vincent Price will make movies again!

943
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,080
Bela Lugosi will be shooting up backstage!

944
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,620
Alfred Hitchcock will do the next Hannibal Lecter movie!

945
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,260
And Willis O'Brien will animate the remake of King Kong

946
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,700
using the most unimaginable, Rome-based computer animation!

947
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,260
Friends, the world will end not with a bang,

948
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,020
mayhaps it might indeed end with a whimper,

949
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,660
but let's make it not a whimper of misery,

950
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,140
but a whimper of sex hurt!

951
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,260
Prolong the sex hurt!

952
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,220
Bob escaped from hell, my friends!

953
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,460
You know, I saw Bob Dock shot and killed in 1984,

954
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,420
but he dug his way out with that entrenching duel!

955
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,240
He fucked the devil's wife and got kicked out of hell!

956
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,860
He beat the devil at card games!

957
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,940
He tricked his wife!

958
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,020
The devil hated Bob's luck!

959
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,580
And Bob escaped from hell, my friends!

960
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,420
And we shall too!

961
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,860
Sooner or later, we just gotta follow Bob

962
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,940
where we can find that tunnel or entrenching tool

963
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,480
or that pipe or whatever.

964
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,700
In the meantime, let it continue.

965
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,680
Us versus them.

966
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,980
Because where else would we get the energy to do all this nutty stuff

967
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,700
if it weren't for them trying to tell us not to, you know?

968
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:00,660
Seriously!

969
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,920
I mean, would we go to the movies?

970
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,300
I mean, we'd probably just be...

971
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,800
In fact, let's do that.

972
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,780
Just go sit around and prop and listen to good music or something.

973
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,760
But, you know, there is a certain amount of fun

974
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,560
in the eternal conflict of monkey versus robot,

975
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,580
subgenius versus pink boy,

976
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,280
Morlock versus Eloy,

977
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,680
Devo versus blockheads,

978
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,740
Quar versus bohabs,

979
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,920
magic folk versus muggles,

980
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,300
and Bob versus Connie, for that matter.

981
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,720
You know, the divine battle must go on.

982
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,280
Somebody's gonna get fucked,

983
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,160
and there's no reason we can't start doing the fucking ourselves.

984
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,180
Friends, somewhere out there,

985
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,980
smoking and driving and selling,

986
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,560
the salesman of slack

987
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:58,640
awaits you and what's in your wallet.

988
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,900
Does your wallet belong to me?

989
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,820
Bob, my friends?

990
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,120
Or does your wristwatch belong to the conspiracy?

991
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,660
The conspiracy!

992
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,960
Are you wearing that chain around your wrist?

993
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,960
Are you wearing that necktie,

994
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,500
that symbol of evil worn by the humales?

995
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,460
Well, friend,

996
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,680
you need slack.

997
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,080
And slack is right around the corner

998
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,700
for those who can whiff it out,

999
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,360
who know slack when they see it.

1000
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,360
Friends, that's all it takes,

1001
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,100
just to know it,

1002
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,560
just to know that whiff

1003
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,940
when you get that chance.

1004
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,600
I smell slack!

1005
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,040
I smell slack!

1006
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,660
I'm quitting my job!

1007
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,860
I'm run...

1008
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,320
That's the idea, friends!

1009
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,520
Get ready, get set, and quit that job!

1010
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,380
I just left work on now,

1011
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,840
so I'm on my period.

1012
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,680
The worst thing that can possibly happen, my friend,

1013
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,240
is you'll get a better job.

1014
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:02,920
So repent!

1015
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,280
Quit your job and whack...

1016
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,040
I mean, slack off, friends.

1017
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,740
Join the wankers for Bob.

1018
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,000
Wank it, friends!

1019
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,780
Wank it with all your might!

1020
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,560
I was thinking of Bob Dobbs

1021
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,240
at the moment I was gesticulating with my articulator.

1022
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,220
At the moment of that frozen orgasm,

1023
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,040
I saw that smiling face

1024
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,100
and the culture in the menses of the mind itself

1025
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,220
exploding in me.

1026
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:32,820
My brain!

1027
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,460
I am one with Dobbs now,

1028
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,900
in a way that very few of you two-legged dogs

1029
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,560
would do to hardly understand.

1030
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,460
I'm leaving soon.

1031
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,280
Or have I already gone?

1032
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,440
Have I...?

1033
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:52,460
The weirdest fucking scene I've seen

1034
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,200
at a subgenius thing

1035
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,200
in a long time happened here on the stage

1036
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,240
after Pisces...

1037
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,820
It built up from Pisces' reign.

1038
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:01,180
Yeah.

1039
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:06,040
She got the young, bold surrealists all fired up.

1040
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,040
I wandered back here and found this spectacle

1041
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,860
of Pisces, like, plastered up against this Dobbs head

1042
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,420
and these guys writhing around at her feet.

1043
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,880
And it was, like, really cultish.

1044
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,100
Jack Chick should have been there to draw it, you know?

1045
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,620
And it evolved into this...

1046
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,820
Okay, those Cosmodeor and those other guys

1047
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,820
were doing this weird shit music up here.

1048
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,360
It was very, you know,

1049
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,380
just designed to make you flip out if you're on acid.

1050
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:39,120
And this just fucked-up ballet morality play

1051
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,360
developed with Zorro and Reverend Alex and Princess Wee

1052
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,360
up here, to that music that was definitely...

1053
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,480
A lot of y'all saw that.

1054
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,600
That was one of the most disturbing

1055
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,900
and fucked-up things I've ever seen.

1056
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,240
And, friends, I've been to Mardi Gras.

1057
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,580
I've been to Burning Man.

1058
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,200
I've been to Bracing Those Bulls in Pamplona.

1059
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,860
I've seen the Eiffel Tower and a Jimi Hendrix concert.

1060
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,480
And I never saw anything like that

1061
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,460
fucked-up shit last night.

1062
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,160
Praise Bob.

1063
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,800
The subgeniuses still have it.

1064
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,700
The bold surrealists.

1065
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,480
The spirit of bold surrealism lives

1066
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,920
in the young subgeniuses.

1067
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,220
Reverend Alex Thompson!

1068
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,000
Even pinks,

1069
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,540
even the pinkest, pinkest pinks

1070
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,560
know that they're not the only ones

1071
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,380
that know that subgenie are better than they are.

1072
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,240
And the reason for this,

1073
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,280
even though these pinks continue to dominate us,

1074
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,200
they make that decision,

1075
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:36,980
nominate or submit,

1076
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,220
and they'll make, they dominate.

1077
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,820
Even these pinks know that we subgenie

1078
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:42,720
are better than they are

1079
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,400
because subgeniuses exude a moist, emotional vibe.

1080
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,440
That's right, a vibe, my friends,

1081
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,560
which acts upon not only slack,

1082
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,960
the love plane, karma,

1083
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,500
those other metaphysical energies,

1084
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,980
and etheric, magical properties.

1085
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:03,360
Yes, our, our, our powers

1086
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,780
are deep in here in the mental life.

1087
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,280
And friends, this is the power called

1088
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,120
orgasmatic radiation.

1089
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,460
That's right.

1090
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,840
This same power, you will note,

1091
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,660
is released when a subgenius is engaged

1092
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,560
in what is known in human colloquialisms

1093
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,640
as deviant sex.

1094
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,780
Yes, yes, yes, my friends.

1095
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,380
But you see, deviant sex,

1096
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,740
it goes so much further in this church

1097
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,280
because deviant sex includes

1098
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,660
that most deviant of all activities,

1099
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,020
which is true Yeti love.

1100
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,540
That's right, true Yeti love.

1101
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,620
We in this church know about true Yeti hate

1102
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,800
because we had Janer.

1103
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,040
We in this church know about true Yeti hate

1104
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,540
because we had Sternadoc's caregiver.

1105
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,560
We in this church know about true Yeti hate

1106
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,720
because we had Father, Papa, Joe, Mama.

1107
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,980
But, my friends, we don't know enough

1108
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,180
about true Yeti love.

1109
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,820
Sub-love is in its purest state upon arrival

1110
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,580
because it is inherently slack.

1111
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,820
Well, that is correct, my friends.

1112
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,680
Slack is love.

1113
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,540
Praise love!

1114
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,780
Yes, praise love.

1115
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,780
And this slack, this true Yeti love,

1116
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,580
can be extended towards a subgenius

1117
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,180
from her Yeti mate to his Yeti mate

1118
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,420
no matter the distance, my friends.

1119
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,480
No matter the distance between them.

1120
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,620
You could be in Timbuktu,

1121
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,280
your Yeti mate could be in Montreal,

1122
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,320
and they will still know that you love them

1123
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,880
and will for all eternity.

1124
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,240
And this thing is mystical.

1125
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,200
It is telepathic.

1126
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,040
It is subgenius love.

1127
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,000
And we need more of it

1128
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,080
because, my friends, what the world needs now,

1129
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,920
well, what the world needs now is to,

1130
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,880
you know, come to man.

1131
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,080
But what Planet X needs now

1132
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,980
is lots of trillions of billions of zillions of subgeniuses

1133
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,780
to extend their tentacles,

1134
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,360
their squamous membranous mental lives

1135
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,540
all over each other in perpetual rescort

1136
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:18,100
and feel the power of love.

1137
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,160
Feel the power of slack.

1138
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,500
Feel the power of compassion

1139
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,580
and desire.

1140
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,480
And the ability to feel that,

1141
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,500
my friends, comes from you.

1142
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:31,740
Thank you.

1143
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,360
Amen!

1144
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,420
YAY!

1145
00:54:53,500 --> 00:55:23,500


1146
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:53,500


1147
00:55:53,500 --> 00:56:23,500


1148
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:53,500


1149
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,740
Check out www.brushwood.com

1150
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,640
and you'll find out all about all the festivals happening out there.

1151
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,280
Check subgenius.com for the weirdo parties.

1152
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,500
Check for any extra bleeding around your ears and eyes.

1153
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:10,080
Real weirdo parties.

1154
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,940
And also check down there and make sure you haven't gone poopy

1155
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:15,460
when you got excited.

1156
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,000
You got anything you want queued up?

1157
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,880
Oh, and there's the Devo convention coming up also.

1158
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,200
Oh, yeah.

1159
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,300
And a DeVival the next day.

1160
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:23,700
Yeah.

1161
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,360
Devo convention here.

1162
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,380
It's in August, right?

1163
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,120
Mass bop-tism.

1164
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:30,160
You said there was going to be a mass bop-tism in the middle of August?

1165
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,480
August 15th.

1166
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,000
Reverend Ivan Stang.

1167
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,140
Hellfire preaching by Reverend Ivan Stang.

1168
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,580
Dr. Katahdin, ladies and gentlemen.

1169
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,120
And Dr. Onan Kanobai.

1170
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,440
He's coming out from Portland?

1171
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:40,980
Yep.

1172
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:41,540
Wow.

1173
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:41,980
Yes.

1174
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,960
It'll be good to see Onan.

1175
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,640
He's a fellow rocketeer.

1176
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,480
Yes.

1177
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,820
He's a rocket man.

1178
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,840
And a full-grown cannibal.

1179
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,140
He's the oldest, youngest subgenius doctor.

1180
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,100
And St. Ann and Helen the handbasket.

1181
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:53,860
She rocked.

1182
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,880
I thought she was right on the mark singing her songs.

1183
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,400
I thought for once she not only nailed it but went into some sort of stardom level.

1184
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,140
That's going to be August 11th at the Lime Spider in Akron.

1185
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,780
August 11th in Akron.

1186
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,700
It's 207 South Main Street.

1187
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,220
Yeah, you could know about that.

1188
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,220
Where the rubber meets the toads.

1189
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:14,220
And the day before that here in Cleveland is the Devotional 2002.

1190
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,300
At the Starwood Center.

1191
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:16,380
With a mass bop-tism.

1192
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,480
712 East 185th Street.

1193
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,060
What time is that?

1194
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,700
There is going to be a mass bop-tism, isn't there?

1195
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,780
That's all day.

1196
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,460
That's like all day Saturday.

1197
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,080
All day long.

1198
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:26,740
A general boy.

1199
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,060
Just head down to the Starwood Center.

1200
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:28,600
All day long.

1201
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:28,920
Will be there.

1202
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,700
The sire, the progenitor of all the devos.

1203
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,200
Jim.

1204
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,160
August 10th.

1205
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:35,900
Jim Mothersbaugh.

1206
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:41,840
And if it's like last year, there will be home videos that Mark Mothersbaugh sends.

1207
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,540
Well, this is Sunday.

1208
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,440
I hope all the subgeniuses come out on a Sunday night.

1209
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,760
After all, don't they all go to church on Sunday?

1210
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:48,180
Pass the show.

1211
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,120
Akron, man.

1212
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,540
And have a big fat old chicken dinner underneath the shade.

1213
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:51,960
Rubber City.

1214
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,480
Gau-ra-duh.

1215
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:56,660
Bob.

1216
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,180
Bob.

1217
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:16,200
Wow-ugh-a, arrog markers.

1218
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,620
All'ini, all'ini, all'ini.

1219
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,460
Here to beat the nggak-ผม

1220
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:22,680
Shanduggen.

1221
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:22,680


1222
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:22,680
