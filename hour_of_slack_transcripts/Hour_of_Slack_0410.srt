1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you so much for supporting KNO and your favorite local station.

2
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:22,580
God, I was watching TV just before we came down to do this show, and that brand new show, Sea Quest, was on,

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,140
and I don't know why they don't just call it Sea Trek, the nth generation.

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,540
Float me up, Scotty.

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,800
I don't get it, why do they keep saying it's like Star Trek?

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,460
Star Trek is in outer space, for Christ's sake, this is like underwater.

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:49,540
How can they say it's like, if it was Star Trek, we'd have robots, and this is, it's state of the art, it's got virtual reality in it,

8
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,560
it's like, it's Star Wars, I mean, it's like, it's underwater, what are you talking about?

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,120
So, somebody has millions of dollars.

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,120


11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:09,220
Millions and millions of dollars to spend on that stuff, and here we are thanking you for your $30 pledges,

12
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,520
and there's only a few of you that were even saying that much, too.

13
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,580
Well, this is one of those completely disorganized hours of slack.

14
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,140
It's, but, why, it's justified, it's our religion, praise Bob.

15
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,940
I have summoned you.

16
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,340
I have summoned you.

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,320
Decompression chamber, maximum duration 10 seconds, repeat 10 seconds.

18
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,480
Okay, the show's really gonna start now.

19
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,840
Shut the doors.

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,080
Now, if somebody listening to the show this afternoon thinks that they are not normal and that they are subgenius,

21
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,420
it's very possible that they have that certain spark that might lead them to believe that they are subgenius.

22
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,540
Yeah.

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,320
Yeah.

24
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,760
I mean, they could be, it's a whole genetic heritage thing.

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,020
Sure.

26
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,260
And it's not elitism, it's just, it's predestiny.

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:02,900
Sure.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,760
Yeah.

29
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,180
Do you want to live forever?

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,120
Yes.

31
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,200
Do you want to live in paradise?

32
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:08,900
Yes.

33
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,360
Will you die for me?

34
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,620
Yes.

35
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,040
Will you kill for me?

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,420
Yes.

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,980
Will you kill for me?

38
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,260
Yes.

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,340
I remember, I think, and maybe I'm romanticizing the past, but I remember when music had a conscience and music had soul.

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,120
And does anybody remember that at all?

41
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,040
Jimi Hendrix?

42
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,820
Any question about that guy?

43
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,440
Stand by the mountain, chop it down with the edge of my hand.

44
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,540
Woo!

45
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,620
Woo!

46
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:54,980
Woo!

47
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,240
Woo!

48
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,940
This guy had a, like an anaconda, blowing in the wind, man.

49
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:11,900
Don't ever want to make you cry, never want to break your diet code forever.

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,280
Excuse me!

51
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,220
I would love to have seen the Jimi Hendrix, Debbie Gibson album.

52
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,280
I bet he could shake her love right in half.

53
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,600
Foxy.

54
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,260
Mommy!

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,980
Foxy, lady.

56
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,080
Mommy!

57
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,360
Debbie, you wanted to be a rock star, honey, remember?

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,620
You got a hang with the big boy, sweetie.

59
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,960
I want to go back to the mall!

60
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,860
I suck!

61
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,640
I suck!

62
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,000
Get him away!

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,440
Foodie child, baby!

64
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,360
Like a buzzsaw!

65
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,180
Ring-a-ring-a-ring-a-ring-a-ring-a-ring!

66
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,800
Cut her into little mall cordwood, man.

67
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,080
Save a pair of bloody panties for George Michaels to slip on.

68
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,400
Boom, he's a woman, she's dead.

69
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,160
Jimi's still jamming.

70
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,600
Hey!

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,140
Hey!

72
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,920
Hey!

73
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,940
And we let him in, come on.

74
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,180
Oh, no.

75
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,340
After that, she....

76
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,440
M-m-my God.

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,060
Oh God, M-m-my God.

78
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,060


79
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,060


80
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,060


81
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,080
Now the Ira's mouth angle is near it.

82
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,200
Oh.

83
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,460
I thought it was a heart, no.

84
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,460


85
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,460


86
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,460


87
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,460


88
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,460


89
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,860
Well, you wish me luck.

90
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:42,860


91
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:42,860


92
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:42,960
Hello?

93
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,840
No, I don't take prev estaban karweual an Fo b 102.

94
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,120
I have some money on me.

95
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,200
guitar solo

96
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,080
guitar solo

97
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,740
guitar solo

98
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,560
guitar solo

99
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:04,020
guitar solo

100
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,540
guitar solo

101
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:08,540


102
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:08,780
guitar solo

103
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,840
guitar solo

104
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:09,840


105
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:09,840


106
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:09,840


107
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:09,840


108
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,360
Something we couldn't find was in trying to talk to the parents or the so-called other generation, you know,

109
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,860
because they have a way of over-protecting the people.

110
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,460
So much as where they put them in boxes, you know, and they put themselves in boxes, and that's not the right way of living.

111
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,240
Because younger people, their minds are a little more keener and they can figure this out.

112
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,040
So therefore, since they can't get released and respect from the older people, then they go into these other things.

113
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,480
And their music gets louder and it gets rebellious because it's starting to form a religion, you know.

114
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,840
And, uh, because you're not going to find it in church. A lot of kids, you know, don't find nothing in church.

115
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,920
I remember when I was, I got thrown out of church because I had the improper clothes on.

116
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,900
I had tennis shoes and a suit.

117
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,260
And they said, well, that's not proper.

118
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,320
So we don't have no money to get anything else.

119
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,380
So I just got thrown out of church anyway.

120
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,580
And it's nothing but an institution.

121
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,340
So they don't have to find nothing there.

122
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,760
And, uh, so then it moves on to trying to find yourself, you know.

123
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:09,380
So therefore, you see somebody look maybe kind of freaky or playing very radical, regardless if it's good or bad, you know.

124
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,320
And then quite naturally, they take up to this person or these people.

125
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,160
It's up to the people to preach the proper thing to them.

126
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,040
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

127
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,940
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

128
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,780
They are the thrill seekers.

129
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,480
Oh, my goodness.

130
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,720
This is...

131
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,160
And we're, we're getting closer.

132
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,340
We're placing a long-distance call.

133
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,500
We're asking Bob to bring us that excess in Slack tonight.

134
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,360
Now, friends, you want to have someone close to your heart.

135
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,060
Close to the rest of you, too. Not just your heart.

136
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,100
You want equal distance and closeness here.

137
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,140


138
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,300
You want it in your ears as close as you can get it.

139
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,680
You want ultimate proximity.

140
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,700
Because you think this sounds great.

141
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:13,900
It sounds good.

142
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,200
Just you wait, folks.

143
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,440
You can make it happen for yourself.

144
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,720
And that's what the Church is all about, my friends.

145
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,640
Yes, that's what Ivan says.

146
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,760
It's what this Church is all about.

147
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,740
Consider the following a self-help tape.

148
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,280
If you're alone, it might be self-help.

149
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,400
Yeah, it'd be self-help.

150
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,700
It's best to practice with a friend.

151
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,880
Yes, Bob helps those who help themselves.

152
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,680
So if you have to help yourself, well, let Bob lend you a hand and make his hand your own.

153
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,600
And I know a number of you folks have been waiting to have your box filled with Ivan, you know, the busy man, the Church of the Subgenius.

154
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,300
Getting your stuff mailed.

155
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,040
Send in energy.

156
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,100
Send it.

157
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,520
Send it all the way.

158
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,340
And get your box filled one way or another.

159
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,580
Obviously, I don't have to explain the Church of the Subgenius.

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,480
But what's it all about?

161
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,940
Wouldn't you like to know?

162
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,560
My friend, if you...

163
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,280
There are some things man was not meant to know.

164
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,380
Any of them.

165
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:12,380


166
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,580
It's like, you know, you're a man.

167
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


168
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


169
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


170
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


171
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


172
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


173
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


174
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


175
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


176
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


177
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


178
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


179
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


180
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,580


181
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:20,300
Thank God there are some things hidden from the mind of the pathetic, poor, tiny mind of man.

182
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,600
I need to be healed.

183
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:28,980
I woke up yesterday morning and there was a psychic fish hook in the back of my brain being pulled on by Bob.

184
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,680
He said, Bob, and who is this Bob?

185
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:42,920
I didn't know who Bob was, but I found a map tattooed on my, on my very chest saying, saying, saying, Tibet, Malaysia, Bobtown, Dobbsville.

186
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,380
What does it mean?

187
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,900
I saw a vision, visions of yetis without knowing what yetis were.

188
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,400
Where did I think you knew just what to do about this?

189
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,960
Bob, Bob, Bob.

190
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,360
We get some damn good lampshades made out of those bats.

191
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,640
Those of us who think that you know what God Almighty wants us to see, hear, think, and do...

192
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,720
Are in big trouble.

193
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,320
Don't let your mind go to hell. Save it.

194
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:29,940
When people get paranoid, even though there may be some justification to it, and that is the feeling develops over a long period of time.

195
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:39,540
When society is against you, that they regard you as an enemy, that, you know, after a while that can generate within you returning, hostile feelings.

196
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,720
They felt, they feel that they're acting under God's inspiration or anything's possible.

197
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:52,160
As you get deeper and deeper into the church, as a matter of fact, you find that there is a very real capital C conspiracy on planet Earth.

198
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,740
And as it turns out, very bad people are running the show.

199
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,660
Okay, so there's a conspiracy. What kind of people are running this whole show thing?

200
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:07,420
Well, that's just it. People. Humans. See, subgeniuses are a totally different strain than humans, a different life form.

201
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:07,820
Yeah.

202
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:14,200
And there are two intelligent species on Earth, actually several dozen, but the ones you usually see are of two basic types.

203
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,820
Normals, and it's a bit of a stretch to call them intelligent, and subgenius.

204
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,740
There may be inadequate distribution facilities and mailing to chronic returnees.

205
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:31,100
We're free of leveraged buyouts, smoking in the workplace, snooping on employees, and employee personal phone calls.

206
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,020
What now?

207
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,100
This is John from the Meat Wrappers local, 101 there.

208
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:37,800
Hi, you're John.

209
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,200
How you doing, John?

210
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,240
We're very pro-union slop here, so lay it on us on us here.

211
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,440
Are you the steward? Are you anything having to do with the actual union yourself, or are you just an onion gobbler?

212
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,800
We want to make the public aware of the plight of the Meat Wrappers.

213
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,480
They're taking phlegm out of our contract.

214
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,800
They're taking phlegm out of our contract.

215
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,760
And we want it back.

216
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,980
Well, when your contract's been reduced and voided of phlegm,

217
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,620
boy, you don't have much meat left in your phlegm.

218
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,500
I mean, there's not really a lot you can do, is there?

219
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:20,060
You can't stand tall, and you can't stand out there on the line and have your brother standing tall and making a solid...

220
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,100
Dave, I have a funny feeling that we better get out of the way.

221
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,420
Well, it's a very serious matter, and...

222
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,600
Well, I'd like you to expound on it.

223
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,540
Ow, my foot!

224
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,420
Ow!

225
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,280
Who's doing it? Wayne Stead said that. Ow!

226
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,360
Ow!

227
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,960
And now you're...

228
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,000
You can get better at that.

229
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,180
Try it one more time.

230
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,120
We got these dollar stores, and they're selling meat wrappings for under-cost, and they're really hurting...

231
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,940
They're selling meat wrapped in underwear to poor children?

232
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,140
To poor children? No, lonesome cowboy Dave, tell me it's not so!

233
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,280
Oh, well, I guess now it's time to tell you what you've been listening to.

234
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:04,940
Well, of course.

235
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:14,800
It's the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack's show, but that show can be composed of many other shows.

236
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,060
In this case, uh, why...

237
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:33,860
Poor Car... From the beginning, poor Cardinal Sin and his friend Reverend Slicky Leisureman, uh, on a radio station up in Kansas City, I think, uh...

238
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,820
Talking about Bob in some what manner.

239
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:44,340
Uh, Bill Hicks, there at the beginning, talking about, uh, Jimi Hendrix, and Jimi Hendrix talking about Jimi Hendrix.

240
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:57,840
And some bits and pieces of Reverend Velveteen Sly's, uh, sexy show with Father Angus MacGomorrah, the psychoacoustics show.

241
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,100
They're up in Madison, Wisconsin, where they also play the hour of Slack.

242
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:11,260
And, uh, there's some more bits from KPFA, uh, puzzling evidence.

243
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,020
And Dr. Howell.

244
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,440
Dr. Howell can be very charming, but, uh, you'll see, you'll see.

245
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,900
And, uh, we're not quite sure what else there is yet.

246
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,760
Help!

247
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,320
Patrons will please excuse the temporary inconvenience of my return fire.

248
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,080
In the future, this work will enable...

249
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,800
We'll have to serve you better.

250
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,920
She came at me with an armload of chromosomes, but knocked over a beaker with her enhanced breast.

251
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,100
Her feet were covered in pure DNA.

252
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,600
She evolved into a toad.

253
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,080
What?

254
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,680
It looked like a cow!

255
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,720
Oh, it was the black and white spots that did it, not you.

256
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,540
It's party time!

257
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,460
Well, that should give you an idea of the general tone of things.

258
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,180
Now for some of the individual sketches.

259
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,140
The letters always start, Dear Gabe, and they ask me questions.

260
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,160
That's because I'm Gabe Woletzki, advice columnist.

261
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,060
Men and women involved in relationships want to find out what the other one wants.

262
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,440
I'll show her what I want!

263
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,940
And I do it again.

264
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,880
At some point in time, the idea got started that people should change to please one another.

265
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,260
I blame it on books, so I went to a novel.

266
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,360
Darling.

267
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,140
Dearest.

268
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,500
Let's tell funny stories.

269
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,500
Don't you want to make love?

270
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,580
I sold my libido to buy a sense of humor.

271
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,540
And I sold my wit to buy a good sex drive.

272
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,580
You're not funny anymore.

273
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,100
You're limp.

274
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,080
You're both beyond help, and I'm getting sleepy.

275
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,240
I closed the book on them and turned out the light.

276
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,280
What?

277
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:39,640
What?

278
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,660
Oh!

279
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,360
Well, that may be the end of the chapter, but my readers still want to know how this comes out.

280
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,560
I'm Gabe Woletzki, advice columnist.

281
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,080
Look for my next byline.

282
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,240
It can be dead.

283
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,980
Oh, man.

284
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,020
I'm going to bed.

285
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,020


286
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,020


287
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,280
Oh, Hitler had Eva Braun.

288
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,480
Manson had Squeaky Frong.

289
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,520
Ted Bundy got lots of dates.

290
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,340
I wonder what I'm doing wrong.

291
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,380
I don't pretend to understand women's little quirks.

292
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,980
Just one thing I know for sure.

293
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,020
Chicks dig jerks.

294
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,500
Yeah.

295
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,520
Well, if I meet one more single mother, I'll be a little more of a jerk.

296
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:32,520


297
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:32,520


298
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:32,520


299
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,120
I'm going to bed, and I'm going to sleep.

300
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,040
I put on my woolen jacket and head to the beach.

301
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,040


302
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,200
Oh.

303
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,460
I'm going to bed.

304
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,460


305
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,460


306
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh.

307
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,240
I'm going to sleep.

308
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,240


309
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,240


310
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,240


311
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,240


312
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,820
Oh.

313
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,820
Oh.

314
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,420
What?

315
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,460
What?

316
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,220
Oh.

317
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,060
I know for sure chicks are big jerks

318
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,780
Well, I'm sure there's some out there who can relate

319
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,840
Particularly young men without a date

320
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,480
See some jerks on fine fine pay go driving away

321
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,120
Oh

322
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,660
Yeah, was that a new bruise you got on you?

323
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,840
What does it say that he loves you?

324
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,100
Sure he beats you but afterwards he cries

325
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,060
Oh baby, I could die

326
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,420
Honey, I don't think that's nothing to be proud of

327
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,400
I think it's called alcoholism

328
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,160
I don't think you should move away

329
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,600
Stay with him till you're in your grave

330
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,480
Yeah

331
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,440
You're so sweet

332
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,600
Can't we just be friends?

333
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,660
I think of you as a brother

334
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,700
Oh man

335
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,100
Oh man

336
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,440
Ow

337
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,220
Ow

338
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,420
You're hurting me

339
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,480
Ow

340
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,460
Ow

341
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,960
What do I have to offer you, baby?

342
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,720
Poetry and true love

343
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,980
That's not enough, I know for sure

344
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,880
You need someone to throw you through the door

345
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,500
Well, I don't pretend to understand

346
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,380
Women's little quirks

347
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,100
Just one thing I know for sure

348
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Chicks dig jerks

349
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,020
Oh

350
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,480
Yeah

351
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,580
Oh

352
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,100
Oh

353
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,400
Chicks dig jerks

354
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,940
It's so true

355
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,100
Oh

356
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,360
Oh

357
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,520
Tell your man be mean to a man

358
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,200
They'll never leave you then

359
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,180
Cause chicks dig jerks

360
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,860
Oh

361
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,940
Just ignore them

362
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,080
Just ignore them

363
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,080


364
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,080


365
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,100
Act like they're not there

366
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,340
Man, you're gonna be pulling chicks out of your hair

367
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,520
They love that

368
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,620
Woo

369
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,880
Act like you don't care

370
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,280
Oh, look at them everywhere

371
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,880
They come running

372
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,340
Woo

373
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,380
Tired of being a good guy

374
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,660
Such a lonely life

375
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,340
I'm gonna be a jerk

376
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,380
Yeah, that's right

377
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm gonna step on lots of toes

378
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,060
I'm gonna step on lots of toes

379
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,180
Woo

380
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,560
Girl's gonna go crazy for that guy

381
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,720
Baby, I'm gonna act like I don't even know you

382
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,480
Woo

383
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,980
I'm gonna return one of your calls

384
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,040
Oh, I hear her

385
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,560
She's already at the door, man

386
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,600
She's intrigued by my indifference

387
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,380
Woo

388
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,620
I'm a jerk and it's working out

389
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,420
Ha-ha

390
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,080
I'm looking for a woman with low self-esteem

391
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,360
One that looks good, who'll stay home and clean

392
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,660
One that won't ask me who, what, or why

393
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,620
And believe me when I tell her

394
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,960
Full-face lies

00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,600
One who has a bad deed just like me

A silent woman with nice straight hair

398
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,600
Don't think no more

399
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,320
To count it blank stares

400
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,240
Wax my fastball

401
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,340

402
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,760

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,800
Won't talk back or criticize me

409
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:19,800


410
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,900
I hope you find one that ain't too smart

411
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,560
Laugh at my jokes

412
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,240
Don't mind when I fart

413
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,280
One that ain't working on her Ph.D.

414
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,640
Could last one to bring

415
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,000
She tried to kill me

416
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,780

427
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:01,820


428
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:14,800
Someone that could be in school

429
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:14,800

00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,460
I'm looking for a woman

447
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,020

Excuse me

459
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,660
Big burly guys in skirts

460
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,480
race dirt bikes

461
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,240
over our famous cruising track

462
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,960
See nitro-burning leather

463
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,520
boys drag down our runway

464
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,180
See the bumps and jumps

465
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,480
that'll throw those drag queens

466
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,020
30 feet in the air

467
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,660
Motocross dressing

468
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,980
See it there or be it there

469
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,900
Motocross dressing

470
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,360
Free ruby slippers

471
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,460
to the first hundred fans

472
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,640
Motocross dressing

473
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,700
So hot it flames

474
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,840
I just want to go

475
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,920
motocross dressing

476
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,620
Is that so wrong?

477
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,880
Mr. Johnson?

478
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,300
Yes?

479
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,040
Mrs. Corbeau, we'll see you now.

480
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,780
Thank you.

481
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,020
Oh, Mr. Johnson, have a seat.

482
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,400
Thanks.

483
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,700
I have to say I'm a little nervous.

484
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,720
Oh, that's understandable.

485
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,720
Just relax.

486
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,200
I've looked your resume over and I'm quite impressed.

487
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,540
Harvard MBA, magna cum laude.

488
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,120
You seem to be Colossal Industries' dream come true.

489
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,560
I just have a few preliminary questions.

490
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,320
Sure, ask me anything.

491
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,540
You seem to be a very impressive individual, Mr. Johnson.

492
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,680
Well, I don't like to come across as cocky.

493
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:18,940
I'm just a little bit nervous.

494
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:18,940


495
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:18,940


496
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:18,940


497
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:18,940


498
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:18,940


499
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:18,940


500
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,440
But I do expect big things from myself.

501
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,080
That doesn't surprise me at all.

502
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,060
Tell me, Mr. Johnson, where do you see yourself a year from now?

503
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,780
In a year?

504
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,940
I see myself with a major company such as yours.

505
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,580
Maybe not a promotion, but I do expect my people to see my ability.

506
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,300
Hmm.

507
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,580
How about in three years?

508
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,360
In three years, I see myself being a major asset to my department.

509
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,020
Really?

510
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,500
In five years?

511
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,460
In five years.

512
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,580
My magical transformation will have taken place, and I will become Habdashanana.

513
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,740
I will be lord over all I survey.

514
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,620
You, you will be my slave.

515
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,080
You puny humans can do nothing to stop me.

516
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,900
I will have my...

517
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:55,940
Uh...

518
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,480
Assistant manager.

519
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,840
I really think I could be assistant manager.

520
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,620
Oh.

521
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,920
Yes, thank you, Mr. Johnson.

522
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,140
We'll be in touch.

523
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,120
Migs, Tallboy, Shanana has surfaced.

524
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,180
He goes by the name of Johnson.

525
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,460
You know what to do.

526
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,080
You know, if you're still listening, then you're the kind of listener we're aiming at.

527
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,500
Oh.

528
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:16,800
Yeah.

529
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,840
That's right.

530
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:24,100
And the people doing the aiming in that case was a group called Hub City Spoke Repair.

531
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,720
Yes, indeed.

532
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,740
From New Jersey.

533
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,460
Jackson, New Jersey.

534
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,580
Um...

535
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,320
Whoa!

536
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,240
Sometimes I just don't know what to expect.

537
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,720
And, uh, I didn't know what to expect when I was handed that tape, but, yeah, it's a

538
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,240
it's a comedy group that's ready for prime time.

539
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:57,880
They also did the, uh, little mock commercials and love letter advice that was a little while

540
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,480
before that.

541
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:08,080
Chicks Dig Jerks was the song by Bill Hicks from his album Dangerous.

542
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,380
Most of that's a comedy album.

543
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,680
The song...

544
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,080
Oh, no, that's from Relentless, the other album.

545
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,400
Chicks Dig Jerks.

546
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,580
Man.

547
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:24,220
And, uh, Low Self-Esteem by an Arkansas band called Groove Handle.

548
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,220
We've played Groove Handle before.

549
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,140
They are a groove.

550
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,480
And, uh, and in the background, the evil Jay Cottons.

551
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,540
Ugly noises.

552
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,400
Let's just listen to his ugly noises.

553
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,680
I believe this is a piece called Zombo Frop Land.

554
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,040
There have been zombo problems.

555
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,420
Where are we?

556
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,220
Where?

557
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,480
Wait.

558
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,240
Wait.

559
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,360
Oh, I know where we are.

560
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,180
We're in California.

561
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,600
Yes, we're in Berkeley.

562
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,000
We'll have it all figured out.

563
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,760
It...

564
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:36,420
The description of this is in the compound name for La Oomloom, means flooded he, love

565
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:36,700
him.

566
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,400
He is God, the father of Jehovah who is hidden under the sky.

567
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,400


568
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,260
And the only one who has the power to do the deluging sea.

569
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,340
Doctor's operating.

570
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,220
Doctor's operating under operational instruction KYJ.

571
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,780
The entire program is upside down and backwards.

572
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,320
This gigantic torso of Os-On found on Easter Island is presently in the collection of the

573
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,020
British Museum.

574
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,380
Atop its large rugose dead-eyed rudiment of a head are two pictographic elements.

575
00:27:59,520 --> 00:27:59,940
She's beautiful.

576
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,240
The top center represents Easter egg island while the larger rim represents the ocean

577
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,500
waters surrounding and deluging this at one time tallest lavaic mountain in the Pacific.

578
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,400
Here, during the Cenozoic age, gigantic rabbits once lived, giving rise to our current

579
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:19,620
legend of the Easter bunny, the somehow animate and live large rabbit who invests our subconscious,

580
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,240
even as he infects the minds of our young'uns and causes them to run riot.

581
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,400
In a search for Easter eggs, candy bubbles...

582
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,920
I have seen the gods and they are us!

583
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,600
And what about the tooth fairy?

584
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,140
This is nothing more than a malign deity.

585
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:42,760
Surviving into the contemporary era, just as the cuckoo clocks and mantel statuettes are

586
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:48,000
actually the secret household gods of the ancient Romans and Etruscans spying on us.

587
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,940
Now I take offense to you calling us Romans ancient.

588
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,360
We're only a few thousand years old.

589
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,300
Oh, tall boy, when I was your age, I was just a young'un indeed.

590
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,460
But it didn't give me the right to go calling the ancient gods something else than what they were.

591
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:03,920
.

592
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:03,960
.

593
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,120
.

594
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,380
.

595
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,280
.

596
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,100
.

597
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,200
.

598
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,320
.

599
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,640
.

600
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,680
.

601
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:29,740
.

602
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,120
What are you saying?!

603
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,120


604
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,020
And now the Contraries are riding over the plane.

605
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,520
This just in off the subtenuous wire service.

606
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,960
It has been announced the subtenuous show has been cancelled due to bad ratings.

607
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,360
Callers have not been calling in and it was unequivocally announced that it had to be cancelled.

608
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,640
The head of ABC, NBC and CBS announced today that all efforts will be made in order to cancel it.

609
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,860
Fifteen minutes, boss. Fifteen more minutes of bibble babble.

610
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,980
No, there will be no further time. There will be no further broadcast.

611
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,620
The show will be cancelled at this exact moment.

612
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,040
It's T minus five seconds and that's all there is to it.

613
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,740
If you've got anything you've got to say, you better say it now because they're going, going, gone.

614
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,800
That's right. Offer ends tonight at midnight and dealers and inquiries welcome.

615
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,480
Give us a call.

616
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,780
It's after midnight, you stoop. Oh, my God.

617
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,920
There's no point. We can't pull this together.

618
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,180
But there's one thing more to be said.

619
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,280
Caramel popcorn.

620
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,760
Shut it down. Shut it down.

621
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,340
Well, this puts us right back where we started.

622
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,020
There's something fishy about all this.

623
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,900
Why can't it meet with your little crew?

624
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,000
You've wasted your time over a cheap romance.

625
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,340
And a stupid show.

626
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,060
Release the family.

627
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,140
Bring back Michelle.

628
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,320
Before Berlin comes down on our necks.

629
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,400
It's Berlin.

630
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,880
They are lovers.

631
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,720
Berlin? What?

632
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,260
Nabi.

633
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:40,820
No.

634
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,660
Nabi.

635
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:45,320
I remember exactly because it was the same day we heard His Excellency was shot.

636
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,540
Oh, thank you, Professor.

637
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,540
You're welcome.

638
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,100
Heitler.

639
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,400
Hey, I...

640
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:50,880
Heitler.

641
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,160
Decompress the chamber.

642
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,720
Maximum duration, ten seconds. Repeat.

643
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:00,100
Yes, friends, friends, you are listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

644
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,740
Owohoh!!!

645
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,780
Hmm, well, why weren't they on our site?

646
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:28,900
We must fight, hurry onward.

647
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,520
Altogether.

648
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,260
Taking action, garlic or nettle, send calling!

649
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:32,260


650
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,940
These are the beschadding nations against which we March today!

651
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:33,940


652
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,240
Huh?

653
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:34,380


654
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:34,380


655
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,400
Our, our, our very own Hour of Snack.

656
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,180
Ah, yes.

657
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,460
Yeah, well, you know, it's weird because I've never felt normal.

658
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,280
I don't think I'm a subgenius.

659
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:19,420
But I think that the reason I don't feel normal is because I had an odd childhood, basically.

660
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,660
Well, Russ, have you ever thought about exploiting your abnormality potential?

661
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,780
Well, no, but what is so bad about being normal?

662
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,620
Man, I hate pulsars on the back of a tropical forest.

663
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
I hate it.

664
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,020
I hate everything that grows at the bottom of the sea that you can't see.

665
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,240
Just because we don't have the technology.

666
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,860
I hate those illusions that grow on the back of my ears when I don't wash enough.

667
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,740
I hate it.

668
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,340
I hate it.

669
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,280
I hate it when blood comes out of my eyes.

670
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,500
I hate it.

671
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,040
I hate it when I tear my own hair out.

672
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:57,720
I hate it when I wake up in the morning and I crawl out of bed and I leave my bed.

673
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,800
I hate it.

674
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,400
I hate it.

675
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,360
I hate it.

676
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,000
I hate it.

677
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,220
I hate it.

678
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,360
I hate it.

679
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:11,580
I hate it when somebody comes up with a razor blade as I'm walking into work at 8 o'clock in the morning

680
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:17,260
and they cut my britches and they fall on the ground and I'm standing there and I forgot to put on my underwear.

681
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,680
I hate it.

682
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,800
I hate it when Bob comes to my house with a garbage sack full of poultry claiming to be my in-law.

683
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,800
I'm not married.

684
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,040
I'm not married.

685
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,800
Indecent.

686
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:35,800
I'm not married.

687
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,660
Beautiful little stupid bird.

688
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:36,760


689
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,560
Oh, well, it ain't straight up yet.

690
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,500
It ain't straight up yet.

691
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:39,920
Oh, well...

692
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,240
Well, just a moment, we'll, we'll...

693
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,960
Don't worry, Buck.

694
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,840
I got pills for that.

695
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,340
That's right.

696
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,200
It will be soon.

697
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,900
Now we gotta wait to tell you what, where we are until it's straight up.

698
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,860
Yeah, and you can help, friends.

699
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,620
If you can just stimulate your radio enough, put your hand on that radio and love.

700
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,320
Lay your hands on the radio and feel the power, the healing power come through.

701
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:02,760
That's right.

702
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,360
You can feel the power of your radio.

703
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,400
warming your hand up okay wait wait a minute wait a minute but we're playing

704
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,280
it we're still scared we're still scared

705
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,640
who is this man where did he come from

706
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:37,280
what fiendish power did he possess that could ruin the life of this girl

707
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,880
which will allow you to continue to have

708
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,020
a

709
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:47,780
repeated ecstasies we will come to many climactic moments yes yes an excess of

710
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:54,140
ecstasies and climactic moments for at least the next half hour at least

711
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,260
but continue as long as you can my friends an excess of stamina for you

712
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:05,740
praise bob praise bob and pass the hour of slack and the almond oil it is a

713
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,840
time of flickering

714
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:12,200
in more action a time when the old standards have crumbled as if hit by history's greatest

715
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,360
tidal wave of filth and perversion and sexual promiscuity and dreamed of even five years ago

716
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,000
sex and violence

717
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,160
sex

718
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,500
sex

719
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,240
sex

720
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,420
sex

721
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,540
sex

722
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,260
violence

723
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,040
sex

724
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,660
sex

725
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:36,820
sex

726
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:36,820


727
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:36,820


728
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:36,820


729
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:36,820


730
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:36,820


731
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:36,820


732
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:36,820


733
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:36,820


734
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,460
so much sex

735
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:37,460


736
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,240
so much sex

737
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,240


738
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,620
the sex

739
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,480
is being

740
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,020
terminated

741
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,880
we would change

742
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:42,900
sex

743
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:42,900


744
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,160
the fon

745
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,060
that's

746
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,480
not

747
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:44,480


748
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:44,880
of….

749
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,260
the end

750
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,580
that's

751
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,660
such R ما

752
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,960
simply Bob.

753
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,140
We hope you're ready for slack.

754
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,300
Oh, lots of slack.

755
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,620
And, well, as once was said by Father Angus,

756
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,360
if you're listening, you'll soon be glistening.

757
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,180
It does tend to wet you down a little bit.

758
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,980
I don't know if it's sweat or tears

759
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,460
or some other sort of lubrication,

760
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,200
but the hour of slack is definitely the best product

761
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,560
for curing all of your ills

762
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,300
and, you know, moisturizing skin and other parts.

763
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,060
Is swimming in slack, though, being truly slackful?

764
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,220
Well, maybe floating.

765
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,100
Well, it depends.

766
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,200
See, if you're swimming in slack,

767
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,840
you don't have to make any effort.

768
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,660
It's effortless.

769
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:39,820
There you are.

770
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,740
Yeah, that would be slackful swimming.

771
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,680
Slippery sliding, slackful swimming.

772
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,560
And if this confuses you folks,

773
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,460
well, fear not.

774
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
It will all be made crystal clear.

775
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,800
And I will apply little calipers to the front of my head

776
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,680
and as my nozzle is gently,

777
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,480
very, very quietly and very softly,

778
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,720
ripped through my face

779
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,640
and since slithering off into the black mist,

780
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,120
the void of consciousness.

781
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,560
And consciousness is a big void for some of us

782
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,620
and nobody cares.

783
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,420
A big void for some of us

784
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,460
and nobody cares.

785
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,320
How come no one wants to talk about Earth Day?

786
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,880
What happens on Earth Day, Dave?

787
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,220
What happened?

788
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,340
I see they're already commercializing Earth Day.

789
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,740
You can go to Kmart

790
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,560
and get your little Earth Day sweatshirties.

791
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,540
You can go to Kmart

792
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:26,540


793
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:26,540


794
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,460
and get your little Earth Day nylon socks.

795
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,320
You can go to Kmart

796
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,320
and get your Earth Day little plastic hat.

797
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,560
And a polyester jock.

798
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,500
And a polyester jock.

799
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,720
And a polyester jock.

800
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,760
You people make me sick.

801
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,740
What did you say, Bob?

802
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,280
I said good Lord.

803
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,960
Were they the instruments of evil?

804
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,080
600.

805
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,540
Three score.

806
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,240
That phone number is...

807
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,980
Six.

808
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,680
306 score and 600 and 966.

809
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,720
We're...

810
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,620
No, no, we're...

811
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,160
No, don't worry.

812
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,460
You guys...

813
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,220
There's nothing here.

814
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,700
Then we can make the plans now.

815
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,420
We can really reveal the plans.

816
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,500
No, there's no problem.

817
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,920
No, don't reveal the plans.

818
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,040
But we can't talk about any of this stuff.

819
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,740
We can't talk about Bohandas or Rumaus or Kitty.

820
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,500
No, don't...

821
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,900
Please, don't talk about any...

822
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,380
Because those confused people...

823
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,340
Bohandas was walking through Tokyo.

824
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,760
Bohandas is the friend of all the little children.

825
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,680
What about Wolwo?

826
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,080
Yes, friends.

827
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,520
Halloween is getting closer.

828
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,360
Closer and closer.

829
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,340
And it is going to be very scary.

830
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,340
Here in the subgenius world.

831
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,720
And even out there in the world of reality.

832
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,040
Stand up on your...

833
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,340
Everybody wants to have three puppies in a bar of soap.

834
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,220
I can't take it.

835
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:41,980
You can't...

836
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,120
You can't clean...

837
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,420
You can't wash soap.

838
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,720
What are you going to do?

839
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,520
Cut that bar of soap in half and rub it against itself?

840
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,460
Soap is the cleanest thing known to man.

841
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,160
You can't wash this show out of your ears either.

842
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,500
Yeah.

843
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,140
I tried scrubbing it out.

844
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,520
You tried scrubbing it out.

845
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:56,520


846
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,300
You tried rubbing it out.

847
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,500
You tried scouring it out.

848
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,540
This is the show that's amazing.

849
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,320
You go listen to six hours of Beethoven right now,

850
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,320
and I can guarantee you, you'll still hear this show tomorrow morning.

851
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:05,820
That's right.

852
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:08,860

864
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:25,360


865
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:34,720
...return my love, a longing burns deep inside me.

866
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:45,340
Retain my love, I want you always beside me.

867
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,120
Love like house, my love.

868
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:55,800
Just be made for you and for me.

869
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,320
Return.

870
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,280
Won't you return my love?

871
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:09,540
For my love is yours.

872
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,180
Went to the cupboard.

873
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,440
Lord, to get a poor daughter a bowl.

874
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,320
Was she a bit old, my brother took over.

875
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:38,240
Because you know he had a bowl of his own.

876
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,760
Stoop down, baby.

877
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,160
Stoop down and see what your daddy can see.

878
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,420
Stoop down.

879
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,960
Stoop down.

880
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:53,100
You sure ain't got nothing but hate.

881
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,660
Oh, that's where you've been.

882
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,340
Midnight.

883
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,920
Night.

884
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,260
Night.

885
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,120
Midnight.

886
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,800
Night.

887
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,540
Midnight.

888
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,380
Midnight.

889
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:25,380


890
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:25,380


891
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:25,700
Midnight.

892
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,440
Night.

893
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,600
Midnight.

894
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,540
And the audience loves it.

895
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,080
Yeah, thank you.

896
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,400
At least my mind is still okay.

897
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,220
They can't get enough of it.

898
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,420
Mindly still, I have.

899
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:32,960
Okay.

900
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,600
Here we go.

901
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,900
Now Jader's going to balance seven poke miles on his head.

902
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,320
High speed.

903
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,760
And it's time for you to tell me a little bit about what my industry is.

904
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,380
Here we go.

905
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,980
I have a mind.

906
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,160
Have I mind... least... still...

907
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,580
Have I mind... still...

908
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,100
...intro-graph...

909
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:53,980
...extended...

910
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,500
...the least on my mind?

911
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,540
What's the meaning of the word meaning?

912
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,060
What's the meaning of the word word?

913
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,480
What's the meaning of the word the?

914
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,060
What's the meaning of the word what?

915
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,320
What are you by do? What are you by do by do by do?

916
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,780
Money is to burn.

917
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,460
Hit Dominica Honda's octoboon lady.

918
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,520
Ahhhh! It's in my ear, it's in my ear!

919
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,620
No, no, that wasn't, that's not the show.

920
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,680
That's one of those creatures that...

921
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,340
That's right, Dr. Jewell, that was that thing that was growing on you earlier today.

922
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,860
Oh no, it's in my ear now?

923
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,860
It's in your ear.

924
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,160
Oh no, I'm gonna have to change shirts as well as shorts, this is awful.

925
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,040
What now?

926
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,720
I, you're, you're drooling.

927
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,700
Anybody can tell from listening to this that there's big puddles of saliva just leaping from your face.

928
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,940
We have nothing to slow down.

929
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,940
Why don't you slow down and express yourself?

930
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,500
No, I do.

931
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,940
But, we're, we're very disorganized up here.

932
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,180
You gotta understand that.

933
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,080
I don't even know what I'm saying.

934
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,460
Well, I don't even understand what the person asked us.

935
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:43,840
I mean, come on.

936
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,240
You're dealing with people that put on a show like this.

937
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,120
What do you think's gonna happen?

938
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,100
Hello, you're talking to Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

939
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,880
This isn't WGAR or Mannequin or anything.

940
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,680
Indians can't even take peyote no more, can't even celebrate their own religion.

941
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,840
And you can get all this sticky...

942
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:04,000
There's this big dumb looking polythene swimming pool that's an earth...

943
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,360
I don't even know what I'm, uh...

944
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,020
Hello, you're talking to Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

945
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,500
You know what I'm saying here?

946
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,400
I'm kinda like a smooth, uh, smooth sailor from outer space.

947
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,780
If you catch my...

948
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,820
Well, I'm not asking you to catch my...

949
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,140
If you catch my tire drift, I...

950
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:15,900
I'm sorry, what now?

951
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,120
Hey, guys.

952
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:17,940
Uh, yes?

953
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:18,980
What's happenin'?

954
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,040
I'm sweating profusely.

955
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,980
Uh, we're heavy into recycling down at the farm here.

956
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:25,820
Uh-huh.

957
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,320
Well, that's a damn good idea.

958
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,880
I'm glad somebody has decided to re-flourish the earth, as it were.

959
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,280
To return those aliens to, uh...

960
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,220
Well, they're not from here.

961
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,640
Are they?

962
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,900
No, well, they're not, but, uh...

963
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,280
But if you believe Heinrich Himmler,

964
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,540
the, the Reichsmarschall of...

965
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,220
of outer Greece,

966
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,620
you, you would know...

967
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,280
Oh, well.

968
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,360
...that the aliens come from the center of the core of the Velikov skin void.

969
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,240
I'm sorry, pig man.

970
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:52,740
I'm sorry.

971
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,320
Don't they, uh...

972
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,520
Don't they, uh, dump off, uh, styrofoam cups up on the way down?

973
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,600
You were...

974
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,660
Now, won't you say something about my dysfunctional thing?

975
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,340
No, it's these aliens.

976
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:03,860
They're...

977
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:08,000
They're known to carry a bunch of styrofoam all the time.

978
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,500
What do you do?

979
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,180
Squish them down?

980
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,500
It could be done.

981
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,680
Well, I'll go for that plan.

982
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,720
Squish them all down, make, like, very flat pancake things,

983
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,620
we'll ship them out on a big old bed truck

984
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,040
and dump it somewhere in Louisiana in the middle of a swamp.

985
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,980
All right, well, you, you can do this.

986
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,420
We'll, we'll, we'll burn all of them down.

987
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,920
Yeah, but I want to cover the carry charge.

988
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,740
You give me, like, a 25% thing, okay?

989
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,200
Okay.

990
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:32,760
All right.

991
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,460
Okay, but you gotta preserve them in large

992
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,740
so we'll get the other spin going.

993
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,440
You know what I mean?

994
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,160
A spin's a spin!

995
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,900
You know, I just realized that I've been extrapolating about

996
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,200
who put the snot on my gumbo as a Creole favorite,

997
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,160
and now I hear someone has a song called

998
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,020
Who Put the Booger on My Beer Mug.

999
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,820
So never, ever will I say,

1000
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,300
Who Put Snot in My Gumbo ever again!

1001
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,320
I swear by God on this Earth Day coming up day!

1002
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:13,740
Lonesome guy.

1003
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:14,760
Save the trees, man!

1004
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,840
You think I'm hampered by a lack of brain cells?

1005
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,780
It doesn't do a damn bit of difference, does it?

1006
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:20,860
Yeah, it does.

1007
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,380
Save the trees, man.

1008
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,880
I can't hear you.

1009
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,540
Save the trees.

1010
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,800
Save the trees.

1011
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,440
Save the world.

1012
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,800
The tree with nipples that feed the world

1013
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,500
like mighty acorns.

1014
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:34,960
Save the trees.

1015
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,320
Oh!

1016
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,480
My head is ringing!

1017
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,940
Henry, my friend Kyle, the craft collector,

1018
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,300
is gonna come get your butt, get your butt.

1019
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:42,300


1020
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:46,560
Now, will you want to perform a proctological examination on me,

1021
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,900
the king of Mars?

1022
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,480
You silly fool!

1023
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,040
Oh, you're talking to a lonesome cowboy, Dave.

1024
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,420
That's right, folks.

1025
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,340
Send all your money to Dr. Howell.

1026
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,220
Care of this station in five years.

1027
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,920
Howell can be very charming.

1028
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,380
And the more he's adored by his followers,

1029
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,500
the more powerful he becomes.

1030
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,540
And the more powerful, the more influence he has.

1031
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,020
Now we hear he's saying he's Christ.

1032
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,920
I say bury him under a rock.

1033
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,160
If he comes up in three days, then I'll believe he's Jesus.

1034
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,540
I'd like to dedicate this next song to all of you

1035
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,460
who are out there listening to the show and...

1036
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,000
On the show.

1037
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:25,600
It's spooky.

1038
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,700
...being with us tonight here.

1039
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,300
It's pootie.

1040
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,800
It's almost 6 o'clock, but, uh...

1041
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,700
It has all of those adjectives...

1042
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,000
We still have a little fun and good cheer to go around.

1043
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,240
We're still trying to find out where the fun and good cheer went.

1044
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,400
And we're gonna see the night out with you, our audience.

1045
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,020
As we all feel good about the show.

1046
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,260
Feel good about our mission here on the air.

1047
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,080
It's our nameless mission.

1048
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,000
Ain't got no name.

1049
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,840
It's just a mission.

1050
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,140
It's what we gotta do.

1051
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,340
We don't say why we do what we do, but you kinda know.

1052
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,900
Otherwise, well, you wouldn't be listening.

1053
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,040
The caller, mesmerized by the voices, finds himself unable to move.

1054
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:10,020
And turns the stereo up past societally acceptable limits.

1055
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,820
I wish you'd just come out, come forth with some bold, brilliant statement.

1056
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,840
Just say a few words instead of muttering in this sullen fashion in the background.

1057
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:19,800
Okay, okay, okay.

1058
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,860
All right, now, what's your beef?

1059
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,460
Well, it would be nice if everybody would just pay their pledge.

1060
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,060
Yes.

1061
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,780
Pay your pledge.

1062
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,580
Well, yes, of course.

1063
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,340
That's certainly important.

1064
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,020
You know, tithing is demanded, not just requested.

1065
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,000
But I...

1066
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,000


1067
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,320
But I will give it back to you now.

1068
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:51,640
Well, uh, make sure you have the right address so I receive the full benefit of the prime premium and significant monetary emolument.

1069
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,800
I appreciate the kindness.

1070
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,560
Remember, to give is to be blessed.

1071
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,320
Thank you.

1072
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,860
You can open the jar now.

1073
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,000
Well, you've got some air holes there, uh...

1074
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,480
Uh...

1075
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:08,500
Uh...

1076
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,500


1077
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:09,900
Uh...

1078
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,020
Uh...

1079
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,340
He's pretending he can't breathe.

1080
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,820
He's on a breathing strike.

1081
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,480
Well, this...

1082
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,740
This would affect some people, but, uh...

1083
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,140
Frankly, I...

1084
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,460
Let me see.

1085
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,460
I was looking in my sermon this morning, and, uh...

1086
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,940
It said that, uh...

1087
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:36,380
Bob, who being in very nature Dobbs, did not consider equality with anti-Bob something to be grasped, clutched, or palpated, but rather smoked in his living pipe, like a fine burly or rum-soaked shag.

1088
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,480
He himself, nothing taken away from Bob.

1089
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:38,480


1090
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,040
He was taking the very nay, sure, taking instead the very nature of a salesman, never taking no for an answer.

1091
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:52,180
And being in appearance as a man, he fumbled himself in the dark, staining the sheets, and became obedient to everything.

1092
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,100
Uh-huh.

1093
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,700
Just don't shake it.

1094
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,020
No.

1095
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,640
You don't want to see the, uh... the settling sediment.

1096
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,600
You might have to cut the opening a little bit wider, too, to actually get the liquid out of the bottle, but...

1097
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:05,760
Uh-huh.

1098
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,460
Well, we'll be giving you such tips for...

1099
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:13,580
For, uh, consumption and, um, redemption, as it were, for the next three hours.

1100
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:22,700
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether this cult, that cult, or for that matter, any cult, should so long endure.

1101
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,220
We are met on a great potter's field of that war.

1102
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:32,580
These bland pinks, living and dead, shall little know, nor long remember, what we do here.

1103
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,720
By the way, I forget, just what is it that we are doing here, anyway?

1104
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,380
Oh, yeah, right.

1105
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,000
It is for we, the living...

1106
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,760
To confess that J.R. Bob Dobbs is dead, dead dead.

1107
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:48,460
To the infinite gratification of Jehovah One, the Father, senile, infinitely maligned space god.

1108
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,880
Jesus came here as a servant, but Dobbs came as a salesman, through scriptures, chapter 21st, 19.

1109
00:49:54,140 --> 00:50:01,780
And he came unto the daughters of the farmers, and knew them well, when there was no room for him to be by himself during the night.

1110
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,260
And in the morning before the sunrise, he continued traveling upon his route,

1111
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,840
so that the franchise might not be usurped.

1112
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,780
Yea, and to this day, it never hath been so.

1113
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,440
Bobbs is still the route, Bobbs is still the franchise.

1114
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,920
And now, as Sister Basilica passes out among you, as she sniffs the contents of the collection plate,

1115
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:30,560
each and every one of you should reach down, deep down, and give, give to the Church of the Powerful, blinding apostasy,

1116
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:36,080
which fears no throne, but exults in its own freedom to scatter its fundaments on the earth.

1117
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,880
Soiling the uppers of its shoes, to let down the inward-produced product of its concentration,

1118
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,480
fertilizing the fields of science, sorcery, art, and religion.

1119
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:52,900
Hull can be very charming, and the more he is adored by his followers, the more powerful he becomes.

1120
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,200
For lo, the frop cloudeth my brain, and my buckler and shield are ripped away.

1121
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:05,040
I am naked before thee, Dobbs, all neckoy. Thou who hast unbuckled my buckler and unsnapped my shield,

1122
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,700
which was my sole protection.

1123
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:12,600
Yea, my buckler being so unbuckled, I am even as a pro-bucker, buck naked before Bobb.

1124
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,020
Bobb dashes a bucket of ice water over my loins.

1125
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,740
The buck passeth not, while the buck and the doe dwell in the same forest.

1126
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,440
The buck is Bobb, he is bucking first.

1127
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,500
He changeth brickbats into buckets of bucks.

1128
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,160
Bucks, bucks, yea, bucks, bucks, but a awkward buck.

1129
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,540
Boy, Buck does that so nicely.

1130
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,200
That's right, Buck, can you come out to California and say a station ID for us?

1131
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:40,280
Buck underwent four operations to get his vocal cords to be able to do that.

1132
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,440
But he still hasn't been Wellmanized. Well, let's do that to him after the show.

1133
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,560
And I'll inform the head.

1134
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,820
The head, what about the head?

1135
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,360
What about the scary poster of Dobbs' thing?

1136
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,820
That evil head.

1137
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,980
There is no sign of Wellman.

1138
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,100
There's no sign of Wellman.

1139
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,620
We're just laying low right here and hoping that we can get in touch with you.

1140
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,240
Wellman's gone?

1141
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,260
Yea, Wellman's gone.

1142
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,460
Psychic dog.

1143
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,660
If we can just get the head inside that lead-lined vault, we'll be okay.

1144
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,700
Friends, beware that head.

1145
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,660
Save it.

1146
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,520
I left a little Wellman at home, but he wants to be in touch.

1147
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:23,660
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer rose slowly above the trap between the third and fourth greens.

1148
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,240
Down at Onion Creek Country Club and golf course.

1149
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,060
Thumping slowly like an over-enlarged fig,

1150
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:40,660
the bleeding head slowly rose at a gentle angle above the green dripping blood.

1151
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:51,760
It hovered briefly over the sand trap and then slowly ascended towards the constellation of Orion

1152
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:59,140
at an angle of about 44.325 degrees, like a shot off a shovel.

1153
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,880
There was no doubt that it was the head of Arnold Palmer.

1154
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,940
That moon-faced smile was unforgettable.

1155
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,520
The population, the population of southeast Austin went wild.

1156
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:19,280
They tore off their clothes, danced in the streets and said,

1157
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,760
the bloody head has come.

1158
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,440
The time is here.

1159
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,920
Take off your clothes and be somebody.

1160
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,860
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer was above such things.

1161
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,840
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer rose gently.

1162
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,500
Buffeting itself slightly as it passed among some ancient pecan trees.

1163
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:44,000
Slowly, still ever moving upwards, it wobbled slightly.

1164
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:50,540
Spraying a small glissando of blood, so to speak, on the people below it.

1165
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:58,640
Healing two old ladies and giving an old man a substantial gland rebuild.

1166
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:11,840
At 14 minutes after 9, the bleeding head was sighted on the forward control radar access plant at Tarkstrom Air Force Base.

1167
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:20,120
Three interceptors were scrambled, one of which crashed on takeoff.

1168
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,380
They could find nothing.

1169
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,140
Radar was still tracking the head.

1170
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,900
The bloody head moved north.

1171
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,360
Rocketed over Dallas and Fort Worth.

1172
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:44,580
The radar at Caswell Air Force Base gave subsequent indications that something large and wet was moving north northeast.

1173
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,100
While ascending still upwards towards the constellation of Orion.

1174
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,480
The bloody head moved on.

1175
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,460
14 ex-virgins were rejuvenated in Lubbock.

1176
00:54:59,480 --> 00:54:59,880
The blood was still there.

1177
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,840
The head came off the entrance gate and jumped off the runway.

1178
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:11,380
While the tail of the aircraft left the site, somehow the head still passed through the other side that is below thešeo.

1179
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:12,880
The Roberto subcontractor

1180
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,120
Keep your hands out of each other's marsupial pockets, boys.

1181
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:17,980
That's right.

1182
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,640
One of these tapes just go right out, don't they?

1183
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,600
They sure do, Reverend Stank.

1184
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,020
G. Gordon Gordon's

1185
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,060
Ode to the Bleeding Head.
