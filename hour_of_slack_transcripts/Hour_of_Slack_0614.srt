1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
Atlas shrugged for Bob. He gave up the work of carrying the world and slacked off.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,720
Let's all shrug for Bob.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,980
Easier said than done, Friday Jones, but we will attempt to do just that.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,640
In fact, we must shrug off this show as fast as we possibly can.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,140
The Subgenius Hour of Slash!

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,440
Welcome, potential initiates.

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,860
Yeah, yeah, there it goes.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,100
Right, now get those two-ring modulators on that bad bag.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,560
Yeah, two-ring modulators, not one, but two.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,900
You go twice the speed of light.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,260
Crank up two-ring modulators.

12
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:05,700
Only a ring modulator can truly, truly hyper-extend the plasma drive.

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,960
That's sweet, that's sweet, that's analog, baby, that's real electricity.

14
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,240
There's no zeros and ones there, baby.

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,680
Nope.

16
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,480
That's the real juice.

17
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,260
They're all alive, it turns out to be a dream.

18
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,320
But it's funny, but with a heart.

19
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,180
I see there's a cross between airplane and Schumler's Lewis.

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,320
I think I can save it.

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,200
I think with about $100,000 I can turn from an idea into a concept.

22
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,320
You do facts meet treatment, I'll get back to you.

23
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,500
I think I can save it.

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,160
Okay, here's the pitch, baby.

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,340
Uh, The Hunger.

26
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:55,120
It's, uh, Eddie Murphy is a gay vampire living in, uh, San Francisco each year.

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,120


28
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,460
Doesn't suck blood because he's afraid of AIDS.

29
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,400
Talk to me, talk to me, Eddie.

30
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,180
Let's talk numbers.

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,300
Buddy Hackett is the wacky gay neighbor.

32
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,600
Sorry, I can't say blood on the air.

33
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,880
Buddy Hackett is the wacky gay neighbor who's into S&M but with a heart.

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,860
It's a horror film, it's a sitcom, it's a variety show.

35
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,480
I see it as a kind of an action comedy drama.

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,180
It's a furniture polish, it's a dessert topping.

37
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,760
It's all things to all people.

38
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,340
It's low-cost healthcare insurance.

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,080
It's a sitcom, it's a hard movie.

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,860
Children will love it, seniors will love it.

41
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,720
Pets will love it.

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,920
That's right, brothers and sisters.

43
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,120
Jesus' blood shed provides you with the token to get through those turnstiles up in heaven.

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,020
Yes, brothers and sisters, we're gonna ride the holy highway.

45
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,380
Oh, brothers.

46
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,980
There'll be homosexuals in heaven.

47
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,640
Just like you and me.

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,840
There'll be homosexuals in heaven.

49
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,120
For all eternity.

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,600
That's right, brothers and sisters.

51
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,720
Don't let the humanist, secularist fool you.

52
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,200
God does truly love all his children.

53
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:18,900
It's true.

54
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:26,640
No matter how sick, profane, twisted, warp, degenerate, backwards, redneck you are,

55
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,800
Jesus has a little tiny corner in his heart just for you.

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,060
So this evening, wrap yourself up in the American flag.

57
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,500
Snuggle up to the warm fire that is our Lord Jesus Christ and his Holy Spirit.

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,900
And be warm in his glowing, basking light.

59
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,800
Amen.

60
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,740
Amen.

61
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,040
Amen.

62
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,000
Tonight's proceedings are brought to you by the good Reverend Edward Sweetness

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,680
and Dr. Katahdin Light.

64
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,560
Yes, sweetness and light for you, brothers and sisters.

65
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,880
Sweetness and light.

66
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,720
Okay, I've got all the equipment set up,

67
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,600
microphones turned on, speakers turned off

68
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,320
so it won't go wee, you know.

69
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,760
But I'm ready to do a show.

70
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,780
I've got to do a show today.

71
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm a day late doing a show, but first I have to eat.

72
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,140
Oh, man, and the dogs look like they want to go out.

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,860
None of the servants are here today,

74
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,160
and it's just me, and, damn it,

75
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
I wanted to be able to sit and edit the Austin ranting.

76
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,000
It has to be edited for most of the stations

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,900
because it has a lot of cutting, cussing in it.

78
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,940
Cussing equals cutting.

79
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,940
Come on, you guys, let's do it.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,240
Come on.

81
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,120
Yeah, they can tell I'm too flustered right now

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
to take them for a walk.

83
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,600
And I have to do this show quick.

84
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,180
In fact, I got up this morning and thought to myself,

85
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,560
I need to get that damn show done by noon

86
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,820
so that I'll have time to dub it.

87
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,440
I actually had dubbed the copies myself

88
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,540
that go out to the stations,

89
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,060
and that takes a couple of days, the way we do it.

90
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,500
So I've got to get this damn thing done,

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,160
and it's 10 o'clock right now.

92
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,340
Luckily, wonderful work has been done

93
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,300
by our good friends at other subgenius radio shows,

94
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,920
Dr. Legume and Reverend Ed Strange,

95
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,040
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chad,

96
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,860
Chaz at WCSB,

97
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:53,120
and old KPFA shows with Hal and Puzzling Evidence and Janer,

98
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,420
and I've got other stuff to read.

99
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,540
We've just got tons and tons and tons and tons of stuff

100
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,920
that I don't have to stop and cut,

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,980
but I do have to just whip through it real fast.

102
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,700
In fact, there was an ESO show last week in Cleveland

103
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,560
that was just Chaz and Dave on their own

104
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,760
with their background tapes,

105
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,160
and it was actually one of the classic ESOs.

106
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:21,380
It shows beautiful speeches and slongs about X-Day,

107
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,700
so that's certainly pertinent.

108
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,420
And I wish I didn't have to stop and eat.

109
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,360
Luckily, I have some kind of Canadian hot links

110
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,620
I can microwave as soon as these dogs are finished

111
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,340
with their silly, earthly concerns.

112
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,460
Eating, sleeping, bathing, things like that.

113
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,380
I just, well, eating I like sometimes.

114
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,200
And I also enjoy the after effects of eating,

115
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:51,820
excremeditation.

116
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,000
But all of these things are like involuntary slack.

117
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,420
They're enforced slack.

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,420
I mean, sleep is wonderful.

119
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,180
It's the best.

120
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,720
Sleep is, as Dr. Philodrumon said so long, long ago,

121
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,140
sleep is the ultimate drug.

122
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,200
But I'm not on drugs.

123
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,860
I've got to get the damn show done,

124
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,340
and it's because of...

125
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,900
It's computer graphics again.

126
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,560
It's the Steve Jackson art game.

127
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,700
After six months, they fired the person

128
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,760
who was holding that project up.

129
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,320
They were very deplorable.

130
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,680
Hey, pud, beast, come.

131
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:29,940
Pud.

132
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,440
Getting up close to the road.

133
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,400
Pud. Pud. Pud, pud, beast, come.

134
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,380
God, it will take forever.

135
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,660
So finally, it was like, oh,

136
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,160
now that you've answered my question,

137
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,880
well, all the artwork's pretty much ready to go.

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,720
And it almost is.

139
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,220
I've got like just another day's worth of work,

140
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,880
and I can send Steve Jackson a stack of zip disks

141
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,360
that will blow everybody's mind out their kazoo.

142
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,380
But I can't do that until I finish this show.

143
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,920
Now, can I?

144
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,760
I can't do that.

145
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,040
I can't do that.

146
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,660
I do have to eat first.

147
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,520
I guess eating ain't so bad, friends.

148
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,420
Eating ain't so bad, but I tell you,

149
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,420
sometimes I think email is so, so bad.

150
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,980
I came in and I made the mistake of stopping to look at my email.

151
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,960
And, oh, somebody had posted this thing on the World Wide Web

152
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,420
that was hilarious, inadvertently hilarious,

153
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,160
but deadly.

154
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,160


155
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,940
deadly serious critique of the Church of the Subgenius

156
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,860
on account of, well, this super genius, I guess,

157
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,860
had been looking into it for a long time

158
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:01,620
and finally figured out that we were making fun

159
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,180
of his religion, too.

160
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,360
He was a transpersonalist, which, to tell the truth,

161
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,920
I'm not even sure what that means.

162
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,440
I think it's just the latest sort of trendy way

163
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,940
of saying new age or.

164
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,600
Hitler was a transpersonalist.

165
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,200
And I guess what the Tutsis and Hutus do to each other in Africa

166
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,100
is a transpersonal interaction in a way, too.

167
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,000
Anyway, he, the guy's basic gist was these subgeniuses,

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,260
they don't even believe in ESP or magic or any of the wonder

169
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,780
and healing and so forth, unless they say aliens caused it.

170
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,280
And so, friends, I don't know, maybe next week,

171
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll read you some of that.

172
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,440
In the meantime, there's much more funfalutin stuff here.

173
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,440
This is that show I was mentioning there about,

174
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,120
of Einstein's Secret Orchestra, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz,

175
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:10,400
on broadcast originally on WCSB in Cleveland on New Year's Day,

176
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,560
January 1st, 1998.

177
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,140
Here are some of the things that we're going to talk about.

178
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,140


179
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,920
Here are those terrible, terrible men.

180
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,560
I just dig that.

181
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,220
It's all I need.

182
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,880
You know, those things they found in space a few years ago,

183
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,660
they said, remember they said, oh, it looks like the waves.

184
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,640
They're like 300 million light years across.

185
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,920
And it might be the waves left over from the Big Bang.

186
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,580
It's kind of like sound waves are like reverberating.

187
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,920
through space there.

188
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,060
And those are really the love vibes.

189
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,020
Booker knew about the love vibes.

190
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,620
He's feeding off of those right there.

191
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,320
But I was trying to figure out, you know,

192
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,940
it's a Church of Apollo 8 thing

193
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,500
that's been evolving here a little bit.

194
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,120
It's actually Church of Apollo.

195
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,720
Because, well, Apollo 8 was the first one

196
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,180
to orbit the moon.

197
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,800
And they said about that one, they said,

198
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,860
well, Apollo 8 was, quite frankly,

199
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,880
the boldest step, the boldest decision

200
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,360
that we had made in the whole

201
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,460
Apollo spaceflight thing.

202
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,380
And, you know, because they hadn't gone around,

203
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,640
they'd only gone around the Earth a couple times, you know.

204
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,540
Here they were, they were going to, you know,

205
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,580
there you go, off into deep space.

206
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,220
If they miss you, you know, that's it, you're gone.

207
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,700
Hang on, hold that thought, hold that thought.

208
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,340
Dave's here.

209
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,360
I've got to go answer the door.

210
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,440
All right, so, anyway.

211
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,080
Where was I?

212
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,200
Where was I?

213
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,360
Oh, yeah, Apollo 8.

214
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,440
Yeah, because that one just orbited the moon.

215
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,640
But it was the boldest step

216
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,440
because they hadn't gone, you know, anywhere else.

217
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,920
They'd only gone around the Earth, you know, a couple times.

218
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,220
And here they were, you know, going to send them off

219
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,940
into deep space.

220
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,940
And they get around the moon,

221
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,620
and they see the Earth from deep space for the first time,

222
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,160
and they show these pictures back and take snapshots,

223
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,320
and it all becomes a big ecological movement.

224
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,740
Yeah.

225
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,360
When it should have become a reawakening spiritually

226
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,220
to set aside all the old religions.

227
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,580
You know, they worked for you 2,000 years ago, okay?

228
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,400
They worked for you 500 years ago, you know?

229
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,400
Even though we already did know

230
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,240
that the Earth wasn't the center of anything,

231
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,540
just 10,000 years ago,

232
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,320
because we were that old.

233
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,840
Somebody, now, we're no longer like we used to be,

234
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:08,900
and we're steamed out of it.

235
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:08,900


236
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:08,900


237
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:08,900


238
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:08,900


239
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:08,900


240
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:08,900


241
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:08,960
was 1 percent.

242
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:08,960


243
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:08,960


244
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:08,960


245
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:08,960


246
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:08,960


247
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,720
100 years from now,

248
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:09,720


249
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,840
because you know their studies,

250
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,080
And I am learning,

251
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,160


252
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,920
You and such have a life.

253
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,340
You sound so lonely out here, man.

254
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,100
And, uh, yeah.

255
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,580
And we are lonely out here, in a way.

256
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,120
But we're not lonely, because the universe, it turns out,

257
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,840
they find out that it's pretty loaded with all kinds of crap.

258
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,700
The universe is, of course, loaded with crap.

259
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,420
That's a pretty spiffy there, goularty sweatshirt.

260
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,340
Yeah, I'd like to thank you for that.

261
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,620
Hey, could you snap up the microphone a little bit, or a mic?

262
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,200
You gotta turn that up.

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,260
Gee, it is, isn't it?

264
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,220
Isn't it one of the coolest?

265
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,820
Look, see his ears?

266
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,400
Ernie's ears go right out where my nipples are,

267
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,320
on this goularty T-shirt you got me.

268
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,360
I mean, sweatshirt. I'm sorry.

269
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,660
Anyway, but yes, in the days of Caledonia and so forth,

270
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,460
when Cab Calloway was a major singer, religion didn't...

271
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,540
It worked. That's right. You're right. It worked.

272
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,140
Listen, folks, the curve of human evolution was bent.

273
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,720
Starts with a K.

274
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,300
It was bent when we went to the moon.

275
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,960
Right, when that little orbit was mishandled so misappropriately.

276
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,540
Yeah, and they snapped those little pictures.

277
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,240
Our little...

278
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,180
Yeah, our little synapses were popping, too.

279
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,520
My synapses were totally popping.

280
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,820
They're going right now, man. I can see the side of your head so hot.

281
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,740
My synapses have not stopped popping since December 1968.

282
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,940
And here it is.

283
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,660
Friends of mine...

284
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,320
1998 now. This is it, Dave.

285
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,020
30 years.

286
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,700
180 some days.

287
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,440
Friends of mine took LSD then.

288
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:33,960
Yeah.

289
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,060
And they told me that when they took LSD,

290
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,280
that a commandor rheumeroid or arthroid, whatever his name was,

291
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,620
arthritic rheumatoid arthritis,

292
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,380
was a guy named Neil...

293
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,220
No, Neil Heppey.

294
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,920
Neil Armstrong said that he was on LSD, too.

295
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,340
He said everybody in the world...

296
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,960
That's why he doesn't talk about it to anyone.

297
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,760
He can't because the back of his larynx was sold shut during that other experiment, too.

298
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,380
But we can't talk about that, either.

299
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,020
When he blew up the spider.

300
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,420
There's so much strange stuff going on that it's beyond strange.

301
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,340
There's an Indian in Charleston.

302
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:00,740
Yeah.

303
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,380
I mean, it's way the hell out there.

304
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,780
It's past the moon, buddy.

305
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,000
It's far and more away from one.

306
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,320
It's way past the moon.

307
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,500
It's beyond the solar system, ain't it?

308
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,140
But, uh...

309
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,700
So, anyway, this new...

310
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,480
So, a new church.

311
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,060
A new idea.

312
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,660
A new spirituality.

313
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,660
Should be arising based on the idea that we don't belong to the Earth.

314
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,160
The Earth belongs to us.

315
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,760
No, no.

316
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,320
The Earth is just a dust speck.

317
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,940
The dust speck belongs to it.

318
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,560
No, let's leave the dust speck behind.

319
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,780
Yeah, leave it behind.

320
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:35,160
I think what we should be doing is start a church and start getting people to join the church with a lot of money.

321
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,640
And start developing rocket ships.

322
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,760
Like, we don't want...

323
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,000
In this church, we don't want aliens to come pick us up.

324
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,220
We want a church based on action.

325
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,220


326
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,820
We want actual rocket ships.

327
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,840
I mean, they call the church the subgenius of...

328
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,240
We don't...

329
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,540
A UFO cargo cult.

330
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,760
This is not a UFO thing.

331
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,180
We don't care about aliens.

332
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,060
You took me by surprise tonight, bro.

333
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,400
We want to be the aliens.

334
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,080
Look, I urinated in my pants.

335
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,760
I was so excited and yet so confused.

336
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,060
Because this goes...

337
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,140
And the past dialectic...

338
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,480
We don't care about the aliens.

339
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,800
We want to be the aliens.

340
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,340
We want to build the ships.

341
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,160
Well, look at yourself.

342
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,440
You already are the aliens.

343
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,880
In more ways than they could even imagine.

344
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,260
Look.

345
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,980
Look at the...

346
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,820
Look at your shoes.

347
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,200
Commander.

348
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,460
Look at your shoes.

349
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,460


350
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,460


351
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:11,980
Look at your feet.

352
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,040
Look at your feet.

353
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,660
They look like them little pointy elf shoes.

354
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,060
And look at your hands.

355
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,720
They're too big for the rest of your body.

356
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,020
I mean, everybody knows you've got to be some kind of outer space mutant guy.

357
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,860
So let's get some rich people, Ted Turner and stuff, on board here.

358
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,340
Oh, yeah.

359
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,760
Maybe I can get them to get my own spaceship because I'm bald.

360
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,440
I don't know.

361
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,980
Hey, you know, opportunity to fly in space, you know.

362
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,600
Hey, you know, all the other people, you go, opportunity to fly...

363
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,340
All the other churches go, opportunity to fly in space on the aliens' ships.

364
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,660
I say, do it yourself.

365
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,920
Just like, you know, make...

366
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,840
What Bob and Ray did.

367
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,760
Just like bands.

368
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,660
What about when Bob and Ray was out there and he built a wooden spaceship...

369
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,980
Don't sign the corporate contract, boys and girls.

370
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,200
...and okay, it couldn't get off the ground, you know, and he went over and said,

371
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,120
hey, Mr. whatever-his-name-is-lucky-killer or whatever-his-name-is-Mr-forehead-paste,

372
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,600
this thing is clearly made of wood, or not clearly made of wood, but it is...

373
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,500
It's a wooden spaceship.

374
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,940
How do you expect to get it in the air?

375
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,680
And old Bob and Ray...

376
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,100
I think...

377
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,520
Who was Ray?

378
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,520
Bob said...

379
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,640
No, was Ray called...

380
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,480
No, Bob said...

381
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:06,960
No.

382
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,820
He said, of course, I don't expect it to fly.

383
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,920
And that's the whole thing we're talking.

384
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Everything is the same thing.

385
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,480
Of course, we don't expect it to really fly.

386
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,880
Start learning about solid rocket engines.

387
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,120
We just want you to start flapping your wings, you know?

388
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,220
Someday...

389
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,020
Well, how do they work?

390
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,120
You know, start finding out.

391
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:32,220
Learning how to build a solid rocket booster is going to be as basic as learning how to build a fire in the future.

392
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:39,020
You know, in the old days, you know, the thing was, you know, everyone knew how to build a fire in, you know, K-Man days and stuff like that, right?

393
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,460
Right.

394
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,580
In the future, that will be the equivalent.

395
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,820
Learning, you know, solid rocket boosters...

396
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,120
Right.

397
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,560
...liquid rocket propulsion, orbital, you know, mechanics and things like that.

398
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,320
Yeah, why can't we get some of them, you know, kids that can't get out of the third gate, some of them retarded kids start learning fluid mechanics and so forth.

399
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:54,640
That's right.

400
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,680
And celestial mechanics.

401
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,380
And if they can't, they should be beaten to a bloody...

402
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,640
Turn off that stupid television set and pick up a book and start learning this stuff.

403
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,800
Go back to school.

404
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,820
I don't care how old you are.

405
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,620
Get enrolled in physics courses and start learning about this stuff because we're going to need you.

406
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,640
We're going to need every one of you.

407
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,540
We're too lazy to do it ourselves.

408
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,320
If nothing else, we're going to line you all up and stand on your backs and jump.

409
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,220
But them funny Greek words with all the letters and numbers behind it, hey, man, we can't make a damn bit of sense out of that, you know what I mean?

410
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:22,560
Yeah.

411
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,780
So you learn all this crap and then you build us a really, really cool one in case, on next day, in case they don't come.

412
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,120
Please, we need some backup, some room...

413
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,500
You need some faith, man.

414
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,020
You better... you sound like you're backsliding a little bit.

415
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,760
What do you mean, in case they don't come?

416
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,920
Weasels ripped my flesh.

417
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Look, you said now you...

418
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,120
You know they're going to come.

419
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,460
Well, not at least in my orifices.

420
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,020
Look, you said weasels ripped my faith and it's gone.

421
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,580
Look, it's just hanging here.

422
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:50,980
Oh.

423
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,960
Now, can... look, you can see my jowls here and you can see my evil incisor teeth now.

424
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,680
You look just like Julius Caesar.

425
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,940
I thought you said I was going to look like Judas Priest.

426
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,980
Judas Priest.

427
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,260
Yeah, did you hear a guy from Akron joined Judas Priest?

428
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,120
Julius Priest.

429
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,460
Judas Caesar.

430
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,400
Yeah, whatever.

431
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,580
Judas Caesar salad.

432
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,500
Judas Caesar salad.

433
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,720
For the holidays.

434
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,640
You know, Caesar salad haircuts was what the real illusion...

435
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,480
People would say and call it the greasy Caesar haircut.

436
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,760
I think people actually put a Caesar salad on their head and let the croutons be a pair of earrings.

437
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,400
Better than at least bowling balls, you know what I mean?

438
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:23,820
Yeah.

439
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,820
I don't know.

440
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,100
But...

441
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,980
So you think we lost it back in the ancient days of Ur and Babylonia?

442
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,840
When we were actually a real star cult or something?

443
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,040
Well, I want to tell you something else, too.

444
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,700
One of the astronauts...

445
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,220
Pepe, I think it was, wasn't it?

446
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,080
I never told this story on the air here.

447
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,640
About Pepe?

448
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,100
No.

449
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,020
There was no astronaut in the air.

450
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,480
There was no astronaut named Pepe.

451
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,540
Come on, man.

452
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,960
Why, you pro-Anglo waxophone.

453
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,040
There had to have been some kind of...

454
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,400
At least somebody up there named Pepe or something.

455
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,220
Pepe.

456
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,220
Well, maybe they had a pet name named Pepe.

457
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,560
You know, those guys who spent two weeks alone, you know.

458
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,700
Yeah, but...

459
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,040
I find out a lady called one of them for a parrot.

460
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,120
I mean, it was a parakeet.

461
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,900
It had a...

462
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,580
Fluxus.

463
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,840
I have to find out exactly.

464
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,340
I think it was John Young.

465
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,540
I think it was Apollo 15 or 16.

466
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,500
That was the guy that was stumping Carl Young with the haircuts.

467
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,980
I remember that guy.

468
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,080
He played the gigaphone for Rupert Folley.

469
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,620
I think you're mistaken.

470
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,980
But anyway, he was...

471
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,680
He had a dream while he was on the moon.

472
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,740
Oh, you told me that.

473
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,160
Yeah.

474
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,280
Juiciest dream ever.

475
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,640
And he...

476
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,880
He dreamed he was dreaming.

477
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,200
They were in the moon rover.

478
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,720
And they're driving down the, you know, driving down the highway on the moon.

479
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,120
Rolling, rolling, rolling.

480
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,300
Keep the doggies rolling.

481
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,200
Yeah, scooping up little rocks as they go along.

482
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,060
Hey, check it out.

483
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,500
Look at me, Houston.

484
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,320
Hey, Houston.

485
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:40,800
Check it out.

486
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,940
Houston, can we go?

487
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,740
Over to that crater there?

488
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,240
Yeah, okay.

489
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,120
So they're driving around on the moon.

490
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,780
And they run across some car tracks.

491
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,840
It looks like human cheese.

492
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,540
Some other tracks.

493
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:49,960
Yes.

494
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,200
On the moon.

495
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,380
And so they radioed back at Houston, you know.

496
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,380
Houston, we've got a little thing happening here.

497
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,660
We've got some tracks here.

498
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,980
Can we follow them?

499
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,980
And Houston radioed back.

500
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,880
Yeah, go ahead.

501
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,180
Okay.

502
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,940
And so they start, you know, driving down and following the tracks.

503
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,880
And, you know, going over hills and stuff.

504
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,680
And you get about a quarter of the way around the moon almost.

505
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,140
And they came upon another car.

506
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah.

507
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,020
Just like theirs.

508
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,340
Right.

509
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,380
Another moon rover.

510
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,360
And it hopped?

511
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,340
And they drove up to it.

512
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,600
And they took samples of it and brought it back to their spaceship and everything.

513
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,740
And one of the guys shot a finger too.

514
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,580
It was a couple of guys.

515
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:29,880
Yeah.

516
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,440
One of them.

517
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,200
He's drinking a beer.

518
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,400
And they're in space suits.

519
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,520
Rednecks on the moon.

520
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,580
And one guy was giving a finger, flipping them off.

521
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,800
Another guy had a gun.

522
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
He was going hunting, I guess.

523
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,760
Yeah, the shotgun, I guess, had gone off.

524
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,500
And...

525
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:40,860
Yeah.

526
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:40,860


527
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,320
And blew out something in the car.

528
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,840
And they couldn't get back to their spaceship.

529
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,820
They were swearing nobody could understand what the hell they were saying.

530
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,180
But anyway, they loaded up the stuff with all the other rocks.

531
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,320
And they took it back to Earth.

532
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
And the scientists analyzed it.

533
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,280
And it turned out that those ancient hillbillies flipping off the Apollo astronauts on the moon

534
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,060
were a million and a half years old.

535
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,540
They had been there all that time, untouched.

536
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,900
I guess Pappy Zika himself had fathered more than eight zillion quadrillion illegitimate LARFs, Brodden,

537
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,800
which was the name given to those people.

538
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,160
In the moon.

539
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,780
By the other subconscious moon people.

540
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,140
Not moon people.

541
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,360
That's their own word for it.

542
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,340
I mean, the subconscious moon people, because so much of the moon's force,

543
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,180
at least on our sense, is in the dynamic of the psycho-spiritual, like when you're dreaming.

544
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,540
So they're kind of like dream shadow people.

545
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,480
But the moon hillbillies are real men.

546
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,980
And you don't want to get them pissed off on you.

547
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,360
There's a lot of hills on the moon, too.

548
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,880
I mean, sure.

549
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,700
It ain't like West Virginia, you know, a little tiny strip in the United States.

550
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,220
Plus, they got rivers down there, and you can go over the river and stuff like that.

551
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,780
Jerry Springer shows and stuff like that.

552
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,160
Yeah, right.

553
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,260
No, there's a lot of mountains on the moon.

554
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,860
So, you know, there's a lot of moonbillies.

555
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,440
We call them moonbillies.

556
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,900
Don't call them a moonbilly when you're in one of them bars, you know.

557
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,500
Unless you are a moonbilly yourself.

558
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Especially if you start hearing, like, you know, Patchy Clone.

559
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,580
Now, everybody likes Patchy Clone.

560
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,720
Patchy Clone is a...

561
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,980
And everybody likes to, you know, see some of the gyres.

562
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,580
Hazy, hazy, for being on the other side.

563
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,440
Of this planet.

564
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,380
I can't remember.

565
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,100
There's in their own dialect, too, which consists of these coarse grunts and snorting weasel sounds.

566
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:18,700
Right.

567
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,680
Yay, yay, yay, yay.

568
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,520
Like that.

569
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,180
Yeah, right.

570
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,040
But, you know, all rural people take a bad rap, especially when they, you know, ain't bathed for a long time.

571
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,480
And can't sleep at night.

572
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,100
Yeah.

573
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,980
Especially, you know, them weird moonbillies which are in your brain and your spiritual subconscious.

574
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,120
Oh, moonbillies in your subsensuousness.

575
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,520
Friends, I...

576
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,780
I sort of know how...

577
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,060
How Lonesome Cowboy Dave feels there.

578
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,920
I think those boys both have moonbillies on the mind.

579
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:48,440
I thought...

580
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,260
Chaz...

581
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,460
Have you gotten the impression over...

582
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,240
Over the last year or so that I've been playing a lot of VSO that...

583
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,420
That my cousin Chaz Smith is sort of interested in the space program?

584
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,560
I am, too, actually.

585
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,740
I'm with him.

586
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,560
I think that...

587
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,720
I think that...

588
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,120
That more money should be spent on...

589
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,780
On that...

590
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,920
Even though we're gonna be leaving the planet in the next 170 days or whatever it is.

591
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,840
I think the conspiracy should spend more money on the space program.

592
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,240
Because they discover cool stuff.

593
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,860
Here's some people who don't need science.

594
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,700
At a September meeting...

595
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,600
Oh, by the way, the music in the background is D.K. Jones.

596
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,640
At a...

597
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,760
At a...

598
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,200
September meeting...

599
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,840
Of Christian Coalition leaders...

600
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,760
Oh, this is the Onan News Service.

601
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,960
This one's titled,

602
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,840
So Who Has the Weird Religion?

603
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,820
At a September meeting of Christian Coalition leaders in Atlanta,

604
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,060
former founder Pat Robertson said the religious group should raise its political intensity

605
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:07,220
by looking to the notorious machine politics of Chicago and New York's Tammany Hall as models.

606
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,500
And also, Pat Robertson said that...

607
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:20,420
It would be God who would personally select the Republican best suited to advance the Coalition's agenda in the next presidential campaign.

608
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,700
I guess that implies that it would be Satan that picked the Democrat side.

609
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,500
Cool.

610
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,300
Let's see.

611
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,180
Robertson had begun his remarks by noting that he assumed he was talking only to the family.

612
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,220
And that if any members of the press were present, would you please shoot yourself?

613
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,660
Well, there were...

614
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:47,700
obviously members of the press present. A Catholic priest, Donald Kocher, testifying

615
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,800
at a deposition in August in a Chicago area lawsuit against him and his diocese for sexual

616
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:59,340
abuse of parishioners, admitted that he had had sex with as many as a dozen women over

617
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,020
a 20-year period. However, he added, I've always seen the affairs as morally wrong,

618
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,580
and I've always tried to bring them to a conclusion as quickly as I could. I am so

619
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,060
glad in this church we don't have to worry about stuff like that. In fact, I have bragging

620
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:20,440
rights. I should brag about what great stuff I'm getting, friends. You wouldn't even believe.

621
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:28,140
Put it this way, Bob's promise rings true, and thousandfold. In September, in New York

622
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,780
City, federal judge Louis A. Kaplan disregarded sentencing guidelines and sent Orthodox Jew

623
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:38,920
Solomon Spree to prison for only 18 months for insurance fraud, citing his three marriageable

624
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,400
daughters.

625
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:45,380
The two daughters, who by law of his babav, Hasidim, must rely on their father to find

626
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,040
husbands for them. The happiness of at least two of them would be crucially delayed if

627
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,080
Spree were imprisoned for the recommended time.

628
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,660
So, they can't put me in jail, man. I've got two daughters that I need to marry off.

629
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:03,520
What else have we got here? Oh, that one's too long. There's something in the onion that

630
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,480
I... Oh, here's some other news. That's right, I'm sorry, I got a little confused.

631
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,280
I got a bit Dave-headed.

632
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,140
A Spanish police foiled a mass suicide planned by a 30-member sect whose members believe

633
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:25,800
they would be carried away by a spaceship from the summit of Tenerife's Tiel de Volcano,

634
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,900
officials in Madrid said Thursday. The group, which may be linked to the infamous Solar

635
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,940
Temple suicide cult or Hindu apocalyptic sect, was convinced that the end of the world would

636
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,380
take place this evening, according to a Canaries government.

637
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,440
Officials, they were planning to end their lives on Earth and travel by spaceship to

638
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,660
a new world. You notice these people did not have their spaceship built. They, too, were

639
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,600
expecting aliens. People in the Canary Islands have been tracking the group's movement for

640
00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:00,580
some... This leader was arrested for inducement to suicide. That's scary to me. They can arrest

641
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,100
a cult leader for inducement to suicide? What if the cult leader's not planning... He's

642
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,400
not planning to commit suicide, but he's going to induce everybody else to do it? Would that

643
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:15,720
cult leader still get in trouble? It is not even clear which branch the sect is, whether

644
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,440
it is the so-called Solar Temple cult or whether it is a splinter of this group. Many types

645
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:27,180
are possible based on the personality of the leader. In 1994, 74 members of the Solar Temple

646
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,880
cult have committed... Since 1994, 74 Solar Temple nuts have committed suicide. The sect

647
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,380
believes that the death voyages by ritualized suicide lead to a place of real suicide. The

648
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:47,820
Cult Co-Owners Program Happy Sober

649
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,460
Coimbar

650
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:49,720
Healthcare

651
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:49,720


652
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,880
Then Tanic

653
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:02,520
You Are

654
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:06,360
Right

655
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:07,800
After

656
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,020
Sex

657
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,040
or yes, hmm, at dominating, searching, and controlling the average law-abiding, polite Christian citizen.

658
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,840
But when it comes to prosecuting the Oklahoma City bomber,

659
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,660
they have to call in a foreign police agency to wit Scotland Yard because the FBI has no credibility.

660
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,880
Only God knows what will happen when the Unabomber case comes to trial,

661
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,820
nor can they keep undocumented aliens, translation, trespassing invaders out of our country.

662
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:35,100
I said the federal government, but many state courts and legislatures are equally guilty.

663
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,200
Remember O.J. Simpson? Wake up, American governments!

664
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,760
On low levels, a cramming of police take down your throats!

665
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:45,360
What is next? What, do they have to break down your door and invade your domicile before you protest?

666
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,600
There comes...

667
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,680
But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop.

668
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,700
Not on mine.

669
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,580
He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.

670
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,580
And I've looked over, and I've seen...

671
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,440
I've seen the promise land.

672
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,300
All the promises we cannot stand.

673
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,080
The promise land.

674
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,260
To the promise, promise, promise land.

675
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,120
Somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly.

676
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,960
Somewhere I read of the freedom of speech.

677
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,940
Somewhere I read of the freedom of press.

678
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,980
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere.

679
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,080
Like anybody, I would like to...

680
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,220
I would like to live a long life.

681
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,860
Longevity has its place.

682
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,480
But I'm not concerned about that now.

683
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,880
I just want to do God's will.

684
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,220
He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.

685
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,160
And I've looked over, and I've seen...

686
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,040
The promise land.

687
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,280
The promise land.

688
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,380
The promise land.

689
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:03,840
Promise land.

690
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,740
Yummy!

691
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,380
Promise land.

692
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,600
Promise land.

693
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,640
Promise land.

694
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:19,840
Promise land.

695
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,580
Promise land.

696
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,040


697
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,100


698
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,100


699
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,720
Promise land.

700
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:23,800
Promise land.

701
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:23,800


702
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:23,800


703
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:23,800


704
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:23,800


705
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:23,800


706
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,060
Promise land.

707
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,060


708
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,160
Promise land.

709
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,340
Promise land.

710
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,240
Promise land.

711
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:25,720
Promise land.

712
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,040


713
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,480
Promise land.

714
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,520
Promise land.

715
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,880
Promise Land.

716
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,260
The promised land

717
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,740
Like anybody I would like to build

718
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,540
I mean, I guess I would

719
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,760
The promised land

720
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,620
Here we go

721
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,600
The promised land

722
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,340
Here we go

723
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,560
The promised land

724
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,760
Uh, yes, dear friends, well, I'm gonna get there with you, I promise.

725
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,600
I will get there with you.

726
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:14,820


727
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:24,500
Friend, all any subgenius has to do is stay alive for another 170 days, something like that.

728
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:34,940
Friends, that song, Promised Land, was by Martin Luther King and I think the guy's name is Bob Suber.

729
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,900
DK Jones and Huge Voodoo.

730
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:46,480
And this is from a tape that is a collection of DK Jones and Huge Voodoo subgenius tunes.

731
00:32:46,680 --> 00:33:02,060
It's got Jim Bob Joyce speaks on it, Hirosaki, Feel It In Your Gut, Let's Get It On, Pissacho, Hound Dog, You Ain't Know That Elvis song, Dobbs theme, Daydream and Dobbs Down, some stuff with Cleve, and of course that promised land here.

732
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,500
Here's a contact number.

733
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,280
Uh, D.B. Grant.

734
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:15,120
Phone number 201-593-8421.

735
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,700
That's, once again, that phone number for Huge Voodoo, 201.

736
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,340
It's in New Jersey, folks, you WFMU listeners, it's probably, I don't know.

737
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,420
Uh, 593-8421.

738
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,500
201-593-8421.

739
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:33,480


740
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:40,060
Friends, the promised land is right around the corner in human reckoning.

741
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,140
It's already happened in alien reckoning.

742
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:53,720
And, uh, this is a newly scored, uh, Hendrix, uh, jam bootleg thing in the background.

743
00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:02,160
Friends in the news, the Midwest was, uh, just recently discovered between the east and west coasts.

744
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,480
This is from the Uncensored.

745
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,760
I'm John Deacon.

746
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,200
Thanks for watching.

747
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,200


748
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:18,380
A U.S. Geological Survey expeditionary force announced Tuesday that it has discovered a previously unknown and unexplored land, uh, landmass between the New York and California coasts known as the Midwest.

749
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:32,940
The Geological Survey team discovered the vast region while searching for the fabled Midwest Passage, the mythical overland route passing through the uncharted area between Ithaca, New York and Bakersfield, California.

750
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:41,780
I had long suspected something was there, said Franklin Eldred, a Manhattan native and leader of the 200-man exploratory force.

751
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'd flown between New York and L.A. on business many times, and the unusually long duration of my flights seemed to indicate that some sort of large area was being traversed, an area of unknown composition.

752
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:03,180
The Geological Survey explorers left the East Coast three weeks ago, embarking on a perilous journey to the unknown.

753
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:12,740
Not long after crossing the Adirondack Mountains, Eldred and his team were blazing trails through the strange new regions, wild lands full of corn and wheat.

754
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:21,340
Oh, excuse me, folks, that Hendrick stuff in the background just isn't working. It's fighting. Where's page eight?

755
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,880
Hardly any room to move in this little space capsule.

756
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,880
We have to conserve oxygen.

757
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,460
Oh, yes, let's see, when Transluc...

758
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:44,920
Let's see, Eldred and the others were surprised to learn that the Midwest, whose inhospitable environment was long believed to be incapable of supporting human life, is indeed populated, albeit sparsely.

759
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:55,620
The Midwestern Aborigines are ruddy, generally heavyset folk, clad in plain non-designer costumery, Eldred said.

760
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:55,980
Eldred said,

761
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:06,320
They tend to live in simple one-story dwellings whose interiors are decorated with hummels and, bless this house, needlepoint wall hangings.

762
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:17,500
And though coarse and unattractive, these simple people were rather friendly, offering us quaint native fare such as hot dish and casserole.

763
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,280
Though the Midwest territory is still largely unexplored, early reports describe a region as backwards as it is vast.

764
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,860
Many of the basic...

765
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,920
The aspects of a civilized culture appear to be entirely absent, said Gina Strouch, a Los Angeles-based anthropologist.

766
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,900
There's no theater to speak of, and their knowledge of posh restaurants is sketchy at best.

767
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:54,240
Further, their agrocentric lives seem to prevent them from pursuing high fashion to any degree, and as a result, their mode of dress is largely restricted to sweatpants and sweatshirts, the women's being adorned with hearts and teddy bears, and the men's with college football insignias.

768
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,420
Believe it or not, this region may have things to offer us, said Jonathan Ogilby, a San Francisco-area marketing expert.

769
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,040
We could construct an airport there, a place where New Yorkers could switch planes on their way to California.

770
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,180
We could stage revivals of old Broadway musicals there.

771
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:20,900
Perhaps we could even one day conduct trade with the Midwesterners, offering them electronic devices in exchange for meats and agriculture.

772
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,860
Others, however, are not so optimistic about future relations.

773
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:33,900
We must remember that these people are not at all like us, Codd Nash, publisher and Manhattan socialite Lucille Randolph Snowden said.

774
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,500
Oh, that's a woman.

775
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:41,640
They are crude and provincial, bewildered by our tall buildings and our art galleries, our books and our coffee shops.

776
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:48,620
For an L.A. resident to attempt to interact with one of them, as he or she would with, say, a Bostonian, is ludicrous.

777
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:54,000
It appears unlikely that we will ever be able to conduct a genuine exchange of ideas with them about anything,

778
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,980
save perhaps television or...

779
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,560
a big game.

780
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,900
Well, friends, here's some subgenius news.

781
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:11,820
This is from a book called Art Postale by Vittore Baroni, a subgenius who lives in Italy.

782
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,820
I haven't looked at this before. Let's see what he says.

783
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,520
It's got pictures, clips from...

784
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:24,360
It seems to be a book about male art, which is one of the things that we used to say the church was in order to get it across international borders.

785
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,360
You know, where...

786
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,320
Countries that normally wouldn't allow religious or political materials would allow male art.

787
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,860
And so they say here...

788
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:45,120
Oh, I guess that's the word for slack.

789
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,140
Total indolence.

790
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,100
That's not actually an accurate translation, but, you know...

791
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,580
It's...

792
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,320
If it sells a few...

793
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,780
We'd have to call it something else in Germany, like total dedication, or, you know...

794
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,860
I guess in Italy, total indolence might work.

795
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,780
I'll have to ask Jesus, the Italian Jesus, about that.

796
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,320
And he saw...

797
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:21,360
He had to translate all these made-up words into Italian.

798
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,020
Schizophreniatria.

799
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,560
Morir.

800
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,100
Realismo.

801
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,960
Sarcastrofia.

802
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,780
Sarcastrofia.

803
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,360
Sine sacra legion.

804
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,020
Oh, now I'm turning French on it.

805
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,600
Apocalyptionomia.

806
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,740
E-espetorationalismo.

807
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,400
Expectorationalation.

808
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,980
Espetorationalismo.

809
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,060
Hypnopediatrica.

810
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,880
Subliminalismo.

811
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,980
Satyriologia.

812
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,540
Disto utopianesimo.

813
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,460
Sardonicologia.

814
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:02,960
Fascistfatuismo.

815
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,440
Ridiculofagia.

816
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,360
Maybe they don't pronounce the G.

817
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,520
Fagia, maybe?

818
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,600
Ridiculofagia.

819
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
E teologia mesolataiesta.

820
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,720
Man!

821
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,660
Well, I...

822
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,640
I tried.

823
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,680
I've...

824
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,280
I, um...

825
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,560
I know how to...

826
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:24,560


827
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,840
I know how to pronounce Spanish like a Texan,

828
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,760
but, uh...

829
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,820
But I never...

830
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,640
I never learned any Italian, friends,

831
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,180
and I...

832
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:32,600
I don't...

833
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,800
I don't know.

834
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,880
I just...

835
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,840
Okay, enough of that.

836
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,140
Enough, enough, enough.

837
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,440
Where was Janer in them at?

838
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,460
These are the strangest shows.

839
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,400
These Janer...

840
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,760
This is from the Janer tapes made in San Francisco

841
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,600
last year, I think.

842
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,160
Sent in by Phineas Narco,

843
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,480
who is the other voice...

844
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,000
the...

845
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,300
the...

846
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,520
that you hear on the show.

847
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,080
It's actually so far what we've heard

848
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,040
has been mostly Janer and Phineas on these tapes.

849
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,880
KPFA tapes from the long-living,

850
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,640
long, still undead,

851
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,240
not really a subgenius show

852
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,040
from KPFA and, uh...

853
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,720
Berkeley,

854
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,000
Puzzling Evidence,

855
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,620
and Dr. Howell.

856
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,220
Thank you all.

857
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,100
Whoopi Goldberg is the street-smart,

858
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,180
hip, yet socially conscious...

859
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,780
Oh.

860
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,820
Wait a minute.

861
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,180
Whoopi Goldberg always...

862
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,460
is a street-smart, sassy social worker.

863
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,760
Why don't we change it a little bit?

864
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,500
Whoopi Goldberg is a refined,

865
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,940
sheltered, Nobel laureate scientist.

866
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,220
Okay, that sounds...

867
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,220
Now, let's have it.

868
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,820
Who slowly mutates

869
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,260
into a street-smart, sassy social worker.

870
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,220
You're beautiful, baby.

871
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:41,800
Come to Papa.

872
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,900
And she's dyslexic.

873
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,980
Talk to me, baby.

874
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,940
She's anorexic,

875
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,180
and she's got, uh,

876
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,180
multiple personalities.

877
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,880
You're beautiful, baby,

878
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,660
but she's sassy.

879
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,060
Street-smart, sassy.

880
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,300
All her personalities

881
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,660
are street-smart and sassy.

882
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,280
That's what's next.

883
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,500
Hey.

884
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:55,960
Hey.

885
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,240
Whoopi Goldberg with a twist.

886
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,380
She plays a white man.

887
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,400
I think it'll...

888
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,160
I think it'll fly.

889
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,100
It's hot.

890
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,600
It's hot.

891
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,060
It's happening.

892
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,700
It's burning.

893
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,980
It's on fire, baby.

894
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,000
It's white hot.

895
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,220
We'll get Ron Howard to direct.

896
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,620
Are you guys from L.A.?

897
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,880
He's unavailable.

898
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,240
It's dead.

899
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,380
It's dead, baby.

900
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:14,960
Forget it.

901
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,740
We'll get Cindy Williams instead.

902
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,340
Who loves you, baby?

903
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,220
Come to Papa.

904
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,680
I know who...

905
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,140
Okay, we'll...

906
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,300
I know who we can get to direct.

907
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:22,960
Fonzie.

908
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,260
All the bad stuff.

909
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:24,260


910
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,640
70s sitcom big characters

911
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,940
make great directors.

912
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,800
And now do we have a relationship?

913
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,780
Supposedly, guest stars

914
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,800
are reaching deeply

915
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,000
into their psyches

916
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,580
for things that happened

917
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,580
in the past show.

918
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,120
We have a relationship.

919
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:39,700
Beautiful, yeah.

920
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,820
With, uh...

921
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,040
Can I get some more lattes

922
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,620
over here?

923
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,220
Okay, I've got this idea

924
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:46,920
for a horror film.

925
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,680
I just pitched to you

926
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,220
for just a thing that had a...

927
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,440
The thing that had a thing

928
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,020
with no face

929
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,840
for a left leg.

930
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,780
Oh, Frank!

931
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,500
We're being...

932
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,260
We're being...

933
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:56,640
We're being...

934
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:56,640


935
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:56,640


936
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:56,640


937
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:56,640


938
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:56,640


939
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:56,680
We're being pursued

940
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,700
by some kind of monstrosity.

941
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,740
It's like some kind of thing.

942
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,420
It's a thing that has a thing

943
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,120
with no face

944
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,080
for a left leg.

945
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,240
We're being pursued

946
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,460
by some kind of monstrosity

947
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,520
that's poorly written

948
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,480
and hard to pronounce.

949
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,060
Ah!

950
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,600
No, no.

951
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,200
The thing with, uh,

952
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,440
nine heads

953
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,360
and the right ear

954
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,480
of the third head

955
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,200
from the left

956
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,720
has an eye

957
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,560
that's like a 7-Eleven.

958
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,840
And you go out...

959
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,180
Okay, like you go out the door...

960
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,760
The other head's like...

961
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,420
It's a donut shop.

962
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:24,840
Right.

963
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:25,800
And then you've got

964
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,120
the big eyeball going out

965
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,880
with a belly button

966
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,140
But the knee of the third thing

967
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,540
is like...

968
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,380
The knee of a convenience store.

969
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,420
It's a convenience store.

970
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,020
You go out,

971
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,900
hit the front door

972
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,720
of the convenience store.

973
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,360
And you, like,

974
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,380
there's that little outboard

975
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,180
and you jog to the right

976
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,680
and you pick up the truck

977
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,800
and you're in the back seat

978
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,120
on the passenger side.

979
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,180
There's this other thing

980
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,820
that has eight heads.

981
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:45,940
And that's, like,

982
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,780
the left third,

983
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,100
the big toe.

984
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:48,740
Right.

985
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,220
And then you go into, like,

986
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,660
I think the tile's a little long,

987
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,000
but...

988
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,680
You sort of go through

989
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,620
this long tunnel

990
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,200
and then you come into, like,

991
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,640
a theater

992
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,540
and there's a screen

993
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,740
and you watch a whole movie

994
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,360
and that's a mill tone.

995
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,100
Right.

996
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,020
And it's a horror movie

997
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,740
in itself.

998
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,600
That's a different movie.

999
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,280
We'll pitch you that one tomorrow.

1000
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,320
Right, but with funny.

1001
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,000
With funny.

1002
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:06,900
Whoopi Goldberg

1003
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,960
is the socially conscious

1004
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,320
sassy...

1005
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,200
Third head.

1006
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,460
The street smart sassy

1007
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,160
third head.

1008
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:13,520
Right.

1009
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,660
Dang, good job.

1010
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:35,660


1011
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,340
No, you think I'm 그러 aquele

1012
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,240
itätLee

1013
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,480
They look smug those two guy

1014
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,020
Anyway, there's two forms of

1015
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,320
that they, it's...

1016
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,020
First of all,

1017
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,020


1018
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,340
the big toe,

1019
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:47,480
you see the rider

1020
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,700
and now I'll show you

1021
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:48,700


1022
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:48,700


1023
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,100
What should I wear?

1024
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,440
Now, just igualy.

1025
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,380
What I see is,

1026
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,020
trodden under cloven hooves.

1027
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,340
Blessed are the victorious, for victory is the basis of right.

1028
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,000
Cursed are the vanquished, for they shall be vassals forever.

1029
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,560
Blessed are the iron-handed, the unfit shall flee before them.

1030
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,840
Cursed are the poor in spirit, for they shall be spat upon.

1031
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:25,320
Blessed are the death-defiant, their days shall be long in the land.

1032
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,580
Cursed are the God-adorers, they shall be shorn sheep.

1033
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:36,420
Blessed are the valiant, for they shall obtain great treasure.

1034
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,800
Cursed are the believers in good and evil, for they are frightened by shadows.

1035
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,160
Blessed are those that believe in what is best for them,

1036
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:48,820
never to be afraid.

1037
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,680
Never shall their minds be terrorized.

1038
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:57,220
Cursed are the lambs of God, they shall be bled whiter than snow.

1039
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,820
Blessed is the man who has a sprinkling of enemies, they shall make him a hero.

1040
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:12,300
Cursed is he who doeth good unto others who sneer upon him in return, he shall be despised.

1041
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,800
Blessed are the mighty-minded, for they shall ride the whirlwinds.

1042
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:18,800


1043
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:18,800


1044
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:26,420
Cursed are they who teach lies for truth, and truth for lies, for they are kitcheniers.

1045
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:35,100
Cursed are the weak, who womanhood makes them vile, for women shall serve and suffer.

1046
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,180
The hand of utter deceit shall dwell in the

1047
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,580
souls of the righteous.

1048
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,380
Cursed are theutationists, for their teams shall be çıktı when they hear the 실�teric

1049
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,800
fire appel, who write talk of merchandise.

1050
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,760
of the Satanists.

1065
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,180
who don't fully accept the rationalist doctrine as inferior to those who have seen the light

1066
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:59,720
and realize that humans are meant to be limited to the boundaries of the material world.

1067
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,500
Does that sound like a quote from a subduer?

1068
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,500
It is often implied in subgenius literature that people seek to explore transpersonal awareness

1069
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,900
because of a need to escape from reality.

1070
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:13,940
No, duh.

1071
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,920
This idea is obviously true in some people's cases,

1072
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,840
but that's not grounds for such a gross generalization of non-rationalists.

1073
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,880
And then he tries to say that we're not that bad, but we really are.

1074
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,800
We have some on-the-mark commentary about the ridiculous nature of many cultish belief systems.

1075
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,940
Unfortunately, his happens to fall under our, you know, our silly hate.

1076
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,760
In fact, the...

1077
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:42,980
Uh...

1078
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,080
Uh...

1079
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:44,260
Uh...

1080
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,500
Most...

1081
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:53,340
Most non-materialistic worldviews emphasize an awareness of the sacred in life.

1082
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,660
But this does not automatically imply God-worship.

1083
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,520
Sacredness can be thought of as an intensity of experience, underlying truths in human existence.

1084
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,860
Ah, he found some of those.

1085
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:10,540
Or a non-destructive, benevolent way of acting towards others, where you can leave us out of that.

1086
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,600
Then he says, but the subgeniuses are funny, so it's okay.

1087
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,780
And he thinks that we're brilliant and witty and everything, and...

1088
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:16,900
...and...

1089
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:25,480
A lot of creative power has been wasted on ideas which are so subversive and an approach which is so manipulative.

1090
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,660
And here he presents the real beliefs of the church.

1091
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:38,960
The propaganda of the church beneath the cult spoof element promotes the belief that people who pursue non-material or transpersonal forms of understanding,

1092
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,940
which he never really explains, are connected with sinister aliens.

1093
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,460
That's what we really believe.

1094
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,900
Like all other subgenius assertions, the idealists...

1095
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:53,120
is expressed in convoluted form through dogmatic preachings that supposedly exemplify the attitudes

1096
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,520
of flaky new agers.

1097
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:00,720
Since this is hidden by a sea of clever catchphrases, people who don't know what to look for probably

1098
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,740
won't catch the message that non-materialists are alien contactees.

1099
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,560
A new message of the Church of the Subgenius.

1100
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:14,260
And you can learn more about our new message by writing for free information from Bob at

1102
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,440
That's right, Texas.

1103
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,220
We're Westerners.

The muam unit at slack at metronet.com.

1109
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:54,080
Because the Church of the Subgenius preaches that aliens are responsible for the growing

1110
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,940
acclaim of transpersonalist paradigms in the West, and have also seeded many unorthodox

1111
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:02,260
or subversive notions that have recently become popular in the fields of politics, psychology,

1112
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,000
and science.

1113
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:07,160
The reason for all this, according to the Church, is that aliens seek to subvert social

1114
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,580
unity and promote chaos among humans.

1115
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,680
All of this is accomplished by introducing seemingly revolutionary,

1116
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:17,940
revolutionary ideas into the social fabric through their mind-control pawns.

1117
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:23,600
If scientific rationalism were said to be a religion, the Church of the Subgenius would

1118
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,680
be a cult.

1119
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:31,880
We deviate from the standard rationalist paradigm by acknowledging the existence of extraterrestrials

1120
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,480
and paranormal phenomena.

1121
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,780
Okay, and uh, well sure, axis.

1122
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,460
Axis, yeah, sure.

1123
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,540
Anyway, he goes on and on.

1124
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:51,760
And um, he has some great references on the Church that I've never heard of.

1125
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,780
I'll have to check them out.

1126
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:53,440
It's something I...

1127
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,060
He also doesn't like schwa.

1128
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:03,520
And his main beef with us is that it condones a belief that transpersonal awareness is alien

1129
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,840
to human experience.

1130
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,760
Well, you know, this guy certainly was able to pick...

1131
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,520
You know, it proves!

1132
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,920
The Book of the Subgenius is just like the Bible.

1133
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,520
You can pick anything you want to prove.

1134
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,200
Out of it.

1135
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,700
If you want to prove that we're Satanists, it's written there in black and white.

1136
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,880
If you want to prove we're having a war against the transpersonalists more than the Christians

1137
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,860
or the Mohammedans, it's there too.

1138
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:30,900
The fact is, we hate everyone who's not a $30 dues-paying subgenius member.

1139
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,340
I'm sorry if that alienates some of my audience.

1140
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:38,100
We don't hate you subgeniuses that didn't send in the membership fee.

1141
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,400
It's that we pity you.

1142
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:43,520
We hate the idea of you proving yourself so dumb in the face of Satan.

1143
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:43,520


1144
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:43,520


1145
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:48,540
This is such obvious fact as the aliens come in July 5th, 1998 at 7 o'clock in the morning,

1146
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,960
despite what some of these silly, big...

1147
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,480
You know, for somebody who's not a rationalist, this person certainly uses an awful lot of

1148
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:01,180
big, big, high-tidy-tidy, hoity-floity, college-educated words like that one person...

1149
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,860
That one company that said, oh, you can't do this, Reverend Stein.

1150
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,120
That can't be done.

1151
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,580
I said, I'm sorry, but everybody's been doing it.

1152
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,660
They just didn't tell you.

1153
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,160
It turned out I was right and they was wrong.

1154
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,500
And I guess when the aliens destroy this planet, that's the end of it.

1155
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:13,500


1156
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,900
or whatever they're planning to do on July 5th, 1998,

1157
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,220
then I suppose we'll see who has the last little laugh.

1158
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:19,860
Now, won't we?

1159
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:20,680
Praise Bob.

1160
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,740
Help me, somebody.

1161
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,920
She ain't got no...

1162
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,020
Oh, I'm not Jane.

1163
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:24,280
Wait a minute.

1164
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,420
I was about to turn into Jane-er.

1165
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,420
Well, praise Jane-er.

1166
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,160
It's a beautiful thing, friends.

1167
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,000
This is Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the background.

1168
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,140
Praise Bob.

1169
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:41,220
We'll get them deviled cussing tapes done next week.

1170
00:59:51,480 --> 01:00:12,860
We'll get them deviled cussing tapes done next week.
