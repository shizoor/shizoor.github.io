1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,020
The All-American

2
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,860
All-American

3
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,580
All-American

4
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,760
All-American

5
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,700
All-American

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:59,760
All-American

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:29,980
All-American

8
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,980
All-American

9
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:29,980
All-American

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:59,860
All-American

11
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:29,980
All-American

12
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:59,980
All-American

13
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:29,060
All-American

14
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,140
All-American

15
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,200
All-American

16
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
All-American

17
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:42,320
All-American

18
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,980
All-American

19
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


20
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


21
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


22
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


23
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


24
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


25
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


26
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


27
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


28
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


29
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


30
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


31
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


32
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


33
00:06:59,980 --> 00:06:59,980


34
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,020
that risk.

35
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,100
On Wall Street 33, 4, 7, 5, 7, and 1,

36
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,700
Chinese authorities say they will not permit PR's PR.

37
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,440
Beijing Olympic organizers issued statements critical of PR.

38
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,680
Analyst Hugh Johnson says you're listening to PR News.

39
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,260
Takes all kinds.

40
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,300
Let me introduce you to some authentic Cleveland radio callers.

41
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,420
Hello, you're on the air.

42
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,580
Praise Bob.

43
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,780
Praise Bob.

44
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,860
Is that all you had to say?

45
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,640
Nappy!

46
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,820
Yeah, that's what I thought.

47
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,800
Praise Bob.

48
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,240
It's amazing that he said praise Bob before he said nappy.

49
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,100
He was waiting for three hours with his legs crossed and he had to urinate.

50
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,160
He was near one of those bus stops that had been contaminated and re-abducedified.

51
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,280
Maybe he should have stood on his head.

52
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,580
Maybe he should have stood in bed for all we care.

53
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,480
If that's all he's got to say, praise Bob, he could...

54
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,600
Never mind.

55
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,660
Well, now you're looking once again.

56
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,660
But, you know,

57
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:58,840
you know,

58
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,760
we have to be thankful for those acolytes and followers who are willing to get right up on their hind legs,

59
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,640
bay at the moon,

60
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,340
and praise Bob on the radio.

61
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,860
We prefer the four of us, anyway,

62
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,220
prefer the female quarters, the hind quarters.

63
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,380
Well, where are they?

64
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,240
Bring them on.

65
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,420
Well, yeah, I suppose we even would take...

66
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,500
This is a sausage fest.

67
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,520
I don't hear any chicks calling in.

68
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,700
Yeah, where's Pisces?

69
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,340
I don't know.

70
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,660
She's probably busy preparing for her saucer adventure.

71
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,500
On X Day.

72
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah.

73
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,960
Where's the owl woman?

74
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,820
She's actually...

75
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,720
Pisces is the new Stang.

76
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,540
She is?

77
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:34,980
Yes.

78
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,780
Pisces is the new Stang.

79
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,500
She's the one calling the shots at X Day this year,

80
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,920
and I presume that soon she'll be embittered and put upon and...

81
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,820
Well, we got a shot caller now.

82
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,000
I guess Stang is...

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,900
All the Stang is there.

84
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,720
Stang is to the Cuban government as Raul Castro is to Fidel Castro now,

85
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,880
and the new Castro is Pisces.

86
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,720
Pisces.

87
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,240
Pisces.

88
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,180
And any other astrological sign that comes along...

89
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,960
Pisces give a five and a half hour speech, a fiery five and a half hour speech on Caribbean

90
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,860
independence while she exposes her enormous, enormous dogma.

91
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,800
Boy, I just can't wait.

92
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,080
Well, you just can't wait?

93
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,280
Well, then don't wait, because she's going to call any second, and you're going to see

94
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,260
him in your running eye.

95
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,620
Well, that's the way radio works, Doctor.

96
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,940
You mention something, and it occurs.

97
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,900
It is there.

98
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,520
It's visible.

99
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:27,720
It's visible.

100
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,000
That's what we do.

101
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,160
Miss Houston?

102
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,260
I think we've got a problem.

103
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,500
I'm sucking up slack like a Tampax.

104
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,600
My words are like races.

105
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,520
Leave you bleeding like a hemophiliac.

106
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,420
My inspiration comes from a man with a pipe.

107
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,500
When he messed me up, my body was spinning.

108
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:57,500


109
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:57,500


110
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,040
God, don't you doubt for a second

111
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,500
I'm still a Kanye

112
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,000
The beats are polyphonic

113
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,240
My rhymes are hydroponic

114
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,360
Hey, I'm Pisces, so give me some water

115
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,960
The stars say Neptune

116
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
The books will tell you Venus

117
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,740
But in the end

118
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,120
I'm Eris' daughter

119
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,720
Cause we got a problem

120
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,360
I tell you, Houston

121
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,860
I think we got a problem

122
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,780
Houston

123
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,400
I think we got a problem

124
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,520
7am is coming

125
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,500
And the Peaks, they back

126
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,660
Better start running

127
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,980
Cause we're just plain plum

128
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,540
Tired of their shit

129
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,840
This man behind me

130
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,080
With a smile on the pipe

131
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,500
He's got a ticket for each one of us

132
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,080
And it's a one-way flight

133
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,380
Houston!

134
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000


135
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000


136
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,240
Houston!

137
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,240


138
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,240


139
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,240


140
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,960
Houston!

141
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,260
Houston!

142
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,740
Houston!

143
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,460
Houston!

144
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:34,760
Houston!

145
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,740
Houston!

146
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:36,580


147
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,160
Houston!

148
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,560
Houston!

149
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,140
Houston!

150
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,540
Houston!

151
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:44,880
Houston!

152
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,140
Houston!

153
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,200
Houston!

154
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,560
Houston!

155
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,200
Houston!

156
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,840
When I say slut, you say or kill me.

157
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,220
Slut.

158
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,160
Slut.

159
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,900
Slut.

160
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,480
Slut.

161
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,340
Priestess Pisces there, friends, with the X-Day Jam Band.

162
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,100
I forgot its name, but it's mostly the amino acids and fat-free.

163
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,340
Before that, Leemers PR News and our titles.

164
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,440
And more to come, which could be good.

165
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,780
But that's if we had a producer.

166
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,860
Well, I...

167
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,880
We just have...

168
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
There's Rob, who's...

169
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,620
Do five things with 12 fingers.

170
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,280
He's all over the board like an octopus with amphetamines.

171
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,360
Like a fish on jello.

172
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,180
Yeah, well, I'm glad somebody's doing it.

173
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,600
That's what we call the safety net.

174
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,560
It keeps us from falling when we stumble, as we do so often.

175
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,800
Well, that's what anarcho-syndicalist socialists like me think, is we need a social net.

176
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,220
But it needs tungsten steel and lamb's bread.

177
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,360
Now you're talking.

178
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,360
Retiarius versus Secutor.

179
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,580
The guy with the net and the trident.

180
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,060
He's good, because he'll throw that net, and then he'll get you with his trident.

181
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,660
That's Neptune, right?

182
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:15,040
Well, I'm not into the latest net terminology, but that's actually of some venerable antiquity.

183
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,200
But didn't we...

184
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,980
That means if you're on the internet, you're like a fish or something?

185
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,520
Like a gladiator contending in the arena of public view.

186
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,720
A million electronic eyes watch as you...

187
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
You fall blood-stained in the sand.

188
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,100
Warrior fish biting at your entrance.

189
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,720
A hundred million thumbs down.

190
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,920
Unfortunately, that's the way they are.

191
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,900
Yes, they'll all turn their thumbs down.

192
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,720
Bless them.

193
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,240
Especially if they've been beaten with hammers and nails.

194
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,660
Big, bloody red thumbs all turned up and down simultaneously to confuse the issue.

195
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys.

196
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,140
We have to mention these things.

197
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,840
It is what it is, you know.

198
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,720
Let's be brutally realistic here.

199
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,660
The time for Namby Pamby.

200
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,000
Fairy Tales is over and done with.

201
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,300
Yeah, let's forget the realism part.

202
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,180
Now it's a survivor's game.

203
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,280
Yeah, let's forget even surrealism and just be brutal.

204
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,360
That's right.

205
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,420
No, never mind.

206
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,040
We learned brutality when we watched our subgenius brethren and sister enthroned to the lions.

207
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,720
Yeah, unfortunately, it was even more brutal on the lions.

208
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,760
If your child is falling behind in school, take Dr. Scholl's.

209
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,780
Film glues acid to your teeth.

210
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,960
So brush your teeth twice a day with film.

211
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,080
No toothpaste can duplicate filmed stains that make teeth look dull.

212
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,260
And remember, film never stops tooth decay.

213
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,360
No, never.

214
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,300
So get filmed today.

215
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,040
Lee Murr.

216
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,780
Now, no money mark.

217
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,640
I have a question for you guys.

218
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,960
How are you positioning the subgenius brand in the current marketplace?

219
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,580
You've got lots of competition from Jehovah's Witnesses and Scientology.

220
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, yes.

221
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,760
Not to mention Jehovah Watch.

222
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,400
One's Witnesses.

223
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,020
This brand really has legs.

224
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,460
It's like the centipede of religions crawling and scuttling all over the noosphere.

225
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,900
And many people often say, you mean subgenius still exists?

226
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,840
I didn't know you were doing that.

227
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:17,460
And then their eyes certainly glaze as you rattle off the long list of recent subgenius publications, events, and phenomena.

228
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
I would say that this religion certainly has climbed.

229
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,960
It's got a lot of market potential.

230
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,520
It reaches a lot of markets.

231
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,700
And it has an industry.

232
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:25,740


233
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:25,740


234
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,780
Imputed bouquet and sort of a nutty, grainy flavor.

235
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:37,560
A sort of a scent of oaken casks and aged septic tanks.

236
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,440
Yeah, I thought you were going to mention the casket smell.

237
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,620
But, yeah, there are.

238
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,160
The gasket?

239
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,060
Oh, the casket.

240
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,740
The casket.

241
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,120
The actual casket smell, not the casket covering.

242
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,640
The gaskets have needed to be replaced for years.

243
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,660
That's not my department, but I just thought I'd say it here.

244
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,320
Well, it needs a knee replacement, too.

245
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,560
It has legs, but.

246
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,500
Oh, yeah, right, right.

247
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,240
And the feet itself, by which it stands on the ground to bestride the earth like a colossus,

248
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,080
have fallen arches and other circulatory problems.

249
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,160
It's soulless.

250
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,300
That is soulless.

251
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,500
Or not so much soulless, but the soul is worn very, very thin.

252
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,780
You know, I just flew here.

253
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,660
And, boy, are my arms tired, Yak.

254
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,280
No, really.

255
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,240
I just flew here.

256
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,640
And in the SkyMall, you're surely familiar with that publication,

257
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,500
they have the damnedest things that you never knew existed and that you wanted.

258
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,480
And some of them are so strange.

259
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,700
One of them is a thing that squeezes your legs while you're sitting down automatically.

260
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,920
So you don't have those annoying circulation problems.

261
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:43,300
This device is tweaking and fondling your legs while you're sitting there watching TV or whatever you're doing.

262
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,200
Couldn't you just hire someone to do that?

263
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Last time I got something like that in the airplane.

264
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,280
They used to call that the mile-high club when you...

265
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,100
But there are these...

266
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,500
This contraptoid that you have to send in.

267
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:04,840
You're hard-earned simoleons for that is obscenely squeezing your calves and your legs to simulate a walking workout.

268
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,460
Right.

269
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,920
It's easier than taking a walk.

270
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,700
And you can keep watching television.

271
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,720
That's the important thing.

272
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,160
Yes.

273
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,140
Well, it's hard to walk on the plane anyway.

274
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,400
And television is...

275
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,940
You can further think of when the X's come.

276
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,260
Are we going to have a need for a cubicle that will exercise our legs and fondle us while we're driving?

277
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm afraid we'll be lucky if we have legs at all.

278
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,420
No.

279
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,100
Or a body.

280
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,780
You know, the X's are quite pragmatic.

281
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,680
They'll only take the part which is useful to them.

282
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,700
And, you know, it's...

283
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,620
Yeah, don't get your hopes up, copper top.

284
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:43,520
Remember, everything that you feel is actually not felt by legs or anything like that, but by the brain.

285
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,240
The central ganglion.

286
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,240
And that's all that will be preserved.

287
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,680
Fixed up, you've heard of phantom limbs.

288
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,380
An entire phantom body and phantom experiences will happen unto you.

289
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,080
Ever after.

290
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,680
Until, at least, you reach the Port Authority building.

291
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,700
Well, there are rumors rampant that your brain is kept in one of those little diaphanous little tubes

292
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,240
like in the brain that wouldn't die filled with a light liquid.

293
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,900
Or it could be, yeah, in a big beaker with Nancy Reagan looking at it.

294
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,040
Or Nancy Davis, as she then was.

295
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,400
Yeah, but the projections that come out of those brains are no more than a crude hologram.

296
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
But once inside those heads...

297
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,660
And we assume that they're reality.

298
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,480
And we're not in a different world.

299
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,480
That's just a rumor.

300
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:33,240
Yeah, well, you know, once you're on that plane, not the one I just got off, but that other plane,

301
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,660
one has to re-conceptualize the entire concept of so-called reality.

302
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,360
Were you frisked by airport security, by Stang and his minions?

303
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,700
Not at all, which is fortunate, since I always carry a lot of contraband.

304
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,320
Well, I've heard that some of them are very rigorous examinations.

305
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,220
They do, but that's only if you act like a smartass and mouth off.

306
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,500
And then they say, oh, we're going to teach this punk a thing or two.

307
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,740
Well, if you're a harmless-looking old lady, you get the cavity search.

308
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,400
That's me.

309
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,960
Pardon me, officer.

310
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,640
I was just rummaging through my reticule.

311
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,700
I was hoping you might check something for me.

312
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,500
Oh, that's all right, ma'am.

313
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,720
Now, the high-tech airports have x-ray devices that see just through your clothing

314
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,180
and show a naked zombie.

315
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,060
Yes, I know.

316
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:34,880
And not only that, there's a puff of air that goes into the automatic sequential analyzer

317
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,640
and knows about every particle of frop, which you've got in the lining.

318
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,320
Oh, they have a sniffer now?

319
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,300
In some airports, you suddenly find that you're being funneled down a corridor

320
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,080
through this huge plastic thing where there's a plastic sheet hanging,

321
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,240
and then a puff of air comes and some busy little electrode,

322
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:01,500
and your brain is analyzing the constituent elements of your package, as it were.

323
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,260
That's the Become the Bong unit, isn't it?

324
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,980
It's all for your security.

325
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,100
Call in the Bong squad.

326
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,640
Do you have to pay the $10 security fee?

327
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,940
They hate our freedom, you know.

328
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:20,240
You might have to pay more than that, but I paid a few extra fees this voyage,

329
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,680
but it's worth it.

330
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,820
It's worth it.

331
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,480
It's especially worth it if you...

332
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,780
If you tip them, because then it turns out that your luggage doesn't end up on the tarmac

333
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,200
under a leaking barrel of toxic sludge.

334
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:42,520
Well, then we might be led to believe that the kayakers of 911 actually tipped.

335
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,140
No, that would be different.

336
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,700
You mean they're going to hit us with kayaks next time?

337
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,120
Those fiends.

338
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,080
Stop it, nothing.

339
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,740
Forget Al-Khaida, it's Al-Kayak.

340
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,400
I'd love to see such a day.

341
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,280
I'd love to see the Eskimos get angry.

342
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,540
Fish cutters.

343
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,320
Seal smackers.

344
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,000
Fish cutters.

345
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,580
Yep.

346
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,680
And they have a right to...

347
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,280
Maybe they'll be able to hire the actual Eskimos,

348
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,060
who are going to be out of a job and out of a place to live.

349
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:25,180
Well, what if the Inuit people do become disenfranchised enough to want to go after the powers that be?

350
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:25,480
What would that be?

351
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,480


352
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,100
What will we do then?

353
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,360
Well, the polar bears are melting.

354
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,000
They are.

355
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,420
They don't have much of a choice.

356
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
They're swimming for hundreds of miles,

357
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,080
and then when they drag themselves up on the shore,

358
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,180
they're shot by meddling nosy parkers.

359
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,560
Don't forget the Hawaiians.

360
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,480
We depose their queen.

361
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,340
You know, Eskimos are showing up more and more.

362
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:51,880
I guess they are being forcibly integrated into the society of the lower earth.

363
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,220
They're even Eskimo porn stars now.

364
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:54,700
What?

365
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,320
Sure, I don't know.

366
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Oh, thank God for that.

367
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,460
I've been waiting for that.

368
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,160
Quite fetching.

369
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,580
What's the URL on that?

370
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,940
I don't know, but just type in those words in that search engine,

371
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,040
and don't forget to type the no filtering button.

372
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,360
Save search keys.

373
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,180
Slash Mighty Quinn slash Mighty Mighty Mighty.

374
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,140
That's almost as good as Aborigine porn, which I'm waiting for.

375
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,700
Wow, I hadn't heard about that.

376
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,440
I haven't either.

377
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,480
But once you've checked out Nanooka, you'll never go back.

378
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,740
How about like Papua New Guinea cannibal porn?

379
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,060
That would appeal to me, especially like the chicks that, you know,

380
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,000
like when the guys go flinging from the trees and get hung from the legs.

381
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,040
The chicks would do that, too.

382
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,240
Yeah, you don't need a sharper image leg squeezer when you've got that action going on.

383
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,040
Now, listen to this.

384
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,540
You can strike against the enemy with tanks, planes, ships, and guns.

385
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:53,120
So with every cent and dollar you can spare, buy guns and planes and ships and tanks and staffs.

386
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,920
Wow.

387
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,760
Now, listen to this.

388
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,520
Praise Lemur, and now Ragnar.

389
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,740
Well, you see, when X-Day comes, everything that's in that SkyMall catalog

390
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,300
is going to be instantly aboard your pleasure saucer.

391
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:18,900
Or available.

392
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,220
You're just going to have like a SkyMall room that's just going to be filled

393
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:23,900
with...

394
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,300
Well, that's everything in that catalog.

395
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,500
But it might not be so pleasant to be SkyMalled on those saucers.

396
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,520
Malled.

397
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,260
Yeah.

398
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,380
By the saucers.

399
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,560
Malled in the sky!

400
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,780
So, so much for transcending material possessions.

401
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,840
Oh, no.

402
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,780
No, it's like...

403
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,000
Far from it.

404
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,600
We actually...

405
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,140
Some of us actually need our material possessions.

406
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,900
When your aberrant poodle makes an error, you rub his nose in it, don't you?

407
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,340
Well, this is what the X-ists are going to do with us and our lust for things.

408
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,900
Gee, that's the X-est.

409
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,200
Well, that's the esoteric truth of this.

410
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:55,760
That's sad news to you.

411
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,440
It's what Dr. Howell is speaking right now.

412
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,640
Stang, he says the overt pervert truth.

413
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,040
I have dibs on all sorts of earthly treasures.

414
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,480
The entire Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Grand Canyon.

415
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,120
Yes, I saw you claiming that.

416
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,380
The Smithsonian.

417
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,440
I've got to...

418
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,020
Well, because nobody else seems to be thinking about that.

419
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,580
All they can think, I'm going to go back and kill that bully it picked on me in sixth grade.

420
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,140
I'm bringing him back to life and then torture him for an eternity.

421
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:18,540
Right, right.

422
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:18,540


423
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:18,660


424
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:23,880
And I'm sitting there going, man, I want to preserve some of the fine things of Rijksmuseum.

425
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:23,880


426
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,560
I want to preserve some of the fine things of this earth before we destroy it.

427
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,300
Stang, if you're claiming the Rijksmuseum, can I claim the tram system?

428
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,680
You can have it, man, as long as you get there first.

429
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,640
You know, when Ratnar and I were in Amsterdam, he was the first to figure out how those things

430
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,820
worked and how to get to the exhibit hall, which was so far out of town and hard to reach.

431
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,240
Yeah, the maps there work by smell.

432
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,980
The signs aren't written.

433
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,840
You have to sniff the language.

434
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,820
Red-blooded, meat-eating Americans.

435
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:53,860


436
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,120
Can't make head or tail out of those things.

437
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,640
Of course, naturally, somebody from Kentucky would instantly figure out how to get around

438
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,200
in Amsterdam.

439
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,320
Yeah, and we would get around very easily.

440
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,120
The only funny thing is that we always seem to end up at a McDonald's or Kentucky Fried

441
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,440
Chicken or something like that, but we sure got around.

442
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,440
Now, after X Day, it'll be Kentucky Fried Humans.

443
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,520
Yeah, at least they won't find your remains in the canal.

444
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,260
Ew, include me out.

445
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,120
Humans are icky.

446
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,840
They taste terrible.

447
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,540
Sharks.

448
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,640
They spit people out.

449
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,580
What, canal remains?

450
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,160
Well, you know, Kentucky Fried Humans, it varies from person to person.

451
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,180
Of course, the French will eat anything.

452
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,080
They eat canal worms, after all.

453
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,860
What are the fish that are spiked in all this?

454
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,880
I mean, the what?

455
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,300
Pulled long pork.

456
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,060
Actually, canal worms are rather good, the way they fix them.

457
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,280
I got a question about the revenge on the bully thing.

458
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,200
Now, if you were on the falter with the sex goddesses, isn't that revenge enough?

459
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:52,980
It amuses the sex goddesses to see these tropes played out, and they incorporate it into their

460
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,860
program for the next episode.

461
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,040
I don't think it's gonna happen.

462
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,040


463
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,040


464
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,040


465
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,040


466
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,040


467
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,960
You know, the whole thing was prefigured by that proto-subgenius HP Lovecraft, if you're

468
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,180
familiar with his novel, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward.

469
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,640
You know that one?

470
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,520
I haven't read it yet.

471
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:13,620
The sorcerer, Joseph Kirwan, is able to bring back dead folks by reconstituting

472
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:20,660
their ashes in a forbidden alchemical practice, which is called palynogenesis, where the ashes

473
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,860
resume the form of falling.

474
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:29,980
the being that was present before death and before it was burned.

475
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,740
But then, after he brings back ancient alchemists and other people,

476
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,080
like Benjamin Franklin, for example,

477
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:41,600
he tortures them in his special torture chamber underground to find out what they know.

478
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,380
Because, I'm afraid, your Joseph Kerwin was a bad actor with unlimited libido.

479
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,360
And this kind of is the way many subgeniuses will be.

480
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,640
Let's not pretend it's the other way around.

481
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:03,240
So that schoolyard bully will have a little bit of unpleasantness in the new life,

482
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,220
just as the subgeniuses must get it out of their system.

483
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,480
But, you know, the more they do it, the more they get it into their system.

484
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:18,800
You've got to remember what the exists want is not really congruent with human desires,

485
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,160
which are on such a fleshy, lowly level.

486
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,000
And, see, once again, there's the esoteric take on everything.

487
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:32,440
How truly believes that we are going to be tortured beyond belief for eons and eons?

488
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,160
No, I've made certain provisions.

489
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,260
No, he spent his $30 and became a subgenius minister.

490
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,040
That's right.

491
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,780
Not that I would encourage everyone listening to do such a thing.

492
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,940
We can't accommodate everybody.

493
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,520
But there is a warning.

494
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,820
There is definitely the warning of the true intentions of the exes,

495
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,240
whereas Stang totally, well, you know, he pays lip service.

496
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,340
But the exists are...

497
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,960
You're forgetting Bob in all of this.

498
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,360
Bob is the reason that we will, we, the subgeniuses,

499
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,700
will meet every reward we ever thought we might deserve.

500
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,260
Bob is the broker.

501
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:12,560
If it weren't for him, to the exists, we're the equivalent of mildew in your kitchen,

502
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,940
just something to wipe up.

503
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,780
The exists have landed.

504
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,420
The earth lies under their control.

505
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,900
Bob's vision stands proven.

506
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,700
Our city's radioactive holes.

507
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,780
And so forth, you know.

508
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,980
We don't know what they came for, but...

509
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,560
There's the glum view of it.

510
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,880
Bob fails, although he succeeds.

511
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,320
The cities are in ruins.

512
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,560
Some of us escape.

513
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,960
Some of us are tortured forever.

514
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,140
I prefer to be one of those ones.

515
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,380
You want to escape and live a rat-like life in a bombed-out city, huh?

516
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,720
Well, more power to you.

517
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,820
Gotta remember the distinction between human and yeti, also.

518
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,600
I'd prefer to live in a library with a pair of bifocals and a parrot.

519
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,900
Then the glasses fall off and everybody laughs at you.

520
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,360
Huh?

521
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:01,200
Well, I mean, in that twilight zone, the, uh, uh, you know, you have all the books in the world to read,

522
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:07,420
but then, unfortunately, you are unable to read them and they don't have books on tape because the power is off.

523
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,800
Well, not just your glasses fall off, then your eyes pop out.

524
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,120
And your pants fall down.

525
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,080
Yes, I know, it's a humiliating process.

526
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,140
And then the parrot tweaks out your eyes and uses them as a mankermat.

527
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,280
Yeah, while black ravens feast on your blue eyeballs.

528
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,920
Oh, my God, I should hope so.

529
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,820
That's why they call it the Raven's Craft.

530
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,620
They don't want to say anything that would get us all in trouble,

531
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,760
because it doesn't have anything to do with us.

532
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,960
It has to do with...

533
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,340
Nevermore.

534
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,200
Never mind.

535
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,080
You're now as the President of the United States.

536
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:43,580
Definitely.

537
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,760
According to the most recent census data, there's a correlation, it seems like.

538
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,760
Behind these statistics are great personal achievements.

539
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,000
They've been overcome.

540
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,540
And lives have changed forever.

541
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,420
I've met people all around our country who can share their stories.

542
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,040
Adversely.

543
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,580
Sometimes...

544
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,320
I've been watching President Bush in the East Room of the White House talking about France.

545
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,240
Paris has been evacuated now, officials tell us.

546
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,120
Because there has been, they say, a homemade explosive device.

547
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,220
You're seeing a picture of it right now from the website.

548
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,880
It is one of France's most visited tourist attractions.

549
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,280
Eight million visitors there last year.

550
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,440
And the world's largest tourist attraction.

551
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,340
So, bring another caller in here.

552
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,100
Hello, you're on the air.

553
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,020
Hello?

554
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:29,900
Is this me?

555
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,180
Hello?

556
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,080
Hello, you're on the air.

557
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,360
Hello?

558
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,280
Hey, what's going on, guys?

559
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,360
You just stepped in it.

560
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:34,980
We're fasting.

561
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,180
We're cooking up a mess of subgenius fixings in our radio kitchen.

562
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,220
See, I just said we were fasting, and Hal just said we just messed up a mess of...

563
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,300
But that is the transcendental truth.

564
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,480
To fast is to divine...

565
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,360
To do...

566
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,180
To...

567
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,260
To dine on the...

568
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,840
Divine subgenius sub-dumplings.

569
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,360
To puke the auditor...

570
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,000
No, that's...

571
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,520
Never mind.

572
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,860
Sub-dumplings.

573
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,040
Nothing like them.

574
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,080
Man, are they good.

575
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,600
It's actually too late for me to eat them tonight, but tomorrow I shall be hungry.

576
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,460
You know, the word dumpling just does not sound very appetizing.

577
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,500
Call them potstickers.

578
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,520
Here, take a dumpling.

579
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,860
No, thank you.

580
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,000
But, you know, tomorrow is another day.

581
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,860
Tomorrow's another day, that's right.

582
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Bacon in the pan, coffee in the pot.

583
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,080
Come on now and get it while it's hot.

584
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,340
Until July 5th, at which point there won't be any more tomorrow is another day.

585
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,040
Maybe a little baby is...

586
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,680
See, I'm still stuck right now thinking that every day is the same day you wake up.

587
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,920
It's kind of like, I hate to quote another movie, but like Groundhog's Day.

588
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,360
They're all the same.

589
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:41,880
Groundhog's Day.

590
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,020
You know, I read in the paper that the poor citizens of Missouri had shored up their levees

591
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,240
and presented a catastrophic flood, and wouldn't you know it, some muskrat tunneled through it,

592
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,880
and caused all that human labor to be in vain.

593
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,060
Muskrat live.

594
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,140
And now you're talking about groundhogs.

595
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:04,800
We have not been concentrating on that part of the animal kingdom as we should have.

596
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:10,900
The fifth column is coming from entirely different species that we never expected.

597
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,460
Rising up from underground.

598
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,940
The servants of the Deer.

599
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,420
Scratching, digging.

600
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,700
Rats are the underground, then.

601
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,320
I'll call back when I figure out something to talk about, all right?

602
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:21,940
All right.

603
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,780
Wait, wait, wait.

604
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,000
What happened?

605
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,920
All right.

606
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,040
Figuring out what to talk about is not a problem right now.

607
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,740
It's trying to force your word in edgewise.

608
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,980
I'm sorry.

609
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:31,980
That's the hard part.

610
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,020
I'll be quiet.

611
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,420
You can say what you want to say.

612
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,300
Just go ahead.

613
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,340
Don't pay no.

614
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,420
Never mind me.

615
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,860
Yeah, I honestly have no idea what to say.

616
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,120
Why don't you describe your own subgenius principles?

617
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,220
Your own subgenius praxis.

618
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,860
The dog just ran outside.

619
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,900
Let me give you guys called...

620
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,600
That could work.

621
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,900
Your dog running outside?

622
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
That could be the beginning.

623
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,520
After all, you have to follow your dog out into the great world.

624
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,100
So why?

625
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,900
Don't you think that that dog heard us speaking of the animal underground and knew what was happening?

626
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,080
Yeah, he's gone to join his Kong gears.

627
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,180
You'd better follow him before he gets the word out to his secret cell.

628
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:18,880
The dog is literally running to other dogs to spread the word like a dog Paul Revere that we are coming and they've already been there.

629
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,120
Attention now.

630
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,760
Now speak.

631
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,660
Speak.

632
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,920
And if your dog could talk, he too would ask for Bob.

633
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,020
Bob is noted as a dog.

634
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,440
He draws largely on his own experience for his tips on the care and training of dogs.

635
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:40,020
And frequently, Bob amplifies this information with an interview with some outstanding dogs.

636
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,300
But now, here's Bob to make the introduction.

637
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,120
Okay, Bob.

638
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,900
Well, I'm surprised.

639
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,120
After all, you're quite a dog too, aren't you?

640
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,860
Yes, sir.

641
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,100
Woof, woof, woof.

642
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,020
Woof, woof, woof.

643
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,340
And now Bob again.

644
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,900
Woof, woof, woof.

645
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,940
Thank you, Lee Murr.

646
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,020
And now Pisces and Dr. Howe.

647
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,140
Well, let's talk about X-Day.

648
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,300
Have you made your preparations?

649
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,400
Oh, I have so much stuff.

650
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,920
She's got so much stuff that I don't have to bring so much stuff.

651
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,800
Pardon me.

652
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,040
Right?

653
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,580
So great.

654
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,400
I told you guys, Pisces is the new stang.

655
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:34,720
She will take on the burdens and become the embittered, peevish, aching, complaining, griping old man.

656
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,340
But I'm a Sagittarius.

657
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,780
But, you know, the great thing about it is that being a female, I can get away with a little bit more of the griping.

658
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,160
Because people will just go, oh.

659
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,280
Yes.

660
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,180
Do you have artistic fallopian tubes?

661
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,060
The kind that makes the kind?

662
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,340
I do.

663
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,220
Do you have axes?

664
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:52,220


665
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,640
Do you have axes to such fallopian tubes?

666
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,640
I have ovaries of steel.

667
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,460
It's all about the art.

668
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,420
Ovaries of steel.

669
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,020
And the literature.

670
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,180
Don't forget Madame Bovary's ovaries.

671
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,200
Exactly.

672
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,060
Let's take a look at Madame Curie's ovaries if we want to see some real radio action.

673
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,080
Pisces is a true ovary man.

674
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,620
Well, that's something.

675
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,920
An ovary ma'am?

676
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,080
No, no.

677
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,680
Ovary man.

678
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,040
She's a mammary ovary.

679
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,740
Sort of like the uber femmes, but sounds better.

680
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,880
A mammary uber.

681
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,600
No.

682
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,220
Not to be confused with...

683
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,280
It's with the ovary man.

684
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,400
Right.

685
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,820
Which is somebody who takes a lot of ovary.

686
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,900
Or the rather juvenile ovaltine man.

687
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,340
Or the regular Scandinavian oomph, Mitch.

688
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,120
I'm taking ovary.

689
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,140
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

690
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,120
When time's too tight,

691
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,600
give yourself some slack.

692
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,820
When time's too tight,

693
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,200
give yourself some slack.

694
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,240
Give yourself some slack.

695
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,500
When time's too tight,

696
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,800
fled technologies to die.

697
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,020
Stuck here on this rock.

698
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,660
Stuck here on this rock.

699
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,220
When time's too tight,

700
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:08,220


701
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,140
Stuck here on this rock.

702
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:10,420


703
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,580
Killing time.

704
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,640
Watching clocks.

705
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,620
Stuck here on this rock.

706
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,020
Killing time.

707
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,180
Watching clocks.

708
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,200
Screw this rock.

709
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,200


710
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,200


711
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,200


712
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,200


713
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,200


714
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,200


715
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,200


716
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,200


717
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,200


718
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,200


719
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,200


720
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,040
Stuck here on this rock

721
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,320
Killing time, killing time

722
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,480
Woke up on the planet of the clocks

723
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,160
Can't ignore the beat, relentless tick and tock

724
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,860
Got some place to be, we won't stand in line

725
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,600
Busy making money, how we spend our time

726
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,700
Pull the wool over your own eyes

727
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,380
Pull the wool over your own eyes

728
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,340
Pull the wool over your own eyes

729
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,380
Lasered elected.

730
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,380


731
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,380


732
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,380


733
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,380


734
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,580
Kill the wolf

735
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,480
Get rid of our massively

736
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:02,560
Barn figured

737
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:02,560


738
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,260
With Howard

739
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,420
We

740
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:04,780
Are

741
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:04,780


742
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,880
Blood

743
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:10,880


744
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:19,640
Blood

745
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:19,640


746
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:19,640


747
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,840
Relentless tic and toc

748
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,760
Woke up on the plantet of the clucks

749
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,740
Plantet of the CLUCKS

750
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,560
Plantet of the CLUCKS

751
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,540
If time's the same as money, can we save time?

752
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,220
If time's the same as money, can we make time?

753
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,900
If time's the same as money, can we buy time?

754
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,700
If time's the same as money, can we waste time?

755
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,680
Stuck here on this rock

756
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,060
Rock, killing time

757
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,120
Watching clocks, stuck here on this rock

758
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,340
Killing time, killing time

759
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:33,280
Busy, busy making money

760
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,640
Busy, busy making money

761
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,120
Busy, busy making money

762
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,000
Before we spend our time

763
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,680
Can we waste time?

764
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,400
Can we waste time?

765
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,200
Can we waste time?

766
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,620
Can we waste time?

767
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,320
Planet of the Clocks by Reverend Max Slack

768
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,660
emailed to stang at subgenius.com

769
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,080
Quite a nice new Bob song there.

770
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,300
We must get to that.

771
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,160
That Bob song's seven CD sometime.

772
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,800
Before that, there was lots of Dr. Hal

773
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,480
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave on Dr. Sinister's

774
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,960
Radio Synesthesia on WCSB.

775
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,740
The background music on Dr. Sinister's show

776
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,440
is all from the Devo Easy Listening album.

777
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,220
The background music behind me now

778
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,360
is Calvin Ball live at X-Day.

779
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,760
And now, a question.

780
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,480
Is there going to be church air at X-Day this year?

781
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,380
Oh, I, you...

782
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,860
We sometimes use church air

783
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,700
as a euphemism for Jenkin.

784
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,380
But, and yes, there will in fact...

785
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,200
In fact, I printed up some signs

786
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,640
to go on all the four flushed doors.

787
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,760
In California, everybody's into church air.

788
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,100
Chicken John and his men, you know.

789
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,460
And K-Rob, my wonderful assistant.

790
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,320
They call that Yuppie Crack.

791
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,840
I thought that was the name of a milk powder, K-Rob.

792
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,900
No, that's the name of the guy who runs everything.

793
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,460
He runs the Ask Dr. Hal MySpace page,

794
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,820
he's the board operator for the Ask Dr. Hal radio show.

795
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,360
He's not doubling as a chocolate substitute somewhere?

796
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,980
Well, he's probably chocolatey in his own way.

797
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,220
I thought K-Rob was kind of like Tiger Balm,

798
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,960
except for only for the appendages.

799
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,460
Well, once you meet K-Rob,

800
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,920
you'll know that to know him is to love him.

801
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,520
He got a Bobby Award last year.

802
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,300
Yes, I delivered it to him.

803
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,180
Yeah, it's poop on a stick is what it was.

804
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,300
He was mightily pleased.

805
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,580
Yes, but it was angel poop.

806
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,340
Well, it could have had a little funny look.

807
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,380
He was a fucking spaceman on it.

808
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,520
It was still poop on his stick.

809
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,580
Now, the listeners may think we're being funny,

810
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,060
but there was an X-Day in which there were angel droppings found all over the camp.

811
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,380
Angel turds were all over the camp.

812
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,220
And they were illustrated.

813
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,060
They had beautiful little color pictures painted on them.

814
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,500
Oh, they're the most artistic things you've ever seen, you know.

815
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,480
They're not produced by apes.

816
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:36,560
Oh, and you can tell, Susie, that I still have my little angel turd.

817
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,300
I will.

818
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,400
The little candy corn.

819
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,360
Well, it's time to let go.

820
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,440
They had her paint for me.

821
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,060
Yeah.

822
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,060
Candy corn?

823
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,840
No, that's really...

824
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,080
Ow!

825
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,940
I got a patty.

826
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,860
I got a whole patty and a George Forskin grill to grill it on.

827
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,040
I got a rock.

828
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,060
Keep me to it, Rock.

829
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,540
You got a rock.

830
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:58,720
It's a sign that Dobbs is very, very disappointed in your behavior

831
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,480
and that rock should go in your shoe wear.

832
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,480
It will motivate you to sell more stuff, things, ideas, questions.

833
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,020
And one angel turd I got was shaped like a female sex toy.

834
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:13,500
And it was painted like a female sex toy.

835
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,040
And I was told it was appropriate.

836
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,340
Well, that's because you're widely regarded as some sort of a slut.

837
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,960
Aside from that, I don't know.

838
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,800
Not that you are.

839
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,240
It's just that if you're a subgenius and you're a girl and you get up on stage and rant,

840
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,160
then therefore, according to the stereotype view,

841
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,240
then you must be...

842
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,200
Easy, as they say.

843
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:48,420
In actual fact, it's funny, you know, because in my experience with ranters

844
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,420
and other showbiz people is that their real personality is often the diametric opposite

845
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,160
of what they present on stage.

846
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:02,200
So they act like sluts on stage, but in real life, they're really uptight.

847
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,960
They're prim, proper, goody two-shoes.

848
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,340
That's me.

849
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,500
In fact, that pretty much describes I was...

850
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,400
Well, I got one of those angel turds.

851
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:14,980
And it was in the shape of a sperm, an aggressive sperm, smoking a cigar and wearing a derby

852
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,740
like Spooky the Tough Little Ghost.

853
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,220
Oh, I thought I was wearing a beret with a goatee.

854
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,200
Bad.

855
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,400
I've seen those ones, and believe me, I've run.

856
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,080
I've run.

857
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,560
Were they French, though?

858
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,260
They were not French.

859
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,260
They were...

860
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,140
How do you say?

861
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,600
They were an act of God.

862
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,600
Have you ever seen a zygote wearing one of those little Portuguese fishermen's hats?

863
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,620
Why a zygote?

864
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:36,960
I'm a zygote.

865
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,260
I can't comprehend.

866
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,440
Yeah, why a zygote?

867
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,140
I want nothing to do with zygotes.

868
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:41,560
I run.

869
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,780
Yes, that's a different judge punchline.

870
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:45,900
Oh, yeah.

871
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,740
Okay, okay.

872
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,220
I'm scared of zygotes.

873
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,820
Well, they are scary things, potentially.

874
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,160
Yeah, they could grow up to be embryos.

875
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,000
They hijack your body.

876
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:56,780
Mm-hmm.

877
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,600
That's right.

878
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:03,400
We were talking about parasites earlier on and strange growths and...

879
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,100
My daughter has one of those.

880
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:05,920
Oh, really?

881
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,420
Yeah, they're planning to excise it next month.

882
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:09,440
Next month.

883
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:09,440


884
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:09,440


885
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:09,440


886
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:09,440


887
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,580
Oh, really?

888
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,300
Well, they're all...

889
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:11,740
I'll be a grandpa.

890
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,300
Good God.

891
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,040
Grandpa stangulation.

892
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,420
Grandpa stang.

893
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:15,940
That's right.

894
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,820
I can see you sitting on the front porch, tapping your foot plain and plain.

895
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,020
Next to that old, abandoned, unused washing machine.

896
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,220
Whittling on the baby.

897
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,880
Well, I have to get you a rocking chair there, Grandpa stang.

898
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,940
Or a rolling chair.

899
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,240
Or a gun or a BB gun.

900
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,000
These grand desires often have mobility problems.

901
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,360
Gothic-like studging them and stuff.

902
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,760
Well, you know, that's a long...

903
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:39,660
It's a wonderful life.

904
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:45,240
To sit in the sun and shine surrounded by all those crawling subgenius offspring.

905
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,160
That's what it's all about.

906
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:47,760
Yep.

907
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,040
It's what we're all looking for.

908
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,040
I mean, beyond X-Day and having lots of hot babes trying to sit on your face at one time,

909
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:56,880
it's going to be sitting in the sun like Marlon Brando in The Godfather.

910
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,300
That's the fourth reference to a movie.

911
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,120
Yeah, but you've just got to watch out.

912
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,260
Don't put those orange slices in your mouth or you'll keel right over.

913
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:04,880
Yeah.

914
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,200
I'm on key, you.

915
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,360
Well, we'll talk about that after a show.

916
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,120
I need to get that all hashed out.

917
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,520
Actually, it wouldn't be too unusual for Stang to be.

918
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,300
My grandpa was a Baptist preacher.

919
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,600
So Stang is a Christian preacher.

920
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,460
You know, it's funny.

921
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,460
I recently learned last year that I'm the descendant of four preachers.

922
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,980
Both my dad and my mom.

923
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,180
All of their grandfathers were preachers.

924
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,000
Well, they're Methodist circuit riders.

925
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:38,720
That was in general.

926
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,280
My grandfather.

927
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:39,380
That was in general.

928
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:39,380


929
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:39,380


930
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:39,380


931
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:39,960
My father's side.

932
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,420
If you go back that far.

933
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:49,640
Well, you could go back on my side and you'd probably find some sort of parasitic preacher involved in my defolution.

934
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,200
A preacher and a speaker.

935
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:56,220
If you go not too far back on Dave's side, you'll come to Neanderthal Man.

936
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,560
You'll come to him singing.

937
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,680
Umpha, umpha, itchy, scratchy.

938
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,640
Another solution.

939
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,080
What was the barking?

940
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,900
Remember the Neanderthal barking on one of the many programs?

941
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:09,920
Yeah.

942
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,560
Barking spiders incorporated.

943
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,440
We're forced to become absorbed into it.

944
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,720
Barking spider is actually a bar by University Circle.

945
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,540
Are they open?

946
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,880
I don't think so.

947
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,180
I don't know.

948
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,560
The barking spider is very much a Dobbs approved bar in that if you walk in there, you will

949
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:32,460
see little rubber bleeding heads of Arnold Palmer and little rubber Dobbs heads.

950
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:38,060
The old Pope of Cleveland, Pope Jimbo, had those manufactured.

951
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,020
And, uh.

952
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,360
He donated some to that bar.

953
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,940
It was always a friendly bar.

954
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:47,500
Well, that sounds genuine, unlike some of those other places which only trade on Bob's

955
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:47,720
name.

956
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,440
Right.

957
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,320
Do many bars name themselves after an excreted inflation?

958
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:58,460
There's a sports bar in Tucson, Arizona called the Bob Dobbs Bar and Grill.

959
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:58,720
That's right.

960
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,940
They serve a Bob Burger and a Connie Burger.

961
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:06,400
And they have the thumbed, greasy book of the subgenius attached by a little chain

962
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,000
to the bar.

963
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:07,500
But, uh.

964
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,120
It's for big red-faced jocks who watch a lot of sports on the TV.

965
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,600
It's the least subgenius thing you've ever seen.

966
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:20,300
It was started by some subgeniuses, but of course they failed and they sold it to

967
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,000
somebody else who kept the name.

968
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,920
That's right.

969
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,760
And any subgeniusettes who were there or would be are actually just sort of, you know,

970
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,200
college girls trying to make a living.

971
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,500
They're spies for the conspiracy.

972
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,980
It is quite possible.

973
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:36,940
Quite likely.

974
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,100
That for some time.

975
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,340
Yeah, I remember the one Alastair Crow.

976
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,640
Alastair Crow blowing up the blue suit.

977
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,280
Fake rubber Connie heads?

978
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,660
Now you're talking.

979
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,440
That's what I'm wondering.

980
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,940
I think someone should open the window.

981
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,840
I'm short of breath here.

982
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,980
I mean, do you take a large rubber Connie head and put it in a room or in a box with

983
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,100
a large rubber Dobbs head?

984
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,440
Are you getting ready to pass out?

985
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,540
And then you leave them there overnight and you wake up the next morning and open up the

986
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:03,700
box.

987
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,780
Something germinates?

988
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:05,780
Yeah.

989
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,680
Yeah, little Dobbs heads and little Connie heads.

990
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,800
Oh, look at that.

991
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,780
Isn't that cute?

992
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,340
And you can actually rub them as an anti-stress thing.

993
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,700
They're available for a limited time only now, only 14, 14, 14, 14.

994
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,520
Well, they got to pay for it.

995
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,960
They're not going to do that for free.

996
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,460
No rubbing baby Bob's heads without paying.

997
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,300
That's what I say.

998
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,280
Rubbing baby Bob head bunkers.

999
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,540
Yeah, in your bunker you can rub that baby Bob head as you listen to the detonations

1000
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:32,900
outside.

1001
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,340
Better to have them on your dashboard, Bob's head.

1002
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:41,620
Or you can have two of them in your palm and you can rattle them while you are testifying

1003
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,040
against yourself in court.

1004
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,940
Yeah, I was going to say instead of Jehovah's Witnesses coming to my house, I've got protected

1005
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,660
Witnesses.

1006
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,160
What can you do about that?

1007
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:55,880
There's people that I guess they're on the lam or the sheep or what can you do about

1008
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,160
that?

1009
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,580
I'm afraid of keeping them in my basement because I'm hiding some slaves there.

1010
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,280
Let them talk.

1011
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,620
Who's going to believe them?

1012
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,260
By the time that happens.

1013
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:04,520
Right.

1014
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:04,520


1015
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,320
That's the first thing you ask anyone.

1016
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,200
Who are you?

1017
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,300
And if they can't answer with their name, then they're not, they're incredible.

1018
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,360
That's right out of the Masonic ritual.

1019
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,980
They ask you when you're being made a Mason, you know, who are you?

1020
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,020
And you answer who, who, who?

1021
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,020
They say you have to answer I'm in darkness and need to be brought to the light, which

1022
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:31,600
is why Jack Chick claims it's totally satanic because that light is the light of the light.

1023
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:31,820
Lucifer.

1024
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,920
Not the light of enlightenment.

1025
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:39,460
In fact, to say enlightenment at all, forget the philosophes and Voltaire and Diderot and

1026
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:39,740
so on.

1027
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:46,340
Enlightenment only refers to Lucifer in Jack Chick's super paranoid world.

1028
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:47,800
God bless him.

1029
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,420
Lucifer means light bringer in the language of...

1030
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,220
The light bearer.

1031
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:51,620
Oh yeah.

1032
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:57,740
He was the covering cherub hovering above the throne and the most bright and brilliant

1033
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,340
of all the heavenly hosts.

1034
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,580
Until iniquity was found.

1035
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,360
In him.

1036
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:08,780
Well, perhaps you found it in the closet right where old Bug Bottom left it.

1037
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,620
Bug Bottom?

1038
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,500
Well...

1039
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,000
Bug Bottom?

1040
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,100
You mean Bayer Zip-Up?

1041
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,020
We'll just call him the first created issuance.

1042
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:15,980
Praise Bug Bottom.

1043
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,920
Praise Bug Bottom.

1044
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,440
I'm a Bug Bottom-y.

1045
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,100
Get him off.

1046
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:19,660
Get him off.

1047
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,940
Get him back.

1048
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,040
Get him back and make him sign releases.

1049
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,680
We may let them go some time.

1050
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,440
Never sign the paper.

1051
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:30,640
Unless...

1052
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,020
I'm sorry.

1053
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:31,060


1054
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:31,060


1055
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:31,140


1056
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:31,140


1057
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,980
Bob has signed it already.

1058
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:33,620
That's right.

1059
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:33,980
Unless he's signed it already.

1060
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:39,720
Put your John Hancock right down there under that J.R. Bob Dobbs, that big sprawling signature

1061
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,880
with the underline.

1062
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,920
A man on the make.

1063
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:48,100
Is he still taking signatures in blood only, like the Pirates' Revenge, and then you stand

1064
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,220
up and you make an oath to...

1065
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,220
No, it doesn't have to be blood.

1066
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,860
It can be any bodily fluid.

1067
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:53,680
That's right.

1068
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,140
And if you stand up, you might want to sit right down again because you'll be dizzy since

1069
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:01,120
you've lost so much vital essence in John Hancock.

1070
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,240
Just that elaborate signature with all the curly Qs.

1071
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:05,940
Right.

1072
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:10,600
I feel like I could sign and snot a thousand documents and would not care a whit.

1073
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:17,280
That's not for me to say, but the great registrar of heaven, the recording angel, will take

1074
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:17,600
note.

1075
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,440
Does his name appear in the Book of Life?

1076
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,040
Nay, Lord.

1077
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,160
Nay, it never does, Lord.

1078
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,260
Cast him into the lake of fire.

1079
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,560
I just love to say that.

1080
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,000
How about his limbic fluids?

1081
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,200
Do they appear on the parchment?

1082
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:37,080
Very sadly, I must say to you, depart from me, ye unclean spirit, into the eternal fire

1083
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,400
and the worm that dieth not prepared for Satan and his fallen angel buddies.

1084
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:41,700
But remember...

1085
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:41,980
And you!

1086
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,540
In you go, the angel will heave you in aly-ookersplash.

1087
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:47,840
Whee!

1088
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,020
Right next to Hitler.

1089
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,560
Well, you just remember that Bob is not...

1090
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,260
Bob is right next to Hitler.

1091
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,980
Bob is not there to wash away your sins.

1092
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,600
No, sir, he's there to encourage them.

1093
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,240
They don't wash off.

1094
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:58,940
...to do your sins.

1095
00:51:59,180 --> 00:51:59,660
Yes.

1096
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,480
Bob is there to pull your nose.

1097
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,320
And he'll wash you to your sins, and he will videotape them, and they'll be on the Internet.

1098
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,120
And everybody will see.

1099
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,680
And then he'll sell them, and for the girls gone wild people...

1100
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:16,960
Once again, Jack Chick is right there with his first tract, This Is Your Life, which

1101
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,660
shows that, you know, way before YouTube was a glimmer in anybody's eye, that after you

1102
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:28,400
die, this huge video of everything you ever did when you thought nobody could see will

1103
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,300
be shown...

1104
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:29,860
God damn.

1105
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:36,380
...not only to everybody present at that trial, but to everybody in the entire universe.

1106
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,320
Well, that's one of my parodies.

1107
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,600
I turned it into, This Was Your Life, Pastor Craig.

1108
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,260
I don't know if we want to go that far in transparency.

1109
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,540
No, well, you know, that's not our system.

1110
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,260
That's the Christian system.

1111
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,300
Doing it with transparency would take too long.

1112
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,720
I mean, imagine writing up all the transparency of everything he's done.

1113
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:52,780
Right.

1114
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:59,140
When Bob judges you, the video of your life that's shown is edited down to just the juices

1115
00:52:59,140 --> 00:52:59,280
of the earth.

1116
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,280


1117
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,280


1118
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,280


1119
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,280


1120
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,280


1121
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,280


1122
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,600
We don't make everybody watch all those videos.

1123
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:07,260
Do you have any idea how many videos any individual subgenius has had to watch?

1124
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:16,560
Many of them mediocre, badly made, the hours wasting one's eyes on these grainy, ineptly

1125
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,420
created images.

1126
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,460
This is not for the afterlife.

1127
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,780
This is part of the penance of the before life.

1128
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,680
So you didn't like my film then, right?

1129
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,320
Well, I wasn't going to come ride out and say it, but...

1130
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,320
Yeah, I have a question.

1131
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,560
You should have a French version.

1132
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,480
They'd love it over there.

1133
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:36,060
You could retitle it, Pardon Mon Direction et Cinématographie.

1134
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,220
And they would love it here.

1135
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,220
A delightful bit of froth.

1136
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:43,040
What if somebody got cast into the lake of fire and then, oh, here that guy is.

1137
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,240
His name was just alphabetized the wrong way.

1138
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,120
Well, a little bit more fire for you, Scarecrow.

1139
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:54,280
Well, as we learned from Uncle Remus' stories, when they start to throw you in the

1140
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,180
lake of fire, you go, yes, please, throw me in the lake of fire.

1141
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,240
But whatever you do, don't send me to subgenius hell.

1142
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,280
Oh, so subgenius hell is the one he fears the most.

1143
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,000
Cast him into the subgenius hell.

1144
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,980
Because that's how you trick him.

1145
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,060
Well, wouldn't they be on to that?

1146
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,660
I mean, that's an old ploy.

1147
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,800
Oh, only an omnipotent being would be able to figure that out.

1148
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,360
You know, they're using double, triple reverse psychology.

1149
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,000
Subgenius hell is actually very subtle.

1150
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,300
Subgenius heaven, you know, you have fields of froth.

1151
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,340
You have a crop that you can smoke.

1152
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,780
No, that's subgenius hell.

1153
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:31,260
Right.

1154
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,700
Subgenius heaven, you can't even begin to imagine.

1155
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,740
You don't immediately go to subgenius heaven.

1156
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,580
There's a long and winding road that takes you there.

1157
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,420
Yeah, you have to be prepared.

1158
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,980
If you went straight to subgenius heaven, the pleasure would kill you.

1159
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:47,440
That's right.

1160
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,600
You have to be prepared by the boot camp of subgenius hell.

1161
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,700
Like when Jupiter appeared to have this simile.

1162
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,120
You would be blasted by the effulgence.

1163
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,320
You would be blasted by the effulgence of the true Bob-like nature.

1164
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,700
You have to be prepared, gradually.

1165
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:03,860
Talk to your lady.

1166
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,860
Would you have a lady prune?

1167
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,240
You know, boys and girls, I was kind of wondering,

1168
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,680
do we assume the Bob nature once we've transformed ourselves,

1169
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,100
or is it always in us, or is Bob an illusion and we create it?

1170
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,820
You put it on.

1171
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,720
You put on the Bob nature like a polyester coat of many colors.

1172
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,400
Like a low-hair suit.

1173
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,960
Like a polyester suit was the way it was first described,

1174
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:27,760
and yet the bowling alley is multicolored as we've taken more and more LSDs.

1175
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,780
Yes, but there's that strike.

1176
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,360
That satisfying strike.

1177
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,600
Or you could pick up a spare.

1178
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:33,800
That lucky stroke.

1179
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,260
A likely stroke for those...

1180
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,260
Aren't you going on strike right now, Hal?

1181
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,060
You're in SAG, aren't you?

1182
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,540
I'm not on strike, and I'm not in SAG.

1183
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,480
I'm in AFTRA, which unfortunately there is a distinction.

1184
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:49,920
They tried to meld SAG and AFTRA together, but it failed.

1185
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,380
And he's a loyal AFTRA.

1186
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,140
It's SAG.

1187
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,420
I'm not loyal, but I have to pay those dues, because if I don't,

1188
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,280
I can't get those big jobs.

1189
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,340
You'll never work in this town again.

1190
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:08,660
Technically, you're forbidden as an AFTRA, an American Federation of Radio and Television Artists.

1191
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,400
So local number 25.

1192
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,420
And...

1193
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,300
From the Los Angeles area.

1194
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,860
You see, I had to join while I was down there in conspiracy TV world,

1195
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,320
and so even though I don't live there, that's my local union.

1196
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,920
I'm in the Film Actors Guild.

1197
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,120
Are you really?

1198
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,300
That's the cool one. That's what I wish I was in.

1199
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,700
I was in BMI.

1200
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,080
Broadcast Music Idiots.

1201
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,040
Well, anyway...

1202
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,040
From PR News in Washington,

1203
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:44,660
I'm expected to grow by 50% over the next two decades.

1204
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,720
On Wall Street, 6211-864-714.

1205
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,400
Today, the Supreme Court was sparked by lightning on Sunday.

1206
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,500
Justice David Souter wrote that this is PR News.

1207
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,420
The Supreme Court is now in session.

1208
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:05,100
Well, folks, speaking of annoying chores we all have to do to satisfy one requirement or another,

1209
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,480
portions of the following broadcast may be found objectionable by members of the listening audience.

1210
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,500
Therefore, WCSB advises listener discretion to the views and opinions expressed on this program,

1211
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,100
not those of WCSB or Cleveland State University.

1212
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,380
They better be found objectionable.

1213
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,900
We're not doing our job.

1214
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,180
We're not doing our job, no.

1215
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,300
Folks, we are just about out of time.

1216
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,780
I want to thank my special guest tonight, Reverend Stang, Dr. Howell.

1217
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:25,460
Hiya.

1218
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,420
Can I thank you enough for your support tonight?

1219
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,840
I would like to thank your glange.

1220
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:29,800
And I want some cowboy Dave.

1221
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,540
Tis midnight, but small thoughts have I of sleep.

1222
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,240
Thank you for your call tonight, Brocknar.

1223
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,380
See you at the work of X's.

1224
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,600
I love all of your glanges.

1225
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,200
I have one final thought.

1226
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:43,660
When X Day does come, will we be reunited with all those clones that the X's have made of us?

1227
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,820
I love your glange.

1228
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,000
We shall see.

1229
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:47,580
I love your brain.

1230
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:48,520
Get ready.

1231
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,460
Only time will tell.

1232
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:49,820
It's coming.

1233
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,900
The end of the world in just a few days.

1234
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,660
Bob, love ya.

1235
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,280
Each and every one of you little subs.

1236
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:55,440
Absolutely.

1237
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:55,920
I love you, D-Mees.

1238
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,320
We smell sausage and sucasa.

1239
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,940
Good night, Pisces.

1240
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,560
Me esposa es su esposa.

1241
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,740
Oh, they hung up.

1242
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,100
Uh-oh.

1243
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,240
We smell sausage.

1244
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,040
You know what, guys?

1245
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:07,760
I got to drop you off.

1246
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:09,240
Well, it was fun.

1247
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,480
It was fun while it lasted.

1248
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,720
Well, uh, we'll, uh...

1249
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,300
I'll try and be here next week, I think.

1250
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:15,880
Um...

1251
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:22,160
Yeah, I'm gonna try to get Dr. Howell back to the studio here by 9 o'clock.

1252
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:22,760
I'll be back.

1253
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,440
But if I don't make it by 9 o'clock, I have to go back to the studio and I'm gonna have

1254
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:25,440


1255
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:25,440


1256
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:25,440


1257
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:25,440


1258
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,420
have dropped off a Suzy the Flusy X-Day special.

1259
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,780
Oh, that outclasses me anyway.

1260
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,340
You'll want to play that in any case.

1261
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,880
Well, that would be the 9 o'clock if we don't make it by hour.

1262
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,000
Well, at least we've got coverage, everybody.

1263
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:42,980
Coverage.

1264
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,720
Me like coverage.

1265
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:50,940
Good.

1266
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:52,820
Yep.

1267
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:53,940
All right, folks.

1268
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,000
That's about the size of it.

1269
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,440
Keep, stay tuned.

1270
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,720
We've got a big steaming pile of crap coming down the pike for your enjoyment.

1271
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:07,300
Keep your hat on tight, your sack in the saddle, and your knees in the wind.

1272
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,980
And always, always.

1273
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,920
And hold on tight.

1274
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,840
And keep it surreal.
