1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
Impressive evidence.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,220
You sex robot.

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,440
Freeze, douchebags!

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,720
Goddamn hotline!

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,780
This place is surrounded. Art's got my back.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,740
Don't move, assholes!

7
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,600
Matt's guarding the back door.

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,120
Yo!

9
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,100
And Bob's covering the harbor.

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,140
This is so stupid.

11
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,340
Asshole destroyed all of Zebulon!

12
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,740
What does such a terrible thing?

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,280
Yes, well, it's actually a funny story about that.

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,300
The subgenius power of...

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:45,700
Son. Oh, son.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,500
I was wrong about you.

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,120
There are so many definitions of a hero.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,700
But for me, someone who lifts you up

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,840
and gives you hope when some dickhead throws your planet into the sun.

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,740
It's J.R. Bob!

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,620
Bob Dobbs, the living slack master

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,120
in his church of the subgenius.

23
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,560
Rachel does not come from the same clinch as Fid Chuli,

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,620
so if you can actually give her a round of applause

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,840
instead of boos,

26
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,260
everybody welcome Rachel Weird again.

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,320
Thank you, thank you.

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,940
It may be familiar,

29
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,340
and I apologize if I give you an earworm.

30
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:25,780
Okay?

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,620
Okay.

32
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,620
Do you want to go to X Day?

33
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,400
Thirty-five is what you pay.

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,800
The pinks will say I am a slob.

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,880
I quit my job.

36
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,360
I'm slacking off all day.

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,780
I used to be downtrodden,

38
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,560
but now I'm not.

39
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
And Bob is the reason why.

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,440
Do you want to go to X Day?

41
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,420
We can watch the world burn away.

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,340
The pinks must die.

43
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,340
Do you want to go to X Day?

44
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,880
It'll be a lot of fun.

45
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,880
The X's will come down for you.

46
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,560
All you have to do is give your cash to Bob.

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,980
Praise Bob!

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,340
Praise Bob!

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,840
You can get real chummy

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,800
with your Yeti clan.

51
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,560
Counting down to the 5th of July.

52
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,280
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.

53
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,020
Bob?

54
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,580
Bob?

55
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


56
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


57
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


58
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


59
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,980


60
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,720
You fuck, I know you're out there.

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,520
I see you screwed us yet again.

62
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,420
You promised us all saucers, but they're overdue.

63
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,980
We will come for you and kill you in the end.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,880
We gather every summer.

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,060
We wake at 7 a.m.

66
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,360
When will all our dreams come true?

67
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,060
Do you want to go to X Day?

68
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,560
Come on, let's go to X Day.

69
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,640
Okay, bye.

70
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,520
The world's gonna end.

71
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,080
Right, exactly.

72
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,700
What the fuck?

73
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,540
Right, exactly.

74
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,240
What the fucking fuck?

75
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,360
So you guys can hang out.

76
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,840
Actually, I expect, you know, if you notice, fuckery is always on the schedule.

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,960
And, in fact, I'm looking at the time, and it's about that time.

78
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,820
And that time on my watch says it's time for fuckery.

79
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,120
So feel free to stick around for the fuckery.

80
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,040
And I expect we'll have some interesting fuckery participants.

81
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,220
Fuckery, dude.

82
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,100
Oh, fuckery.

83
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,460
My home, my world.

84
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,120
A fuckery day.

85
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,800
Lenny, a fucker, and him my way.

86
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,980
Fuckery, dude.

87
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,760
Oh, fuckery day.

88
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,960
Mr. Fucker on my shoulder.

89
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,600
That was very tweet, yes.

90
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:20,960
Very tweet.

91
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,640
That was a little too sweet, personally.

92
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,060
So I think we need a little anger.

93
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,360
I'm pretty good at anger.

94
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:40,100
And this is one of those that poor Stang will only be able to put on the triple X hours of slack.

95
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,320
Fuck advertising.

96
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,500
Fuck advertising.

97
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:54,200
The fact that some algorithm sees fit to remind me on a regular basis that I'm a childish old divorcee without a degree is rather annoying.

98
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,320
On the same fucking page, on the same fucking page,

99
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,880
dating for middle-aged women,

100
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,240
sperm banks,

101
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,540
to make money, you have to have your bachelor's.

102
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,160
Seriously, fuck that shit.

103
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,300
I mean hell.

104
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,640
God damn, hello ma'am, you're fat, unattractive, childless, a stupid failure of a woman that no one will ever want

105
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,880
unless you quickly settle for some second-rate shit that we're peddling and sell your soul to the fucking conspiracy.

106
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,680
That, my friends, is some serious fucking bullshit.

107
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,540
I am damn good on my own at making myself feel like shit, and I sure as fuck don't.

108
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:28,540


109
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:28,540


110
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,580
I don't need the age conspiracy to guilt the greed machine into doing it for me.

111
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,220
This thing, though, the real reason that I'm offended by this shit is I am damn fucking good at marketing.

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,580
I understand it.

113
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,520
Because, folks, it is 80% psychobabble and 20% luck.

114
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,220
And the reason shit like this pisses me off is I know exactly what went through those ad teams' head.

115
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,200
The conspiracy marketing blorps seeking out buttons.

116
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,540
But, motherfuckers, but, my brothers and sisters,

117
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,520
they play the game.

118
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,720
They planted the buttons there.

119
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,880
They put them there, their fucking selves.

120
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,760
And you would think if the conspiracy made the buttons, it would be easier for them to nail them.

121
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,980
Yet, they suck at it.

122
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,340
Next time!

123
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:19,780
This fucking marketing dipshit I know doesn't even know that, understand the basic way to press the buttons that their kind created themselves.

124
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,600
Because this shit isn't just Pepsi Cola, folks, or Fairfax County Sperm Bank.

125
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,780
It's not Big Oil. It's not Wall Street.

126
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,140
Civilization itself.

127
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,660
It depends on the marketing machine.

128
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,460
And one of the best marketing machines in history was Christianity.

129
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,640
Man, that was fucking brilliant.

130
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,100
So let's steal the ideas from popular pagan thought.

131
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,420
Make the pagan deities of Western Europe seem to be the exact most evil, cruel beings in your mythos.

132
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,520
Force-feed hopes.

133
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,260
Teach people that they are compliant and play by the rules.

134
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,080
They'll win the grand prize of heaven.

135
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,680
It's fucking brilliant.

136
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,260
It's sinister. It's evil.

137
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,820
But it's fucking brilliant.

138
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,680
But maybe you never bought the sales pitch.

139
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,840
Maybe you're a mutant.

140
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,460
I never bought it either.

141
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,820
But you know why?

142
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,620
Couldn't get the product.

143
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't understand what it did.

144
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,920
I mean, I just don't get it.

145
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:14,020
See, there's very little difference between folks waiting in line for the newest I suck and the prayer vigil.

146
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,820
So tell me what it is.

147
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,580
Because here's the thing.

148
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,340
I fucking at least got a face that I know is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

149
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,940
What the fuck does God even look like anyway?

150
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,720
Or Jesus for that matter.

151
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,480
I know what Bob fucking looks like.

152
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,380
I know what Bob fucking tastes like if I want to.

153
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:35,940
Hello!

154
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,160
Hello!

155
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,400
So, in closing I'm going to do another call and response.

156
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,520
So, let's do this one.

157
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,020
Fuck the conspiracy.

158
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,280
Fuck the conspiracy!

159
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:52,900


160
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,920
Fuck the conspiracy!

161
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,640
Alright, I want a little more effort in that, y'all.

162
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,600
I came up here and started screaming into a microphone to the point I'm redlining the levels over there for suds.

163
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,260
Let's try this again.

164
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,820
Fuck the conspiracy!

165
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,860
Fuck the conspiracy!

166
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,580
Thank you.

167
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,780
Fuck the conspiracy!

168
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,160
Thank you very much.

169
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,980
Now, if someone else would like to come up here, you're welcome to do so.

170
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,100
We have a special guest singer.

171
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,280
Oh, yeah.

172
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,340
Now, if you can't see up here, this is the absolutely awesome,

173
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,480
incredible Queen Mum.

174
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,340
Yeah.

175
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,060
And if you had any doubt in your head that she was awesome, well, you're an idiot.

176
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,720
And so, they're going to go ahead and perform for us.

177
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,440
It's the Queen Mum and the lovely Princess Wee, who are going to do something special just for you.

178
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,800
Starting with...

179
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,840
There was a little bird.

180
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,080
Okay.

181
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,420
There was a little bird.

182
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,320
No bigger than you.

183
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,620
No bigger than a turd sitting on a telephone pole.

184
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,140
He stretched out his neck.

185
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:16,700
Then he shit about a peck as he puckered up his little asshole.

186
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,860
Asshole.

187
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,740
Asshole.

188
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:34,580
As he puckered up his little asshole.

189
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,920
I don't know what I was expecting.

190
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,300
No need to backtrack.

191
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,300


192
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,300


193
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,300


194
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,300


195
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,300


196
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,300


197
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,300


198
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,300


199
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,300


200
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,680
I don't believe it.

201
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,020
Yes.

202
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,040
Brothers and sisters,

203
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,480
the hour of Bob is upon you.

204
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,620
Bob is all upon you.

205
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,320
Bob is the crusty sweat

206
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,040
on the back of your armpits.

207
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,100
Bob is the three-month-long

208
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,240
festering fungus under your little pinky toe.

209
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,360
Bob is the itch on your balls

210
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,500
that won't go away

211
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,800
no matter how much you spray and spray and spray.

212
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,180
Hide your cornicell and won't leave him alone.

213
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,320
Bob is all upon you.

214
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,420
Bob is in places you didn't know you had.

215
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,780
Bob is up in you and make you feel sad,

216
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,900
but sometimes glad

217
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,040
because you know he's with you

218
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,520
no matter where you are stuck.

219
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,520
At your shitty slave conspiracy job

220
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,280
driving a fucking truck,

221
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,740
Bob is there.

222
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,700
He's stuck up your ass

223
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,100
like a fucking crushed red pepper seed

224
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,120
that wouldn't come out.

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,060
That's where Bob is up upon you.

226
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,920
Bob is all up in you.

227
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,360
He's that one fucking hair up your nose

228
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,740
that no matter how much you try to dig for it,

229
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,500
fucking bumblefuck around,

230
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,780
you can't get it out of there.

231
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,960
That's where Bob is.

232
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,620
All up in you.

233
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,780
The power of Bob is up in you.

234
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,180
When you walk into a fucking convenience store

235
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,200
or pass the fucking security checker at Walmart

236
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,720
because everybody knows we want to go steal toilet paper.

237
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,960
You know, nothing better to do.

238
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,860
Can't afford a 98 cent roll,

239
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,940
so you better check my receipt.

240
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,040
Bob is with you.

241
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,940
Don't let those conspiracy pinks knock you down.

242
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,520
Don't conform.

243
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,100
Am I being detained?

244
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,120
Do you want to speak to my lawyer?

245
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,580
Well, Bob off, alright?

246
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,540
You don't need to see my fucking receipt,

247
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,100
you 98-year-old Walmart greeter.

248
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,480
Get with Bob.

249
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,420
You don't need a job.

250
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,080
All you have to do is commit.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,600
$35.

252
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,220
That's all he asks of you.

253
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,140
After that,

254
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,460
the fringe will suck you dry.

255
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,880
But the up front is legit.

256
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,940
It's read the fine print on all your shit.

257
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,860
Because Bob is up upon you.

258
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,520
He's inside.

259
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,380
Bob's the one that made you drink and drive.

260
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,480
Blame Bob.

261
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,000
Fuck,

262
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,360
I forgot.

263
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,580
I forgot.

264
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,160
I forgot about your old lady sweet and fly baby.

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,780
You forgot it was Valentine's Day.

266
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,380
Blame Bob.

267
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,960
Bob's there for you.

268
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,040
Bob is your scapegoat.

269
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,100
He's your wingman.

270
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,520
He's your detonated driver.

271
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,040
Bob is all upon you.

272
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,120
The power of Bob is here.

273
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,200
Can you smell it?

274
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,620
Smell it.

275
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,880
Come here.

276
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,200
I can smell it.

277
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,600
I can fucking smell it over here.

278
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,200
The power of Bob is fear.

279
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,020
The fear that the pinks will win.

280
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,780
And you won't come back next year.

281
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,360
You'll have a fucking excuse.

282
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,920
Oh, my car broke down.

283
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,580
Oh, my dog is in heat.

284
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,980
Oh, my baby daddy,

285
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,980
uh, you know, likes video games too much.

286
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,140
I can't, I can't go.

287
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,900
Don't let the conspiracy win.

288
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,000
Keep Bob with you right on your chin.

289
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,520
Like a warm ball sack.

290
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,400
Always there.

291
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,240
Bob is the one that's in your hair.

292
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,860
Like a fucking tip.

293
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,160
Crawling around.

294
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,900
Bob's the guy making that sound.

295
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,220
Bob's making my fucking ears bleed.

296
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,500
Bob's making me never want to breathe.

297
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,400
Bob's making me have sex with myself.

298
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,600
Bob's the one.

299
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,080
Bob's the one.

300
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,580
Bob's the one.

301
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,940
Bob's the one.

302
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,820
Bob's the one.

303
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:00,680


304
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,200
P

305
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,300
P

306
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,420
Bob's the one.

307
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,600
I'm the one.

308
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,380
Let me tell you that.

309
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,940
Bob is the one.

310
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,040
Bob is the one.

311
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,420
You might ask me.

312
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,380
Bob's the one.

313
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,820
Let me tell you about it.

314
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,500
Bob's the one for all the fun.

315
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:28,980
You see?

316
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,120
Bob's the one who's out with me.

317
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,540
Bob's the wingman.

318
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,900
He is your friend.

319
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,740
Bob will be there with you in the end.

320
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,820
Praise Bob!

321
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,580
Praise Bob!

322
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,640
Praise Bob!

323
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,100
Praise Bob!

324
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,780
Praise Bob!

325
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,300
Drop it down!

326
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,260
Drop it down!

327
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,880
Drop it down!

328
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:44,880


329
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,340
Good job!

330
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,340
D...

331
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,540
D-O-P-P-S

332
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,080
D-O-P-P-S

333
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,040
D-O-P-P-S

334
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,140
D-O-P-P-S

335
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,520
Who is it D-O-P-P-S you might ask?

336
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,660
He's the one that causes women to undress, that's why.

337
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,340
He's always with you.

338
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,880
Keep up alive.

339
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,340
Not that you guys clapped, but can I get a round of applause for Gravity over here?

340
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:41,680
Actually, DJ Gravity, you are the bellybutton fuzz of J.R. Bob Dobbs, just so you know.

341
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,540
Some of you are the pimple on Bob's ass.

342
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,440
Some of you are that bit of spinach stuck in Bob's teeth.

343
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:58,280
You are, you are my friends. Some of you are the ever-flowing pre-cone from Bob's dick.

344
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,800
But every one of you is important.

345
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,020
For if it was not for the pre-cone,

346
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,060
for the ever-flowing pre-cone of Bob's dick,

347
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,500
the universe may not exist.

348
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,540
If it wasn't for the bellybutton lint of Bob Dobbs,

349
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,860
the clouds may not form.

350
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,360
If it wasn't for that pinky nail of Bob Dobbs, how would he have signed that contract?

351
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,980
If it wasn't for those fingernails, how would he have been able to scratch the backs of those exes

352
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,160
in the middle of trying to gain, to gain that contract,

353
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,020
to save your life?

354
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,200
To save your souls.

355
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,120
To make sure that when the world ends, brothers and sisters,

356
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,360
when that world ends, that you, you, every one of you will be saved and this planet will be burned.

357
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,660
So remember, even the asshole of J.R. Bob Dobbs is important.

358
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,800
Every little bit of him is important.

359
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,860
And you need to give, brothers and sisters, give out of your soul.

360
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,120
Make sure that every inch of Bob,

361
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,940
make sure that even the eyebrow hairs of Bob,

362
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:02,320
make sure that all of them, all of them are truly fulfilled and truly have that energy to continue on every day.

363
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,560
Now, brothers and sisters, I can see that you are listening and I'm glad to hear it,

364
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,360
so let's see if we can get you to participate a little bit.

365
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,200
So, one of the things we need,

366
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,940
one of the things we need, brothers and sisters,

367
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,820
we need some energy, we need that slack energy.

368
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,780
We need to feel it. We need to feel it in everywhere.

369
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,140
I need to feel it in my bones.

370
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,420
You need to feel it in your bones.

371
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,440
You need to be able to feel that slack in your penis.

372
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,920
You need to be able to feel that slack in your big toe.

373
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,140
I want to be able to hear Connie squirting from the slack that you guys have given off.

374
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,220
So, brothers and sisters,

375
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,060
can I get a praise, Bob?

376
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,800
Praise Bob!

377
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,160
Brothers and sisters, that is on the right track

378
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,340
and we are doing really good and I'm really proud of you.

379
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,480
You are giving out your slack and I appreciate it.

380
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,420
But let's give it one more try, alright?

381
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,920
Alright? Can I hear a praise, Bob?

382
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,920
Praise Bob!

383
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,700
Hallelujah.

384
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,380
I'm feeling the slack flowing

385
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,520
and I can feel the energies moving upon this stage

386
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,300
and here shortly, once we get everybody down,

387
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,540
we're going to get together.

388
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,440
We're going to blow your minds with slack tunes,

389
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,080
true doctor music, the multi-fisted tales of Connie.

390
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,620
You are still, once again, welcome to come up here

391
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,640
and rant and share your slack with us,

392
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,420
brothers and sisters.

393
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,940
You may have something on your chest.

394
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,500
You may have something on your ass.

395
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,260
I don't care.

396
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,360
You can come up here and you can share with your brethren.

397
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,960
If you have something to say, head on up here now

398
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,500
and share with us,

399
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,000
share with us the feeling in your heart

400
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,080
and what you feel.

401
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
What you need to tell us about Bob Dobbs,

402
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,860
your personal savior.

403
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,080
Raspi,

404
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,120
oh,

405
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,320
Raspi,

406
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,740
if the hair

407
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,840
on your head

408
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,680
is a bright,

409
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,560
curly red,

410
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,920
then what color

411
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,300
would you like

412
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


413
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,300


414
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,420
to put the hair

415
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,840
on your

416
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,620
Raspi?

417
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,400
Raspi,

418
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,860
if the hair

419
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,220
on your hair

420
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,580
is a bright, curly red,

421
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:24,760
then what color would you like

422
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:24,760


423
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,900
on your Raspi?

424
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,880
Raspi,

425
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:27,880


426
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,360
on your Raspi

427
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,640
That's pretty good for 80 fucking 7.

428
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,460
Everybody give her a round of applause.

429
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,580
80 fucking 7.

430
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,240
I feel sorry for whoever is following that.

431
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,100
So basically this is Andrew the Impaled.

432
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,500
He's the world's biggest subgenius asshole.

433
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,280
He's a motherfucker.

434
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,340
He's a real dickhead.

435
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,120
And you guys are unfortunate enough to suffer through his shit.

436
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:14,220
So without further ado, yada, yada, yada, let's welcome Andrew the Impaled.

437
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,260
He's going to play music.

438
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,420
Thank you, Pisces, for that glowing.

439
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,220
And thank you, Andrew.

440
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,060
That was a wholly accurate portrayal of yours truly.

441
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,620
All right.

442
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,160
So if there was a song that you wanted to hear tonight that you've heard me play before, well, I'm sorry.

443
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,280
I'm probably not going to play it.

444
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:34,900
Yeah.

445
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,920
Because you've got to deal with this.

446
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,540
And see, that would be enjoyable.

447
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,240
And that's not what this is about.

448
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,940
This is about you suffering.

449
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,920
I come out here every fucking year, just about nowadays.

450
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,220
And I'm not going to play this.

451
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,200
And I suffer a lot.

452
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,580
And I know you appreciate it.

453
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:02,340
But I don't think you really understand exactly what that entails.

454
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,080
So you're going to suffer now.

455
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,520
.

456
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,400
They say reconcile with the wife.

457
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,240
I say fuck it.

458
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,440
They say fix the holes in your life.

459
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,400
I say fuck it.

460
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,420
.

461
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,080
Might seem I'm leaving in a rush.

462
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,780
But a man can only take so much.

463
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,940
So I grabbed just some of my stuff.

464
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,040
And I said fuck it.

465
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:24,720
.

466
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,560
I said fuck it.

467
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,280
.

468
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:26,940
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.

469
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:27,660
.

470
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,620
I said fuck it.

471
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,080
.

472
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,100
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.

473
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,380
.

474
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,500
And if you don't agree, my friend, don't make no difference in the end.

475
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,580
Because in the end, all I have to say is fuck it.

476
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,440
.

477
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,380
They say get to work on time.

478
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,140
I say fuck it.

479
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,800
.

480
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,360
They say write a clever rhyme.

481
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,320
I say fuck it.

482
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,140
.

483
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,960
Because here's one thing that I've observed around some words.

484
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,400
Don't take it too seriously.

485
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,400


486
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,400


487
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,400


488
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,760
It's not much nerve.

489
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
And it might sound quite absurd.

490
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,860
But I say fuck it.

491
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,660
.

492
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,440
I say fuck it.

493
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,380
.

494
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,800
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.

495
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:54,960
.

496
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,500
I say fuck it.

497
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:55,940
.

498
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,940
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.

499
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,260
.

500
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,780
And I don't care if I lose my job.

501
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,320
I don't care if I become a slob.

502
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,560
My conscience has been robbed.

503
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,500
And I say fuck it.

504
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,320
.

505
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,760
Oh, now we're going to fuck it in this key.

506
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,080
.

507
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,600
They say you got to pay your bills.

508
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,480
I say fuck it.

509
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:14,860
.

510
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,780
They say you can't be drinking swill.

511
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,700
I say fuck it.

512
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,120
.

513
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,020
Because if I could afford better than swill, I'd probably be able to pay my bills.

514
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,120
But then again, I might just say fuck it.

515
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:24,860
.

516
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,680
I say fuck it.

517
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,440
.

518
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,060
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.

519
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:27,740
.

520
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,780
I say fuck it.

521
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,160
.

522
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,140
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.

523
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,560
.

524
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,480
And if you got a better way, go tell me on some other day.

525
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,760
Because on this day, all I have to say is fuck it.

526
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,160
.

527
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,740
They say love your enemies.

528
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,040
.

529
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,260
I say fuck that.

530
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,220
.

531
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,080
.

532
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,380
They say try to keep the peace.

533
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,380


534
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,040
.

535
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,200
I say fuck that.

536
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,480
.

537
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:53,880
Too hard.

538
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,280
.

539
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:01,340
Because I got to tell you girls and boys, this angry man's going to make some noise.

540
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:02,940
.

541
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,160
And it truly is a joy to say fuck it.

542
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:06,880
.

543
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,760
Now let's go back.

544
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:12,800
.

545
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,120
They say watch what you eat.

546
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,240
.

547
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,000
I say fuck it.

548
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,500
.

549
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,380
Put the lid down.

550
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


551
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


552
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


553
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


554
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


555
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


556
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


557
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


558
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


559
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


560
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


561
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


562
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


563
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,380


564
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,080
Put the lid down on the seat.

565
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,300
.

566
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,980
I say fuck it.

567
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,360
.

568
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,520
Because I'm going to live just how I do.

569
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:22,660
.

570
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,080
I don't need no advice from you.

571
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,240
.

572
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,340
Because when I hear advice, I say fuck it.

573
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:26,980
.

574
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,840
I say fuck it.

575
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:28,500
.

576
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,140
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.

577
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,260
.

578
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:30,940
I say fuck it.

579
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,140
.

580
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,240
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.

581
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,640
.

582
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,200
And if you think my song is crude or you're put off by my attitude, there's one thing

583
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,760
you can do and that is suck it.

584
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:39,660
.

585
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:39,660


586
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,620
They say compose an end to this song.

587
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:45,780
.

588
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,500
I say fuck it.

589
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:46,740
.

590
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,060
.

591
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,060


592
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,260
Fuck it.

593
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,560
.

594
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:52,560


595
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:52,720
Fuck it.

596
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,240
.

597
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,900
Hey father, could you unhook the phone that's plugged in over there behind you.

598
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,040
Not behind you, behind you.

599
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,680
The other behind.

600
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,980
Towards the wall, towards the wall, there's a phone there plugged in over there.

601
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,660
Could you grab that?

602
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,720
Alright, uh.

603
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:12,220
I should probably give a little bit of background information on that last song in case some

604
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,720
of you are wondering.

605
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,440
.

606
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:13,460
.

607
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,160
Ah-hah.

608
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,160


609
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,580
I'll probably do it, but I'll do it all over.

610
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:16,580


611
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:16,640
All right, thank you, I'll do it.

612
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:16,660
.

613
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,820
She said she'd always love me

614
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,680
As long as life goes on

615
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,580
She said she'd keep hold of me

616
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,260
Turns out she was wrong

617
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,140
She called me her one and only

618
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,720
In my ear she'd softly sigh

619
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,680
That I'd never again be lonely

620
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,520
That was just a lie

621
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,160
I guess I've been had

622
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,060
I guess I've been had

623
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,860
And if it wasn't for the cash I spent

624
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,260
Fixing up her car, well

625
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,060
I wouldn't feel so bad

626
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,220
I never saw it coming

627
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,120
Didn't realize we were near the end

628
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,000
And that I would soon be slumming

629
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,540
Even though I just paid the rent

630
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,520
Yeah, I thought I made all the right moves

631
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,820
And that things between us were cool

632
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,820
Yeah, I thought I might get some good news

633
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,400
Instead, I got schooled

634
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,720
I guess I've been had

635
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,560
I guess I've been had

636
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,480
And if it wasn't for the time I wasted

637
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,900
Cleaning her garage, well

638
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,680
I wouldn't feel so bad

639
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,780
That ain't no euphemism either

640
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,380
We never did fight

641
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,780
We always got along

642
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,660
We'd rock and roll

643
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,160
All night

644
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,820
Oh yeah, our lovin' was strong

645
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,080
We made a good team

646
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,540
At least that's so I thought

647
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,100
But then in key sense of perception

648
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,500
It's something I ain't got

649
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:52,920
Right?

650
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,720
That's fucked up

651
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,420
That shit's called thrash

652
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,640
That should suck

653
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:43,640


654
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,540
Turns out that was something, and that something was the end.

655
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,980
I guess I've been had.

656
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,680
I guess I've been had.

657
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,200
And if it wasn't for the fact he was my roommate back in school, well, I wouldn't feel so bad.

658
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,940
I guess I've been had.

659
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,600
I guess I've been had.

660
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,180
And if it wasn't for the fact I could have been with Cheryl Moore,

661
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,960
if it wasn't for the fact I just installed a brand new floor,

662
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,500
if it wasn't for the fact she stood there grinning at the door, well, I wouldn't feel so,

663
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,560
I wouldn't feel so,

664
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,500
I wouldn't feel so bad.

665
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,820
I wouldn't feel so bad.

666
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,800
I wouldn't feel so bad.

667
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,540
It's a great deal that Bob provides us that the minute you pay your registration fee,

668
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,320
which, by the way, registration opens at noon and is open until about 4 o'clock.

669
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:57,980
The minute you pay your registration fee, you get free unlimited fuckery.

670
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,960
It is a free add-on.

671
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,940
It's like free coffee in my cup, right?

672
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,940
Yes, it's like free refills, except it's free refills of fuckery, ladies and gentlemen.

673
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,140
This is a really important deal.

674
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,780
I hope you learn to take advantage of it.

675
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,100
And I see another question from the class.

676
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,380
Yes, I forgot to poop during the allotted time frame.

677
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,100
Will I get a chance to do so later?

678
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,100
Good question.

679
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,200
If you did not poop on the scheduled poop time, that's going to be a little difficult.

680
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,680
You were supposed to poop in that time frame.

681
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,480
Now, here's the thing is that you can ask for a hall pass,

682
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:39,080
and if your particular instructor at the time in that particular class is willing,

683
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,640
you can get a hall pass.

684
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,420
And you can poop.

685
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,920
Also, if you are in a particular part of your camp,

686
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,040
you will have to request if you can poop at that time.

687
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,500
The camp or party you're at will take a vote and decide if you're allowed to poop.

688
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,200
So that's how you handle if you did not poop in the allotted time.

689
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,080
Now, there is an exception.

690
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,340
We do allow for fropping and drinking at any point in time

691
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,160
because those are pretty much essential for survival the next day,

692
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,760
just so you know.

693
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,300
But food and poop are sort of on a limited schedule.

694
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,640
So if you're not allowed to poop at that time,

695
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,120
you can ask your camp mates or party mates if you are allowed to go poop at that time.

696
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,660
I will admit there are some camps that have a really lenient open pooping rule.

697
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,180
Make sure you ask before you poop and make sure that that does apply to that camp.

698
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,320
Pooping is for the weak!

699
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,500
My poop is strong!

700
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,660
Well, I can't stop myself.

701
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,880
But he is a member of the lady of, what is it, perpetual constipation,

702
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,480
which explains a lot about Finchuli.

703
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,380
I'm sorry.

704
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,040
Saturday the fourth, which is the last day before the end of the world,

705
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,020
we will have the live hour of slack, as expected.

706
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,920
At 3 p.m. we will baptize you.

707
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,460
If you have not been baptized, do you understand there is a slight risk in the baptism procedure?

708
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:01,100
It does remove all of your sins, so you have a clean slate to sin with.

709
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:08,080
However, for some people, the sudden removal of that much sin can cause a slight bit of discomfort.

710
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,040
So...

711
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
Be prepared for that.

712
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,660
So, I have done my job there to remind you guys of everything that's going on.

713
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,280
Don't ask me, because you should have picked up your fucking schedule.

714
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,520
That's why we played them.

715
00:34:46,280 --> 00:35:00,480
And I was a lucky charm correctly.

716
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,500
The stereotype of stowing şam кл scissors off lye is wrong.

717
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:00,500


718
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:00,520
He stashed the second bottle of a hem lively sound.

719
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:00,520


720
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,820
What canutally describe the importantness of…

721
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,360
It'sarnya!

722
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,500

Therý penarş.

725
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,860
Go like this

726
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,960
Dance, go like that

727
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,040
Do the hairball

728
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,260
Do the hairball

729
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,440
Do the hairball

730
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,460
Do the hairball

731
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,520
Do the hairball

732
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,380
Do the hairball

733
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,000
Hurry up, you're going to the gas station

734
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,380
Do the hairball

735
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:59,640
Do the hairball

736
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,900
Do the hairball

737
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,980
Do the hairball

738
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,800
Do the hairball

739
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,620
Do the hairball

740
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,080
Do the hairball

741
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,320
Do the hairball

742
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,640
Do the hairball

743
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,840
There's your little hoppin'

744
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,380
There's your savin',

745
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:13,780
There's your savin'

746
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,420
You do the rememberin'.

747
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,360
Woo!

748
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,760
Make it look like you just bit into a lemon.

749
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,720
Use your index finger and stick it in the ground.

750
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,000
And then you rotate.

751
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,340
To the hairball.

752
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,360
To the hairball.

753
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,460
To the hairball.

754
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,520
To the hairball.

755
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,520
To the hairball.

756
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,520
To the hairball.

757
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,560
To the hairball.

758
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,460
I'm tired of your bullshit, motherfucker.

759
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,620
Give me one word, motherfucker.

760
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,660
I'm tired of your bullshit, motherfucker.

761
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
This is the end, motherfucker.

762
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,020
I'm tired of your bullshit.

763
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,140
Think you're gonna get hit.

764
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,120
With all of your bullshit.

765
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
How can we stand it?

766
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,540
Bob's gonna make you pay.

767
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,640
Come in next day.

768
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,840
Bob's gonna make you pay.

769
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,800
Come in next day.

770
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,100
I'm the Gaspard, motherfucker.

771
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,580
I'm the Gaspard, motherfucker.

772
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,960
I'm sick and tired of your bullshit.

773
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:49,960


774
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:49,960


775
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,220
I'm sick and tired of your bullshit.

776
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm sick and tired of your bullshit.

777
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,560
I'm sick and tired and sick and tired of your bullshit.

778
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,060
Hold on for a second here.

779
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:00,880
I told you that I've been crazy.

780
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,540
I said you can't have him.

781
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:02,540


782
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:02,540


783
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,780
Don't tell me he didn't hear me.

784
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:03,780


785
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,460
Bob's gonna make you pay

786
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,580
Bob's gonna make you pay

787
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:09,580


788
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,360
Hot in the shadows and tail tails

789
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,380
Your lips are flapping

790
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,200
Like windy sails

791
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,360
Hot in the shadows and tail tails

792
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,460
Lips are flapping

793
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,980
Like windy sails

794
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,960
Windy sails

795
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,560
Hot in the shadows and tail tails

796
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,960
Bob's gonna make you pay

797
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,160
Bob's gonna make you pay

798
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,320
Bob's gonna make you pay

799
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,400
Bob's gonna make you pay

800
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,340
Mom's gonna make it pay

801
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,380
Come in next day

802
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,560
Mom's gonna make it pay

803
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,340
Come in next day

804
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,020
Woo

805
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,360
Mom's gonna make it pay

806
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,400
Mom's gonna make it pay

807
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:04,540
Yeah!

808
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,100
You better run, boy!

809
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:51,940
You better run, boy!

810
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,660
Back when Bob was in the band and Ronald Reagan,

811
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,180
the band was called the Shitty Beatles.

812
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,680
And, uh,

813
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,600
real-

814
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,320
movie fans

815
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,000
among you

816
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,640
may remember in the movie

817
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,700
Wayne's World,

818
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,440
they're going into a club

819
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,580
and these guys in

820
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,000
brown smeared

821
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,980
insect suits

822
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,640
are leaving the club.

823
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,800
And, uh,

824
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,860
Wayne says, uh,

825
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,280
Uh, is that-

826
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,560
that's the Shitty Beatles?

827
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,840
How were they?

828
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,280
Because they were terrible.

829
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,240
So, it's not just a clever name.

830
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,920
So, even though

831
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,760
we're pretty bad,

832
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,080
the fake name of this band got mentioned

833
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,000
in Wayne's World.

834
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,480
And they have actors playing the Shitty Beatles.

835
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,600
I think I heard somewhere that there is a real band

836
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,040
called- called the Shitty Beatles now.

837
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,980
They've ripped us off.

838
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,860
But, we're used to that.

839
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,720
There's always some new

840
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,180
fake, uh, subgenius rip-off coming out.

841
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,860
Church of Dawn.

842
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,520
Flying Spaghetti Monster.

843
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,760
Christianity.

844
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,360
They ripped us off.

845
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,200
Zoroastrian.

846
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,220
The Rosicrucians.

847
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,020
They stole all that stuff from us.

848
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,720
I just forgot my next line.

849
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,980
I better go look at the script.

850
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,440
Flip the anus of a moon in hell

851
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,060
Flip the anus of a moon in hell

852
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:40,120
Split a Scientologist wide open today

853
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,340
Split all foolish demon possessed

854
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,220
Christians today

855
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,560
What about that other one?

856
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,640
That one song again with that one guy?

857
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,980
Split the anus of a moon in hell

858
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,800
Split the anus of a moon in hell

859
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,180
Split the anus of a moon in hell

860
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,980
Split the anus of a moon in hell

861
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,580
Split a Scientologist wide open today

862
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:18,420
Split all foolish demon possessed Christians today

863
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,680
See we still got it, Dr. Jones.

864
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,800
We got it. We still got it.

865
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,300
I remembered that one.

866
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,620
You know, even though I haven't sold it,

867
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,080
it's something.

868
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,320
It's already one of my years.

869
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:29,720
Yeah.

870
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,040
I can't admit those high notes like I used to.

871
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,020
This must be how the devos feel.

872
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,140
They have to play the songs just as fast as they used to, but they can only move half as fast.

873
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,880
Okay, Princess We is here.

874
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,320
We already did the first Princess We song.

875
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,880
Okay, that one's in the can.

876
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,260
Okay, we did My Place is on Fire.

877
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:02,300
You're going into the Word of God.

878
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,660
You're sinking in.

879
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,860
It's like quicksand.

880
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:17,080
It's pulling you deeper and deeper down, down, down, down, into the Word of God.

881
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,480
Hey, you know, I think we've already done the first side of the first Lotan album.

882
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,240
Oh, there's one called I Can't Believe It.

883
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,360
I hate those assholes. I don't remember that one.

884
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,020
I love those assholes.

885
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,900
Some people do love assholes.

886
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,940
I'd like to know, is there anybody here tonight that really loves an asshole?

887
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,940
I mean, an asshole, but first.

888
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,940
I mean, maybe a particular asshole you haven't affected before.

889
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,780
I'm not talking about that kind of situation.

890
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,540
I'm an asshole.

891
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,080
More or less.

892
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,560
I'm an asshole.

893
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:48,180


894
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,660
I'm an asshole.

895
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,900
What an asshole.

896
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,900
Love me.

897
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,580
Love me.

898
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,240
Love me.

899
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:55,660
Love me.

900
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,360
Love the assholes.

901
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,100
Love the assholes.

902
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,460
Would you love the assholes?

903
00:45:59,460 --> 00:45:59,760
You know, that's really unique.

904
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,120
A lot of us have forgotten.

905
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,460
Can't you love an asshole?

906
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,620
We've forgotten about the rest of minorities, and people forget about the poor asshole.

907
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:11,880
Hey, tomorrow's the pancake breakfast, and we're bringing scrapple in that's made of assholes.

908
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,860
I love assholes.

909
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,940
Do we have that?

910
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,460
No, seriously.

911
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:22,880
I did bring scrapple, and we have to eat some asshole in before we eat.

912
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,120
I feel like you're not a hittler, that's good.

913
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,240
What is that thing doing?

914
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,380
You have babies with that thing?

915
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,060
Yeah.

916
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,160
That's the mother of my children.

917
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,040
Or one of them, anyway.

918
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,300
That's the mother of my butt baby.

919
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,060
Oh!

920
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,520
Old butt baby.

921
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:55,240
One time, my toilet broke, and I told my son, I said, Sandy, you're going to have to

922
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:55,240


923
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:55,240


924
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:55,240


925
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,320
go to the bathroom and be careful, because some of your little brown brothers are still

926
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:00,700
in there.

927
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
He got so mad at me.

928
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:03,580
Oh, man.

929
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,960
I hate that.

930
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:07,100
Yeah, your little brown brothers.

931
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:07,960
That's what I don't call them.

932
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,660
Little brown brother, how I love thee.

933
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,080
That's the problem, they're still born.

934
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,440
Yeah, it's sad.

935
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,300
It's not funny.

936
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:15,880
That's not funny.

937
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:16,220
It's really sad.

938
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:16,800
Yeah.

939
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:24,340
As if it wasn't clear enough from context, all of this Hour of Slack episode was recorded

940
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,220
live at the New York Times.

941
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:25,220


942
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:25,220


943
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:25,220


944
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,660
The 18X Day Drill last July.

945
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:35,400
That last mess we just heard was Doctors for Wotan, with myself and Dr. Philo Drummond reunited

946
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:42,360
from our old 1980s band, only this time with new wives, which makes a lot of difference.

947
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:50,140
That was Reverend Chaosmic Bobcat you heard singing, and earlier in the show with her

948
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,800
tune Fuckery Doo-Dah.

949
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,200
I think the acts were...

950
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,660
I don't know if you were introduced or explained, but I should mention that most of the rockin'

951
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:05,300
type music you heard was the Fuck Peas Band, also known as Six-Fisted Tales of Connie,

952
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:12,260
with Reverend Angry Larry on the most prominent guitar and also singing, as it were, on Do

953
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,320
the Hairball.

954
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:20,400
We also heard Priestess Pisces do quite a bit of singing and ranting, all of it basically

955
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,360
off the top of her head, incidentally.

956
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,180
Priestess Pisces basically produces songs.

957
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,780
She's a great singer, and she's been a great songwriter since the late 18X Day, and organizes

958
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:33,080
everything that can be organized, emcees the shows on stage, and rants and sings her subgenius

959
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,200
Foo head off.

960
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:41,760
Other musicians in the Fuck Peas Band include Bishop Stick, Reverend Rock God, Reverend

961
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,500
Hazel of the Windmills, Reverend Fid Chooly, Trademark Gee from Evolution Control Committee,

962
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,680
Reverend Sinfaltimus X.

963
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:55,180
Mortis, Reverend Chovvur, Reverend Aidy, Lord Ferg, Reverend R.T.

964
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:55,180


965
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:55,180


966
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:55,180


967
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,820
Sud Spishaw, Dr. Philo Drummond,

968
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,220
and DJ Gravity, and probably a couple of other people

969
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,660
I'm leaving out. We'll end with

970
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,240
Pisces and Baby Bear doing the audience hate song,

971
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,500
but first, Reverend Sinfaltmus

972
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,920
Ex Mortis will deliver his

973
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,040
lilting rendition of his song

974
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,660
Kill the Pinks.

975
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,800
And I must emphasize this, kids,

976
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,080
it's meant strictly as a metaphorical

977
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,140
mood piece, and not

978
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,640
instructions. Price bomb.

979
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,380
guitar solo

980
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,320
Run, baby, run!

981
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:45,000
guitar solo

982
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,300
Only one thing I wanna do now

983
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,680
When I grow up, kids, I used to travel to you

984
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:06,020
Five, six, seven, eight, yeah

985
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,260
So the pinks, oh, the pinks, oh, flop down!

986
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,980
Kill the Pinks!

987
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,760
Kill the Pinks!

988
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,520
Kill them all!

989
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,600
Kill the Pinks!

990
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,280
Kill the Pinks!

991
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,040
Kill them all!

992
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,400
And let's bounce on about!

993
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,920
guitar solo

994
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,520
I'm gonna weep and end with myself

995
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,660
I go for Jack off just for a pop

996
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,640
guitar solo

997
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,580
I'm gonna weep and end with myself

998
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,560
You know where I'll be

999
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,040
You know where I am!

1000
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,260
I'm a pink killer!

1001
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:15,680
Yeah!

1002
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,060
I'm a pink killer!

1003
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,620
Fucking yeah!

1004
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:21,800


1005
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,440
Like this, here they come

1006
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,180
Yeah!

1007
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,120
All the little pink boys on the run

1008
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah!

1009
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,360
Nobody takes a show

1010
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,860
Nothing they can do

1011
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,780
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1012
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,280
Let's shake it now!

1013
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,540
It's like war, yeah!

1014
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,200
Yeah!

1015
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,100
Kill the Pinks!

1016
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,200
That's what they call me!

1017
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,260
Yeah!

1018
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,280
Cry now for Ryan Hill!!

1019
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:53,280


1020
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,160
I got the Jack from this olí tree!

1021
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,480
Summing up it's nothing better than...

1022
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,160
Maybe we have theext barto for Italian bros

1023
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:07,160


1024
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,200
But, I love your sideshrant!

1025
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,520

00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:17,040

1027
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,180
They don't say shit!

1028
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,680
Oh

1029
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,540
Oh

00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,000
Oh

00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,240
Oh

00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,300
Oh

Oh

1037
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,160
Oh

00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:09,960
Oh

00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:10,920
Oh

1043
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,280
Oh

1044
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:11,420
Oh

1045
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:11,420


1046
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,860
Round of applause for

1047
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,980
SimphilonymousXMartist with his

1048
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,880

1049
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,980
favorite, Kill the Pinks.

1050
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,040
It's the turn your back on the audience song.

1051
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,320
I would do that all night.

1052
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,860
Alright, um

1053
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,040
So this song is about how we hate

00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,460
the audience cause you don't clap.

1055
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,040
Happy fourth!

1056
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,200
It's the fuck the audience song.

1057
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,380

I'm kind of out of breath now

1083
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,560
Screaming is really hard

1084
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,960
But I'm going to keep doing it

1085
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,940

It's not about you

1089
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:08,000
It's about us

1090
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,780
It's about us

1091
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,840
You hurt the audience

1092
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:16,240
You don't even understand

1093
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,400
Fuck the audience

1094
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,860
Fuck the audience

00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:24,860


1096
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,660
Wait a second

1097
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,040
I can't

1098
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:31,160
I can't

1099
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,160
I can't

1100
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,000

1101
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,860

1103
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:37,480
I can't

1104
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:37,540
I can't

1105
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:37,900
I can't

1106
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:38,180
I can't

1107
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,600
Fuck the audience!

Fuck the audience!

1109
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,620
You better fucking clap when we're done, you fucking dumb shit!

1110
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,700
Get it together! You have one fucking job!

1111
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,760
One job to do!

1112
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,680
And that's to sit on your ass!

1113
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,200
And then fucking clap!

1114
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,600
It's not that hard!

1115
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,100
It's not that hard!

1116
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,220
Fuck you guys!

1117
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:49,400
Fuck you guys!

1118
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,000
Fuck you guys!

1119
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:50,640
Fuck you guys!

1120
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:50,640


1121
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,560
You're all fired!

1122
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:58,260
That's it, boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen.

1123
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,560
You can all go fuck yourselves.

1124
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,400
Next up, Andrew the Impaler!

1125
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:05,720
There it is! It's started!

1126
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,760
The bombs are falling!

1127
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,760
That was the sound of the Panzerschrausers entering the atmosphere.

1128
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:17,580
It's a sonic wheeze kind of noise that they make when they enter.

1129
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,320
It's spelunking.

1130
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,900
They spelunk into the atmosphere,

1131
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,640
buoying us into their craft.

1132
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,720
That's why we need all the blow-up dolls.

1133
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,680
What's going on, Pisces?

1134
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:33,480
Fuck the audience.

1135
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:36,180
Well, yeah, but I mean, aside from that.

1136
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,340
I was like, Baby Bear was looking at me.

1137
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,500
Come up here, Baby Bear!

1138
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,440
That was pretty awesome.

1139
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,660
She screamed in the mic.

1140
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,060
I didn't know she... I couldn't hear her. I could hear you.

1141
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,040
That's all right.

1142
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,460
Maybe it was her, not you.

1143
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,360
No, she was the one screaming.

1144
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,300
You had your backs to the audience. I couldn't tell what...

1145
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:53,940
Yeah, well, you couldn't tell who we were.

1146
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:58,080
Oh, that was the screech. I was wondering how you could be so screechy.

1147
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:58,760
No, that was not me.

1148
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,340
Oh, that was her.

1149
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:00,420
That was Baby Bear.

1150
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,480
I couldn't see you, because you were fucking me.

1151
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,020
Yes.

1152
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:03,880
In the audience.

1153
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,600
How did you fuck me in the audience, Pisces?

1154
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,000
Because I'm magic.

1155
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,880
Oh, that's right. I read that on the internet.

1156
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,600
Fuck these!

1157
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:21,920
You've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1158
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:30,480
For free information, write to P.O. Box 181416.

1159
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:38,600

1160
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:44,820
Or see www.subgenius.com.

1161
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,940
Praise Bob!

1162
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,560
But sire, there is no more money.

1163
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,000
We gotta get some money.

1164
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,240
That dirty purgish hark of backflag we wantin'

1165
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,520
Philip Bunker Burton, Perkaluma Burton, Dutton Bush tonight.

1166
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,200
We're gonna get some money.

1167
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:04,840
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1168
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:11,060
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on goin' for another couple of months.

1169
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,160
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1170
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:23,180
But if you truly love Bob, and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1171
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:28,700
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page.

1172
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,620
Or the catalog store pages.

1173
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,020
And help out financially as best you can.

1174
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,360
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty.

1175
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:42,020
And we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1176
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,940
But some of you still have jobs.

1177
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,300
Even five bucks makes a big difference.

1178
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,860
Even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1179
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,240
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1180
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,660
All we're sayin' is that...

1181
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:03,040
Slow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1182
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,840
We also take checks and money orders to...

1183
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,520
Subgenius Foundation.

1184
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:20,980
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1185
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:26,240
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1186
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:35,660
If youact like you think your night in the ocean takes forever long.

1187
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:42,580
Like this cool chick that gets through your nose

1188
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:55,780
