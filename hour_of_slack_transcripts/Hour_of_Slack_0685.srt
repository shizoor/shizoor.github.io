1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Welcome to the maggot in the cheese.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,820
The cheese is the universe.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,060
Welcome.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,080
Welcome.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,160
Oh, it's quiet.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,960
A quiet start.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,740
It'll get real noisy, though, any minute.

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,400
Did you stand in line today?

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,100
Did you let someone know you care today?

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,540
For financial aid, hang up now.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,800
If you were satisfied with the service, press 2.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,280
If you were dissatisfied, goodbye.

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,860
But all my efforts have now resulted in real progress.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,340
We'll see the important information that is used to make decisions about you

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,660
and review what your report says about you at no charge.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,640
All you'll have to do then is to see that they react to the call,

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,780
when you put the call on.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,120
If you choose to remain on the line to commit the class to be registered at the end of the call, press 4.

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,440
What would you advise me to do to improve my communication skills?

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,700
Press 5, now.

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,320
Press 9, now.

22
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,800
Press 1, now.

23
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,260
Press 2, now.

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,400
Press 6, 6, 6, now, now, now.

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,660
That's how long it takes, but we gotta be out here at 4 o'clock and we can't wait 15 years.

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,480
Get out of my...

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,720
To use the system...

28
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,380
Please hang up and bypass instruction, now.

29
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,720
Is there any general information I can help you with at this time?

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,600
Thank you for your comments. We value your opinion.

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,480
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge!

32
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,860
Hosea 516.

33
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,880
I can't believe anybody's waited until 1998 to say goodbye to the Church of the Subgenius.

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,200
I'll tell you when it ended. It ended in 1984,

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,260
when Bob was shot by puzzling evidence, he did not come back alive.

36
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,540
He actually died dripping pus out of his wounds and a lauded haze.

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,080
I mean, the whole church has been a scam ever since.

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,680
They replaced him with this guy named Martin Bridger.

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,000
Remember that name.

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,220
He was just some, like, guy who sell water filtration systems.

41
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,580
He doesn't even look that much like Bob, because if you see the photos before and after, I mean, it's really obvious.

42
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,760
And the thing, I mean, it's been a scam ever since.

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,100
I mean, if you look at the...

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,940
early archives of the church, it's really obvious that Ivan Stang was actually a black man.

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,920
So I don't even know who this guy is that's going around pretending to be Ivan Stang.

46
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,840
So the fake Bob and the fake Ivan aren't gonna save anybody.

47
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,980
When the saucers come, you better not even be on this planet, or it's just gonna be all over.

48
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,980
My, that fudge smells yummy.

49
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,440
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,300
The Subgenius.

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,680
Swag!

52
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,520
We must get off, we must get off, we must get off this place.

53
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,720
We must leave, we must get off, we must get off.

54
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,580
Now who gonna talk for you on Earth?

55
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,580
Who gonna say the word?

56
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,060
Who gonna pronounce the final epithet that's gonna take you on fire this world?

57
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,920
Who gonna speak for you?

58
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,140
Who gonna talk for Earth?

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,420
We know who speaks for the nation.

60
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,220
But who speaks for the planet?

61
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,800
Who speaks for Earth?

62
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,280
Cold billions of steel.

63
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Umbres without hearts.

64
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,420
Human beings without minds.

65
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,780
A world of pain.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,940
No luxury.

67
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,060
No comfort.

68
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,220
No delight.

69
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,240
Suffering at every corner.

70
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,080
Enjoy yourself.

71
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,100
Enjoy yourself.

72
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:52,320
We must get off, we must get off, we must get off this place.

73
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,920
Earth, face, Earth, face.

74
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,980
We must get off and we can, friends, because XX Day is coming up.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,100
It's only six weeks from whence I speaketh and it's...

76
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,960
Friends, I'm so ready for that.

77
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,640
I'm so tired of war on Earth.

78
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,580
Of war on Earth and this Earth is full of war.

79
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,380
I'm ready to make war on it.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,080
War on show.

81
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,640
War on show.

82
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:24,640


83
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,180
Versus science.

84
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,700
War versus God.

85
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,300
And we've got all of that coming out.

86
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,920
The kazoo, friends.

87
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,740
Pardon me if I sound blase about the war and everything, but we're leaving.

88
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,080
And I'd rather be having war in space, wouldn't you?

89
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,200
War on show.

90
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,200
We've only had a format for this show for three or four episodes now.

91
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:53,600
And I've...

92
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,700
Man.

93
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,120
To tell the truth, I've already forgotten what it was.

94
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:57,880
The...

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,480
God, this music is great.

96
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,280
This is amorphous.

97
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,500
Let's just forget the show.

98
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,240
I don't mean to be, uh...

99
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,220
I...

100
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:30,300
Finally.

101
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,180
Yep.

102
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,560
It...

103
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:34,560


104
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:34,560


105
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:34,700


106
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,540
I am certainly a traitor.

107
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,220
And I...

108
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,780
And I...

109
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,960
And I'm...

110
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,260
I am certainly a traitor.

111
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:09,420
Oh, friends, this is the kind of music that makes me want to say P.O. Box 1403,

112
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,340
but I won't do that right now, actually.

113
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,480
The amorphous Sterno has been sending me all this wonderful Scandinavian

114
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,200
and otherwise death rock, but we'll just go right back into ESO

115
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,460
as if there had ever been a format.

116
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,860
Yeah, we did, honestly, we did have a format, believe it or not,

117
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,720
for about three shows, and I've forgotten.

118
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,560
The list is lost. Who cares?

119
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,900
I mean, I've forgotten the war already.

120
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,960
The whole idea was to force me to play a good cross-section of whatever,

121
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,980
you know, the kinds of things that had always made the hour of slack great,

122
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,880
rather than just whatever was my favorite obsession that particular show,

123
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,480
which is what I'm going to do again anyway, because who cares?

124
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,500
Man, it's almost X-Day.

125
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,260
But my only question is, should I take a shower first?

126
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,480
Do you care?

127
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,880
I doubt it. I doubt it, and I probably won't.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,680
But seriously, some shows I just want to do nothing but play solid ESO,

129
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,880
because that's what I like.

130
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,140
But where...

131
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,000
It's because we've had some real good tears lately.

132
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,720
I may just do a lot of that.

133
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,580
But we also got this new CD, which I played a little bit of,

134
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,320
that sounds sort of negative land-like, in that it's a...

135
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,100
Well, I should read to you what this guy said here.

136
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,880
The CD is by Pete Martin, really, but it's called Eddie the Rat.

137
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,520
And I can't play it in the background like this ESO music,

138
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,220
because...

139
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,120
It's...

140
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,240
Oh, this is going to be a great show for headphones, friends.

141
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,700
If you're not listening on the Internet, listen in headphones if you can,

142
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,200
because this is a real marvelous...

143
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,260
Here, this guy's description is pretty good.

144
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:14,120
The CD, Eddie the Rat, could best be described as an experimental sound collage

145
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,440
of homemade spring instruments, rebar xylophones,

146
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,920
micro-cassette recorders shoved in the faces of drunk people,

147
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,380
a cast of hundreds over many years.

148
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,360
And that's the part I like about it.

149
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,720
I like the stuff that's obviously taped in the faces of drunk people at parties.

150
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,880
How do you think Church of the Subgenius started?

151
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,480
Paper towel on the human head percussion,

152
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,560
detuned acoustic and electric guitars,

153
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,800
ADAT recordings of frying grease, which we'll come back to in just a second,

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,160
pre-programmed drum machines,

155
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,740
subharmonically mutated keyboards,

156
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,360
pedal steel guitar, helium,

157
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,300
a lizard named Herb,

158
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,600
an eight-ball comic book,

159
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,880
kazoos, brushes on cardboard,

160
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
choose harp, a PhD in psychology,

161
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,740
washboards, rubber ball on rice paper,

162
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,080
drum siren loops,

163
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,840
typewriters,

164
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,780
78 Victrolas,

165
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,160
film projectors,

166
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,140
there's enough here to have a party in Dallas,

167
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,680
one or two angry Korean women,

168
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,140
unidentifiable fortunes,

169
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,200
and a bunch of other things.

170
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,200


171
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,520
but I'm going to go into a little bit of the soundtrack stuff.

172
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,080
Reassembled touch tone operators, pots, pans, little people, Tupperware,

173
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,660
the ongoing construct, purring cats, pouring water,

174
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,940
and plenty of nails on chalkboard-like scraping metal.

175
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,340
Now that just makes my mouth water.

176
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,480
I've read that and I thought,

177
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,740
I'm going to listen to this CD,

178
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,100
and it's great.

179
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,060
And he goes on to say,

180
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,460
it's a nightmare to categorize,

181
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,980
and impossible to market by conventional methods.

182
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,140
It could best be described as the most expensive,

183
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,140


184
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:50,140


185
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,100
most annoying, pretentious, irresponsible,

186
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,140
drivel that my severely damaged hearing could muster.

187
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,600
I'd be interested in your reaction to it,

188
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
any ideas you might have about marketing it,

189
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,800
being new to this whole game myself,

190
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,800
and boy this guy,

191
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,580
boy did he write to the wrong dude.

192
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,720
Because, like him,

193
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,380
we all invented this a long time ago,

194
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,120
and negative land has stuck to it more than anybody,

195
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,600
and does sort of make a kind of a living,

196
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,060
I guess,

197
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,120
in the world of music.

198
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,120


199
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,780
So, I'm going to take this off of it,

200
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,280
but let's go back to it,

201
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,940
because the one thing we can do for this poor bastard,

202
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,740
Pete Martin,

203
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,700
is play his CD,

204
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,300
Eddie the Rat,

205
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,140
to an appreciative audience.

206
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,160
And I think that you subgeniuses,

207
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,260
since you're all like me,

208
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,140
renaissance animators of radio dials,

209
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,840
and computer digits,

210
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,880
scrap paper,

211
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,360
old bottoms of bottles,

212
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,360
and comic books,

213
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,460
and bull dada in general,

214
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,080
could like get off on it, man, right?

215
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,140
This is ESO in the background,

216
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,580
but coming up now,

217
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,540
Eddie the Rat.

218
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,360
Because it's over, so we're through.

219
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,100
This edge from above

220
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,660
is to terminate our love.

221
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,360
Look, Ma, isn't it beautiful?

222
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,260
Oh, thank you.

223
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,680
This is going to be gorgeous for the prom.

224
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,540
Smith party two,

225
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,280
Ray party seven,

226
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,580
come on down to the hostess stand,

227
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,000
it's chow time.

228
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,700
The fact that he came early

229
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,300
made everything worse.

230
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,080
That's mother in the kitchen

231
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,400
filling a bottle with water.

232
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,900
I know this is probably

233
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,960
a completely utopian thing to say,

234
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,880
but people have to be taught

235
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,320
to have their own individual minds.

236
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
They do.

237
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,840
They do.

238
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,020
They do.

239
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,400
They do.

240
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,400
They do.

241
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,740
They do.

242
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,640
They do.

243
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,260
They do.

244
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,820
They do.

245
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,220
What are you doing back there?

246
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,600
Hide, that's all they do,

247
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,920
they hide, they drink beer and they hide.

248
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,740
They do.

249
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,320
They do.

250
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,220
They do.

251
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,220
They do.

252
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,100
They do.

253
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,020
Ready, go...

254
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,480
Ready, go...

255
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:57,820
They do.

256
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,120


257
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,580
They do.

258
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,200
You aren't necessarily the same thing when you're stoned.

259
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,640
Welcome.

260
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,140
Mmmmm...

261
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,540
Mmmmm...

262
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,540
Poof...

263
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:06,500
Thank you.

264
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,340
Thank you.

265
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,640
Thank you.

266
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:36,720
In the year 2001 or 2002, I look out at you and I think how far we have come.

267
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:47,900
The class of 2020, they have never known life without anti-gravity body paint.

268
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,900
They think a car is something you swallow to go somewhere.

269
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,780
They have only known what it is like to pee in one direction.

270
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,480
They don't think of Bruce Willis' acting career, only his political downfall.

271
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,820
Insect-based protein products have been a part of their diet since before conception.

272
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:21,040
They were four years old when the Australian continent was yanked off the face of the earth

273
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,560
and made into the Gibroframian bottle colony.

274
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,560
They think that hole has always been there.

275
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,900
They cannot imagine anyone being able to endure even one second of life

276
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,200
before Gibroframian replacement trademark was invented.

277
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,320
They've probably heard of sleep, but have never seen it practiced.

278
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,200
They have no idea what a wallet is.

279
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,560
They cannot possibly comprehend a bathhouse.

280
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,780
They cannot imagine a bathroom without a 3D-dot Dobbs altar over the toilet.

281
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,840
And if they saw an old water system toilet, they would probably scream.

282
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:19,320
They think sex is something people used to do in libraries involving flashlights and salad oil.

283
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,560
They've never heard what a city sounds like without construction.

284
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:29,560


285
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,080
They fewer arms and ears splitting fnarr-melch background sonic scatter-bongs.

286
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:42,680
And most of them would run and clean you with a blowtorch if they knew that you rode a subway

287
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,460
or a bus even once without a rubber or polymer bobshed body-stocking,

288
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:58,960
and so enclosing this year of 2020 has been the best of times.

289
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,620
the worst of times

290
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,000
and

291
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,700
five thousand

292
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,080
and five years from now

293
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,380
in the year

294
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,960
2525

295
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,060
if

296
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,240
man

297
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,960
is still alive

298
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,520
if woman

299
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,980
can survive

300
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,700
they may

301
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,560
find

302
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,460
this old tape

303
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,080
yeah you know if any of our people

304
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,780
would ever bother to read their own

305
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,640
bibles they might notice that there were

306
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,620
actually numerous provisos

307
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,880
what did Heaven's Gate do

308
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,000
that was so wrong I mean you were very

309
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,440
critical of the Heaven's Gate cult

310
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,380
what did they do that

311
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,400
well for one thing they were just losers

312
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,420
there was only 3900 of them

313
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,340
and there's 39000 of us

314
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:54,840
mhm

315
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,380
um

316
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,480
they seem to think that

317
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
in order to get slack you had to

318
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,640
remove your

319
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,020
uh

320
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
organs of procreation

321
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,400
I don't

322
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,520
want to offend the sensibilities

323
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,600
of any listeners here but I believe those people

324
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,460
were all eunuchs

325
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,780
now we have a lot

326
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,520
of programmers of the

327
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,460
eunuchs computer system

328
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,060
in the Church of the Subgenius but

329
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,560
eunuchs no I mean not if

330
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,320
we can help it

331
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,900
right

332
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,520
I guess my friend Dr. Lake Hume said the big difference between the Heaven's Gate people

333
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,320
and us was

334
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,280
the Heaven's Gate people when they saw the bus coming

335
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,740
they jumped out in the middle of the road into the path of the bus

336
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:44,040
we were happy to sit with our you know counting our change at the bus stop waiting to board

337
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,540
the bus

338
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,380
it's just that it didn't stop for us

339
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,520
and I

340
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:54,460
now personally believe that uh X Day will actually come in 1995

341
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,320
in 1999 I think maybe there was a little mistake on Bob's part or something

342
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,380
you didn't you didn't they say that though the mistake was uh it was 1998 but then it

343
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,820
was 8661

344
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,400
we

345
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,100
did notice on

346
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:12,520
the original memo that was Bob wrote on a bar napkin or something back in the 50s it

347
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:12,860
said

348
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,800
the world ends 7 a.m. July 5th 1998 well

349
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:24,440
we got to looking at it about 7 05 a.m. and we noticed that that the very bottom of the

350
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:30,060
of the memo had apparently been torn off and taped back on again, only somebody taped it

351
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,180
back on upside down.

352
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,020
I see.

353
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:39,880
And it may originally have said 8661 instead of 1998, which would mean we have another

354
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:46,280
6,000 years to wait before justice comes and our $30 is paid off.

355
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,760
But that's just one theory, okay?

356
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:54,940
Now, like the Jehovah's Witnesses probably have some dissension within their ranks, the

357
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:02,400
Solar Temple people and any other suicide UFO cult is going to have a certain amount

358
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,720
of, you know, counting how many angels can dance on the head of a pin and all of that

359
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,820
doctrinal argument.

360
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,520
You know anything about the Concerned Christians?

361
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,300
They're another cult that's taken off.

362
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,180
Nobody knows where they are.

363
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,340
They think they've committed suicide.

364
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,460
Well, who's concerned about them?

365
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,560
You know, you have to remember.

366
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,600
You have to remember the good riddance factor once again.

367
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,160
Okay.

368
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:27,740
Well, there was a great insult delivered by Popes Lilith on the IRC one night.

369
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:33,580
I forget who she was insulting, but she said, she said, you're so lame that your escape

370
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:39,760
vessel will probably look just like your cruddy little apartment in every detail, even down

371
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,160
to the spots on the ceiling.

372
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,120
Pay no attention.

373
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,740
We must get off.

374
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,400
We must get off.

375
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,800
We must get off this place.

376
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,060
As you all know, there is no future.

377
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,240
We have to spoil the land we live in.

378
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,960
First, we will enslave the earth.

379
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,620
And enslave the earth.

380
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,740
Then we will enslave all of its goods.

381
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,960
pirate. Cle extinction.

382
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,760
The escaped ambientean living things.

383
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,460
This isillo.

384
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,220
It's a life electricity facility.

385
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,340
All of its

386
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,340


387
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,400
Sultan Airlines, United States.

388
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,740
I can't infer them.

389
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,820
It's a punishment.

390
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:45,860
We have no unํ Menschen rises.

391
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,900
We have spare rot.

392
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:47,440
Fish

393
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,700
is actually here in this very studio.

394
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,540
And princess, we are gone.

395
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,620
Broadcasting remotely from a distant star.

396
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,500
And that means it cannot be smoked or eaten.

397
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,740
When the beeps come in,

398
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,920
when the beeps come in in prime numbers, people,

399
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,600
get ready.

400
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,720
Pack your bags.

401
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,040
And the Wizard of Oz,

402
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,500
a perfectly good metaphor itself

403
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,360
for her divine journey off-plan.

404
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,260
As an escaped Kansas girl,

405
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,040
I surely can identify with that one.

406
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,900
As a Marin, California TV listing

407
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,880
describes the Wizard of Oz,

408
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,860
trapped in a surreal landscape,

409
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,960
a young girl kills the first woman she meets

410
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,900
and teams up with three complete strangers

411
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,040
that kill again.

412
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,120
Oh, that about says it all for me.

413
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,880
I sure know about that repressed urge to kill, baby.

414
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,140
Oh, yes.

415
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,500
Oh, and do they ever do their part

416
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,580
to engender our righteous rage

417
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,400
in these bitter end times?

418
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,240
Oh, why haven't they learned?

419
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,360
Why is it that they're actually turning the screws on us

420
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,520
as their lives stick away

421
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,020
like granulated turds in an hourglass?

422
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,600
Oh, I can already smell the burning flesh

423
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,180
of a glorious new subgenius dawn.

424
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,420
Oh, I can already smell the burning flesh of a glorious new subgenius dawn.

425
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,300
Oh, baby, it's better than waking up to breakfast.

426
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,280
We're going to be dancing to the rhythm

427
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,540
that their fat makes

428
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,080
as it bops in the flames of a dying world.

429
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,840
Oh, hey, nice beat,

430
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,480
and it's easy to dance to.

431
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,020
Hey, Bob, I'd give it an 86.

432
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,120
Yeah, 86 the whole damn planet.

433
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

434
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,340
So here, have a nice juicy red apple.

435
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,340
Oh, for the trip.

436
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,380
But ooh, watch out for the serpent.

437
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,580
You owe it to yourself not to resist this temptation, honey,

438
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,200
because it may never come around again.

439
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,960
Yeah, you might even be thinking

440
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,060
about skipping the flight out of here,

441
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,020
hiding out deep underground,

442
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,540
and then, after the X's turds have done their thing

443
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,540
and moved on,

444
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,240
yeah, maybe you'll crawl out of the radioactive ash

445
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,400
of this incinerated world.

446
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,400


447
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,900
Yeah, you might even be thinking about

448
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,540
going to the planet and set yourself up

449
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,840
as the king of the ravaged earth.

450
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,900
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

451
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,960
Ooh, and it's going to be serious kicks for you then,

452
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,660
isn't it?

453
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,620
Yeah, that's when you'll find out

454
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,920
what Bob meant when he said

455
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,920
that we'll all be eating roach crap

456
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,420
by the turn of the century.

457
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,060
Ha, you didn't realize

458
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,460
that he was actually soft-peddling us,

459
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,620
did you, you fool?

460
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,700
Oh, remember,

461
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,160
what hits the fan

462
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,560
will not be evenly distributed.

463
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,000
So, go ahead.

464
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,820
Save your $30

465
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,340
and take your chances.

466
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,640
Even if you do set yourself up,

467
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,840
it's only a matter of time

468
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,780
before the greys and the yakatismas

469
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,600
show up to pick over the remains

470
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,440
like screeching seagulls

471
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,340
fighting over a planetary garbage scow.

472
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,760
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

473
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,080
Ooh, yeah.

474
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,360
Mm.

475
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,400
It's so soon I can taste it.

476
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,040
We're almost there, Seagulls.

477
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,460
The light at the end of the tunnel

478
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,940
is an onrushing train of Bob.

479
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Yes, it's time for us to tie ourselves

480
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,120
to the track of his slack.

481
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,200
Because since we're taking the Titanic,

482
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,760
why not go first class,

483
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,160
ensconced in the hospitality chambers

484
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,140
with Bob?

485
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,340
Sex goddesses

486
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,400
fastened to us

487
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,400
like deliciously musky leeches.

488
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,380
Because yes,

489
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,000
finally,

490
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,100
we're on our way

491
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,120
out of here.

492
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,300
Because there's nothing I want more

493
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,080
than this cosmic deliverance.

494
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,120
And I've used this ministry

495
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,440
to attain that end.

496
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,560
All the horrible, membrane-ravaging

497
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,280
things I've had to do

498
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,560
in the course of my service to the church

499
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,760
has been worth it.

500
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,440
Oh, except maybe for belching the elder gods.

501
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,600
Oh, but yes.

502
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,440
Yes, everything has been worth it in spades.

503
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,580
Because no price is too dear

504
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,340
to attain that exquisite nerve-searing embrace

505
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,040
of eternal slack with Bob in the stars,

506
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,120
sailing to a bright new subgenius hell in space.

507
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,280
Just a consummation to vow to me

508
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,640
to be one of his secrets.

509
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,120
Oh, life as we know it

510
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,040
will die choking on its own

511
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,060
foul spew while we thrulled

512
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,620
every twitch and rictus

513
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,140
on the big viewscreens of the escape vessel.

514
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,440
Yes,

515
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,520
every pink

516
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
bastard, bitch,

517
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,800
and none of the above will be made

518
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,900
to pay for their wrongs.

519
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,520
The wrongs that the true

520
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,880
yeti races suffered at their hands

521
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,360
while we were imprisoned

522
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,560
on this dung ball and crying out

523
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,700
for the divine slack that's almost...

524
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,560
within reach of our desperately clutching fingers.

525
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,740
Yes!

526
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,640
Yes, we have survived

527
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,500
and finally escaped this earthly hell.

528
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,820
This bitter purgatory that has so contemptuously

529
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,400
crushed our souls

530
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,940
and ground out our bright and shining promise.

531
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,560
The conspiracy has killed so many precious

532
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,300
subgenius souls already,

533
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,600
but this last surviving subgenius generation

534
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,900
shall fulfill

535
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,760
Dog's divine prophecy

536
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,360
and sail into the vastness of space.

537
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,080
Yes,

538
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,640
our covenant with Bob

539
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,300
shall enclose us in a velvet vortex

540
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,760
of his blessed slack

541
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,260
and we shall live forever in the stars.

542
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,500
Praise his blessed name.

543
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,820
Seekers,

544
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,940
we're going home!

545
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,740
We're going home!

546
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:14,740


547
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:14,740


548
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,380
on the day

549
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,240
I went away

550
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,120
Goodbye

551
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,100
Was all I had to say

552
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,980
I want to come again

553
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,960
And stay

554
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,380
Smile

555
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,500
And that will mean

556
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,040
I'm there

557
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,680
Cause I've seen

558
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,220
All

559
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,460
Blue skies

560
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,720
Through the tears

561
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,800
In my eyes

562
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,700
And I realize

563
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,820
I want to take a ride

564
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,000
I want to take a ride

565
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,780
Ah, friends, what a wonderful

566
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,700
pre-X Day show

567
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,240
about

568
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,160
That was on side one of show

569
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,540
That was, of course,

570
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,180
Susie the Floozy

571
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,440
The beautiful Susie the Floozy

572
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,080
with her final

573
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,520
X Day farewell rant

574
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,340
So beautiful that was

575
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,600
from last X Day, actually

576
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,840
I guess it was a little bit

577
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,880
premature, you might say

578
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,860
But it's still good, you know

579
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,280
That's the great thing about religions

580
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,140
Sometimes things don't work out exactly

581
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,660
exactly according to prophecy

582
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,840
and so forth, but

583
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,380
But somehow it still sounds good

584
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,400
You know, it still works out

585
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,060
in this funny way

586
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,120
Well, friends, we're going to

587
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,080
We're going to

588
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,060
I promised that we were going to

589
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,640
have war on the show

590
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,360
And we will

591
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,380
It was actually the Einstein Secret Orchestra show

592
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,360
Which we must distinguish from this show

593
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,200
Hour of Slack

594
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,220
Which also must be distinguished from

595
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,900
Bob's Slack Time Fun House

596
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,580
Susie the Floozy show

597
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,920
up there in Atlanta

598
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,420
Okay

599
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,980
In fact we worked so hard

600
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:48,480
urging Jacky Collins and Max

601
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,080
for permission to do a standpoint

602
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,520
We are taking a break

603
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,160
for Ratty AND his company

604
00:32:53,160 --> 00:33:09,140
They had a show

605
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,440
The The

606
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,560
So

607
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,040
I gotta ask one more thing

608
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,220
You're not going to work any more right?

609
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,280
Hyperactive atrophy

610
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:35,340
Okay, now, you, there was something, I find it interesting that Hell Bop, you know, what the Heaven's Gate called, Hell Bop sounded a lot like Bob.

611
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,360
Was there some sort of problem?

612
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:57,640
Like I said, I think that they weren't on drugs or something, they were all mixed up, they got very confused, they maybe read a little bit of Book of the Subgenius, a little bit of the Bible, a little bit of Eric Von Donaghan's stuff, you know, some Velikovsky, some Roswell, some this and that, and watched a little bit too much Star Trek.

613
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,460
Right, right.

614
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:05,860
I mean, it's so silly to watch these superstitious people, you know, following these false prophets and so forth.

615
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,280
Well, didn't you have a tub of cool?

616
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,720
Was there a Kool-Aid waiting for your followers on X-Day?

617
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,060
Well, yes, we did.

618
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:23,340
Just a matter of tradition, we had the big corrugated tin aluminum tub of purple Kool-Aid, and I, Clyde, I got to stand there and say over a megaphone,

619
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,760
Children, drink the Kool-Aid.

620
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,860
Please, don't, let's not be rowdy.

621
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,240
Drink the Kool-Aid.

622
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,580
Just like my hero, Jim Jones.

623
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,800
And there were some witnesses.

624
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,320
Witnesses who thought that maybe we were going to poison the Kool-Aid and all commit mass suicide.

625
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:42,980
You know what?

626
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:43,380
What?

627
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,900
They didn't stop us.

628
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:45,860
Right.

629
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,320
They didn't stop you.

630
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,420
You know, so what can I say?

631
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,880
This is a crooked and perverse nation.

632
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:54,860
Want to take a ride?

633
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,600
Want to take a ride?

634
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,080
Want to take a ride?

635
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,740
Get your luggage ready.

636
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:05,800
All your spare tires, your empty window panes, your ideas that have no ending.

637
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,780
Put them in.

638
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,860
Put them all together like a ball of twine.

639
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,500
Roll them down the hill.

640
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,860
The way it's been done for millions of years.

641
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:18,240
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

642
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,080
Do you know who you are?

643
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:28,760
Do you, are you connected to that atomic big whoopee?

644
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,080
It's not a ball of twine, Chaz.

645
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,340
It wasn't a big bang.

646
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,320
It wasn't a big ring.

647
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,420
It was the big whoopee.

648
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,860
It's not a ball of twine.

649
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,040
It's not a ball of twine.

650
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,720
It's the big whoopee, Chaz.

651
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,000
And that's the way it's been done for billions and billions and billions of years.

652
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,460
And billions and billions.

653
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,920
The whoopee goes in, the whoopee comes out.

654
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,060
The crooked spiral.

655
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,140
And the whoopee falls back in on itself again.

656
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,880
The crooked spiral was a fist.

657
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,960
And then the whoopee pushed it all about.

658
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,540
Say it again?

659
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:02,360
How do you get real documentation of art or voice or whatever you're trying to recreate without doing it covertly?

660
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,120
Say it again?

661
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,360
Turn it over, turn it over.

662
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:04,960
Turn it over.

663
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,820
Turn it over.

664
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,320
Turn it over.

665
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:20,820
Turn it over.

666
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,100
They're like, ah, my life.

667
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,860
Don't hurt it, please.

668
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,100
Thank you.

669
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,760
Thank you.

670
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,000
Thank you.

671
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,680
It's pretty twisted.

672
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,640
Do you know how it feels

673
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,000
To be different from others

674
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
To get picked on

675
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,120
And you can't find a lover

676
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,440
Are you a subgenius

677
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,560
Do you know how it feels

678
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,000
Do you know how it feels

679
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,960
When you have to go work

680
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,080
At a job that you hate

681
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,060
And your boss is a jerk

682
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,400
Are you a subgenius

683
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,240
Do you know how it feels

684
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,000
Do you know how it feels

685
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,940
With a gun in your back

686
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,240
When the conspiracy

687
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,100
Takes away all your slack

688
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,540
Are you a subgenius

689
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,600
Do you know how it feels

690
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,020
Do you know how it feels

691
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,000
To learn you're not alone

692
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,280
To join in our church

693
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,420
And take Bob in your home

694
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,840
Are you a subgenius

695
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,840
Do you know how it feels

696
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,980
Do you know how it feels

697
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:12,120
So this is the church

698
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,880
Of the subgenius

699
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,580
My god

700
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,860
This is the blood wrestling

701
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,460
From X-Diagram friends

702
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,360
Wrestling in fresh goat blood

703
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,980
These two vixens

704
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,460
Fight to the finish

705
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,280

been hearing was Clyde Lewis's show, Ground Zero, out of Salt Lake City, Utah. And he is on the web

728
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:13,840
at, well, anyway, Clyde Lewis, Ground Zero. I've got a lot of that on tape, actually. We've been

729
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:21,120
listening, of course, to ESO Volume 16, Chaz Smith's edits of old Einstein Secret Orchestra

730
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,340
shows and so forth. It's the way it's been done for billions of years. Pete Martin,

731
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:33,460
Eddie the Rat CD, this Negative Land-like stuff, you might say, the collaged music sound.

732
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:42,240
We listened to one called Sun, My Lizard. And the song, Do You Know How It Feels, friends,

733
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:50,660
was Dr. Onan Kanobite, the youngest subgenius apostle, except we don't know who the 13th

734
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,100
apostle is.

735
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:56,980
That one might be some child. But that was Onan doing that a cappella version at X Day,

736
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:04,900
Brushwood, 1998. Friends, they're going to be here this year, X Day, XX Day, XX Day,

737
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:15,520
the great double-crossed X of July 5th this year. Do it, man. Information is right there

738
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,180
at your fingertips. Just listen closely.

739
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,060
Raise.

740
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,940
Oh, my.

741
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,100
Oh, my.

742
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,620
Oh, my.

743
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,560
We have no signal.

744
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,640
Can you turn on the door?

745
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,260
I have no signal.

746
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,380
What is that?

747
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,580
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.

748
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,200
None?

749
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:29,620
Hello?

750
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,080
Listen to that rockin', rockin', rockin' roll.

751
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,700
Yeah, it's on.

752
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,200
Oh, and your headphones, you might have to turn it off over there.

753
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,220
Hello?

754
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,540
Oh, that is mixed rather strange, I must say.

755
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,660
It's a lonesome day.

756
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,440
I must say.

757
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,320
What's your hết it matter?

758
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,900
quarry tarde, taira?

759
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,000
Yes?

760
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,000
What?

761
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,620
Tellin' ya anything.

762
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,120


763
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,000
We go down the meth it shwaiten her,

764
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,120
A Sri Dante went off to West America town on fier linear.

765
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,080
To make this, hangin' on a

766
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,080


767
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,260
No, come on stop with the

768
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:08,960
Iads and two mensen

769
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:16,700
A lennin' devil mit

770
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,840
aish Yes.

771
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,460
Every now and then.

772
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,540
All right.

773
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,120
Billion miles to Earth.

774
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,180
Yes.

775
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,960
Witch disco.

776
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,040
Welcome to the witch disco, kids.

777
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,100
You are rising to the air.

778
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,620
The human race.

779
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,960
Many, many, many miles.

780
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,240
Well, who will save the human race?

781
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,620
I don't think it's anybody in this room tonight.

782
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,900
No, I don't.

783
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:52,520
I think it's the man grinning at me from my coffee cup who will save the human race.

784
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,540
The grinning man, the smiling man with the pipe.

785
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,020
Carl Sagan.

786
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,760
Bob Sagan.

787
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,560
Cobb.

788
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,420
Cobb Sagan.

789
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:04,960
Cobb Sagan.

790
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:05,940
The Slaven of Time.

791
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,280
I think Mannix will save us.

792
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,720
Tripoli Vegas.

793
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,720
I like their logo.

794
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,180
Oh, I didn't want to hear that.

795
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,280
Mannix.

796
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,380
You remember Mannix, the old 70s doodad hero?

797
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,600
The guy who used to mustard his hair with bees?

798
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:17,940
He's waxed.

799
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,760
What do I got here?

800
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,040
Sometimes used to ride the surfboard with, what's his name, Hawaii Five-Oil?

801
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,320
Yeah.

802
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:28,920
I think he has the potential to save the human race if given the proper direction or misdirection,

803
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,240
depending on his, you know, novitiate speed or his articulation.

804
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:39,680
I think misdirecting anyone to save the human race is the gravest sin and must repent with lots and lots of money.

805
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,900
But if it ain't Popeye Pilau.

806
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,460
We're trying to enslave the human erasure is the main thing here.

807
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,900
We're not trying to enslave...

808
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,120
You're trying to...

809
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,500
When did the human erasure appear on this scene?

810
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,280
I've been looking for...

811
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,440
When the flaming carrot lost his job.

812
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,960
Shortly after enslavement.

813
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,440
I have to, first of all, make a preamble.

814
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,440
I am extremely against the United States war against every country it feels like picking on,

815
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,880
which is pretty weird for rights of...

816
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,520
But hang on, Dave.

817
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,460
I know you want an event.

818
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,860
There's a war on, isn't there?

819
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,500
The pirate states of America.

820
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,320
I'm more concerned about...

821
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,400
Didn't you read in the news?

822
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,600
I read today about the 13 billion year old galaxy.

823
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,040
Yeti skull?

824
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,280
No, I heard about the Yeti...

825
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
Did you hear about the Yeti skull?

826
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,280
I don't care about Yeti skulls.

827
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,360
I got about the science.

828
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:27,420
Look at you, Dave.

829
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,340
You've got all those starving dead people.

830
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,600
This is a science show.

831
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,500
We're not a religious show here.

832
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,620
We don't care about that crap.

833
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,340
Yeah, but religion is false science in many ways, don't you think?

834
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,240
I mean, why get so...

835
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,640
Religion in a lot of ways.

836
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:46,040
Forbidden science and religion are identical to primitive humans and third dimensional.

837
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,620
Oh, man.

838
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,400
I thought you were going to say...

839
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,320
A true human science.

840
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,100
But then you went and said forbidden human interdimensionals.

841
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,960
That's three contradictions in a row.

842
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,200
Three continents in one hit.

843
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,140
That's why they call it forbidden science.

844
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,480
Well, is that an oxymoron, human science?

845
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:06,560
Because Hunan beans, or the Hunan rice as we may call it, might be spicy, but it's very dull when it comes to brains.

846
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,640
Well, not necessarily.

847
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,160
Some of them are clever monkeys indeed.

848
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,240
Clever.

849
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,400
They're tool using primates, Dave, just like we are.

850
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,280
That's why we got opposable appendages.

851
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,960
So we can stick it up our derrieres.

852
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,900
And a whole lot of them are smarter than us.

853
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,460
We're just subgeniuses.

854
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,860
The human race includes many morons, but it also includes quite a few geniuses.

855
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,560
Evil geniuses.

856
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,040
That's what I would say.

857
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,320
Super geniuses.

858
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,020
That's what I would say.

859
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,960
Evil geniuses.

860
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,100
Because science is being subverted, like for these weird wacko wars, you know, these plunderisms.

861
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,340
And these different...

862
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,380
Don't you think we could cure cancer and stuff like that and just rocket into space?

863
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,600
Not because we had to.

864
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,000
But because we damn well felt like it.

865
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,540
We could do it for a ride.

866
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,920
Well, but we have to kill everyone first.

867
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:50,520
Oh, yeah.

868
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,400
I forgot about that part.

869
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:51,580
Yeah.

870
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,340
And there's only money to do one thing.

871
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,720
We can either save the planet or kill everyone.

872
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,260
So which is it going to be, Dave?

873
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:57,760
Come on.

874
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,600
Now, let's be logical.

875
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,380
Well, just think, though.

876
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,760
If you killed everybody and got all the money, then there'd be no money to spend it with.

877
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,840
You know what I mean?

878
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,960
Like, if America gets its ultimate wish, there'll be some crap out there.

879
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,360
The one that dies with the most toys wins, dude.

880
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,320
Yeah.

881
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,340
It is a philosophy.

882
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,200
The one who dies with the most rockets.

883
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,760
Listen to this, bud.

884
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:25,320
It sounds like a playground full of little kids all babbling in their sandbox about their various different obsessions.

885
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:33,160
Dave's worried about all the Kimodians and the Kimodo dragons.

886
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,820
And Chad can only think about rocket butt.

887
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,440
I'm worried about mutations, man.

888
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,880
I'm thinking the one with the most sockets dies.

889
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:41,680
You know what I mean?

890
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,160
What if we start growing these different appendages that need nucleotides?

891
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,540
The one with the most rockets gets off first.

892
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,960
The one with the most sockets can fit anywhere.

893
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,020
Hey, think of that one.

894
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,600
The one with the biggest gun gets to steal the best ship.

895
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,020
Well, geez, I guess so.

896
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,440
That kind of blanks out all the other ones, doesn't it?

897
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:11,380
Well, see, but the thing is that the guy who can build the biggest rocket along the way has built numerous smaller rockets that he can tip with all sorts of fun things to deter people from coming at them with a gun.

898
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,500
Long before they can get anywhere near them with a gun.

899
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,940
Well, you know, mutual assured.

900
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,040
The destruction really was a great idea.

901
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,340
Mad, yep.

902
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:29,860
And we didn't have quite as many of these little, you know, mini-series type wars, these TV wars back when we had mutual assured destruction.

903
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,400
They're all called Day One, too, and that's so old, man.

904
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,340
I mean, they were doing that in 1943 or whatever the hell it was, you know?

905
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,440
Let's see the Earth from space.

906
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,340
Day One.

907
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,780
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

908
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,820
Well, Princess, we used to be involved in that insane freeze.

909
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,960
That insane routine where they were going to freeze all the nuclear...

910
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,000
I thought they froze your cerebral cortex.

911
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:59,800
Well, actually, last weekend, last Saturday, Guido, my guidance officer, and myself went out to Brushwood...

912
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,700
He's your parole officer, Chad.

913
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,040
...to test the grounds for XX Day.

914
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:03,760
Oh, that's right.

915
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:07,640
The radio audience doesn't know about that, do they?

916
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,660
No, not at all.

917
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:13,220
We went out and we launched six rockets and one globular spaceship.

918
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,520
Sacred launch.

919
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,180
But the globular...

920
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,140
The globular spaceship had so much of that, like, trans-dimensional mucal matter on it that it began spinning.

921
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,520
Its orb went wildly.

922
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,060
It did.

923
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,860
And it actually...

924
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,400
And it fell on the ground.

925
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:30,980
It got about 30 feet high, then veered one way and hit the ground and did the curly shuffle.

926
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,640
That sounds like my life, man.

927
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,160
You know, you get real high, you fall down, and you do the curly shuffle.

928
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,500
Running in circles on your side.

929
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:38,960
Yeah.

930
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,440
But then we invented the sport of rocket jousting.

931
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,900
I launched a rocket at Ryan.

932
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,960
And Ryan took the launch pad to the other end of the field and launched it straight back at me.

933
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,880
And we nearly hit the first aid house there.

934
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,980
Psychologically, that's a lot more bleak.

935
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,140
You know, jousting with rockets.

936
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,120
But actually, the big rockets, that was the big thing.

937
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,060
The big rockets we launched, we lost completely.

938
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:06,180
That's such NATO tactics, you know, blowing up the first aid station so that if any of you get hurt, you have no choice.

939
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:14,620
Well, you know what, P. Lil, I don't know if you guys knew this, but when the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer was prematurely blown up,

940
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:23,280
dynamited out there on Pastor Craig Island at Brushwood during the X-Day drill, the last one,

941
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,140
when that head blew up, only one person was injured.

942
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,800
The doctor.

943
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,820
Dr. Tillis, who was out there on the island in case anyone got hurt.

944
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:40,800
And he had a chunk of bleeding head tissue, foam rubber, blown into his chest.

945
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,260
Well, that sounds like great, man.

946
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,300
I'd love to have all that stuff blown into my chest.

947
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,560
And he just got discharged from his Army doctor position.

948
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,220
Oh, man.

949
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,500
Which is what he wanted.

950
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,780
I think he discharged.

951
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,420
In his Kleiner style.

952
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,040
I'd love to get discharged, too.

953
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,640
I've been having this, like, discharge all month.

954
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,080
And it's kind of stinking up the laundry room a little bit.

955
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,360
Have you ever had those?

956
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,520
I think it's not from the pubic distension.

957
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,700
I think it's interstellar.

958
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,100
Remember, you know, we measure time by solar increments on this daylight planet of ours.

959
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,460
So we don't know outside of certain time dimensions how old it actually is.

960
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,240
It could be, like, 1,000 years.

961
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:14,680
It could be born Tuesday.

962
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,560
But we assume that was a long time ago in their time.

963
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,260
No, you can tell by its red shifting.

964
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,700
Oh, they do that.

965
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:27,640
Yeah, there's been a real serious discrepancy in the age of stars versus the theorized age of the Big Bang.

966
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,220
That's true.

967
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,000
And there are some stars that appear to be older than the Big Bang, which doesn't make any sense at all.

968
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,020
Like yourself, Stan.

969
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,700
Or maybe not stars, but galaxies.

970
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,100
Well, Stan was a big gas bag at one time, and he's red shifting right now.

971
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,480
You know what I mean?

972
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,120
Well, not by choice.

973
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:43,760
Right.

974
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,140
Really?

975
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:48,100
It happens once your equivocal axis begins blown.

976
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,700
It gets blown out by too much disco, too many bad events.

977
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:58,120
A little star could last 15 billion years, but it'd have to be about the size of, you know, your head.

978
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,980
She was a burlesque queen, little star.

979
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:00,860
Remember her?

980
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:01,660
Yeah.

981
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,440
She was about the size of your head, too.

982
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,020
I know.

983
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:10,740
That was her calling card in her drawing thing, was the fact that he had to use some sort of microscopic device to see her do her dooder.

984
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,100
I haven't seen her since they bulldozed Prospect.

985
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:14,360
Yeah.

986
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,920
And he was just dabbing her down and turned it into a...

987
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,240
Well, I guess she's like a little teeny tiny bag lady.

988
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:18,720
Back in the...

989
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:19,720
Very...

990
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,220
With a lot of sequins, but you can...

991
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,620
You know, they're such small sequins.

992
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:28,940
What does this have to do with the war in Kosovo or the rockets to Uranus?

993
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,320
You're right.

994
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:29,980
You're right.

995
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,580
What does the war in Kosovo have to do with getting off the planet?

996
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,180
Well, Chaz thinks that life...

997
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:39,080
Well, it's the only way some people have to get off the planet is to die in war.

998
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,580
Oh, they've upped the ante.

999
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,200
They've upped the ante for the...

1000
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:43,620
For ante.

1001
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:43,980
Two...

1002
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,120
200 kilometers.

1003
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,800
Two kilograms, 200 kilometers.

1004
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,900
By the year 2000, the ante has now been up to half a million dollars.

1005
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,600
For...

1006
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,660
If you can get your...

1007
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,060
That's the prize.

1008
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:59,920
Your own post-erectile simian body off this Earth or any device as big as...

1009
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,940
No, only two kilograms.

1010
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,540
Two kilograms of plutonium.

1011
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:07,020
If you can get two kilograms of plutonium at least five feet above your head by through

1012
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,120
some psychic or telekinetic device...

1013
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,020
I was thinking anthrax germs.

1014
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,520
Oh, I don't think President Anthrax is...

1015
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:13,960
Two kilograms of anthrax.

1016
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:14,360
Anthrax germs.

1017
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,040
That's a lot of anthrax.

1018
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:16,520
Yep.

1019
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,580
That's a lot of people to soak it up to.

1020
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:24,260
Now, I was thinking maybe if you put it on a balloon, if you strap the rocket to a balloon

1021
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,560
and let the balloon go up to about 10 miles...

1022
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,240
And then...

1023
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,840
And then ignite the rocket.

1024
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,360
I think you could do it.

1025
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,860
I think I could do it with one of my rockets.

1026
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:33,700
Those things are...

1027
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,760
Well, could you, like, take...

1028
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,020
Shoot one rocket on the back of a bigger rocket or...

1029
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:41,120
Yeah, kind of like that story about the little sparrow in the...

1030
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:41,520
Piggyback.

1031
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,880
That hid out in the eagle's...

1032
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,620
Well, I...

1033
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:49,820
What if we made some wings out of feathers and sticks and wax and we'll fly to the sun while wearing them?

1034
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,640
Icarus.

1035
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,420
Remember that story?

1036
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,420
Because they didn't have music.

1037
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,980
Their music was gone.

1038
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,440
It was the story of Icarus.

1039
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,500
No, Icarus was that idiot that tried to fly.

1040
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,460
Oh, that was you.

1041
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:58,840
Yeah.

1042
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:05,360
No, the other story about the people who had no music because the music had been taken up to the sky.

1043
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,100
And the little sparrow had to go get the music back, but the sparrow couldn't get there.

1044
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,080
So the sparrow hid on the back of the eagle.

1045
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,820
He got a ride from the eagle, and the eagle flew as high as the eagle could fly.

1046
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,200
And the damn sparrow couldn't fly anymore.

1047
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:26,640
The sparrow took off, flew that little bit higher, ran out of oxygen, and died and fell back to Earth.

1048
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,420
What a crappy story.

1049
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,520
Swallowed by a blue whale.

1050
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,960
He took it to the bottom of the ocean where...

1051
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,820
What's on?

1052
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,060
Where it decomposed.

1053
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,700
Oh, decomposing whales do have a very strong flavor.

1054
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,120
Believe me, you can smell them from miles away if anybody's lived near the Pacific Ocean.

1055
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,460
I think it's like P. Lill or something.

1056
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,440
Oh.

1057
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,060
Have you ever smelled it?

1058
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:47,600
I was wondering what that smell was.

1059
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:47,880
I'm sorry.

1060
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,360
I just...

1061
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,840
I smelled it in my mind.

1062
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,180
I'm sorry.

1063
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,280
I'll forget it.

1064
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,200
Yeah, it's all right.

1065
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,340
I saw a movie of that smell once.

1066
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,220
I'm going to the bottom of the ocean.

1067
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,060
I saw another guy smell that smell one time.

1068
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:00,300
Pardon?

1069
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,080
I watched a movie of another guy smelling that one time.

1070
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,020
There was a whole movie of one person smelling...

1071
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:07,560
Smelling it.

1072
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,700
The amenities of a...

1073
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,500
Well, no, it was just a few shots.

1074
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,420
And I thought, man, that must smell bad.

1075
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,880
You could just tell.

1076
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:15,900
It's known for it.

1077
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,640
It is known for it.

1078
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,420
What's the 37th element?

1079
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,040
Uh, krypton.

1080
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,380
No, no, it's...

1081
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,360
Green kryptonite.

1082
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,260
Isn't it green kryptonite?

1083
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,060
I think it is.

1084
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:25,360
Uh-huh.

1085
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,860
I thought it was Celsius.

1086
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:27,380
I thought it was...

1087
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,740
Maybe it's gold kryptonite.

1088
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,840
It could be fromage.

1089
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,400
Some of the weaker members of the unit might want to...

1090
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,740
I know it's not red kryptonite.

1091
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:34,160
A-U-K.

1092
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,820
It could be riddle-ated kryptonite.

1093
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,080
Isn't the symbol for gold kryptonite A-U-K?

1094
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,080
That's the kind you take and five minutes later you want to take more?

1095
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,360
A-U-K-R.

1096
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,500
Or K-R-E-U.

1097
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,920
Oh, that sounds more like a Russian weapon or something.

1098
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,000
Or...

1099
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,920
I don't know.

1100
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,400
I don't know.

1101
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,620
You could use it as a weapon.

1102
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:56,940
Our kryptonite-tipped warhead will defeat even Saddam Hussein's Republican guards.

1103
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,880
We could make up a whole little army of little kryptonite soldiers

1104
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,300
and just, like, blast them off into different directions

1105
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,420
and let them do what they will.

1106
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,020
Perhaps they could be on map...

1107
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,180
No, never mind that one.

1108
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,060
These kryptonite-brained robots will be able to...

1109
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,960
She gravitates to the site.

1110
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,240
...much vaunted.

1111
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,060
Burn.

1112
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,860
Welcome to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

1113
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,400
I'm worried about the Vaunts, too.

1114
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:24,420
The Vaunts were a hardy people who lived on a diet of sodium and beans.

1115
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,600
And they...

1116
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,180
Have you ever...

1117
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,840
You remember the sodiums and little horses?

1118
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,860
I think you mean the Texans, don't you?

1119
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,280
Well, you guys started all this stuff with these oil and vinegar wars, you know?

1120
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,460
You guys invented the idea.

1121
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,540
No, I'm sorry.

1122
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,140
Oil for blood.

1123
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,760
That was our contribution to the...

1124
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,700
No, blood for oil.

1125
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,360
That's what it was.

1126
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,480
Blood for oil.

1127
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:42,980
Okay.

1128
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,380
Yeah, it was backwards.

1129
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,980
No, I mean put it out.

1130
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,060
They've been complaining.

1131
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:53,380
We're trying to put out the flames of a fire that could engulf the planet.

1132
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:53,540
A fire in your heart!

1133
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,820
A fire in your mind!

1134
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,380
A fire down in your pill dispensary.

1135
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,880
Fire in your pants.

1136
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,920
Bob's gonna put a fire in your pants.

1137
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,780
He's gonna light it.

1138
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,960
Take a big old whiff.

1139
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,680
He's gonna take him a big old head of you, my listening friend.

1140
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,700
And when he exhales...

1141
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:17,920
Are you gonna be shotgunned into the next...

1142
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,120
Into Connie's mouth?

1143
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,780
Or are you just gonna be blithered out into the atmosphere?

1144
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,600
Speaking of lethal friends, I think you all need to be sedated.

1145
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:32,100
And furthermore, what difference does it make as far as a 15-year-old solar system is concerned?

1146
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,320
I mean as galaxy.

1147
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,200
It's 1,500 billion zillion, isn't it?

1148
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,240
What does that mean to those starving refugees?

1149
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:42,080
What do they care about some billion-year-old carbon?

1150
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,520
And back to the garden.

1151
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:50,660
They just want A.C. or a blanket or a bowl of Rice Krispies, man.

1152
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,880
Or a popular CD or like one of those...

1153
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,560
And we're sitting here joking about it.

1154
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,360
And we're shopping, too.

1155
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,700
Yeah, we're all dead. We're all going to hell. We know all this already.

1156
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:01,140
We're drinking Orange Julius.

1157
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,260
We're going to the mall and playing ping-pong with our feet.

1158
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,060
You may as well just send me to hell that now.

1159
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,560
I'm going to transactional therapy.

1160
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,040
We're just gonna leave them behind.

1161
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,540
We're gonna leave all those suffering people on exit.

1162
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,380
We're just gonna stay. We're just gonna...

1163
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,020
We had $30.

1164
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:21,980
We happen to be well-educated Americans who learned about the word of Bob, spent our $30.

1165
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:28,640
So we get to leave the planet and live with riches and sexual fulfillment and food and comic books forever.

1166
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:34,540
And yet here we are just laughing at the plight of the humans who did not join our church.

1167
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:40,320
Now is this the way a subgenius should be?

1168
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,520
Mocking rather than reaching out a helping hand?

1169
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,860
Really, think about it.

1170
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:45,400
Why not?

1171
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,420
Well, I don't know. The timber, the tone, the way things are going here.

1172
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:53,860
Chasing the pure science and you're just, you know, want to leave the earth without any...

1173
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:54,980
I don't know and...

1174
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:57,020
No, I want to leave the earth as cinder.

1175
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,500
That's what I mean. That's what I mean.

1176
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:05,520
I don't know. I like to smell some flowers and see the eucalyptus jump and the heffalumps and the birds.

1177
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,480
Yeah, but do you need to have a bunch of humans around while you do it?

1178
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,260
No. No, I guess I don't.

1179
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,860
All you need is a few wiggles and squiggles.

1180
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,740
You've got subgeniuses. You know, there's enough...

1181
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,900
How many subgeniuses are there in the world?

1182
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,260
Let's say, okay, there's about 10,000 that have joined up.

1183
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,760
Say there's 10 times as many who haven't even heard about it.

1184
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,760
There may be 100,000 subgeniuses on a planet of 18 billion.

1185
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,200
They didn't tell you about that other 10 billion.

1186
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,660
And so, you know, so?

1187
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:35,780
So I guess...

1188
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:39,100
Why do we need them? There's plenty of us. 100,000.

1189
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,460
We're kind of like the Yeti refugees.

1190
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,180
That's enough to repopulate the solar system.

1191
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:42,700
Right.

1192
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:47,200
I think we're missing 44,000 subgeniuses, though, now that I think about it.

1193
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:50,920
Oh, that's right. The number there shall be 144,000.

1194
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,800
Oh, yes. Pilo, you're right.

1195
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:59,280
And they're in Lithuanian refugee camps right now waiting to take your address, your cards, your numbers, your phone calls.

1196
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:11,040
But some of them want to hear your ideas about a universe, perhaps a whole entire dimension, which is not only flip-flop from ours, but it's just diasporopically totally in my entrails.

1197
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:17,000
I am mildly amused by the strategy to shoot anything that moves.

1198
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,380
I kind of...

1199
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,160
On Earth, you mean?

1200
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:19,860
It's an interesting strategy.

1201
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,180
That has evolved over the years. You just kill anything.

1202
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,640
Just go anything that moves in an area.

1203
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,200
Just segregate off that area. Just, you know, isolate the area.

1204
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,120
Cover it with planes. And if something moves, shoot it.

1205
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:33,860
Kill them all.

1206
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,740
Right. That's a great idea.

1207
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,640
It would have worked in Vietnam if they'd let us off the leash.

1208
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,020
We had to kill that plane.

1209
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,720
We had to kill that country to save it, and I'm glad we did.

1210
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,760
Fighting soldiers.

1211
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:47,260
And we're going to kill every country in the world we can to save every country.

1212
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,300
I'm sorry.

1213
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,000
Oh, man.

1214
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,500
Stop that. Don't like that.

1215
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,620
Oh, Dave, you peacenik.

1216
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,800
I'm going to have to fade out there, friends, because I just realized this show's about to end.

1217
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,560
It's sad but true, and...

1218
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,780
I didn't know.

1219
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,340
I'm glad you're enjoying this, but let's get on with the war.

1220
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,420
Okay, okay, okay. You're right. You're right. You're right. Okay. We'll do it.

1221
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:19,880
Uh...

1222
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:24,980
You have been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1223
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:36,360
Uh, you can get more information about us and all of that stuff from Bob at Post Office Box 140306...

1224
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,020
Dallas, Texas, 752...

1225
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:48,520
one four and this real crazy stuff in the background was by uh pete martin who you can

1226
01:02:48,520 --> 01:03:01,840
reach at sonic sun at earthlink.com that's sonic sun like son of sonic okay went off into the desert
