1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:07,520
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard our McDonnell Douglas DC-88 space liner for today's mission to Mars.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,440
The captain has asked that you remain in your seats at all times.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,420
And please, no smoking.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,820
Attention, please. Folks, this is Third Officer Collins speaking.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,780
I'm your tour guide today, and I'll be telling you about what's going on during the trip.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,040
Right now, we're on final countdown, and you can watch our liftoff on the lower screen in your cabin.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,100
I'll speak to you again after we're in space.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,840
Mission control, this is Mars 295 ready for departure.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,120
295, roger. Countdown is going.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,360
Going up in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,100
We'll meet again at midnight.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,820
Who else wants to come up here?

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,780
Who else wants to read off the phone?

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,300
We need a female voice for balance.

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,940
But we'll take a weak man, if that's all we can get.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,580
I'll take a day man. We don't need a full week of him.

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,180
A sissy would be fine.

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,620
We'll take... Church has many sissies.

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,200
You can't just call people sissies.

20
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,080
There ain't a bunch of sissies.

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,860
I know the sissy once who was captured by the Cherokee.

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,480
They tortured him and tortured him.

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,640
He never screamed or cried.

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,940
He was a sissy.

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:29,940


26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,700
Animal's a sissy.

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,860
No bad damn sissy.

28
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,460
Reverend Animal, I take it you've got over your head.

29
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,400
Oh, okay. I see.

30
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:37,920
You're good.

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,780
Yeah.

32
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,440
You're good.

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,180
Thank you.

34
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,560
Sibilance.

35
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,220
Sibilance.

36
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,780
That was the news.

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,440
Reverend Fox, I got you coming in at 10 or by 3-er.

38
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,800
Gonna need you to calibrate cylindromes.

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,820
Sibilance.

40
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,020
Sibilance.

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,360
Sibilance.

42
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,880
Sibilance.

43
00:01:59,880 --> 00:01:59,880


44
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,780
Ah, sweaty headphones.

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,480
My favorite.

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,400
We're modulating frequencies now.

47
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,880
Deafness is contagious and carried by headphones.

48
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,400
Now you know.

49
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,900
Deafness, the silent killer.

50
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,900
Oh.

51
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,080
Ah.

52
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,420
Does everybody feel better?

53
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,460
Definitely.

54
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,980
That feels better. I feel better. How about you people?

55
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:38,220
I'm just happy that everyone was able to get here and be in such high spirits.

56
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,480
The highest.

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,740
That's it. Those are the sounds of X-Day.

58
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,840
I was concerned. I thought you were going to go somewhere with that.

59
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,960
I thought there was more to the story.

60
00:02:51,960 --> 00:03:01,220
No, I actually thought somebody out in the audience might do one solo clap or just vomit onto the ground at least.

61
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,980
That has not happened. I have not seen that yet.

62
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,520
And I appreciate not slipping in people's vomit, but if it's that kind of vomit...

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,580
Well, this isn't a gravel floor. It's actually sand sorb.

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,300
So that's the entire campground.

65
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,040
For now it is.

66
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,340
Oh, and look, more Bulldada items.

67
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,060
Did you see?

68
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,500
I just wanted to know if this got added to the list.

69
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,460
This is straight from Texas.

70
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,780
Mystery tube full of bees.

71
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,720
Okay, so it's a mystery tube full of bees.

72
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,300
We don't know what's in the mystery tube.

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,040
Bees.

74
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,480
But you can learn the secrets.

75
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,320
There's a mystery on how they're going to fly out.

76
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,540
Or if they're still alive.

77
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,240
You can learn the secrets of the mystery tube of bees.

78
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,060
Schrodinger's bees.

79
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,360
A mosque-shaped alarm clock.

80
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,380
You will always know which way Mecca is if the big hand is on the...

81
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,240
For people that have to wake up five times a day, it's the mosque-shaped alarm clock.

82
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,640
In blue.

83
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,760
There are multiple color choices, but this will be the blue mosque-shaped alarm clock.

84
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,060
Mosque-shaped alarm clocks are not like Southern Baptist church-shaped alarm clocks.

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,240
Which just chastise you for 45 minutes until you get up.

86
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,120
The sense of the middle gear has the job of refreshing the slide shower.

87
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,980
Because the spank has left.

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,880
And the spank's on the plank now.

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,900
Whoa, slow down there.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,680
With great knowledge comes great responsibility.

91
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,100
Or sitting in the middle chair.

92
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,060
I've become a big ol' cyberpunk technocrat.

93
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,020
I have middle chair syndrome.

94
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,500
He thinks he's all hot stuff.

95
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,260
You know, because he's got his smart phones.

96
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,900
He's connected to his smart web.

97
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,000
What the fuck?

98
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,080
Reverend Adie also brought the...

99
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,900
Unofficial presidential pencil sharpener.

100
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,440
The Bill Clinton model.

101
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,460
And there's a sticky note on top that says,

102
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,760
Don't take this to work!

103
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,920
Exclamation point.

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,140
Exclamation point.

105
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,160
So you have a Bill Clinton fleshlight available for purchase, ladies and gentlemen.

106
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,000
So if you, uh...

107
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,600
If you have a...

108
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,800
Dishwasher safe.

109
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,740
A pencil-shaped penis.

110
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,200
Which, uh, they're coming.

111
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,060
And yeah, look at them coming out there.

112
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,600
There's old Slick Willie.

113
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,460
That's a flashlight.

114
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,880
For a very, very small wiener.

115
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,120
Some, you know, you can grow an extra small wiener.

116
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,020
What do you have to say to him, Bill?

117
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,020
Imagine rubbing your two wieners together.

118
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,620
Your large wiener and your small wiener.

119
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,940
No, I disclosed last night that I could, um...

120
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,840
Use a paramecium for such endeavors.

121
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,700
That's true.

122
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,980
Due to my staggering lack of, uh...

123
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,980
You know, manlyhood.

124
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,320
I'm just going to have...

125
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,240
Sex with that woman.

126
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,680
That's great.

127
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,380
Oh, almost there.

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,360
Number two pencils only, people.

129
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,060
Number two penises.

130
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,520
Thank you, Reverend Stang, for that correction.

131
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,900
I guess that's why they call you Reverend Stang.

132
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,000
I hear there's a special shipment of magic pencils coming in when Pease arrives.

133
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,680
I'm told that I am due a pencil.

134
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,860
Spirit magic pencils.

135
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,840
I've got some pencils, but they're not for sharing.

136
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,920
I actually lost...

137
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,340
I have a solid graphite...

138
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,820
pencil.

139
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,820
There's no wood.

140
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,700
It's just, uh...

141
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,020
It's really great for doing all these wavy lines.

142
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,000
And, uh...

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,900
I've lost it.

144
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,020
I lost every...

145
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,280
I thought I would lose one thing of value,

146
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
and I lost the one pencil I...

147
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,160
I like chewing on the solid graphite pencils.

148
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,520
You know, you get the nice...

149
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,380
You get the ring around the teeth.

150
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,300
Shiny mouth syndrome.

151
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,680
Shiny mouth syndrome.

152
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,160
SMS.

153
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,920
In middle school, the D.A.R.E. officer gave us these pencils that said,

154
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,860
don't do drugs,

155
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,120
but by the time you sharpened it about halfway down,

156
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,340
you just had a pencil that said,

157
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,200
do drugs.

158
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,300
So we thought that was funny,

159
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,680
because we were immature...

160
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,980
Uggs.

161
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,100
...and classless...

162
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,020
I've got one that says Uggs.

163
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,200
You were in an American public school,

164
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,800
so, uh, yeah, you're just living up to expectations.

165
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,080
Tony the Tiger says,

166
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,240
prostitutes are great.

167
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,040
I can't do my Tony the Tiger voice anymore,

168
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,880
because I...

169
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,020
They're great in small doses.

170
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,560
I used to have a bevy of funny cartoon voices,

171
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,580
but smoking cigarettes and fromp and, uh,

172
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,380
dipping my head in fats of acid...

173
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,040
I think staying up till dawn ruins it for everyone.

174
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,380
Yeah, it was...

175
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,680
It was a long night,

176
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,880
and I think most of us are just now getting that...

177
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,620
that kick.

178
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,040
My mom says I could use my own voice and be myself,

179
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,380
because people should like me for who I am.

180
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,500
Yay!

181
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,620
Baby Fitz, my favorite.

182
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,340
That's what we need.

183
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,200
I just want to take him home and put him in our pockets.

184
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,200
We need a spin-off show called Little Subgeniuses.

185
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,700
Where we're all like the baby versions of ourselves.

186
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,580
Mini-sub!

187
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,420
And we'll...

188
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,360
We'll go on big adventures

189
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,320
with our imaginations.

190
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,240
Yay!

191
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,460
And I'm sure that will be entirely kid-friendly.

192
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,300
Speaking of Imaginariums,

193
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,000
we have a creative center over here

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,820
for the health and safety and, uh...

195
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,440
I thought we had a cream center.

196
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,800
We have one of those.

197
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,980
It's next to the cream center.

198
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,940
But, uh, if you're interested in protecting yourself

199
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,620
or collecting Argon Rays,

200
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,760
I know that's out there, too.

201
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,320
Yeah, just head right over there.

202
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,320


203
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,020
Head right over to the cream Abdul-Jabbar section.

204
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,520
Make yourself...

205
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,400
Uh, you can come to X-Day

206
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,440
and, uh, make yourself a protective device.

207
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,800
We have at least, uh, 60 feet left

208
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,620
of the heavy-duty aluminum foil

209
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,460
for your disposal.

210
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,300
Make sure you amplify your thoughts.

211
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,200
Sorry, I'm allergic to Xenon.

212
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,760
Then don't lick it.

213
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,980
It's delicious.

214
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,360
And the music's gone again.

215
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,380
Hat licker.

216
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,260
What's your favorite isotope of Xenon, you guys?

217
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,620
Let's say it at the same time.

218
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,220
Say it on the count of three.

219
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,080
Where is it coming back in?

220
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,020
I hear, like, wind chimes.

221
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,660
Hippie alarms.

222
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,860
There are definitely wind chimes.

223
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,840
There's wind in them chimes.

224
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,640
It's his Monster Hunter soundtrack.

225
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,320
When Stang's not busy running around

226
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,980
running the entire operation,

227
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,760
you can find him locked in the, uh,

228
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,120
tortoises with his Monster Hunter DS.

229
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,320
Gouda.

230
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,400
Havarti.

231
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,060
Them video games ain't gonna play.

232
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,360
They're gonna kill themselves, Reverend Fox.

233
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,680
We're missing out on a lot of prime video game playing time right now.

234
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,780
Speaking of which, we're going to have a golf tournament later.

235
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,740
We're just going to, uh, we're gonna have to have help erecting the screen.

236
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,400
Oh, they're not going to kill themselves.

237
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,780
Isn't there something about some chariot racing?

238
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,380
Stang is leading a genocidal rage against monsters.

239
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,280
Chariot racing at dawn.

240
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,520
But we're not talking about the chariot racing.

241
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,420
You're a monster Nazi.

242
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,640
You're a monster!

243
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,300
Monster!

244
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,300


245
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,560
Monster!

246
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,720
You're a monster monster hunter.

247
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,160
That's me.

248
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,840
Am I correct?

249
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,560
Uh...

250
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,600
We'll put it on soon.

251
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,420
Chariot race to the death.

252
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:56,500
Reverend Fox.

253
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,200
Exotic clown.

254
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:57,460
Best two out of three wins.

255
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,720
Are we doing the chariot racing at dawn again?

256
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,880
I believe so.

257
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,440
Okay.

258
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,140
We'll, uh...

259
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,680
If you've moved up in the bracket of the chariot races, uh...

260
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,140
You need to report at dawn.

261
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,700
At dawn.

262
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,740
Whee!

263
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,720
To the fire circle.

264
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,640
Wherever that fire may be.

265
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,040
The fire's in your belly.

266
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,760
Ugh!

267
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,960
You can use music to cover up your sneezes.

268
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,480
Finally, a use for music.

269
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,720
It's the subgenius hour of slack featuring those guys you don't know.

270
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,560
Come aboard.

271
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,580
I don't know you.

272
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,180
Who are you?

273
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,340
I'm just that guy.

274
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,100
Oh, wow.

275
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,580
That's...

276
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,780
It's so nice to meet you.

277
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,920
I've heard all about you.

278
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,560
Yeah, I came with Reverend Funny Name.

279
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,620
You work with, uh...

280
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,260
Those other...

281
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,340
What's his name?

282
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,740
The place, uh...

283
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,280
That asshole.

284
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,160
Over by the...

285
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,660
The...

286
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,440
The stuff shop.

287
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,640
Yeah.

288
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,280
With those...

289
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,280


290
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,280


291
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,280


292
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,460
Those things.

293
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,700
Yeah, I have two of those, and I lost one.

294
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,980
Maybe you know where it is.

295
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,500
Have you met this guy?

296
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,600
Hi, my name's Lil' Fid.

297
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,240
Lil' Fid and I actually go way back.

298
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,060
We, uh...

299
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,840
We went to the same, uh...

300
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,180
Uh...

301
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,900
Inner city, uh...

302
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,260
Middle school together, where, uh...

303
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,080
We had zany adventures on Saturday mornings, uh...

304
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,360
Usually involving, uh...

305
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,320
Learning moral lessons.

306
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,320
If these underoos could talk.

307
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,880
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

308
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,220
I'd be happy to.

309
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,220


310
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,220


311
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,240
I'd be happy to.

312
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,240


313
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,240


314
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,260


315
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,260


316
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,260


317
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,140
Thought I recognized you from an after school special.

318
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,140
Uh, that and usually bulletins that flash in between them.

319
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,920
That is on a milk carton, even.

320
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,820
Maybe once.

321
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,340
Maybe that was Lil' Fid.

322
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,080
My work has been featured on milk cartons.

323
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,960
You can't spell bulletin without spelling it.

324
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,620
Bull.

325
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,960
Bull-eaton.

326
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,320
Have you gotten your bull-eaton today?

327
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,780
Have you gotten your daily dose of Thorazine urine?

328
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:44,940
No.

329
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,480
Urethrally absorbed.

330
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,400
Mmm.

331
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,160
Thorazine.

332
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,000
Perfect opportunity.

333
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,580
Thorazine.

334
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,140
There we go.

335
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,520
Oh, animal.

336
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,480
Oh, now you broke it.

337
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,580
Oh, I am slacking up here.

338
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:54,800
I am slacking.

339
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,880
It's not a slideshow anymore.

340
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,260
It's just a disaster.

341
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,480
Oh, that was all me.

342
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Fire the juggler.

343
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,820
Worst overlord ever.

344
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,780
Cool off the fire juggler.

345
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,960
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

346
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,540
Ha ha ha ha ha.

347
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,960
But with all this sunlight coming out, I think it's gonna dry up all that mud so we

348
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,420
can get a bunch of subgeniuses down in front of the stage tonight and, uh...

349
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,960
Yeah, we're gonna have dust wrestling now.

350
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,240
It's the best thing ever.

351
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


352
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


353
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,240


354
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:18,740
We're gonna have mud wrestling.

355
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,900
Yeah, and we'll just, uh...

356
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,220
Cancel the mud wrestling.

357
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,720
...cake them up.

358
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,640
But there's no schedule this year.

359
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,620
How's everybody gonna know when to do everything?

360
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,180
When will you know how to do the thing?

361
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,760
Well, some people think that when, uh, the thing starts, uh, you can...

362
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,740
It's gone completely sideways, dang.

363
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,120
...you can go over and see it.

364
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,060
It's gone completely sideways.

365
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,520
But if you miss it, uh, that's just your fault.

366
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,580
I went off and took a wee wee earlier by myself when it wasn't scheduled.

367
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,900
This isn't some sort of vacation.

368
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,240
You know, you can't just sit in one place for hours.

369
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,760
You can't just sit in one place for hours on end listening to people talk through microphones.

370
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,200
You need to go to the other places and listen to other people talk through microphones.

371
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,840
Try our new Google Hangouts stage.

372
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,140
Oh, and yeah, we'll have the SlackTube system running tonight, so, uh...

373
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,440
Yeah, over here on the Skype stage, we can only have so many people participate, but

374
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,680
over on the Google Hangouts stage, it's a really wide audience there.

375
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,960
You can all chime in on the side chat.

376
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,520
We're not gonna read it, of course.

377
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,120
And with the, with the hookups, we were going to do the, uh, the satellite sermons, so

378
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,180
people around the campground will be able to be heard live.

379
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,220


380
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,080
And, uh, we're gonna have a lot of people come in from the stage.

381
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,660
Oh, boy, we're gonna get so many likes.

382
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,700
Just think of all the likes we're gonna get, you guys.

383
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,240
All the shares.

384
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,580
I'm in it for the shares.

385
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,120
But none of those comments.

386
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,760
That's a little rich for my blood.

387
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,280
Touch the magic solar monkey.

388
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,580
It'll, it'll bless you.

389
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,060
It'll create, uh, diversion for the device that you're trying to control.

390
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,220
See, there you go.

391
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,480
Watch as Reverend Ivan Stang attempts to navigate the webiverse.

392
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
Coming through your door.

393
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,220


394
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,840
We'll see you live from Wisteria, watching everybody...

395
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,540
Back on track.

396
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:51,880
Back on track.

397
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,420
...using their computers and laptops and phones and tablets and mobile devices.

398
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,100
The Wi-Fi is just...

399
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,300
You know, I was, I, if anybody could bring a big screen television out Saturday afternoon,

400
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,380
that would be excellent.

401
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:13,060
And, and, and also if, uh, and maybe, uh, like an old console stereo, some reel-to-reel.

402
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,480
I, cause I like to stare at the, uh, the older devices.

403
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,500
Well, we'll, uh, we're looking to acquire some, uh, VHS players.

404
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,720
Uh, and we have...

405
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,420
I can play a mean VHS.

406
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,680
Yeah, we can string them up and, uh...

407
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,320
Play the hell out of one.

408
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,620
...you know, kind of like a wash, washtub bass.

409
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,880
I'm like the Jimi Hendrix of VHS players.

410
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,440
And now I'm seeing what is, what is known as pork orgy.

411
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,180
Is that pork?

412
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,760
The, the pork orgy.

413
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:38,980
That's, that's delightful.

414
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,560
Uh, Reverend Heathen has actually, uh...

415
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:41,680
Infinite pleasure.

416
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,680
...dismembered, uh, three or four, uh, infant long pigs.

417
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,440
And has, uh, provided...

418
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,160
...provided them in, uh, uh...

419
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,420
Post-molt long pigs.

420
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,640
...a delightful dish just braised with all of the, uh...

421
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,180
Smoked pig butt.

422
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:54,620
...it's the what?

423
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Smoked pig butt.

424
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,260
Smoked pig butt.

425
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,720
He's showing his ass.

426
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,200
Smoked pig butt. Reverend Smoked Pig Butt is here.

427
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:10,260
I saw him earlier over on the, on the main stage during the, uh, during the impromptu noise session.

428
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,780
Now that wasn't on the schedule.

429
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,940
But the noise seemed, uh, to show up.

430
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,400
Oh, the, the extemporaneous noise session.

431
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,720
Wasn't scheduled again.

432
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,200
I know, right?

433
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,520
But it's okay.

434
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,880
You know, we can, we can make our own schedule.

435
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:30,440
I think we'll, we'll, we'll use the hundred minute system and we'll start tracking it.

436
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:38,700
And we'll, we'll sell everybody commemorative watches that they can tediously monitor the activities around the camp.

437
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,980
But they're not gonna be smart watches, are they?

438
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,020
I'm, I'm concerned about the intelligence that I outsourced to my wrist.

439
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,420
We could, we could, we could use that.

440
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,540
We could use those dumb watches.

441
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,120
I don't have a smart watch. I've got a dumb watch.

442
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,640
Yeah, they take out too many civilians, though.

443
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,720
Actually, we're gonna use a sophisticated series of pagers.

444
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,160
And we will actually page everybody.

445
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,140
And we'll use, uh, numerical codes to indicate where you need to be and what kind of activity is happening.

446
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,600
I already have my pager inserted.

447
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,440
Cosmac, Dr., uh, Cosmac brought his pager.

448
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,860
But it's, uh, it's kind of a reverse pager. It lets everybody else hear your beeps.

449
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:23,800
But we were able to send out those, uh, those lovely, uh, saucer tones last night throughout Wisteria.

450
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,820
And, uh, there's, there's all of the madness creeping around.

451
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,480
But I feel like it, you know, as, as the sun goes down, the subgeniuses come out.

452
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,240
And you can see them scurrying through the rocks.

453
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,760
I think, I think oozing and, and, uh, writhing.

454
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,660
Carrying, carrying bottles of booze in their mouths.

455
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,240
Not necessarily scurrying.

456
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,460
Uh, kind of, kind of like a wiggle, a wriggling, a wriggling sensation.

457
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:45,840
Wriggling.

458
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,420
Coming out from the ground themselves.

459
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,560
Their heads peeking up.

460
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,960
Their eyes blinking.

461
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,680
Long lashes removing the dust.

462
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,980
And they're, they're, they're observing the areas around them.

463
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,080
Trying to find places where they can maybe steal somebody else's slack for a few minutes.

464
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,480
They're just gonna come up and leech off of them.

465
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,100
But it's okay.

466
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,940
There's, there's so much slack right now just radiating through all of the, uh, the pylons.

467
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,540
Hypercube has also set up the pylon system here.

468
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,600
So right now we have a surplus of slack.

469
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,700
Yeah, we've got a, we've got the resonators are, are definitely imbibing people.

470
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,820
So don't, don't feel bad.

471
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,480
You know, bring that subgenius over and, and make sure he's not one of the ones that was sent to kill you.

472
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,100
Uh, if anything, kill that subgenius first.

473
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,580
And the only way you're going to be able to do that is by opening up.

474
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,300
Chariot races to the death at dawn.

475
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,900
That's two out of three wins.

476
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,640
Flaming chariot races on the last day.

477
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,860
Well, uh, in the interest of full disclosure, we already did some practicing.

478
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,660
So we might have an edge on the chariot racing game.

479
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,720
I'm fine with that.

480
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,420
Okay.

481
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,180
I feel like a winner already.

482
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,900
Second place is first loser.

483
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,400
I had a shirt that said that.

484
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,240
It had a big dog with a thumbs up on it.

485
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,460
I got it from Sears.

486
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,840
That's the same place with my spring break t-shirts.

487
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,880
Hell yeah.

488
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,660
Some, some like fire on the sides.

489
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:19,900
Yeah.

490
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,560
You know, silk shirts with flames.

491
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,240
That's what we don't have enough silk shirts with flames.

492
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,460
We need some flaming fire jobs.

493
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,020
Fire hole jobs.

494
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,580
Fire hole jobs indeed.

495
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,240
Fire hole jobs.

496
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,400
And the lyrics to Freebird on the back.

497
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,120
The lyrics to Freebird tattooed around your fire hole.

498
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,220
That bird what resisted the yoke of tyranny.

499
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,920
Yes, if anybody hasn't arrived yet, uh, can bring the full lyrics.

500
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,260
Uh, just get out your dot matrix, uh, printer there and just, you know, take at least, I

501
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,200
think it's maybe a half hour, hour and a half.

502
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,120
And there's a, there's an army of Xerox machines here.

503
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,860
So just make sure you bring those with you.

504
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,620
Full size dot matrix on like 11, 14 spread.

505
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,300
And, uh, we'll take care of making sure that everyone else gets their, their copies.

506
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,820
And also please record the sound.

507
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,380
It's delightful.

508
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,720
And we're taking, we're recording everything to tape this year.

509
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,200
We're not doing anything on phones or computers.

510
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,620
Everything's being recorded to tape, uh, masking tape.

511
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,040
I have some duct tape as well.

512
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,320
So yeah, we'll have, we'll have several reels.

513
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,240
But it's been in the sun so it's not as sticky where it should be.

514
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,720
But if you, if you play it at the right speed, you'll get all the messages.

515
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,620
Oh, a message does come across when I get the duct tape out.

516
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,240
There's a little message coming off of the duct tape.

517
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,000
It's the, it's the message of the silence.

518
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,800
The fumes is how you know it's working.

519
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,600
Or fear.

520
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,180
But you just got that scrum just busting its ass.

521
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,880
It seems.

522
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,960
You know, I thought we weren't, I thought we weren't going to talk about that today.

523
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,780
I, uh, I had to.

524
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,580
You know what?

525
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,580
I've been containing myself long enough.

526
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:52,860
I think you're being possessed by the fake vid.

527
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,440
Okay.

528
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,300
That hasn't been told in memo about how we're going to keep scrum a secret.

529
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,180
Because if you haven't figured it out by now, uh, it's too late.

530
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,600
Well, just keep it between me and you.

531
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,380
Just, just you and I?

532
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:04,820
Yeah.

533
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,940
Yeah, I don't, I don't know anything about that, that garbage.

534
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,800
Uh oh, we've got a, uh.

535
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,280
It's a blessing and a curse.

536
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,420
It's a double-edged sword.

537
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,180
A crazed X Day attendee has just rushed the stage.

538
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:18,780
Damoclesisscrum.com.

539
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,720
He's now underneath.

540
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,200
Lick it.

541
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,280
I could make a toe sock out of that thing.

542
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,700
Someone in the audience said he's going to lick your toe.

543
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,260
I was just going to, so they know what, in what you were referring to tell them to lick.

544
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,360
Platinum memberships only get to lick the toes of, uh, Fox and, uh, Vid Chuli.

545
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,260
Platinum.

546
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,700
Platinum plus.

547
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,860
Platinum plus triple.

548
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,100
Platinum plus triple diamond.

549
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,020
I think you're looking for the diamond L members.

550
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,100
You don't have to believe me and you probably shouldn't.

551
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,140
You know, if you turn those D's around in Fid, it becomes Fib.

552
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,220
But we're just going to keep that between us too.

553
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,180
If you change all the letters around in Argus Fox.

554
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,100
Yeah, that happens.

555
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,180
Every time.

556
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,800
Every time.

557
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,980
Every time you switch those letters around.

558
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,160
Every time you switch those letters.

559
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,380
I think animal is spelled the same way backwards and forwards.

560
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,300
If you hit yourself in the head enough with a baseball bat.

561
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,640
A palandrom.

562
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,560
That is true.

563
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,060
A palindrom.

564
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,600
Palandrom.

565
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,840
Palindoms.

566
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,400
Palindoms.

567
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,440
It is when you write it in, uh.

568
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:25,960
Palindoms.

569
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,060
Palindoms.

570
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,120
That's how you might read it and it sounds in your head, but it actually speaks loud.

571
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,820
The script of the native Eastern Islanders.

572
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,460
Go fuck yourself.

573
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,060
Oh, that's one of the.

574
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,400
You can't say that on the, on, on.

575
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,340
Hey-o.

576
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,620
Radio.

577
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,980
Oh, we don't have a kazoo of censorship, so I'm just going free range.

578
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,140
I'm just going free range.

579
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,140


580
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,140


581
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,140


582
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,020
That's my bad.

583
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,420
Put a token in the jar animal.

584
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,120
There are delicate ears out there.

585
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,860
Oh, I'm awake now.

586
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,320
I'm awake.

587
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,580
That, you know, the.

588
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,340
I can't do the effing and the jeffing.

589
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,240
There are soft ears that can't handle that sort of.

590
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:52,900
Jeffrey.

591
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,780
There's no cuss like show cuss.

592
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,580
I will leave you back.

593
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,640
You can't say cuss on the radio.

594
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,820
Show cuss, po cuss.

595
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,220
You just.

596
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,860
Swear words.

597
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,060
No promises made.

598
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,560
Abra, abra, cadabra.

599
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,880
I want to reach out and grab ya.

600
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,920
I thought it was stab.

601
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,140
I thought it was stab.

602
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,140


603
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,140


604
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,140


605
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,140


606
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,140


607
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,400
I've been singing it wrong all these years and you gotta act it out with the knife.

608
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,260
Yeah, you just gotta practice.

609
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:19,800
You know.

610
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,020
I've been in this elevator before.

611
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,820
You keep your nose to the grindstone.

612
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,840
These don't fart all over here.

613
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,380
You straighten up.

614
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,260
You fly right.

615
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:25,580
It never opens.

616
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,800
You get squared away.

617
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,320
It never opens on the floor you want to get off on.

618
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:30,680
You get it together.

619
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,900
Pull yourself up by your boot straps.

620
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,420
If you get on one floor and go out and get on another elevator.

621
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,120
12B is really 413.

622
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,040
They can't fool me.

623
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,040


624
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,100
It'll just take you another week.

625
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,080
Note for an answer.

626
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,480
The elevators are actually self-aware.

627
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,120
I'm not a fan of elevators.

628
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,120


629
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,140
They, they, uh.

630
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,660
Sentient, I think is the word.

631
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,940
A sentient elevator.

632
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:45,440
Sentient.

633
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,360
That was in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

634
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,000
It was.

635
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,640
The sentient elevators.

636
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:48,960
It was.

637
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,000
In fact, it was in a few of those books that Douglas Adams possibly wrote himself that

638
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,260
probably paid small children in Malaysia to do.

639
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,240
Possibly, yes.

640
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,760
I think he outsourced that last couple of, um, the trilogy.

641
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,020
Once it turned into five.

642
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,820
Evil Brocks Pays It Safe.

643
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,160
That was definitely outsourced.

644
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,960
Yeah, I don't, I don't know how you can add to somebody else's story once they're,

645
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,620
once they're dead.

646
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,000
But I guess we've been doing that for a long time.

647
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,760
If there's one thing humans are good at, it's taking the works of dead people and just adding

648
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:19,760


649
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,060
Post the Ghostwriter Nevermore.

650
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,380
But we wouldn't know anything about that now.

651
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,260
I mean all the books, all the subgenius books, I mean most of the authors of the subgenius

652
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,260
books are here.

653
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:30,620
True and right and good.

654
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:37,300
So we actually have the ability to, uh, to blame the authors, the original authors, while

655
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,080
we're still here.

656
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,260
It's truth.

657
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,560
It is truth.

658
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,480
I think it's more like my, uh, Doogie Howser fan fiction.

659
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,400
Well, I've been checking his handwriting.

660
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:50,080
I've been asking, uh, Stang to write things out for me in longhand to make sure that I

661
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,480
know which books are real.

662
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,360
Oh, he's got awful handwriting.

663
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,400
Which one's written by him and which one's written by somebody else.

664
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,140
I think he's been cheating.

665
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,380
This is written in crayon.

666
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,800
That's, that's more like, yeah.

667
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,740
Grease pencil.

668
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,000
That's...

669
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,960
Finger paints.

670
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,320
I buy finger paints.

671
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,840
The brown finger paint that naturally comes from...

672
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,040
Keep that pencil greasy.

673
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,020
The natural finger paint reserves.

674
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:14,860
What?

675
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,540
Wiseria is known to be on a great finger paint reserve.

676
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,440
Just gushes right out of that, uh, beautiful lake.

677
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,120
Or pond, not a lake.

678
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,300
We call everything a lake in Florida.

679
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,600
And Florida's had so much fun.

680
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:34,200
And you know, we, uh, my, my wife, my recently legalized wife, we just legalized...

681
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,440
Things are getting legalized everywhere.

682
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,300
Legalized marriage here in, here in Florida.

683
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,680
Uh, Wisteria here at X Day.

684
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,540
But we, we left Florida and we went to Georgia for a little bit.

685
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,360
And we told them that we had come from Orlando.

686
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,580
And this is just a week or two after the shooting.

687
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
They said, wow, it sure has been rough down there.

688
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,900
I don't know how you can dee, you know, how some people can deal with tragedies like that.

689
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,280
And we said, yeah, we, uh, we know it's been kind of rough.

690
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,600
And they said, I mean, having your kid snatched up by an alligator, that's just terrible.

691
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,380
How could you live after something like that?

692
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:15,600
And we just nodded our heads and go, yep, that was definitely the worst thing that happened in Orlando in the past two weeks.

693
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,980
So, uh...

694
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,560
It's good that they're up on the current events.

695
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,760
And know what's important in life.

696
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,620
But those t-shirts are still available.

697
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,780
So you can still order your, your, your Reverend Fox Disney World Lunch Club t-shirts from the Hypercube store.

698
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,660
Alligator snack packs now available.

699
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,200
I wanted to try and make a costume for the costume ball.

700
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,220
I don't know if I'm going to have enough time to do that.

701
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,220
What's the kid's toy with that meal?

702
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,580
The kid's toy with that meal?

703
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,840
What was the child holding as it was being devoured by the...

704
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,940
A reattachable arm.

705
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,580
There you go.

706
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:47,700
Prosthetic.

707
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,620
All kids have off...

708
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,420
All kids have off...

709
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:49,780
Prosthetic limbs.

710
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,540
That was, I should have put that on the shirt.

711
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,440
I should have put that on the shirt.

712
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,380
All kids have off.

713
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,980
Yeah, that's what you should have done.

714
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
Thanks, thanks for, thanks for the hindsight, 80.

715
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,080
Back to the drawing board.

716
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,800
Burn them all.

717
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,880
Drawing boards.

718
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,840
We don't have, well, actually no, we do have drawing boards.

719
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,920
I brought one myself.

720
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,620
I tried drawing on a board.

721
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,340
That's what I should do.

722
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,660
I should get out my dry erase board so I can do my eponym check.

723
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,720
People on the microphones kept yelling at me.

724
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,420
And for those with the platinum membership that can see this video live, they'll be able to see what I've written.

725
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,780
Drawing board with Reverend Fox.

726
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:34,400
Watch as Reverend Fox sits and draws and bores the shit out of me.

727
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,600
Oh, now I did it.

728
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,400
In real time.

729
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:47,460
I actually set up a feed so people could watch me draw my little Simpsons cart, the Stinsons, the Stinsons, that's their names.

730
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:53,660
Because we don't, we don't want to promote any unauthorized work here.

731
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,520
That would be wrong.

732
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,620
You know, there are registered trademarks out there and you need to observe those registered trademarks.

733
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,360
You can't just do whatever you want with someone else's registered trademarks.

734
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,140
Or possibly McMurphysboro.

735
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,880
Where do they hail from?

736
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:10,780
From who?

737
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,380
The Stimpsons.

738
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,600
The Stinsons?

739
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,860
Yeah, Murphysboro.

740
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,800
And I'm not going to tell you in which state.

741
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,880
But yes, the Stinsons from Murphysboro.

742
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:34,060
And, but more people were watching other people getting yelled at on their phones last night.

743
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,540
So.

744
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,960
I guess nobody wants to watch me do my terrible drawings.

745
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,900
I tried to watch you do your terrible drawings and you just ended up playing Team Fortress 2 the whole time.

746
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,940
Yeah, there's that too.

747
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,740
So.

748
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,840
That was.

749
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,000
We can't always be productive.

750
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,800
Can't always be as good as when you're playing Team Fortress 2.

751
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,880
I just remembered something.

752
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,160
Let me have this for a minute.

753
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,380
I just remembered something, friends.

754
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,320
Today's Friday, right?

755
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,060
Yes.

756
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,360
That means tomorrow's Saturday.

757
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,260
That is correct.

758
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,740
That is very correct.

759
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:16,500
That's one of the few things that is on the schedule is that the Bobtism is tomorrow.

760
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,800
And I guess we better decide when.

761
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,600
Now judging by today, nobody really gets moving until about 3 o'clock.

762
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,100
I think you should just ring the bell.

763
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,860
I don't unshackle them until 4.

764
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,540
Ring the bell for the Bobtism.

765
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,840
Well, there aren't that many people in here right now.

766
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,000
So spread the word.

767
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,600
Let's plan to do the Bobtism about 3 o'clock at the pond.

768
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,720
Not here.

769
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,680
There is a pond.

770
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,440
Touché.

771
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,720
Yeah, there is a pond down there.

772
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,660
It's a bit of a walk actually.

773
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,100
And you don't have to be naked or nothing.

774
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,960
In fact, if you don't want to get in the water, we'll just sprinkle you.

775
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,160
But we usually get in the water.

776
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,440
I keep my clothes on.

777
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,300
Don't worry.

778
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,440
So does Dr. Hal.

779
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,680
You can do anything you want.

780
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:22,140
But yeah, tomorrow is the Bobtism and therefore also the party, which is when I guess everybody really drinks a lot or something.

781
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:22,860
I don't know.

782
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,500
And if you have a weird costume, you can wear that then.

783
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,440
We've just been practicing for that party.

784
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,720
Starting then, yeah.

785
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,640
Yeah, starting then.

786
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,700
So it's like you go to the Bobtism, you get filthy with life.

787
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,020
Other life forms.

788
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,780
You can shower it off or you can wear them to the party.

789
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,120
And yeah.

790
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
And your new friends along.

791
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,520
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,000
Invite your new friends along to the party.

793
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,520
And what else?

794
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:48,820
Yeah.

795
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:56,000
That means, oh, Andrew the Impaled and Circus Apocalypse will be performing tomorrow night.

796
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,360
Which means we'll probably burn Bob right after that.

797
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,000
Wow.

798
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,760
So those of you who have a band, you'll be playing tomorrow night.

799
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:14,060
But at some point, Andrew and David Apocalypse will get up there and destroy everything.

800
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,700
And then we'll burn Bob, I hope.

801
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,680
I'm going to add one more thing to that schedule.

802
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,220
We have our 100th episode of X Day 19 Podcast happening tomorrow.

803
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,840
And where and when would that be?

804
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,420
That will be on the Google Hangout stage at 1 o'clock.

805
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,840
Or?

806
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,780
Or 11 to 2.

807
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,500
Be there or be somewhere else.

808
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,100
Now, what is this?

809
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,600
The 100th episode of the Thorazine Urine Pod Crust X Day Special.

810
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,200
You still haven't edited any more than the first two, right?

811
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:48,800
Should we?

812
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,840
This is episode 100.

813
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,020
Do we have to?

814
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:56,160
No, we're not going to let the fact that there's only two episodes stop us from celebrating our 100th episode.

815
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,580
We're swimming through the crust of the pods as we speak, guys.

816
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,420
If there were a literal and not just a proverbial editing room floor.

817
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,620
We'd all be dead right now under so much tape.

818
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,320
But we're getting the good bits further down.

819
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,620
I'll probably turn all this crap on again tomorrow.

820
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,960
And if you guys want to do some of it here or do it there, I don't.

821
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:23,180
But we will have to go down to the medicine fish hole, as it were, the pond.

822
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,480
And at 3 o'clock.

823
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,500
I heard a song about that place.

824
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,400
Only about half the people here will actually make it.

825
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,640
I predict.

826
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,980
I can't be naked under doctor's orders.

827
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,940
I blinded that NASA astronaut that was looking through the Hubble.

828
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,720
Uh-huh.

829
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,800
Oh, that's the other thing.

830
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,840
I have a drone with a camera on it.

831
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,060
I mean, it's a really fancy camera drone.

832
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,800
So just the most flattering angles will be shown and recorded.

833
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:56,800
Well, years ago, we had the subgeniuses spell out Bob's name in asses pointed at the sky.

834
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,500
It's hard to point at the sky.

835
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,380
I do it like this.

836
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,300
That'll do.

837
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,660
You only need one butt on either end for the quote marks.

838
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:14,960
But it requires like 46 people to spell out Bob properly if you want to get the Bs to look right.

839
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,660
I worked this out on graph paper and Minecraft.

840
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:30,360
But if we could, if we can get that many people together, maybe on Sunday, there will hopefully be enough people to spell Bob.

841
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:30,360


842
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:36,680
I can fly the drone up so it's looking from an axis point of view and finally get the picture.

843
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,180
8-bit Bob.

844
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,580
And if it doesn't work, we can Photoshop it.

845
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:47,060
Now, if everybody's bent over in the same way and the drone is about at a 45-degree angle, it might show butts.

846
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,400
It doesn't have to be a bare butt, I suppose, but those would show up better.

847
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,120
You should battle…

848
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,500
For most of us with pale white fish belly skin butts.

849
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,240
You should.

850
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:57,740
You should.

851
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,340
You should.

852
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,520
I, of course, have to fly the drone.

853
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,300
I'd love to be up there on the front lines with you, but they need me here.

854
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,760
I should practice that drone and charge up those batteries.

855
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,840
I'm glad that…

856
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,820
It's good drone crashing.

857
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,260
I can't believe it's already Friday.

858
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,680
It's what?

859
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,700
It's good drone crashing weather right now.

860
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,200
Actually, it's not.

861
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,680
There's no wind at all.

862
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,380
It's perfect.

863
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,360
We need you to send that up so we can generate some wind.

864
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,280
Right.

865
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,880
That'll help generate more wind.

866
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,320
Reverend Stang's drone could battle Doc Ock.

867
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,100
Doc Ock's drone.

868
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,800
To the death.

869
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:30,980
To the death.

870
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,600
Did you bring the drone?

871
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:31,840
To the death.

872
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,820
Is it a big expensive drone or a little bitty?

873
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,660
I've got a really heavy, big expensive drone.

874
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,980
He's just dragging.

875
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,940
It's not that big.

876
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,340
It's not that big.

877
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,140
Man, mine's eight inches, baby.

878
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,100
Here we are, hitchhiking to get here and no, $35.

879
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,420
That's where these drones are going, huh?

880
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:50,700
Yeah.

881
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,520
Well, actually, Reverend Zaphod gave us the drone and that laptop and that recorder right

882
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:57,760
there.

883
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:05,140
And, uh, yeah, the other laptop actually, come to think of it.

884
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,860
You praise Reverend Zaphod.

885
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,080
Praise Zaphod.

886
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,140
That's the schedule now.

887
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,780
To Zaphod.

888
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:10,900
To Zaphod.

889
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,480
Three o'clock at the pond and that's the one thing I would ask you to tell other people

890
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,960
if you can remember through your drunken and froppant-ness.

891
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,980
Can someone post that on MySpace, please?

892
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,560
Yeah.

893
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,800
Well, that's what we ought to do.

894
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,600
Just paste it on the 19X Day page.

895
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,820
That's what everybody does instead of attending.

896
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,280
That's what everybody does instead of attending.

897
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,260
Yeah.

898
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,620
Actually, even when they're here.

899
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,680
Can someone post that on Ello?

900
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,280
They're watching the show.

901
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,480
I think everybody's on Ello now.

902
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,160
I posted a ton of stuff today.

903
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,540
Can you Snapchat that?

904
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,460
Three o'clock.

905
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,000
Be there.

906
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,640
Bob-tism to borrow.

907
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,820
I'm going to post that right now.

908
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,280
I won't be there.

909
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,640
Well, you know, I was wondering though, I've noticed a few people who seem to be allergic

910
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,440
to water.

911
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,840
So, there might be an issue with the Bob-tism of people exploding.

912
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,220
I'm allergic to nudity.

913
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,260
I've, uh, because I'm allergic to water.

914
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,260


915
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,260


916
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,260


917
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,260


918
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,260


919
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,260


920
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,040
I want to harbor all my sins and travails.

921
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,080
I don't want to just give them away to the lake for nothing.

922
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,720
But you don't have to give it away to the lake.

923
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,040
You can give it away to our old friend, Sequa.

924
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,340
Sequa.

925
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:11,940
Sequa.

926
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,760
Sequa.

927
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,840
Living near the very bottom of that abandoned mine shaft filled with hundreds of human corpses.

928
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,220
Infinite pleasures.

929
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,240
Old Sequa will come up and give you a nip and let you know that, hey, it's a good thing

930
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:27,240


931
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,100
it's your turn, buddy.

932
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:36,420
And then you too can join history and become one of the scales on Sequa's back.

933
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,180
From PR News in Washington, I'm in federal custody.

934
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,140
The chair of the Federal Reserve says she doesn't 69.

935
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,240
So, to me, it's not a first line of but.

936
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,060
In violation of PR News.

937
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,100
On Wall Street, 14th, 16th, German Chancellor Angela Merkel still sweeping the table.

938
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,300
Merkel criticized PR News.

939
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,220
Tarnished the public opinion.

940
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,220
Margaret says this is PR News.

941
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,200
Oh, yes, dear friends.

942
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:09,940
We're back with more readings from the subgenius cyclopedia of slack, the Bobliagraphon.

943
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,420
Reading from chapter five, the conspiracy chapter.

944
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:22,180
I'm going to continue from where we left off last week on page 98, where it says, we pay

945
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,860
the conspiracy to take our money away.

946
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,800
That's their job.

947
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,760
It's what the conspiracy is.

948
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,520
It's not so much that they rule over us.

949
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,920
It's that we live, breathe and eat the conspiracy.

950
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,900
It's what we live in.

951
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,340
The conspiracy is the fishbowl and the water we swim in.

952
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,680
They don't consciously take our slack away.

953
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,560
They trample slack without ever knowing of its existence.

954
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,800
But this will in fact lead to their downfall.

955
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,780
Even the unthinking 10,000 year world.

956
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,640
The war on slack must grind to a halt when, thanks to their slack ignorance, the world

957
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,620
economy finally caves in on itself.

958
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,800
The free world is grossly overpriced.

959
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,940
There's really only one airline left, but that's okay with them because they own it.

960
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:18,160
There's really only one publisher left, but that's okay because they own it.

961
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:23,840
Only one TV network left, only one internet provider, only one political party, but that's

962
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,720
all okay because they own it.

963
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,200
Everything is under control, they say.

964
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,580
Right.

965
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:38,280
The craziest 1890s steam engine train engineer in the world is at the helm of spaceship Earth.

966
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:44,340
Our whole planetary vehicle is careening out of control with drunken madmen at the wheel

967
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,700
and none of them are Bob.

968
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,640
What then is to be our destination?

969
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,960
The moon?

970
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,080
The future?

971
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,100
No friends, it's Hooterville.

972
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,760
Our future?

973
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,000
The future, under the conspiracy, is a bad sitcom that never ends.

974
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,000
Already, most cities are like something from a science fiction movie.

975
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,600
An old science fiction movie.

976
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,640
The further north you go in any city, the more it becomes like a clockwork orange.

977
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,520
On the south side, it's more like Blade Runner.

978
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,540
Out in the sticks, Road Warrior.

979
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,400
The mass media news?

980
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,600
That's not even like science fiction anymore.

981
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,580
But tacky surrealism.

982
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:33,180
We're being adjusted to accept the idea that at any moment, anything can happen, including

983
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,460
the unimaginable and the impossible, but mostly the unlikely.

984
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,080
Once they've gotten you to believe one impossible thing, you can get yourself to believe damn

985
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,900
near any impossible thing, such as that it's all for your own good.

986
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,380
Friends, are you prepared to be really paranoid?

987
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,580
A little pre-conceived.

988
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,080
We, paranoia, never hurt anybody.

989
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,920
Don't worry about being called a kook.

990
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,460
We used to call the John Birchers kooks, them and all those other rabidly right-wing anti-communists,

991
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,960
when they were hollering that the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations

992
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,600
would take over the world.

993
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,760
But by gobs, they were right.

994
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,340
The kooks were right.

995
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:23,660
Totalitarian commies did take over the world, disguised as right-wing industrialists disguised

996
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,420
as Christians.

997
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,580
We called the Christians kooks for worrying about the mark of the beast that the Antichrist

998
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,920
would make everyone wear on their hands and forehead.

999
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,000
Well, guess what, mocker?

1000
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,560
There is a mark of the beast on your hand and on your forehead.

1001
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,220
The one on your hand is your thumbprint, and thanks to face recognition software, the one

1002
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,060
on your head is your face.

1003
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,060
You don't need a barcode tattooed on your forehead.

1004
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,400
Your face is the mark of the beast.

1005
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,220
They've been scientifically perfecting their various contradictions for centuries.

1006
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:09,280
We're like some gland owner's dumbasticated dogs, so well trained that when one bargain

1007
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:16,200
basement bin Laden drizzles stale pee on the shriveled little bush in our front yard, we

1008
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,840
all instinctively start howling and slobbering and peeing all over every bit of foliage for

1009
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,440
miles around.

1010
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,380
While our owners love it.

1011
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:24,380


1012
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,160
They laugh at us.

1013
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:31,880
Using television, they taught us a whole new language whereby war in the Middle East really

1014
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,120
means two for one sale at Walmart.

1015
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:42,460
Even the tiniest, seemingly most insignificant details are set up to make less sense.

1016
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,860
Ever notice that everything in the stores costs say $19.95 or $19.89 instead of just

1017
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,820
a straight up $20?

1018
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,380
When they say only 69 cents, we both know that they've really done something wrong.

1019
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,240
They've taken our perfectly good 70 cents and wrecked it.

1020
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,200
Bob prophesied.

1021
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,440
It's going to be a bummer, man.

1022
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,960
Prophecy fulfilled.

1023
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,940
And so we're now told about a new mutant disease every month.

1024
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,780
Jesus said, you will hear of SARS and rumors of SARS.

1025
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,160
What nanobots lurk in the government's smallpox shots?

1026
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,180
How much will we have to pay later to have them removed?

1027
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:28,840
Already the conspiracy has government pee inspectors analyzing your urine every time

1028
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:34,160
you flush, tracking you via your toilet so that, for instance, you can be sued retroactively

1029
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,820
for lying to the insurance company about your drug or vitamin use.

1030
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:44,120
The next step, of course, will be identity theft via urinary traces of your DNA and psychic

1031
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,800
stench.

1032
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,420
That's p-psychic, p-stench.

1033
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,180
Each time you flush down an unapproved chemical, whether you peed it or not.

1034
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,160
You might have to pay for it.

1035
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:57,200
You might as well be signing away your children to the slave camps of tomorrow.

1036
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,520
Oh, I'm sorry, patriot camps.

1037
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,100
That's right.

1038
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,260
It's all become so dirty.

1039
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:10,280
The inevitable fad of reality TV finally came full circle with the ongoing oil war mini-series.

1040
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,380
But it's all so sterile.

1041
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,420
One almost misses chillin' with the Cold War, which was somehow cooler.

1042
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,040
But as long as they can make you worry about how you smell.

1043
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,540
Whether your poo stinks.

1044
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,340
If you're wearing the right deodorant.

1045
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,640
Whether or not your stomach will get you through the day.

1046
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:34,440
The endless conveyor belt of cheap crap will distract you from real slack.

1047
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,220
Sometimes they want you to fight them.

1048
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,840
Because that's an impossible battle that you can't win.

1049
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,280
Leaving you exhausted and defenseless.

1050
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,720
And in need of more cheap crap.

1051
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,380
Oh yes, it's all very paranoi-ing.

1052
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,400
It started with breathalyzer tests.

1053
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,880
Then they moved up to pee-alyzers.

1054
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,180
Then vot-alyzers.

1055
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,860
And now they even have a machine that can tell if you're thinking.

1056
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,200
It's called a TV.

1057
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,300
If it's off, you're guilty.

1058
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:14,500
It's said that less than a hundred people control all the big corporations, armies,

1059
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,760
governments and mass media in the world.

1060
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,500
And that most of them are into Bob.

1061
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,560
Actually it's less than ten people and they all do know Bob.

1062
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,940
But you have never heard any of their names.

1063
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,900
Cause see friends, if you know his name, he's not one of the puppeteers.

1064
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,700
Just one of the puppets.

1065
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,120
You never see the puppeteers.

1066
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,020
You can't follow the strings up that far.

1067
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,620
If you could, it'd be easy to cut them.

1068
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,140
But nowadays there are puppets that can work other puppets.

1069
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,740
And it's puppet working puppet.

1070
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,680
As far up the line as you can see.

1071
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,900
Even the puppets don't know where they are in the hierarchy.

1072
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,020
Only the ones that work the puppets.

1073
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,500
Only the ones who aren't operating a marionette themselves know exactly where they are.

1074
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,880
The bottom.

1075
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:07,440
And you, dear subgenius reader or listener, are probably not engaged in pulling anybody's

1076
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
strings right this minute.

1077
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,940
It's economic Darwinism.

1078
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,300
Survival of the richest.

1079
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,040
The decks are manufactured already stacked for the winners.

1080
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,020
The guys who put the evil in evil.

1081
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:23,020


1082
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:23,640
The evolution.

1083
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,540
Talk about not wanting to make waves.

1084
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,260
They finally got things just the way they want them.

1085
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,740
The times, they were a changing.

1086
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,880
But that may end.

1087
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:41,600
Now that the rich are firmly rich and the poor are securely poor, the conspiracy as

1088
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:47,700
a whole would benefit if all change were to stop.

1089
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,000
We must not let this happen.

1090
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,000


1091
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,480
Let this stopping begin.

1092
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,000
We must spend our time getting slack.

1093
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,860
Because time itself may be running out.

1094
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,280
Oil shortage.

1095
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,280
Water shortage.

1096
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,180
Air shortage.

1097
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,580
Those are as nothing compared to what the conspiracy would like to see.

1098
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,120
A ewe shortage.

1099
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:20,520
Because it's gradual, people don't even notice the world ending when that day finally comes

1100
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,980
on which everything locks up and freezes into nothing.

1101

A particularly galant area of land is inhabited by a techуляella.

1110
00:45:52,980 --> 00:46:00,480
the center of a conspiracy of slack. Are they right? The shakedown started long ago, but who

1111
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:08,580
will go in the dome and who will stay out is being decided today. The cultural gestalto asks you for

1112
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:16,040
your papers. Will you resist? You sure don't want to get caught resisting. They have this new drug

1113
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,980
called Camp X-Ray that they give you that makes you think you've been held in prison for months

1114
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:27,020
without even being charged. And they have an even worse drug called false slack that makes you think

1115
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:31,220
you've been sitting in your house watching imaginary people's fake lives on TV for years

1116
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:38,600
and years instead of living a real life of your own. You can only see the retardation for what it

1117
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:44,880
is after you've removed yourself from it for a while. The less TV you watch, the more obvious

1118
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,700
is the brainwashing when you do watch it. The conspiracy knows you know this, so they pretend

1119
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:50,960
that you're not a part of it.

1120
00:46:50,980 --> 00:47:00,200
They crank out programming that is deliberately so dumb that you find yourself thinking,

1121
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:06,820
I can't believe how stupid this is. People watch this? This is so fantastically stupid,

1122
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:13,020
I could sit here forever transfixed and marveling at how stupid people must be to watch this.

1123
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,720
Those incredibly dumb shows are their way of openly, brazenly,

1124
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:28,680
gloating about what cows we are. Break free of the matrix, screams every cable TV sci-fi thriller

1125
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:36,860
after these messages. Gil Scott Heron said, the revolution will not be televised. He was wrong.

1126
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:42,940
Not only was the revolution televised, but Nike sponsored it. Television, unfortunately,

1127
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,260
was not revolutionized, so the whole thing ended up as just another show.

1128
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,320
Friends,

1129
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,700
we subgeniuses are proud to be called kooks by the rest of the media,

1130
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,240
if that keeps us out of the same boat with them.

1131
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:08,780
And I guess I should leave off now. We'll continue reading from the conspiracy chapter

1132
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:19,940
of the Bob Leografon, Cyclopedia of Slack. Yeah. Friends, the music in the background was by

1133
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:20,700
Cybertonic.

Ha haaah.

1137
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,040

A cup turned up for her to drink down all the years

1153

All the lips to die for and heart that made

1154
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,240
Picking up the paper she leaves

1155
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,400
If she can't change what the world has made

1156
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,100
All of this because there's no one in vain

1157
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:22,460
Am I am I a little stone?

1158
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,740
Am I am I a little stone?

1159
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,140
Oh, if I could have found out

1160
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,720
That she danced on a mountain

1161
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,760
Knowing everything

1162
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,040
What her rhymes should say

1163
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,080
She would have been a little stone

1164
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,200
So entertaining, yeah

1165
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,900
Oh, if I could have had a lesson

1166
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,660
Fancy a magic dance on a table

1167
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,040
For student boys, stars, and to a brain

1168
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,140
Am I am I a little stone?

1169
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,820
Am I am I a little stone?

1170
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:18,120
Am I am I a little stone?

00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:18,120


1172
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,840
Oh, sweet freedom

1173
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:25,380
Sweet and low, carry me home

1174
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,840
Oh, sweet freedom

1175
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,500
I will not destroy for this love

1176
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,980
For the next time

1177
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,960
For the last time

1178
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:59,740
Oh I we will never forget

1179
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:11,400
The little stone that she saw

1180
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,160
I did not stop by, I did not see him fall

1181
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:20,540
Oh, I never wanted to watch him ever turn disaster

1182
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:27,320
Every step the building blocks me from another

1183
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:35,660
Where do I run when this kingdom's rain came down like so much glass?

1184
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,500
Where am I, am I?

1185
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,980
Am I a little stone?

A little stone?

00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,760
Am I, am I?

1191
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,940
A honeycomb?

1192
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,480
Oh, sweet honeycomb

1193
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,180
Sweet freedom

00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,920

00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,840

Sweet allowon

1198
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,920
Carry me home

00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,340
Sweet freedom

00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,540
Sweet allowon

00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,520

Oh, sweet freedom

Sweet allowon

1204
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,360
Carry me home

1205
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:56,500
Reverend Andrew Genis did that song, Empire, at 18X Day.

1206
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:03,100
And I guess it would be okay to mention that you can find her music if you look for the name Robin Renee.

1207
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,080
She's produced CDs in many different styles.

1208
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,000
And if you Google around, you can find them.

1209
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:16,040
Renee is spelled R-E-N-E-E.

1210
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,480
Robin Renee.

1211
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,760
And this is another unusual episode.

1212
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:27,440
You can hear Dammit the Hound Dog baying in the background, I think.

1213
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:35,040
The first half of this show was three of the Thorazine Urine Pod Crust crew,

1214
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,480
guest hosting a live hour slack at Wisteria during nightfall.

1215
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,040
19X Day last summer.

1216
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,500
Those three of the crew being Reverend Argus Fox,

1217
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,860
Reverend Anna Maul,

1218
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,000
and Reverend Fid Chewy.

1219
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,080
And the rest of this episode will be poetry.

1220
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,040
Yeah, because why not?

1221
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,340
Two short poems.

1222
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,220
First, a recitation by Dr. Howell.

1223
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,180
This is by a California poet, Robinson Jeffers.

1224
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,780
And it is about that maligned creature, the vulture.

1225
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:20,260
I had walked since dawn and lay down to rest on a bare hillside above the ocean.

1226
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:27,660
I saw, through half-shut eyelids, a vulture wheeling high up in heaven.

1227
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:35,720
And presently, it passed again, but lower and nearer, its orbit narrowing.

1228
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,980
I understood then that I was under inspection.

1229
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,480
I lay, death still, and heard the flight feathers whistle above me,

1230
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,320
make their circle and come nearer.

1231
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:57,420
I could see the naked red head between the great wings, bare downward, staring.

1232
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,220
I said, my dear bird, we are wasting time here.

1233
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,700
These old bones will still be there.

1234
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,220
They will still work.

1235
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,280
They are not for you.

1236
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,460
But how beautiful he looked, gliding down on those great sails.

1237
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:20,060
How beautiful he looked, veering away in the sea light over the precipice.

1238
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:25,240
I tell you solemnly that I was sorry to have disappointed him,

1239
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,840
to be eaten by that beak,

1240
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,160
to become part of him,

1241
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,740
to share those wings, those eyes.

1242
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,680
What a sublime...

1243
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,540
What a sublime end to one's body.

1244
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,720
What an enskyment.

1245
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,920
What a life after death.

1246
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:53,120
When I got the call, her voice, tense, hesitant, uncertain.

1247
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,700
Honey, do you know what I just found?

1248
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,460
Out in the backyard?

1249
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,800
A strip of flesh.

1250
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,300
Her voice, hesitant with suggestion.

1251
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,760
I knew what she was thinking.

1252
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:14,360
My fascinations, crime and serial killers, my dark humor and looming darkness.

1253
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,540
She finally found what she'd expected.

1254
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,180
A strip of flesh.

1255
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:25,320
Well, it was skin actually, not really muscle mass, not flesh.

1256
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:29,520
It makes a difference, you know, to know anatomy that intimately.

1257
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,120
But not to her.

1258
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,360
So I told her, to comfort her.

1259
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,680
A strip of flesh.

1260
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:35,680


1261
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,360
A strip of flesh.

1262
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:42,660
It's just a dog toy, a piece of rawhide, uncurled, slimy and pliant from the rain.

1263
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,740
I'm so glad you called to tell me you found it.

1264
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,500
I'll be right home.

1265
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:51,600
Creepy.

1266
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:58,320
An alarming find written and said by Dr. Lee Cipher.

1267
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,860
Reverend Dr. Lee Cipher, that is.

1268
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,820
Thank you, dammit.

1269
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,660
And to end the show, we'll let puzzling friends,

1270
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,300
Dr. Philo and Dr. Howell of the Puzzling Evidence Show,

1271
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:14,120
take us out with just a bit more poetry by Dr. Seuss in this case.

1272
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:19,060
Mile high towers made of gleaming chromium

1273
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:25,520
with overhead spiral ramps and quizzing monorails under a giant blasting dome.

1274
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,380
In between, we involve time and space.

1275
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,660
This is the city of the future.

1276
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,040
Let's go, John.

1277
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,300
This is the city of the future?

1278
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,300
Bringing absolute power to destroy the other nature.

1279
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,200
Welcome to greater cosmopolis and rocket port.

1280
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:41,900
Three minutes.

1281
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,600
Seven million human beings live under the dome in the giant...

1282
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,660
Now I don't know what to do.

1283
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,420
Solar power.

1284
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,480
She will formulate serious and precise with the pose of the insolent...

1285
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,640
No, we need a real arm.

1286
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,600
...is a female two-headed transatlantic...

1287
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,880
...into the bedrock of the planet...

1288
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,560
...movie nowadays.

1289
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,800
...and three heads and black, white and Chinese.

1290
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:02,500
Yeah.

1291
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,620
...in the middle of...

1292
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,200
Oh, my gosh.

1293
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:04,640
...the future.

1294
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,600
It has something to do with being real tiny.

1295
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,360
You know, they're not in atomic sync with this world and time.

1296
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,000
They're kind of like the Who, the Who's on the fluffball in that...

1297
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,320
Yes.

1298
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,040
...Dr. Seuss story.

1299
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,840
Yes, in Horton, here's the Who.

1300
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:26,400
Only he with his giant elephantine ears could hear the mayor of Whoville.

1301
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,140
On the 15th of May,

1302
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:39,300
in the jungle of Newel, in the heat of the day, in the cool of the pool, he was splashing,

1303
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,380
enjoying the jungle's great joys...

1304
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:42,980
Yeah, look at them, they're little...

1305
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,460
...when Horton the elephant heard a small noise.

1306
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,400
...swept water girls and the rafts.

1307
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,600
We called him Mutant.

1308
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:51,840
You know?

1309
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,400
Mutant.

1310
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:53,760
Mutant.

1311
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,400
Mutant.

1312
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,200
Mutant.

1313
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,480
Mutant.

1314
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:57,560
Mutant.

1315
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:00,040
Mutant.

1316
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:00,900
Mutant.

1317
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:01,620
Mutant.

1318
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:02,120
Mutant.

1319
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,120


1320
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,120


1321
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,120


1322
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,120


1323
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:02,120


1324
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,560
Mutant.

1325
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:03,800
Mutant.

1326
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,660
Mutant.

1327
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,460
But he found a more beautiful girl.

1328
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,360
What do you think of this story?

1329
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:15,360


1330
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:15,360


1331
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:15,360


1332
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,300
And if you've been listening to the SubGenius Radio Ministry,

1333
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,100
this is our hour of...

1334
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:21,360
Our hour of...

1335

1351
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,340
Praise Bob!

1352
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,400
Ah, my dear internet listening friends.

1353
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,760
Yes, yes, yes, the harvest.

1354
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,840
For you know, friends, the annual Slack Friday sale is on.

1355
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:04,000
It lasts from now until just before Existence-less-ness-ness.

1356
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:09,620
And that means you can buy two Subgenius ordainments for the price of one.

1357
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:15,860
That's right, two ordainment kits, normally a $70 value for the price of one.

1358
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,300
Only $35!

1359
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:25,100
And it's been $35 for about 10 years now, so prices may go up after this sale.

1360
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,180
Just saying.

1361
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:29,820
You can have us send both packages to you.

1362
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,780
Or one to you and one to a friend.

1363
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,620
Or two to two friends.

1364
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,520
Or one friend.

1365
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,640
Or damn near anything.

1366
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:40,520
Just go to subgenius.com and start a-clickin'.

1367
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:44,480
You can't miss the twofer Slack Friday sale.

1368
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:51,160
Not only does the recipient become a truly ordained minister, the real kind, that can perform weddings.

1369
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,040
But you also get all this keen stuff.

1370
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,560
Like two Subgenius pamphlets.

1371
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:59,780
A big doctorate of the Forbidden Son.

1372
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,860
An all-inclusive excuse document.

1373
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,800
Both of those are large and suitable for framing.

1374
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,200
An 8x10 of J.R. Bob Dobbs, of course.

1375
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,760
Two vinyl bumper stickers.

1376
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,580
Several postcards.

1377
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,540
A decoder pen, although you'll have to decode it.

1378
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:22,060
The famous minister's card, inspired by Pope Bob's Discordian Pope card.

1379
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,060
Only real.

1380
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,920
And what else?

1381
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,140
Loads of instructions.

1382
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,320
Mystic diagrams.

1383
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,700
Artwork for your walls or prisons.

1384
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:35,580
Sell recruitment materials for sucking more seekers into the cult.

1385
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:40,320
Friends, why, the fun is limited only by your imagination.

1386
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,380
And I know that if you've listened this far, you're one sick kitten indeed.

1387
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,140
And probably have quite an imagination.

1388
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,140
Praise Bob.

1389
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:54,160
That's Subgenius at Post Office Box 181417.

1390
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,340
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1391
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:57,900
Or...

1392
01:01:58,580 --> 01:01:59,820
The Texas Address.

1393
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:05,480
Stang at P.O. Box 807.

1394
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:10,800
Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1395
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:11,980
Praise Bob.
