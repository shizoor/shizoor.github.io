1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
At the moment, I'm thinking about my reputation.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,560
You're going to marry me, Bob.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,980
Listen, I've told you how it's going to be, and you might as well get used to the idea.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,300
Because if I have to, I'll smear you, Bob.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,360
I'll ruin you for the hour of slack.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,140
From PR News in Washington, I'm suffering two years of declines.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,140
President Obama is appealing for an anti-Islam video,

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,440
but said the video justifies an attack or any other violence.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,200
President Obama said he understands why crude and disgusting people took offense.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,840
At a time when anyone with a cell phone is obsolete.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,660
PR News.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,040
The latest snapshot shows an increase in major percent.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,260
A 16.6% increase in 5.4%.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,980
Analysts say they order a suspected drunk driver

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,120
to call for the return of unionized NFTs.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,540
For PR News, the political one.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,720
Official North Korean media also said that teachers would be given PR News in Seoul.

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,840
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is again sounding the alarm about PR News,

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,200
saying the international community cannot afford PR's reports.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,600
He says PR News is spiraling out of control.

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,080
Ban said Russia and China have blocked PR News.

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,860
He says this is PR.

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,480
Tattoo.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,160
Variety.

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,140
Nikto.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,000
Tattoo.

27
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,720
Variety.

28
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,700
Nikto.

29
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,560
Tattoo.

30
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,300
Variety.

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,280
Nikto.

32
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:31,980
Tattoo.

33
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,820
Quiet numbskulls, I'm broadcasting.

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,680
Lay your hands on the radio.

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,920
Lay your hands on the radio band at home,

36
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,360
and we're gonna look to God.

37
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,180
I'll take that as two.

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,720
Here we go.

39
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,380
Here we go.

40
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,220
Everybody get in line.

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,660
Everybody from the new freak nation.

42
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,980
Open up your tired eyes.

43
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,740
Oh, get up now from your hibernation.

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,400
Our research shows a shocking rise in evil bullshit.

45
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,760
And how they bullshit, it's sick.

46
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,060
You'd be surprised to know just how deep it's got.

47
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,420
Or maybe not.

48
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,640
So everybody, now's the time.

49
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,920
Snag a weapon and fight a lot.

50
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,240
Right.

51
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:44,980
Behind me

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,960
The freaky time is coming soon

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,440
Our non-believers leave the room

54
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,880
Listen, won't be said again

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,360
This is your life to defend

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,400
We won't stand and leave by

57
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,960
As it devolves into madness

58
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,620
Resolves in a sad mess

59
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,460
A broken pipe dream of the day

60
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,940
When freaks take control

61
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,560
Oh yes, that's the goal

62
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,400
Now who's still with me?

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,080
Hurry up this little time

64
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,620
I'm burning up with anticipation

65
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,100
You've heard enough of leaders' lies

66
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,000
Lies

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,740
You've learned enough to know the true frustration

68
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,800
Burning in the hearts of every woman, man and child

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,720
A fire wild style

70
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,820
Sad truth is most folks are trained to just ignore it

71
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,540
And that's why I'm here

72
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:43,880
To get some shit

73
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,960
To turn the other cheek is fine

74
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,880
If you don't care, but if you do

75
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,480
We're counting on you

76
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,480
We'll raise your hand and take a vibe

77
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,940
Afraid your species needs you now

78
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,440
You came in thinking life was play

79
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,700
But hey man, that was yesterday

80
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,820
Look around and you'll see

81
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,220
This is just the beginning

82
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,800
And if your head's spinning

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,300
Take that as your cue

84
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,200
Up the band, they'll be first to arrive!

85
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
And if they don't survive

86
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,080
We'll call upon you!

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,800
And if they don't survive

88
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,040
We'll call upon you!

89
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,740
And the few who understand what's right

90
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,020
And the few who hunger for some confrontation

91
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,620
Will get to undertake the fight

92
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,220
Get set to usher in the new freak nation

93
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,040
No one knows why

94
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,180
All the freaky kids are in the dark

95
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,060
That's out of screaming

96
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,460
Or that they're dreaming, scheming

97
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,840
Once it flows, this river ain't never gonna stop!

98
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,740
Even if we drown

99
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,860
For you, step one is just sit tight

100
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,800
And imagine all the things you'd change in this world

101
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,460
And some of you are gonna die

102
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,620
Some of you are gonna fail

103
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,160
Others will end up in jail

104
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,720
Danger lurks, so please take care

105
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,220
Try not to get killed out there

106
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,320
Most will say that we're mad

107
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,020
And implore us to give in

108
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,440
But the way that we're living

109
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,640
Just makes my hair curl up your fist

110
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,240
And focus your power

111
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,120
For you soon know the hour

112
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,020
Will take back the world!

113
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,520
Everybody get in line

114
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,060
Everybody from the new freak nation

115
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,300
Everybody get in line

116
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,960
Everybody from the new freak nation

117
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,180
Everybody now's the time

118
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,360
Snag a weapon and file out right behind me

119
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,820
Thank you freaks, that's for all you freaky people.

120
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,440
A Letter to Bob

121
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,960
By Reverend Baby Bear

122
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,280
Dear Bob Dong

123
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,520
I'm writing to you

124
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,400
Things have been so hard

125
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,200
What should I do?

126
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,880
This slacklessness is getting to me

127
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,560
I am a slave

128
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,760
I long to be free

129
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,640
He wrote me back

130
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,740
To my surprise

131
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,100
And here's what he said

132
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,180
To open my eyes

133
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,400
He said put it in your pipe

134
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,320
Put it in your pipe

135
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,500
Put it in your pipe

136
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:38,500


137
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,060
And smoke it

138
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,540
I wrote him back

139
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,360
What do you mean?

140
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,600
If you're telling the truth

141
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,980
There's no proof I've seen

142
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,540
Your advice doesn't help

143
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,800
With my job or my bills

144
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,460
Or those pink boys and girls

145
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,420
Who make me feel ill

146
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,400
He wrote back again

147
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,920
With the same canned reply

148
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,960
The same paper and pen

149
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,480
And the same pen

150
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,380
And the same damned advice

151
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,660
Put it in your pipe

152
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,020
Put it in your pipe

153
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,300
Put it in your pipe and smoke it

154
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,240
I was so pissed

155
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,480
At this salesman's dimwit

156
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,620
And his thousand yard stare

157
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,520
And his shit eating grin

158
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,080
I wrote Bob you're no help

159
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,180
You're as dumb as they come

160
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,280
Never mind the advice

161
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,280
I'll just face it alone

162
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,720
I don't find a better job

163
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,820
Some way to pay these bills

164
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,480
And I don't have a job

165
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,140
And I'll freak out the pinks

166
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,520
I'll give them the chills

167
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,280
Then Bob appeared to me

168
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,740
But I still didn't give a shit

169
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,780
He smiled and said

170
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,140
My dear you've got it

171
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,600
Just put it in your pipe

172
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,020
Put it in your pipe and smoke it

173
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,900
So that's how I learned

174
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,780
This lesson in life

175
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,160
No one needs anyone

176
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,860
To smoke their own pipe

177
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,100
The

178
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,100


179
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,640
End

180
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,860
And I was just picking the wedding music

181
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,700
This is the same one we used

182
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,920
At Nicky and Bob's ex-day wedding

183
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,560
Very good

184
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,460
You DJ'd

185
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,280
Actually Dr. Howell

186
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,340
Shall I do it again

187
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,080
Would you like me to do it another time

188
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,540
No you can do that this time too

189
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,620
Very well I shall

190
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,180
Because you know the material

191
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,300
The Abominable Snowman

192
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,060
Beast from 20,000 Fathoms

193
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,600
Bride of Frankenstein

194
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,320
The classic

195
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,080
Oh and what's the other one

196
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,680
Also I was going to play that song

197
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,780
From A Funny Thing Happened

198
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,600
On the Way to the Forum

199
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,500
Isn't there a show on

200
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,380
Bring me my bride

201
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,300
Do you have it

202
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,860
Yes

203
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,520
My bride my bride

204
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,700
I've come to claim my bride

205
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,560
My lust for her no longer

206
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,820
Can be denied

207
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,340
Yeah there's actually

208
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,380
You have that one that's Here's to Your Illusions

209
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,480
From Fla Huli

210
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,800
Fla Huli

211
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,480
I don't care about no Fla Huli

212
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Fla Huli

213
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,100
There's no Fla Huli fans out here

214
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,120
Me no savvy Fla Huli talk

215
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,660
No speaking of Fla Huli old man

216
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,580
Stangor from Fla Huli

217
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,900
Stangor eats Fla Huli

218
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,680
You're like from the planet Fla Huli

219
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,180
Like the planet Koloth

220
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,500
You know I have to keep up with these things

221
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,420
These theological developments

222
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,400
Yes Dr. Howell

223
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:04,780
We made it

224
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:04,780


225
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,680
We must keep up

226
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,900
We're still at the 50 next day drill friends

227
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
Actually the 17th such drill

228
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,960
If you want to get technical

229
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,820
That was Dr. Howell with G. Gordon Gordon

230
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,720
Dr. Philo Drummond and yours truly

231
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,580
Reverend Stang and we have

232
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,580
Several of the bands from our little

233
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,500
Summer camp out coming up

234
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,080
The Slot Rods

235
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,160
The Evolution Control Committee

236
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,100
Amoeba

237
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,980
Amoeba Knievel

238
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,280
Heard in the background

239
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,380
And now to get us started the musical styling

240
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,520
Of Andrew the Impaled

241
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,700
They deserve it

242
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,340
On this special day

243
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,220
This special day

244
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,180
Approaching the nuptial hour

245
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,420
Yeah I just queued up

246
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,000
Bring Me My Bride

247
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,460
Although I'm not going to play it

248
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,300
Right this second

249
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,800
Why are you telling us about it if you're not going to play it

250
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,480
I'm just talking to myself

251
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,020
Well don't talk to yourself

252
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:00,860
Stang

253
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,520
Go out and have a smoke

254
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,640
Of what?

255
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,780
I quit smoking in 1997

256
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,560
You say

257
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,380
On November 17th

258
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,620
The old Stang the irritable Stang

259
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,640
You gave him a cigarette

260
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,580
And he just calmed right down

261
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,560
100 million seconds ago

262
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,820
The confessions of Ivan Stang

263
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,080
Since I had my last cigarette

264
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,880
This man when he quit smoking

265
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,860
Had such a terrible addiction

266
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,600
That he had to use nicotine patches

267
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,080
And there were days in his early

268
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,780
Period of quitting where he looked like the mummy

269
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,540
Because he had so many

270
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,660
Nicotine patches all over his body

271
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,620
And I was smoking

272
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,340
I was secretly smoking too

273
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,820
Man that is a buzz

274
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,180
Like five of those big patches

275
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,660
Five

276
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,780
And a pack of Marlboros

277
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,400
And smoking at the same time

278
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,540
Yeah that will keep you awake

279
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,300
Well it was work related

280
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,100
Reverend Stang you've always been a drug abuser

281
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,200
You're just an abusive personality Stang

282
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,780
You do these things to yourself

283
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,500
Look what about the time

284
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,940
We had to wean you off all those white powders

285
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,420
I mean you know come on

286
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,540
What about that time you ate nine aspirins

287
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,840
And drank a coke real fast

288
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,320
I needed those white powders

289
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,780
My crotch was sweaty

290
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,460
Yeah but you could leave them lying around

291
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,000
I would think they were the other kind of white powder

292
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,420
What bothered me was the

293
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,540
Bobbies that would try to snort it off

294
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,820
Of my damp crotch

295
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,340
It's horrible the things people will do

296
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,840
For religion and drugs

297
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,820
And I just work here

298
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,440
I mean really honestly I'm just a clerk

299
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,440
Did it get them high

300
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,820
I can't hear you

301
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,840
Did they get high

302
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
I can't hear you

303
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,640
He asks did they get high

304
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,080
I was being facetious

305
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,420
I don't know

306
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,960
Did they get high

307
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,000
You can't tell the difference with some people

308
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,980
Anybody's dumb enough to snort

309
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,180
White powder off of my lap

310
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,360
What difference does it make

311
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,800
Well if you were

312
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,880
If you were a kitten at Tibby Dodd

313
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,480
I might snort white powder off of my lap

314
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,020
I wouldn't do it off your lap

315
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,380
But I certainly wouldn't do it off your lap

316
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,300
That's Reverend Kitten on Tibby Dodd

317
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,760
Oh my gosh more ice creams

318
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,780
Oh we're very good friends staying

319
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,700
We don't go on formalities

320
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,400
Did you know that

321
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,340
Jay Condom

322
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,680
Reverend Jay Condom dated Kitten

323
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,940
On Tibby Dodd

324
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,820
No I didn't

325
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,140
She dated Bouncing Boy

326
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,920
Yes she dated the guy who drew P-Dog

327
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,840
The original P-Dog comics

328
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:30,900
Who's a

329
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,980
Stumpy little fella

330
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,740
With a beer gut

331
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,160
He became Kitten on Tibby

332
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,020
The famous porno star

333
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,600
Kitten on Tibby Dodd's boyfriend

334
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:42,980
But

335
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,760
She broke up with him

336
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,180
When he referred to her

337
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,520
She had

338
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,100
She actually had breast cancer

339
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,980
And then had reconstructive surgery

340
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,300
And he referred to it as

341
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,220
A bolt on

342
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,160
Her bolt ons and she was offended

343
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,620
And broke up with him

344
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,300
And she was referring to her

345
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,000
Brand new fake breast as bolt ons

346
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,700
You have to be careful in situations like that

347
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,280
This next song is called

348
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,540
I Missed the Boat

349
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,660
Like the unicorn

350
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,640
Ha ha ha ha Bob

351
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,440
Praise

352
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,940
Praise Bob our drummer

353
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,340
Got it?

354
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,020
Is it okay now?

355
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,600
Okay okay

356
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,160
Okay everybody

357
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,380
Oh ladies and gentlemen

358
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,040
Playing

359
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,680
Bass for the first time

360
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,120
Andrew the Impaled

361
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,920
For the first time

362
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,220
In our band actually

363
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,660
Not for the first time ever

364
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,500
And actually

365
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,020
The rest of the band Red Bob

366
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,060
Junkins

367
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,500
Everybody say happy birthday

368
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,640
To Red Bob

369
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,900
Thank you very much

370
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,600
Thank you

371
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,260
And the great Bill Sperry

372
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,060
On guitar

373
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,040
And

374
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,500
And

375
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,400
I'm Tommy

376
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,220
Amoeba and this next song

377
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,100
As I said before

378
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,320
I Missed the Boat

379
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,620
I Missed the Boat

380
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,180
I Missed the Boat

381
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,000
And this is

382
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,000


383
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,000


384
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,900
Sitting on the dock of the harbor

385
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,640
Staring at the oil in the water

386
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,220
Forming pretty colors and patterns

387
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:01,980
Worming pretty colors and patterns

388
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,480
Like there is a rock

389
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,740
Neptune and Saturn

390
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,580
Saw this great big passenger freighter

391
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,780
Pulling out to see a bit later

392
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,460
Then I saw her face in the porthole

393
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,920
And it made me feel like an asshole

394
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,540
Because I missed the boat like a unicorn

395
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,420
I missed the boat on the Dallas phone

396
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,980
I missed the boat but it's not so scary

397
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,620
I missed the boat but I caught the fairy

398
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,220
I missed the boat like a unicorn

399
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,040
I missed the boat on the Dallas phone

400
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,520
I missed the boat but it's not so scary

401
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,180
I missed the boat but I caught the fairy

402
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,480
Caught the fairy, caught the fairy

403
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,620
Read the news today in the paper

404
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,900
Bought some capsized passenger freight

405
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,320
Saw this great big passenger freighter

406
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,980
Tied a ways and turned it upside down

407
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,660
Like the famous SS Poseidon

408
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,880
Forty portals broke in the motion

409
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,540
How they caught them all in the ocean

410
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,380
Then I read the list of who made it

411
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,820
And it made me sad and elated

412
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,740
Because I missed the boat like a unicorn

413
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,480
I missed the boat on the Dallas phone

414
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:28,960
I missed the boat on the Dallas phone

415
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:38,460
I missed the boat like a unicorn

416
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,040
I missed the boat like a unicorn

417
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,040


418
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,240
I missed the boat on the Dallas phone

419
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,640
I missed the boat but it's not so scary

420
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,260
I missed the boat but I caught the fairy

421
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,100
I missed the boat like a unicorn

422
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,100


423
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,100


424
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,100


425
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,560
Caught the fairy, caught the fair....ry

426
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,180
Caught the fair...nnin- конечно o.o

427
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,460
aaa...raaa....ry

428
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,260
guitar solo

429
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,340
guitar solo

430
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,140
I Missed the Boat by Amoeba Knievel.

431
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,440
That is Tommy Amoeba and band.

432
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,620
You can find them and all the other bands we play tonight on Facebook

433
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,080
if you can spell Amoeba.

434
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,460
Look it up.

435
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,940
And now, from Detroit by way of out of space,

436
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,700
the Amoeba, I mean the Slot Rods.

437
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,380
Play that one with the notes.

438
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,020
Huh?

439
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,420
Play that one that rocks.

440
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,500
That one that rocks.

441
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,440
Oh, coming up.

442
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,900
I Missed the Boat by Amoeba Knievel.

443
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:45,080
That is Tommy Amoeba and band.

444
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,500
You can find them and all the other bands we play tonight on Facebook

445
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,960
if you can spell Amoeba Knievel.

446
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:09,240
That is Tommy Amoeba and band.

447
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:58,960
You can find them and all the other bands we play tonight on Facebook

448
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:28,680
if you can spell Amoeba Knievel.

449
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,440
That is Tommy Amoeba and band.

450
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,420
Well, let's get the party saucer serving, shall we?

451
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,980
I'd say it's just about time for lunch with evaluation control committee

452
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,680
and another great video done by Trans Fatdy.

453
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,960
It's girls with meat, ladies and gentlemen!

454
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,560
Slow polo

455
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,220
Slow polo

456
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,320
Ambergers!

457
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,420
Amber..

458
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:55,860
MARKENDEIS

459
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,740

460
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,020

461
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,100
Markendeeis

462
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,960
Markendeeis

463
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:58,960


464
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:58,960


465
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:58,960


466
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:58,960


467
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:58,960


468
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,400
Hamburgers!

469
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,260
Potato salad!

470
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,860
Watermelon!

471
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,600
Hamburgers!

472
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,020
Potato salad!

473
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,480
Watermelon!

474
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,000
Thank you.

475
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,440
Here's sensational news.

476
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,500
A terrific offer.

477
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,160
Listen.

478
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,240
One, 89 cents.

479
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,540
Two, 89 cents.

480
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,740
And three, 89 cents.

481
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,140
Right.

482
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,360
Right.

483
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,820
Man, here's your chance to get 89 cents.

484
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,460
Imagine.

485
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,700
In one combination package, you get only 89 cents.

486
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,320
Yes, sir.

487
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,200
89 slick sweet cents.

488
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,460
Retail value, 49 cents.

489
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,220
Okay.

490
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,440
I ask a lot of people this question.

491
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,740
Some people don't know the answer.

492
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,820
They think they know the answer.

493
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,100
But anyway, who knows who the bad was in the good and the bad and the ugly?

494
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,780
Me.

495
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,360
Okay.

496
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:22,860
Okay.

497
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,300
You want a shirt?

498
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,480
This one's called Lee Van Cleef.

499
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,320
Okay.

500
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,700
Okay.

501
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,580
Okay.

502
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:37,900
Okay.

503
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,600
Okay.

504
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,080
Okay.

505
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,020
Okay.

506
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,080


507
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,360
Okay.

508
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:40,360


509
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:40,360


510
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:40,360


511
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,580
Okay.

512
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:41,580


513
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:41,580


514
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:41,580


515
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,560
Okay.

516
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,180
Thank you.

517
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,760
Thank you.

518
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,400
Thank you.

519
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,460
Thank you.

520
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,480
This, what you're hearing now, is the Slot Rods live at 50 Next Day.

521
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,000
Before that, we heard,

522
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,080
You can find them, by the way, at

523
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,240
Also on Facebook.

524
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,980
For that matter, everybody here is on Facebook, except me.

525
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,900
I keep a relatively low profile there.

526
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,260
Coming up, more Evolution Control Committee, plus a wedding.

527
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,100
A real, legal, subgenius wedding, live from 50 Next Day.

528
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,840
Oh, and thanks to Reverend Baby Bear for the poem at the beginning and the end.

529
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,140
And to Lee Murr for the titles.

530
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,640
PSA and PR.

531
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Some of the subtitles may not be as clear as very natural, so I won't go through all the talk.

532
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,040


533
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,040


534
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,040


535
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,580
world ofnde화

536
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,000
well restaurants

537
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,100
around.

538
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,120
Are going south,

539
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:42,620


540
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:42,740
episode one.

541
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,060
Thank you.

542
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,860
Thank you.

543
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,900
Thank you.

544
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,520
Thank you.

545
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,620
Thank you.

546
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,520
Thank you.

547
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,520
Thank you.

548
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,740
Thank you.

549
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,220
Thank you.

550
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,040
Thank you.

551
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,420
Thank you.

552
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:24,820
Thank you.

553
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,880
Thank you.

554
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,580
Thank you.

555
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,960
Thank you.

556
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,840
Thank you.

557
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,080
Thank you.

558
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,280
Thank you.

559
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:03,760
Thank you.

560
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,020
Yes okay well let's begin.

561
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,240
You can ease that music up a little bit I think.

562
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,380
And let the lovely couple come forward friends.

563
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,400
Reverend Gorgon Millar.

564
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,580
and the inaptly named Princess Squirrel Face.

565
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,360
She does look like a princess.

566
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,120
But to be a squirrel face, you need much bigger teeth.

567
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,060
I was honestly looking forward to giant teeth.

568
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,800
Don't stop me if you've heard this before,

569
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,980
because we did just do it two days ago.

570
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,940
But I'm going to try to do some extra stuff for you guys.

571
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:57,460
Friends, these two are preparing to launch themselves into the future,

572
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,660
not unlike the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer,

573
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,000
which usually has to be launched by somebody else,

574
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,440
but you guys are doing the launching yourselves.

575
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,020
I'm just helping.

576
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,920
As most wedding ceremonies have,

577
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:18,440
the preacher gives this corny advice on helpful hints for a marriage.

578
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,200
But I bet you guys have been shacked up for a little while.

579
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,680
But I'm sure that as good subgeniuses,

580
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,400
you haven't, you know, until you're married,

581
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,320
you wouldn't have sex or anything like that.

582
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,620
Of course not.

583
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,980
This is the part that I neglected to explain to Reverend Suds and Priestess Pisces,

584
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,920
and that's why they haven't given birth yet.

585
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,240
I know you guys haven't done this routine yet.

586
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,700
Oh, he's got two daughters.

587
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,940
Yeah, but that was with a human.

588
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,720
Subgenius, when subgeniuses mate, the gestation period is very swift.

589
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,720
There'd suddenly be ten little bat-like creatures flying around.

590
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:16,380
This is a brief explanation of the Yeti bat-squid symbiont.

591
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,600
Uh, birds.

592
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,740
And the bees, basically.

593
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,880
The facts of life.

594
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,600
And I'm going to go ahead.

595
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,040
Oh, there's no kids here, so I can use the full vocabulary.

596
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,300
When a face-fucking bat attacks a male Yeti subgenius

597
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,500
and ejaculates its poisoned sperm down his throat,

598
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:40,360
and the Yeti is not promptly treated with face-fucking bat-sperm antidote pudding,

599
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,480
it must find a prairie squid to fuck or it will die.

600
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,920
When a bat-sperm-infected Yeti,

601
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,160
fucks a prairie squid,

602
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,320
it empties him out like a man-shaped condom,

603
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,520
leaving only the undamaged skin lying in a heap upon the ground.

604
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,960
The prairie squid stores and mutates the Yeti sperm

605
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,420
and ejaculates it into the female Yeti on not infrequent occasions.

606
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,700
That means they do it a lot.

607
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,840
Uh, the prairie squid mutated Yeti sperm,

608
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:27,980
swims up the tubes and impregnates the female's entire lifetime supply of eggs all at once,

609
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,740
transforming her, that would be you,

610
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,020
into a vast egg bag with a little tiny human torso on one end.

611
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,560
Sort of like that female alien in Aliens.

612
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,440
Uh, some guys are really turned on by that.

613
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,820
Uh, the thousands of prairie squid mutated Yeti sperm,

614
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,960
impregnated Yeti eggs,

615
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,520
hatch out into thousands of face-fucking bats

616
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,340
who seek Yetis to face-rape, etc.

617
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,760
So, those are the facts of life.

618
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,800
I know it may sound complicated and disgusting,

619
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,720
but, you know, once you get started, you'll see what I mean.

620
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:14,740
It's actually, especially the part where you swallow the face-fucking bat sperm antidote pudding,

621
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,320
that's really the main reason most of us do it at all.

622
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,940
Okay, so let's get to the point now that we've covered the scientific details.

623
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,160
Uh, these two are true Yeti mates, you can tell just by looking at them,

624
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,500
and must be together, because there are basic primate needs

625
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,260
that are true from monkeys to humans to subgeniuses.

626
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,040
All three types of primates need, um, grooming,

627
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,300
is what the scientists call it,

628
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,820
uh, making out, and backing out,

629
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,540
and back rubs and stuff, is, uh, what we call it, I guess.

630
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,360
I think it's where true love comes from, myself.

631
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:01,660
You have to have physical touch from another person,

632
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,340
or you go kind of crazy.

633
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,440
Every now and then, one of us is lucky enough

634
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:14,480
to finally find another one who, for whatever reason,

635
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,160
rubs just right,

636
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,320
co-groomer, picks your fleas just right,

637
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,800
you know, that whole thing.

638
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,520
Uh, don't do that with ticks.

639
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,980
That's different.

640
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,000
Um, who smells just right,

641
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,900
who looks at you just right,

642
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,200
and, best of all, who laughs at your jokes.

643
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,820
Thank you very much, Princess Wee.

644
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,580
She laughs at all my jokes.

645
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,580
She's so polite.

646
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,240
Without all that, you go half crazy,

647
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,040
but with that, you can go completely crazy,

648
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,280
fully crazy.

649
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,020
That's the, the, the great part about le-

650
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,140
being legally marriage.

651
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,560
They can't stop you.

652
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,540
You, you have this excuse.

653
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,300
In fact, we'll soon sign the paper that

654
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,740
even the government gives you the excuse.

655
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,120
Even your religion.

656
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,100
Which, you already have that excuse here,

657
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,920
but we're formalizing it.

658
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,860
Uh, I am qualified to do this because

659
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,620
I have a, um,

660
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:27,600
a Universal Life Minister's card in my pocket.

661
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,680
That's not it, but it's close enough.

662
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,580
It's my FCC license, actually.

663
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,440
Good enough.

664
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,340
But I do have it.

665
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,240
And I also have a piece of paper that says

666
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,640
my mind is normal.

667
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:39,720
Sorry.

668
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,060
I really do have one of those.

669
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,880
Um, and also, the other thing that makes me qualified

670
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,700
is Princess Wee and I have the happiest marriage

671
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,500
in the whole world.

672
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,840
And I said, I mean, we don't fight.

673
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,380
You oughta hear our fights, man.

674
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,360
They, they're, it's like, uh,

675
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,660
who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?

676
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,380
I'm the asshole, of course.

677
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,620
And as Nenslow, the great Nenslow said,

678
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,820
in every relationship,

679
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,940
there has to be a mean one and a nice one.

680
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,120
I'm not sure why that is, but apparently it's true.

681
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,580
I'm usually, you're the mean one?

682
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,840
Good, good.

683
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,500
It's, it's best,

684
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,580
it's, I think it's best if the girl is the mean one.

685
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,860
I'm usually the mean one,

686
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,460
unless she's tricking me that completely.

687
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,860
Uh, weddings always feature, uh, quotes,

688
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,900
usually from some, uh, wonderful, nice poetry.

689
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,660
We prefer quoting monster movies,

690
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,360
which always seem more entertaining to me.

691
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,880
And the, the, I'm gonna quote

692
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,420
The Bride of Frankenstein.

693
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,260
Friend.

694
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,480
Good.

695
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,480
I could also throw in food, good.

696
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,760
Smoke, good.

697
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,120
Wine, good.

698
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,220
But really, the friend is the, the most important part.

699
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,460
And the way that you can tell that you are true Yeti mates

700
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:09,680
is that your worst quarrels will be a thousand times better

701
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,180
than everybody else's honeymoons.

702
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,260
Everything will seem perfect

703
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,140
when you have a true Yeti mate.

704
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,600
You'll be total blithering idiots.

705
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,120
And not that you're blind to each other's faults.

706
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,880
You notice the faults, you just don't care about them.

707
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,000
That's not the important part.

708
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,060
And any stupid mistakes that your partner makes,

709
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,300
I'm afraid you may have to deal with a lot of these,

710
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,760
um, will, will just seem to you

711
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,260
to be part of his or her very existences,

712
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,320
his or her very existences eternal flirtation

713
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,000
with the entire universe.

714
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,680
You'll both continue to make thousands of stupid mistakes,

715
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,940
uh, because for one thing you're subgeniuses,

716
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:04,160
but because you're psychotically preoccupied with each other

717
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,380
all the time.

718
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,380
So your ability to deal with the others,

719
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,080
which is all of the rest of us, may be severely impaired.

720
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,140
Uh, but that doesn't matter.

721
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:19,760
And the normals around you will still screw up a lot worse.

722
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,140
As, as, as distracted and screwy as you may be,

723
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,980
remember, they're even worse.

724
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,780
Um, that's always been easy for me to, uh, remind myself

725
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,960
over and over again.

726
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,680
Your friends will probably decide that you've lost your minds,

727
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,300
and they will be right, because you are soul partners,

728
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,140
only partially in this world,

729
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,960
uh, maintaining the least possible toehold on reality,

730
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,540
good for very little else than laying around

731
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,120
experiencing your joint nervous system,

732
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,520
which is probably about as close to real slack

733
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,380
as any of us will ever get.

734
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,180
Best of all, you have an excuse.

735
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,340
You literally can't help it, right?

736
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:09,700
I mean, if we tried to keep you guys apart, would it work?

737
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,440
No. Duh. You can just tell.

738
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,120
And in order to do that,

739
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,780
in order to get a little bit of God in here,

740
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,280
I'm gonna quote Einstein,

741
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,180
who was not a subgenius

742
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:27,000
and would not have been qualified for our august religion.

743
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,460
But he said,

744
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,920
My religion consists of a humble admiration

745
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,460
of the illimitable superior spirit

746
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:39,660
who reveals himself in the slightest details

747
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,600
we are able to perceive

748
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,480
with our frail

749
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,120
and feeble mind.

750
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,000
I notice he refers to God as him.

751
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,040
But he was old.

752
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,140
That was in the old days.

753
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,660
And it was Einstein.

754
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,200
He could get away with a lot.

755
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,120
The masculine was thought to embrace the feminine.

756
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,300
Um, an old Chinese proverb,

757
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,900
more to the point, says,

758
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,660
I hear and I forget,

759
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,100
I see and I remember,

760
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,320
I do and I understand.

761
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,120
And, uh,

762
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,460
Reverend Gorgon and Princess Spurlface

763
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:22,780
are about to truly understand.

764
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,140
And no.

765
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,280
Of course, that means you have to do it.

766
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,900
But we're not gonna make you do that right here.

767
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,040
All you have to do here is make out pretty good.

768
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,900
Um, they don't seem very alike.

769
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,640
You really, guys, really don't look very alike.

770
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,460
Um, but your true soul is, um,

771
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,040
soulmate and yeti mate is supposed to be very different from you,

772
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,080
had better be very different from you,

773
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,200
because if you're the same,

774
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,740
you get more cow-like.

775
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,880
You amplify each other's faults.

776
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,580
You just make everything

777
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,660
dumb easier.

778
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,300
As different people,

779
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,620
your holy differences trick you

780
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,280
into learning from each other

781
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,500
and seeing new ways

782
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,000
and learning new tricks.

783
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,940
When you get to my age,

784
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,680
you don't imitate the guys,

785
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,080
what you see guys in porno movies doing.

786
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,860
You work on that now.

787
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,180
But you don't want to go through the conversation

788
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,880
I had to have with my doctor.

789
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,680
She wanted to know exactly what I did.

790
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,720
I wouldn't tell her.

791
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,020
But the main thing is, friends,

792
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,640
uh, you hone the skills of marital compromise

793
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,200
to the point where you get better at working and playing with others.

794
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,300
And you can use those skills on the job

795
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,620
or in real life.

796
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,620
Either one.

797
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:46,720
Even both.

798
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,780
Two heads are better than one.

799
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,760
Especially if both heads are not completely filled with brain cells.

800
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,700
As I've said many times,

801
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,360
Princess Wee and I only have half a brain cell each.

802
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,440
But it's the other half.

803
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,080
So, as long as we're together,

804
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,460
we have one fully functioning brain cell.

805
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,160
Now, some people change when they get married.

806
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,100
Oh, how terrible.

807
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,760
You might become something new.

808
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,880
Although, you probably won't.

809
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,240
You guys, obviously you've been together for a while.

810
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,120
When you were on your own,

811
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,200
you didn't need to grow in quite the same ways

812
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,000
because who would complain if you didn't?

813
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,940
But when you share your whole life with somebody,

814
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,280
they're going to complain.

815
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,580
And you have to grow.

816
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,160
There's certain parts grow faster than others,

817
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,780
I've noticed at certain times.

818
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,100
I like that part.

819
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,140
Uh,

820
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,460
when you share your whole life with somebody,

821
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,120
you have to grow.

822
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,700
That means compromises, loyalty, devotion,

823
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,960
which sometimes can be a pain in the ass.

824
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,080
But it's worth it.

825
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,760
Absolutely worth it,

826
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,900
because the payback is,

827
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,360
you get to soak in pure love.

828
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,800
The real thing.

829
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,620
Which is very rare,

830
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,680
and congratulations to both of you.

831
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,700
I mean that.

832
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,000
If there's anything eternal in life,

833
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,280
that's probably the best way to find it.

834
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,620
And so friends,

835
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,260
those of us gathered here today,

836
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,140
by the way,

837
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,940
if there's anybody who objects to this ceremony,

838
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,360
I don't care.

839
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,200
Keep your mouth shut.

840
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,500
Don't speak.

841
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,200
You just forever hold your peace.

842
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,380
Um,

843
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,560
these two,

844
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,400
Princess Squirrelface and Gorgon Miller,

845
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:35,960
Mylar,

846
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,240
oh is it Mylar?

847
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:38,960
Okay.

848
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,140
Sorry about that.

849
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,220
Who were apart,

850
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,760
come together now in our presence

851
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,100
to declare their love and be united in marriage.

852
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,000
You know, there's all this stuff about,

853
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,040
but you must be able to stand alone and dance alone

854
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,320
and not be too dependent and co-dependent

855
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,420
and needy on each other.

856
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:57,960
Screw that.

857
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,920
Go ahead and be co-dependent.

858
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,280
Go ahead and be needy.

859
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,520
That's what it's all about.

860
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,400
You know,

861
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,200
you gotta scratch each other.

862
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,340
You can't scratch your own back.

863
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,360
Or pop zits.

864
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,540
That's one of my favorites.

865
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,400
So, yeah,

866
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,760
go ahead and intertwine to your heart's content.

867
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,000
Need and co-depend all you want.

868
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,960
If they can't take a joke,

869
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,220
you know what they can do.

870
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,860
And we've just explained what you guys can do

871
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,880
in, you know, great scientific detail.

872
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,940
In coming before us all here today,

873
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:35,520
you're performing an act of faith in each other.

874
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,320
A faith that will continue to grow and mature

875
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,320
and endure.

876
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,140
And if you have your love set on that faith

877
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,140
for all the days ahead,

878
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,800
then cherish the hopes that you hold right now

879
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,900
and resolve that love will not be blotted out

880
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,020
by the commonplace

881
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:57,560
or blurred by the mundane in life

882
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,600
and screw the boss.

883
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,300
Uh, you know,

884
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,200
if you need to stay home and make out all day,

885
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,060
bye gobs.

886
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:08,300
Bye.

887
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,800
Well, actually, maybe,

888
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,000
you might need to hang on to your job, so,

889
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,660
whatever.

890
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,120
What you guys have is a lot more important

891
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,840
than any of that other stuff.

892
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,020
You know, the rituals of daily life

893
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,920
eventually make some things seem, uh,

894
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,300
almost mundane,

895
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:31,160
but I'm sure that you'll come up with something

896
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,680
to keep it lively.

897
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,960
Having fights often is a real good way to make up.

898
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,980
The making up part kicks ass.

899
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,980
So, believing in yourselves and each other

900
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,880
will strengthen not only the both of you,

901
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,000
but it'll strengthen all your friends.

902
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,380
The rest of us who know you

903
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,220
will also be given hope.

904
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,780
Those who haven't found true Yeti mates,

905
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,020
even if it takes until you're 60 years old,

906
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,180
don't give up.

907
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,660
Even if you only have that true Yeti mate

908
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,060
for five minutes

909
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:08,660
before an asteroid comes down

910
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,460
and crushes your true Yeti mate,

911
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,520
that five minutes is worth the 60-year wait.

912
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,120
I speak from experience.

913
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,840
I'm, well, 58 years.

914
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,260
Okay, this is the good part.

915
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:25,560
In our presence, you're now ready to pledge your love.

916
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,600
Do you, Princess Squirrel Face,

917
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,000
take this man,

918
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,920
Reverend Mylar,

919
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,660
to be your husband,

920
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,380
to have and to hold from this day forward,

921
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,660
for better or worse,

922
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,980
for richer or poorer,

923
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:44,340
in sickness and health and kinkiness,

924
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,200
to love and to cherish?

925
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:46,920
Say, I do.

926
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:47,540
I do.

927
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,860
Do you, Reverend Gorgon Mylar,

928
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,260
take this woman, Princess Squirrel Face,

929
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,420
to be your wife,

930
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,740
to have and to hold,

931
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,080
holding, pardon, and having.

932
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,400
Having is good, too.

933
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,140
From this day forward,

934
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:02,980
for better or worse,

935
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:03,600
richer or poorer,

936
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,340
in sickness and health and to love and to cherish?

937
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:06,080
Say, I do.

938
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:06,600
I do.

939
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,500
With their whole hearts

940
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,840
and all of their organs

941
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,300
and their complete devotion,

942
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,140
they pledge their love today.

943
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,880
Now, do you have a ring?

944
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,920
They've got a ring!

945
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:21,000
You now perform the sacred symbolic temple of Devoe.

946
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,800
This is symbolic of a pole going into a hole.

947
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,800
I'm not sure what that has to do with weddings,

948
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,460
but it's very traditional and romantic.

949
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,180
Princess, we and I, by the way,

950
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,160
tried to get our, when we got married,

951
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,460
we tried to get the rings on the wrong hand.

952
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:41,720
They didn't fit.

953
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,020
It was a subgenius wedding.

954
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,540
All right.

955
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,060
Oh, do you have any vows to say to each other?

956
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,180
I figure you probably handled that last night.

957
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,800
In that case,

958
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:59,180
you must now seal your vows with a kiss.

959
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

960
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,420
Now we're talking.

961
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,000
Now we're talking.

962
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,120
This is what it's all about.

963
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:11,500
Now shake on it and say it's a deal.

964
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,480
It is now a deal.

965
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,720
I now pronounce you man and wife.

966
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,140
Friends, I am pleased and very proud

967
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,460
to present the newly married couple,

968
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,940
Princess Squirrelface and Reverend Gorgon Mylar.

969
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:30,440
I am pleased and very proud

970
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,360
to present the newly married couple,

971
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:31,360


972
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,980
They are now hitched.

973
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,220
You've just done the easy part

974
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,800
and let the party begin.

975
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:41,380
Huh?

976
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,640
Did I learn anything?

977
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:23,760
Where's my unscrewing fork?

978
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,260
You said there are no excellentitudinals.

979
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:24,320
I said,

980
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:24,420
yours and mine

981
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,160
are not necessarily odpowied.

982
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,180
So I said it all.

983
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:53,800
you've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack

984
00:57:53,800 --> 00:58:11,900
for free information write to p.o box 181 417 cleveland heights ohio 44118 or see

985
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:18,780
www.subgenius.com praise bob

986
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,220
here's my love religion

987
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:29,180
here's my love religion

988
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:51,120
love my religion

989
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,840
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

990
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:18,080
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

991
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:23,120
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

992
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:30,180
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

993
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:37,720
you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

994
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,040
and help out financially as best you can.

995
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:45,400
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

996
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,040
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

997
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,960
But some of you still have jobs.

998
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:58,900
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

999
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,260
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1000
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:09,740
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay dogs.

1001
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,900
We also take checks and money orders to subgeniusfoundation.

1002
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,920
P.O. Box 181417.

1003
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:28,020
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1004
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,240
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
