1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,560
And now, something only you would like.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,460
You know, it's interesting about the 60's revolution, cultural revolution,

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,180
which ran here through Europe in the 70's from Franco-Ride,

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,860
and when Salazar was in Portugal-Ride, one after one, as these tight, old,

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,100
geriatric Cold War dictatorships loosened up, up popped this new spirit.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,720
What was it? It wasn't anti-communist, it wasn't communist, but it was it.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,060
How could you describe it? It was the Chinese spirit.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,240
We will now listen to Aristotle wishy-washy, word-touting,

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,960
sicklemen get forficulate smartish.

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,420
Well, my friends, you've got religion here today.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,080
I don't need God!

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,000
You now take control of your life.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,360
Video hypnosis plus audio and video subliminal suggestions for ultra-monotonic success.

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,200
I don't need God!

15
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,060
All I need is an amiibo.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
All I need is an amiibo.

17
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,240
All I need is an amiibo.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,460
All I need is an amiibo.

19
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,280
Do you believe in God?

20
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,100
Do you believe in God?

21
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,180
Do you believe in God?

22
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,440
I don't need God!

23
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,320
I don't need God!

24
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,800
I don't need God!

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,000
God.

26
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,920
I was just thinking on the way down here,

27
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,080
just all these black Sabbath stories

28
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,940
that I had in my head.

29
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,120
S?

30
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,160
Oh, no, not the Venusian deal

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,340
or the Coca-Cola death thing.

32
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,900
Oh, don't tell them about the cancer deal

33
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,420
and the ovens fired with galactic hydrogen

34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,320
or the Nova Express.

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,740
Oh, fiddle, faddle.

36
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,860
Hi, everyone.

37
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,260
This is Bell Burrows.

38
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,260
And when I'm not shooting apples off her head,

39
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,500
I put on my radio shorts and listen to...

40
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:53,720
Bob?

41
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,880
Bob?

42
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,340
Oh, Jack?

43
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,480
When the little red moon rolls across the low asphalt skies

44
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
that stretch from the ocean in Point Pleasant, New Jersey

45
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,180
to the western surf at El Granada Beach,

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,300
don't you know that Pooh Bear is a pervert

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,720
and Dean Mortadella's a three-day-old sandwich?

48
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,280
An old sandwich, man, an old sandwich.

49
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,080
Hello, everyone. This is Jack Kerouac.

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,120
When I'm not laying around on Mom's couch

51
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,240
and she's not talking to me,

52
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,920
I'm not enlarging my liver.

53
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,440
I listen to...

54
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,300
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,320
Neil?

56
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,640
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

57
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,780
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

58
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,300
Hi, this is Neil Cassidy,

59
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,940
and when I'm on the bus sniffing glue,

60
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,460
I'm being a fictitious character.

61
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,480
I, uh, I, I...

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,160
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

63
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,760
The Subgenius Hour of Slack

64
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,240
that you are about to listen to.

65
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,280
is specially designed only to be played on radio station

66
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,420
and only in the city of...

67
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,720
Here is your host...

68
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,140
Thank you so very much.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,940
Thank you for that introduction.

70
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,760
And really, it's great to be here.

71
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,340
Thank you so very much.

72
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,160
This bass is good for the soul.

73
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,620
The bass is good for the soul.

74
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,720
This bass is good for the soul.

75
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,420
Rock this bass.

76
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,140
Rock. Rock this bass.

77
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,500
Rock this bass.

78
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,480
This bass is good for the soul.

79
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,740
We're going to take a quick break.

80
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:25,360
We'll be right back.

81
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,300
Look, fooled you, Merle.

82
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,180
That's not real horse manure.

83
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,080
That's new fragmented.

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,460
I can't believe it's not horse manure.

85
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,540
Looks like, grows like, smells like, and tastes like real horse manure,

86
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,640
but with only half the feces.

87
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,060
Here, try some.

88
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,740
You're right.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,980
This tastes just great.

90
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,080
Fooled you again, Merle.

91
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,600
That was real horse manure, you old cork soaker, you.

92
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,360
You?

93
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,600
Yee-hoo!

94
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,200
Ha-ha!

95
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,560
Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

96
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,140
I can't believe it's not horse manure.

97
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,600
Fools even the finnickest connoisseur.

98
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:19,260
Hello and welcome once again to the Heaven or Hell Coin Toss,

99
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,940
the game show where your eternal condition is decided not by being born

100
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,440
again.

101
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,500
Or good or bad deeds, but by a simple toss of a coin.

102
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,880
I'm your host, Don Drysdale, after the shower.

103
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,620
Let's drag out our first contestant on the Heaven or Hell Coin Toss,

104
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,380
E-C-Zone.

105
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,780
Get your hands off me!

106
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,480
Get these chains off me!

107
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,360
Let me go!

108
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,860
I see E-C-Zone is psyched and ready to play the Heaven or Hell Coin Toss.

109
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,900
Let's begin.

110
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,380
God sure moves in mysterious ways.

111
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,920
Let's flip that coin.

112
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,540
It's flipping and now it falls.

113
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,080
It's going to be tails.

114
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,220
That's right.

115
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,800
Go straight to hell.

116
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,480
Do not pass purgatory.

117
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,020
Do not collect 200 venial sins.

118
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,840
The evil of heaven.

119
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,180
The devil arrives, who hasはい

120
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,860
I'm decir I arriving is approaching from hell and heaven.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,780
I am coming from hell and this is heaven and heaven.

122
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,160

0, 1

157
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,240


158
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,260
no

159
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,280
no

160
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,280


161
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,300
no

162
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,400
no

163
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,440
no

164
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,460
no

165
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:41,860
Ouch!

166
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,000
Reach the end of the hole...

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,440
again...

168
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,640
Jeff's been down a lot of shells...

169
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,060
I sweep around let me know

170
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,780
And when I can hear those shots they pop...

171
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,300
it's...

172
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:21,900
A FRIENDSHIP!!!

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,780
trying to sing.

174
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,840
He's drowning off the side of the show there.

175
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,280
Just push him off the side of the show.

176
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,920
Is this an outboard show or an inboard show?

177
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,320
Let's let Dennis throw it away and Marina Del Rey,

178
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,160
and we'll talk about what we're going to do with this church.

179
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,080
And when Dr. Duell leaves, how much of the church is he going to take back with him for security?

180
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,660
And this is very important because Green Hill is one of the most secure areas for church business.

181
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,920
Although it can't rock the church almost quicker than anywhere on earth.

182
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,460
That's true.

183
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,320
You have to crush them to keep cleaning it.

184
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,560
You have to pack silica gel around your church down there.

185
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,400

It's difficult.

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,660

188
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,700

And that's where you send your answers to this quiz.

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
And given forth hideous monsters.

193

195
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,360

Oh Bob, oh Bob, oh Bob.

203
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,480
Oh Mr. Dobbs, I didn't want to be here.

204
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,260

Oh!

00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:11,040
To make sure America's citizens back and believe their leaders 100%.

374
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,080
If you're a true American patriot and think people unlike you are revolutionary,

375
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,900
then join SIMPOL.

376
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,340
Yes, SIMPOL. The Symbolism Police.

377
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,900
No formal education necessary.

378
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,040
We actually prefer people with no education.

379
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,540
They make the best symbolism police

380
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,460
because of their uncompromising patriotism

381
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,800
and their fervor to follow any law or leader, hands down.

382
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,700
There will be lots of work for the symbolism police in the future

383
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,120
as the far-right Supreme Court changes the Bill of Rights to the Bill of What's Left.

384
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,160
You don't.

385
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,960
You need freedom.

386
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,980
You have symbols of freedom.

387
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,420
Start a neighborhood SIMPOL. Now!

388
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,460
It's wonderful to be able to experience this.

389
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,340
This modern battlefield is very lethal.

390
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,100
It's an exciting thing to be out here.

391
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,140
I feel euphoric.

392
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,040
You're gonna use military force. Use a lot of it. Quickly.

393
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,660
That is the way you use it. Do it right away.

394
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,260
Hit hard. Hit fast. Hit often. Hit early.

395
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,340
You can't go in half-stepping.

396
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,980
Cut. Cut.

397
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,380
Cut that country in two. Cut. Cut that very fast.

398
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,400
Cut that very, very hard. Cut that very, very, very, very hard.

399
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,060
It's gonna be violence. Very, very violent.

400
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,000
Very, very, very fast. Very, very hard.

401
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,540
Cut. Cut that fast.

402
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,440
Can't go in half-stepping.

403
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,700
War is conflict with blunt instruments.

404
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,680
War is just easy. War is just misinformation.

405
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,820
There's always misinformation in the initial reports.

406
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,820
We're all going to have to rally.

407
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:45,960
We're all going to have to rally. We're all going to have to rally.

408
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,560
We're all going to have to rally around the flag.

409
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,740
Rally around the flag.

410
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,360
That is truly scary.

411
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,300
You might want to remember, too, that in a few seconds you may not exist.

412
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,760
Mommy, Daddy, I'm afraid. I'm scared.

413
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,640
Well, I try not to really think about it a lot.

414
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,140
In a way, I got to say, good job.

415
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,480
You know, a good on-campaign is like a sore tooth.

416
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,240
You know, it's got to come out.

417
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,480
And even though it's painful, it's got to come out. You know?

418
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,340
This is continuing coverage of the Gulf War.

419
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,240
Military action can take place at any moment.

420
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:31,760
Midnight.

421
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
In less than a minute it will be midnight.

422
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,680
Midnight.

423
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,660
Big question, what happens now?

424
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,460
Midnight.

425
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,320
We can only imagine what that means.

426
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,300
The midnight deadline passed quietly at the White House.

427
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,120
There was a steady drumbeat.

428
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,320
I have a statement by the President of the United States.

429
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,300
The liberation of Kuwait has begun.

430
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,520
In conjunction with the forces of our coalition partners,

431
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,100
the United States has moved under the code name Operation Desert Storm

432
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,320
to enforce the mandates of the United Nations Security Council.

433
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,960
As of 7 o'clock p.m.,

434
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,580
Eastern Standard Time,

435
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,460
Operation Desert Storm forces were engaging targets in Kuwait and Iraq.

436
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,040
President Bush will address the nation at 9 o'clock p.m. tonight from the Oval Office.

437
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,320
Real war, real death, real wounds, real pain.

438
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,720
The most violent day, they say, in the history of war here.

439
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,960
Quote, more successful than we imagine. Close quote.

440
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,520
We can only imagine what that means.

441
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,260
Watching CNN mesmerized by what we've seen and what we've heard.

442
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,780
Real death.

443
00:29:50,920 --> 00:30:02,320
We expect more from the, on the, we expect more from, noting as we must, that it was Iraq.

444
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:13,240
And, and, noting from the, as we must, that it was Iraq.

445
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:23,160
And, and, noting as we must, that it was Iraq.

446
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,360
I think you got another smash.

447
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,380
Warning, danger.

448
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,200
Insert the short handle.

449
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,620
What do you want, do you mind?

450
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,340
I am a sick man.

451
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,520
A victim of a delusion.

452
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,620
The most passionate love story ever told.

453
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,360
And here's the transition to chaos.

454
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,500
The art of it all is how he brings together the noise and the music.

455
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,440
I'm a very short-haired dog.

456
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,140
I'm a very light-headed dog.

457
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,180


458
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,340
I'm a very light-headed dog.

459
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,340


460
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,500
I'm a very light-headed dog.

461
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,780
Come in and have some fun.

462
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,780
Hit it, boys.

463
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:40,520
Go!

464
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,340
.

465
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,280
.

466
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,060
.

467
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,000
.

468
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:28,000


469
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,260
.

470
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,100
.

471
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,960
.

472
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:39,960


473
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:39,960


474
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,000
.

475
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,000


476
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,000


477
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,000


478
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,060
.

479
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,060


480
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,920
That was quite an attraction.

481
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,120
.

482
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,120


483
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,000
.

484
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,000


485
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,040
.

486
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,560
Howdy, y'all.

487
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,860
This is Tiger Man Solitaire, the urban connoisseur,

488
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,160
bringing you a show this week.

489
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,000
Welcome to the new Urban Street Game Show.

490
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,540
People are funny, smelly.

491
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,860
The game now, I'm the host of this show for one week.

492
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,340
Y'all know I got an interesting mile-long career,

493
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,060
but we ain't going to talk about me.

494
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,500
We're going to get right down to our new Urban Game Show.

495
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,160
And since I got a lot of expertise on the street, I know where to hide.

496
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,200
This is a game show where we track down foul, foul-smelling street people

497
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,760
and see who can get the closest to them.

498
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,160
Now, you know the rule.

499
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,220
Someone, something similar to name that tuna.

500
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,220
You know, I can name that tuna in such and five notes type of BS.

501
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,060
Okay, here we go.

502
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,300
Ed G., that's my first contestant.

503
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,400
You're number one. Go ahead, Ed G.

504
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,200
Dig! I can get two blocks from him.

505
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,220
Okay.

506
00:33:59,480 --> 00:33:59,760
Okay.

507
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,000
Al G., it's your turn.

508
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,020
I can get a block from him.

509
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,900
I can get two liquor stores from him.

510
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,840
I can get across the street rolling.

511
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,040
I can get ten feet of him upwind.

512
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,080
I can get nine feet from him downwind.

513
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,040
Al G., I can walk by him.

514
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,700
Ed G., walk by him.

515
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,540
Whoo-wee!

516
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,960
I didn't know God beggar down his brain.

517
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,820
Only a damn fool tried to get that close to that smelly old bum.

518
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,320
By the way, the winner of People of Frontage Mellon this week

519
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,100
get a week's supply of Tonka Man Solitaire's Presidential Open Pit Bull Barbecue Sauce.

520
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,900
Bad dogs beware.

521
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,300
That's right.

522
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,620
Because a loser, the loser get a year's supply of Old DeBum Pete.

523
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,600
Look at here.

524
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,920
Ed G., getting pretty close to him.

525
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,100
He moving up on your man here.

526
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,180
Uh-oh.

527
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,800
I can see Ed G.'s eye really starting to water hard.

528
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,580
Now, he really bad.

529
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,440
His breath coming in short gas now.

530
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,020
He looks like a dog.

531
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,680
He's going to pass out.

532
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,040
Okay, he done for.

533
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,420
He just turned whiter than KKP Marshall.

534
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,260
Bad form, man.

535
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,280
Bad form.

536
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,140
Okay, he weeping.

537
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,740
He wobbling.

538
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,640
He down.

539
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,960
Ed G. down.

540
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,520
That's right.

541
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,920
He passed out on some old newspaper.

542
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,200
DeBum notice him now.

543
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,140
Wait, wait, wait.

544
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,320
DeBum is starting to notice him.

545
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,680
What's that damn fool doing?

546
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,480
Oh, my God.

547
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,640
He pulling his zipper down.

548
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,980
Ah, yes.

549
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,000
When I want to turn heads of cabbage into mutant femmes in heat,

550
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,080
I dose myself with Old DeBum Pete.

551
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,600
Nothing attracts girls with no noses like a whiff of Old DeBum Pete.

552
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,700
Old DeBum Pete is made from urine extracted from bums.

553
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,400
But not just any bum.

554
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,520
Older bum.

555
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,520
Mature bum.

556
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,820
Only the ripest bums can get to be Old DeBum Pete bums.

557
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,740
And now you can get a sample of Old DeBum Pete.

558
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,400
For free.

559
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,760
That's correct.

560
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:02,700
Free.

561
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,900
No charge whatsoever.

562
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,940
Simply bring a newspaper and wear used articles of clothing

563
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,260
and hide in one of our conveniently located collection sites

564
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,260
near soup kitchens, dives, flophouses, and especially alleyways.

565
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,220
Especially the dead in Dallas.

566
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,800
Cover yourself with a newspaper and wait.

567
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,180
It won't be long before you get your free sample of Old DeBum Pete.

568
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:42,240
And now for a limited time, if you hurry, you can also get the freshness of a mad bouquet absolutely free.

569
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,360
So make your statement.

570
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,140
And don't bother to hurry.

571
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,500
Supplies are unlimited.

572
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,140
Old DeBum Pete.

573
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,920
It doesn't get any more natural than this.

574
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,680
Old DeBum Pete.

575
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,900
Old DeBum Pete.

576
00:36:59,960 --> 00:36:59,960


577
00:36:59,960 --> 00:36:59,960


578
00:36:59,960 --> 00:36:59,960


579
00:36:59,960 --> 00:36:59,960


580
00:36:59,960 --> 00:36:59,960


581
00:36:59,960 --> 00:36:59,960


582
00:36:59,960 --> 00:36:59,960


583
00:36:59,960 --> 00:36:59,960


584
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,600
Thank you. Thank you very much.

585
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,120
Thank you very much.

586
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,620
I know that all of you, as well as the rest of America,

587
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,700
have been glued to your television sets.

588
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:22,360
We are indeed impressed with what we see on television.

589
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,500
I say watch.

590
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,460
Televations.

591
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,680
It does work.

592
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,640
Televations says, always get the job done.

593
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,960
I say televisions says, start getting the job done today.

594
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,700
I say...

595
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,220
Watch live television on television sets today.

596
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,740
Television, it does work.

597
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,000
Television sets always get the job done.

598
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,220
I just punched up one, and I'm opening...

599
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,540
Should we zoom in?

600
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,720
So it's best to go back to two.

601
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,520
That's it.

602
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,460
Okay, now watch that reading.

603
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,880
Watch the needle on five now.

604
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,580
Watch this.

605
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,920
Which is the switch to get it out?

606
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,380
Okay, there we are.

607
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,860
What is the real dope on the cortex bond problem anyway?

608
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,720
Oh, you find yourself with...

609
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

610
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,920
Oh, there's stop, stop.

611
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,040
Oh, little stop, stop.

612
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,280
Stop stop bomb mine, yeah.

613
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,460
Stop stop bomb mine.

614
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,140
Stop stop bomb mine, oh there pop stop bomb a time.

615
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,020
What if you punch two up?

616
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,500
Like, like, like...

617
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,620
Stop, stop.

618
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,100
Talk about stop stop.

619
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,880
Yes, you can see two at once.

620
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,300
When you see three, punch a third and you'll see the numbers.

621
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,420
Da da da, da da da da da...

622
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,840
Da da da, da da da, da da da, da da da, da da, da da, da da, da da, da da da da, da da.

623
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,320
Da da da da da da da dark stock

624
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,540
Oh dark stock, oh little bit of dark stock

625
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,500
Little tiny naked dark stock

626
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,320
Little stinky slimy dark stock

627
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,160
You are the dark stock of my dreams

628
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,580
You're the dark stock on which I creep

629
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,840
You're the dark stock of my pfft

630
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,540
You're the dark stock

631
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,840
With my knife I'll cut

632
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,260
I'm gonna be lickin' and a stickin' and a nickin' and a flickin'

633
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,180
Carvin' up the body of dark stock with my pocket knife

634
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,300
Hee ha!

635
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,260
Wee hee hee hee hee hee

636
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,700
Oh dark stock!

637
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,800
Cap cap cap cap ho ho ho

638
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,740

00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,240
Woo hoo hoo hoo

Talkin' bout you, I'm talkin' bout her

641
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,720
I'm talkin' bout them, I'm talkin' bout

00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,240

Ah a ya

648
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,440
A y a

649
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:35,480
Hoo

650
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,240
I don't see any of this movie at all

651
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,360
No you haven't

652
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,060
Don't let it get above 4.7

653
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,340
Uh

654
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,440
Here I'll string these back down a little bit

655
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,600
I've seen the overloading

656
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,440
Well you should put a

657
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,460
You shouldn't

658
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,120
Instead of

659
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,620
Ah

660
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,480
There it is. It's about 4.6 now. Is that right?

661
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,860
Yes, but dissolution occurred at 4.5.

662
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,840
Oh, yeah?

663
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,980
Can I borrow one of your etch-a-scenes?

664
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,140
Uh, sure.

665
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,200
You got the don't-fool hair.

666
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,780
You got the don't-fool hair.

667
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,400
Who cares?

668
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,140
Yeah, some say it's better.

669
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,520
Some prefer Jones, actually.

670
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,280
Yeah, we're just right out here.

671
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,520
The streets of San Francisco.

672
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,040
Look at that guy do it.

673
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,000
Are you for Smith?

674
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,740
Or are you for Jones?

675
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,920
Yes, I am.

676
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:38,980
You for what?

677
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,080
I said, yes, I am.

678
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,300
Oh, you're for Jones.

679
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:43,700
That's right.

680
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,260
I put the heart in myself.

681
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,320
So, join us today and boycott the new Stark fist.

682
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,960
The pink fist, bad, old fist, good.

683
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,740
Liver.

684
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,820
That's a genius.

685
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,000
I spit all over myself doing that.

686
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,900
What did a man have to do to get a little proper?

687
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,340
Come around here.

688
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:44,680
Well, here this last half of the program.

689
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:48,000
First, we heard the boingos and something isn't right.

690
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,580
The symbol police piece performed by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

691
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,260
And a little bit more of defense entertainment technologies.

692
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:05,600
Our old friends OBE doing Victims of Delusion and Wacko Wacko.

693
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,700
A little bit from that amazing Lookout Miami tape.

694
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,100
Lonesome Cowboy Dave again doing The People Are Funny, Smelling.

695
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,180
And a little bit of Philodrum and a whole bunch of other stuff.

696
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:23,920
I want to read something we got in the mail from the Special Righteousness Committee.

697
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,800
And I will give you their address.

698
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,080
They're in Portland, Oregon, which is relevant because perhaps some of you,

699
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,200
those of you who follow things like politics,

700
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,700
made note of Measure No. 9 recently, which failed in the state of Oregon.

701
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,640
I was up for a vote this month as I read this.

702
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,980
And that Measure No. 9 was,

703
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,440
well, here it is, quote, unquote.

704
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,700
Measure No. 9 amends Constitution.

705
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,100
Government cannot facilitate, must discourage homosexuality, other behaviors.

706
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,520
All governments in Oregon may not use their monies or properties

707
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,500
to promote, encourage, or facilitate homosexuality, pedophilia, sadism, or masochism.

708
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:18,160
So the Special Righteousness Committee, again addressed to Fox,

709
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,380
published the following argument in the general voters pamphlet,

710
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,700
the space for which they bought for $300.

711
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,760
And that is the statement which they sent us in which I'm going to read to you now.

712
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:37,480
Now this was an argument in favor that was sent to the state of Oregon.

713
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,500
And this was published.

714
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,800
Argument in favor.

715
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,920
According to the book of Leviticus in the Bible,

716
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,460
oyster eating, crossbreeding cattle, shaving a beard,

717
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,160
wearing clothing made of...

718
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,140
mixed fibers,

719
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,540
cursing one's parents,

720
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,140
and adultery are just as immoral as homosexuality.

721
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,440
If the OCA's No Special Rights Committee

722
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,540
wants to take one of the 3,000-year-old laws of ritual holiness from Leviticus

723
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,180
and put it into the Bill of Rights in the state constitution,

724
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,920
they should at least be sincere enough to put all the rest of Leviticus into the constitution as well.

725
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,020
Simple matter of respect for these historic laws to treat them consistently.

726
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,680
We at the Special Righteousness Committee are just as offended

727
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,160
by the OCA's no special rights committee as we are by the state constitution.

728
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,320
Oyster eating, shaving, and mixed fibers.

729
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,100
As the OCA is offended by homosexuality,

730
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,500
and we have just as much right as the OCA does

731
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,940
to change the state constitution to require government discrimination

732
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,060
against people whose behavior we don't like.

733
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:34,800
My friends, do you want the public schools teaching your children

734
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,980
that shaving is a legitimate and equal alternative style to a normal and healthy beard?

735
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,460
Would you want to be forced to hire an oyster eater to direct your church choir?

736
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,120
Adam and Eve wore fig leaves.

737
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,900
100% fig leaves.

738
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:54,580
And this is divine proof that these disgustingly unnatural cotton polyester blends are sinful.

739
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,460
And when the OCA was analyzing the threat to traditional family values,

740
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,640
we don't know how they managed to overlook adultery.

741
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,800
Why, there's a lot more adultery than homosexuality going on out there,

742
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,600
and extrapolations from OCA statistics show that 90% of the people

743
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,540
who have engaged in sexual perversions are heterosexual.

744
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,400
Or straight.

745
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,100
This state condones adultery.

746
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,180
By not punishing it with death, as required by Leviticus.

747
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,000
It promotes oyster eating by licensing seafood restaurants,

748
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,260
and it allows people to take mixed fibers out of the closet

749
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,840
and to flaunt them right out in public without being fired or evicted.

750
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,260
The state is encouraging sin.

751
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,000
If the OCA can have the special right to make their personal moral agenda into public policy,

752
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,620
then anyone else should be able to amend the state bill of rights

753
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,700
to eliminate basic human rights for people who they don't like.

754
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,080
My friends, let's put all of Leviticus into the picture.

755
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:47,480
The Constitution.

756
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,600
A yes vote is the first step in facilitating our militant moral agenda.

757
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,860
Agree with us, or burn in hell.

758
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:08,860
Signed, Special Righteousness Committee, P.O. Box 1851, Portland, Oregon 97207.

759
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,800
And now the contendering dope opera as the world order turns.

760
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,660
Last week, George told Barbara Ronnie was pregnant with Nancy's baby,

761
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,360
who ran away with Jim to the Baker's.

762
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:50,800
George eavesdropped on Bill, who was listening in on Dan,

763
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,040
who was tapping Al's phone, who was eavesdropping on George.

764
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,300
Sodom moved to Beverly Hills with a movie deal while the Ayatollah remained dead.

765
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,460
A family values stop speech stop.

766
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:09,240
Dan cheated on his wife, drove drunk, and didn't buy his kids anything.

767
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,020
As for the GOP, they found a domestic agenda.

768
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,180
They're going to hire everybody as domestic.

769
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,000
Now, a preview as, as the world order turns.

770
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:31,280
Deliah Kulka has to come in the back door.

771
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,500
I don't want that Mexican free trade delegation seeing him here.

772
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,360
Barbie, Barbie, barb...

773
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,720
But Georgie, that's not he.

774
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,660
That's one of the Hangar 19 aliens.

775
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,340
And I, and I, I don't know.

776
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,320
I'm having an affair with it.

777
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,680
And, and it's baby too.

778
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,940
Alien, alien.

779
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,180
Better get immigration after him.

780
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,840
See if he has a green card.

781
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,340
Did Dan call?

782
00:48:58,780 --> 00:48:59,180
He did.

783
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,580
And I'm having his baby too.

784
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,500
That's, that's what's great about America.

785
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,560
I'm having a baby too.

786
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,600
It's what family values is all about.

787
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,220
Choice.

788
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,060
And I'm getting an abortion.

789
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,860
No, no, no.

790
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:16,660
George.

791
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,260
Oh, no.

792
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:42,380
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.

793
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,780
We will, we will rock you.

794
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,880
We will, we will rock you.

795
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,840
Some may ask, why rock out now?

796
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,080
The answer is clear.

797
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,040
These are the times that rock men sold.

798
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:14,520
I instructed our military commanders to totally rock back then.

799
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,200
And I repeat this here tonight.

800
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,800
We will, we will rock you.

801
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,840
We will, we will rock you.

802
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,200
We will, we will rock you.

803
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:34,200


804
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,480
I think that we just have another satellite cross paths.

805
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:44,160
Not long enough for that's the sound of video tape being rewound.

806
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,320
We will, we will rock you.

807
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,760
We will, we will rock you.

808
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,600
And let me say to everyone listening in Washington, may God continue to rock our nation.

809
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,680
The United States of America.

810
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,560
.

811
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:58,560


812
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:06,380
.

813
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,280
.

814
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:17,400
.

815
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:17,440
.

816
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:17,460
.

817
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:17,480
.

818
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:17,500
.

819
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:24,260
Man, this would be a hell of a job if I didn't have so many bosses and customers and workmates.

820
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:29,000
This would be a great job if all I had to do was have this company all to myself.

821
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,720
I wish I could just cash in the company, take the cash, and fuck everybody.

822
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,360
You know? I'll cash the company in.

823
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,340
It's worth like 650 million dollars or something.

824
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,140
Cash it in, tell all the advertisers,

825
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:49,300
Fuck you! Get your own damn ad, your own book, make a publication.

826
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:59,600
Keep the money, start an evil empire full of demons and occult references.

827
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,300
Make it into a worldwide universal religion.

828
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:13,040
The use of which I can then, through the use of which I can overthrow

829
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,120
the government.

830
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:14,640
The world.

831
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,140
That's not asking much.

832
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,200
650 million may not be enough.

833
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,180
You mean about 40, 50 billion.

834
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,080
Yeah.

835
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,260
Maybe a trillion.

836
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,860
As long as I wish, I wish I had a trillion dollars.

837
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,680
Buy my own country and make myself a dictator.

838
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,260
Fuck everybody!

839
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,960
That's what I'd do, man.

840
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,100
If only I had a trillion dollars.

841
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,280
None of this, none of this other than this hundred dollars,

842
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,080
this thousand dollar stuff, no way.

843
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,580
I want a trillion and nothing.

844
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,280
A trillion and me-

845
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:55,900
hundred dollars.

846
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,620
Is it too much to ask?

847
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,540
To have just a measly little old trillion bucks?

848
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,480
Is it too much?

849
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,620
I guess.

850
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:10,980
Hmmmm.

851
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,780
Ooh.

852
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:16,100


853
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,000
Locked in for continued tracking.

854
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,840
Navy returning lawn chairs to quivering, palpitating flesh.

855
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:36,820
Shop owner shaken made jettison unimportant, ephemeral nobodies.

856
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,080
They are nuisances, plain and simple, that's all.

857
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:51,500
KPFA, Reloader survives gigantic those benighted experiments before it's too late.

858
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,680
Prunes, illegal aliens find bad homes, accomplishments, and so forth.

859
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,860
Especially all over your face.

860
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,280
So, Princess and the P test.

861
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,920
Once upon a time in a plutocracy, a long time today,

862
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,560
there was a King George.

863
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:13,820
He was a bad king, but he was even worse when he was running drugs to other kingdoms.

864
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,620
Sadly, King George got high on his own supply,

865
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,120
and this made him very cross at times,

866
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:24,260
especially to his loyal subjects, who he was sure were trying to kill him,

867
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,380
or not elect him, as the case may be.

868
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,360
One day, he hit upon a great idea.

869
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,580
The kingdom would supply drugs to his subjects,

870
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:36,400
and then pass laws, making anyone who got caught with drugs

871
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:36,760
enemies.

872
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:42,980
And, as enemies of the kingdom, King George could confiscate everything the subject owned,

873
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,340
and put the subject into slave labor prison.

874
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,920
This he did.

875
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,000
But, he wasn't getting enough confiscations.

876
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:54,800
One day, during one of his month-long tears, he had another brilliant idea.

877
00:54:55,100 --> 00:55:00,160
He passed an edict saying all his subjects must submit their urine to be analyzed,

878
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,440
to see if they had ever used drugs.

879
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,560
If they had ever used drugs, everything they had would be his.

880
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:11,700
This way, as supplier of drugs, and enforcer of draconian drug laws,

881
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,960
he had his loyal subjects right where he wanted them,

882
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,420
between a rock and hard time.

883
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,480
Which brings us to the princess.

884
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,680
A white Anglo-Saxon princess.

885
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,760
Her name was Juanita Epstein.

886
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:27,780
She was an average princess who liked to party an average amount.

887
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:32,460
Then, one middle of the night, there came loud, rude knocks on her door.

888
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,840
She was whisked away, and immediately,

889
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,100
brought before King George, she had to take a pee test.

890
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:44,680
Now, with everyone looking and leering, this upset the princess,

891
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,740
because she had just smoked some plant a few days ago.

892
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,600
Obediently, she squatted down, and tried to fill the cup with her sample.

893
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,640
Then, with a trembling hand dripping with urine,

894
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,440
she handed the sample to the king, who was by now quite aroused.

895
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,980
Knowing her bodily functions had betrayed her, and she had nothing to lose,

896
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,680
with the other hand, she withdrew a firearm.

897
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,840
And shot the king five times.

898
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,140
For the people!

899
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,560
She cried, as the kingdom's goons ripped her apart.

900
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,960
After this episode, another king took over, who was even worse.

901
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:18,920
King Dan.

902
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:23,360
He would sell arms to foreign countries, and then fight wars with them.

903
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,820
And everybody lived happily, never after.

904
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,360
Well, thanks again.

905
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,880
I can't thank you enough, Philip Glass, for being here in the studio with us tonight.

906
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,180
Well, way back there, what was it?

907
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:51,380
Good old lonesome cowboy Dave, with that Bush soap opera,

908
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,360
and the Princess and the Pea test.

909
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,060
And then we heard Philodrumon making what I personally thought

910
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,560
was a not unreasonable request for a lot of money.

911
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,120
And...

912
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:10,160
we wind this particular hour of Slack down for...

913
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:11,960
down for a night.

914
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:16,780
And we want to thank you all so much for all your wonderful cards,

915
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,140
and letters, and phone calls, and...

916
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,580
Yeah, we were... we were on...

917
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,520
President Bush tonight, but we're not gonna have much chance,

918
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,820
and we'll be on Clinton, don't you worry.

919
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,980
Uh, that old thing here about Rendon Stimpy I was gonna tell you about, but...

920
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,740
don't have time, but, uh, it's, you know...

921
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,040
The news is bad, so, you know, forget about it.

922
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,240
Leave it out.

923
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,340
But, you know, it's fun, that's just the way it works.

924
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,720
It's good and bad, we lose Rendon Stimpy, but we still got the Simpsons, and...

925
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,880
you know, we've got that big fat load, Rush Limbaugh,

926
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,020
but on the other hand, we... we in Dallas now have Howard Stern,

927
00:57:55,140 --> 00:58:00,080
so I think it's what Bob takes away with one hand, he gives back with the next, and...

928
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,040
to give, uh...

929
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,960
to get that hand from Bob,

930
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,900
or at least one of the fingers,

931
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:12,460
just write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306

932
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,260
in the city of Dallas, the state of Texas.

933
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,960
75214, that's Bob, P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

934
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,420
Praise Bob, thank you for listening, and be here at your station next week.

935
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,380
Praise Bob.

936
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,740
That's right!

937
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,000
Coming up this fall of Western Civilization,

938
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,620
it's radio shorts, scam arts, brain rats, cartoon excess!

939
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,500
Chugging into your what-a-way-to-make-a-living-room!

940
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,840
Radio cartoons like you've never heard them and probably won't ever will again!

941
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:01,560
We've got radio cartoons for everybody, like you, Dad!

942
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,660
How about a cartoon about a playboy,

943
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:04,980
Bunny,

944
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,500
model with the crabs, you got it, Bugs Bunny!

945
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,360
And Mom, you'll get the best in kiddie porn with...

946
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,840
He Licks the Cat!

947
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,980
He licks the cat!

948
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,980
The wonderful, wonderful cat!

949
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,720
Whenever he needs a fix,

950
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,660
he boinks his cat's bull tricks!

951
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,660
Be on the listen for Heckle, Jekyll, and Hyde,

952
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,620
by day, fun-lovin' magpies,

953
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,580
by night, rude, coot, lewd, shrewd dudes.

954
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:38,520
Hey, E. Rocky! Watch me put a rabbi out of my hat!

955
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,540
Aw, that trick never works.

956
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:43,020
This time, for sure! Presto!

957
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,280
Hey, that's me!

958
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,080
No, no, a moose?

959
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,860
You heard correctly.

960
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:57,560
It's E. Rocky and Bullwinkle with Boris Chalkanoff and Roochstaffa!

961
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,040
Woo!

962
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:03,500
Gee, my hoos, you know how shrewd you can be!

963
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,260
I think Ranger Smith's karma's bad.

964
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,900
I wish you'd maybe rip him apart.

965
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,660
We're bears, Yogi, not the Beatles.

966
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,760
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Little Boo Buddha!

967
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,900
Don't let bad energy vibes

968
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,220
Rube your sublime state of consciousness!

969
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:20,660
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

970
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,660
Give Ranger Smith a chance

971
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,600
You will see he's intrinsically on a different level of thought

972
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,060
And hence his actions

973
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,320
Should provoke in you a spirit of peace

974
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,740
And tranquility

975
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,580
With your emotional well-being!

976
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,960
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

977
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,980
Gee, my hoos, you know how shrewd you can be!

978
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:42,100
What's the metaphysical aspects of pick-a-lick baskets?

979
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,040
There's more.

980
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,920
You've heard of Tom and Jerry?

981
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,380
Well, we got Uncle Tom and Jerry Falwell.

982
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,100
We've got the scummy bears,

983
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,700
the I-don't-care bears in Woody Woodpeckerwood.

984
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:57,600
That's Cartoon Access, coming this fall

985
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,060
of Western Civilization on radio stations

986
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,580
and everywhere.

987
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,820
It's about the movie

988
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:05,820


989
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:05,820


990
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:05,820


991
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,680
Hey there!

992
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:17,960
What a wonderful party!

993
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,120
Yeah!

994
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,980
It's a good party as usual.

995
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:30,740
It's just, like, it's very glossy, right?

996
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,060
Thank you very much. You have just proved my point.

997
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,100
Oh, please, mister.

998
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:51,580
Oh, please, mister. Please, mister. Please, mister. Please, mister. Please, mister.

999
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:56,440
We won! Because everything counts when you're building a house.

1000
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,880
Even if it was Tiger's fault.

1001
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:04,620
Oh, please, mister.
