1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,820
Holy cats. Hey. It's almost...

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,780
Yeah. Almost a perfect...

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,840
It is. It's wrong.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,600
We finally got one.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,440
We found a...

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,460
So genius. Power of...

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,520
Swatch.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,580
Oh excellent. I know doctor, we think so too. We're gonna try to melt it out with thermite bombs.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,820
Where do you want these bombs sir?

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,240
Over there.

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,740
Hey doc, can you see anything out there?

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,740
A bunch. We don't have more than an hour.

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,460
There was a guy on alt slack today going,

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,200
I've transcended duality and you haven't.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,320
And he was serious.

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,240
I transcended duality and you haven't.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,220
I don't think he saw the inherent paradox in that statement or the inadvertence.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,520
I don't think he saw the inherent paradox in that statement or the inadvertence.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,500
I don't think he saw the inherent paradox in that statement or the inadvertence.

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,640
But if they can't not see the humour of it then let them mount up upon themselves.

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,060
But if they can't not see the humour of it then let them mount up upon themselves.

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,720
As the old Irish thing goes.

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,400
Anyway, I've been reading through the autobiography of Mark Twain.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,660
This edition I found at a garage sale for 25 cents.

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,920
And it was printed in 1924.

26
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,220
And until I got hold of it, it was in really bad shape.

27
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:33,160
But I wanted to read this bit that I found in here because it's perfect for reading.

28
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,460
But I wanted to read this bit that I found in here because it's perfect for reading.

29
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,720
Written in 1898, Vienna.

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,780
By Mark Twain.

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,340
Beauties of the German Language.

32
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,240
Lectured for the benefit of a charity last night in the Borsendorfer Saal.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,000
Lectured for the benefit of a charity last night in the Borsendorfer Saal.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,600
Just as I was going on the platform, a messenger delivered to me an envelope with my name on it,

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,760
and this was written under it.

36
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,780
Please read one of these tonight.

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,200
Please read one of these tonight.

38
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,420
Enclosed were a couple of newspaper clippings.

39
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,020
Two versions of an anecdote.

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
One German, the other English.

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,800
I was minded to try the German one on those people just to see what would happen,

42
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,140
but my courage weakened when I noticed the formidable look of the closing word,

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,520
and I gave it up.

44
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,360
A pity, too, for it ought to be read well on the platform and get an encore,

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,860
that or a brickbat.

46
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,880
There is never any telling what a new audience will do.

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,000
Their tastes are capricious.

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,020
The point of this anecdote is a justifiable,

49
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,900
a double jibe at the German long word,

50
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,100
and is not as much of an exaggeration as one might think.

51
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,060
The German long word is not a legitimate construction,

52
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,780
but an ignoble artificiality,

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,620
a sham.

54
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,360
It has no recognition by the dictionary,

55
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,680
and is not found there.

56
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,380
It is made by jumbling a lot of words into one,

57
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,400
in a quite unnecessary way.

58
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,540
It is a lazy device of the vulgar,

59
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,080
and a crime against the language.

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,500
Nothing can be gained,

61
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,460
no valuable amount of space saved,

62
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,460
by jumbling the following words together on a visiting card,

63
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,440
quote,

64
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,120
Mrs. Smith, widow of the late commander-in-chief of the police department.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,060
Yet a German widow can persuade herself to do it without much trouble.

66
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,480
Mrs. late commander-in-chief of the police department's widow Smith.

67
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,400
This is the English version of the anecdote.

68
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,500
A Dresden paper,

69
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,660
the Weedeman,

70
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,680
which thinks that there are kangaroos,

71
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,760
or butylrattes,

72
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,480
in South Africa,

73
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,760
says the Hottentots,

74
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,300
or Hottentotten,

75
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,900
put them in cages,

76
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,960
or kotter,

77
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,860
provided with covers,

78
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,460
lattengitter,

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,040
to protect them from the rain.

80
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,580
The cages are therefore called

81
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,440
lattengitterwetterkotter,

82
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,180
and the imprisoned kangaroo,

83
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,520
lattengitterwetterkotterbutylratte.

84
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,000
One day, an assassin,

85
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,920
or Hottentotter,

86
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,960
was arrested who had killed a Hottentot woman,

87
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,300
or Hottentottenmutter,

88
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,720
the mother of two stupid and stuttering children

89
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,200
in Strattertrotterl.

90
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,840
This woman, in the German language, is entitled

91
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,460
Hottentottenstrattertrottermutter,

92
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,220
and her assassin takes the name,

93
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,660
Hottentottenstrattermutterottentotter.

94
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
The murderer was confined in a kangaroo's cage,

95
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,840
butylrattenlattengitterwetterkotter.

96
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,920
Whence, a few days later, he escaped.

97
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,060
But fortunately, he was recaptured by a Hottentot,

98
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,500
who presented himself at the mayor's office

99
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,740
with a beaming face.

100
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,600
I have captured the butylratte, he said.

101
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,580
Which one, said the mayor,

102
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,480
we have several.

103
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,180
The Hottentotterlattengitterwetterkotterbeutelratte.

104
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,320
Which Hottentotter are you talking about?

105
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,920
About the Hottentottenstrattertrottermutterottentotter.

106
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,300
Then why didn't you say it once?

107
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,240
The Hottentottenstrattermutterottentotterlattengitterwetterkotterbeutelratte.

108
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,520
By Mark Twain.

109
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,420
And friends,

110
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,180
that's all I'm going to say,

111
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,960
because I have to crank out shows in a hurry.

112
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,640
We're in the middle of a big project.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,100
And luckily, Dr. Philodrummon called me up

114
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,160
and said that the other night on the Puzzling Evidence show

115
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,800
at KPFA in Berkeley,

116
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,000
the actually oldest subgenius show,

117
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,240
it started in 1982,

118
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,440
and yet it's still on.

119
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,900
He said they did a really good one the other night

120
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,260
with Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence

121
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,420
and himself.

122
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,180
And a caller, Governor Rocknar.

123
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,020
And I listened to the MP3,

124
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,600
which is easy to download

125
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,800
by way of quiveringbrain.com,

126
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,300
if you look closely.

127
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,940
And he was right.

128
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,260
It's a really good one,

129
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,340
and it saves me having to edit

130
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,120
because it was just generally a good show.

131
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:11,680
So friends,

132
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,220
I'm just going to give it all to the Californicators there

133
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,360
in Berkeley and San Francisco.

134
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,500
And I'm going to give it to you.

135
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,660
Snoop Dogg,

136
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:20,760
Tony SW,

137
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,440
Foogie the Scooby and so forth,

138
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,320
where they all live.

139
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,740
Friends,

140
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,980
Christ-Bob.

141
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,420
And as Howell wandered away,

142
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,700
he carefully assessed the situation

143
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,200
asking himself,

144
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,040
First,

145
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,380
I've got to get loose

146
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,280
and then,

147
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,240
I'll kill Bob.

148
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,040
There he is.

149
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,540
Always playing this show.

150
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,940
Wandering away with the Amos.

151
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,580
They call him the wanderer.

152
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,060
Maybe we can help him.

153
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,720
And yet everyone knows World Overlord.

154
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,140
Please help me!

155
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,580
He's stuck in that Xerox machine.

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,320
He's Xeroxing all the pages of that new book, The Truth Behind Skull Farming.

157
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,380
It's my only chance to keep this Xerox machine running.

158
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,420
Here, have this sack full of museum quality food.

159
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,500
As soon as I finish making these copies, I'll tear into it.

160
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,260
Okay, we're all ready for the boat ride back to the center of the museum.

161
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,260
It strikes me as odd that the Xerox machine looks like a submarine.

162
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,920
It does. It's a submarine turned upside down.

163
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,120
We're gonna sit on the top or the bottom of it.

164
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,460
Apparently the studio they broadcast from sits in a pool of mercury.

165
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,720
So there's no way to reach them.

166
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,100
I was just watching Sano Buoys.

167
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,460
The tomb in China that is surrounded by the many terracotta warriors.

168
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,960
And they haven't touched it because they really want to get to the best point of entry.

169
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,920
Like 50 years from now and they think they can do it without breaking something.

170
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,760
Man, that looks great.

171
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,960
It's a whole cosmology that the king had built around himself.

172
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,380
Of his own.

173
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,800
His world in miniature to take with him.

174
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,780
And then he drank some mercury because he figured that was everlasting life.

175
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,740
And who knows, maybe he's right.

176
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,920
And then he lay down and became a tomb.

177
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,020
There goes.

178
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,960
They laid him in the tomb.

179
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,360
Hey, this is my tomb.

180
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,920
Get out of here.

181
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,320
I'm already resting in here.

182
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,540
Well, you were using up all the doom here in the tomb.

183
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,360
Well, I didn't roll away the stone for no reason.

184
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,800
Man, I was in here with the stone rolled back waiting to be discovered by the priests.

185
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,680
They were going to come in and find me still alive.

186
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,140
Papa Jesus and Mama Jesus.

187
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,380
I was supposed to be in here.

188
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,460
I was still supposed to be alive though.

189
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,900
Sorry sir, central services has a form here you can fill out.

190
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,820
Did you bring the lunch you were supposed to bring?

191
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,160
I ordered a special kosher lunch.

192
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,220
It's turned to stone.

193
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,580
Oh no.

194
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,860
All right.

195
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,400
That's it.

196
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:14,900
Bob.

197
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,620
Bob.

198
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,700
He's calling the teacher.

199
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,180
There he goes.

200
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,740
Always running and crying to Bob when anything goes wrong.

201
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:22,940
Bob.

202
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:23,840
Bob.

203
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,380
No.

204
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,900
Bob, son of battle.

205
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,280
No.

206
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,860
No.

207
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,660
But you can't have Bob fight all your battles.

208
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,200
He'll be here in a minute.

209
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,120
Then you'll be sorry.

210
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,920
You'll say, forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

211
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,440
No, in your version he's fine.

212
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,500
He's going to be here in a minute.

213
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,100
In my version, I just shot him again.

214
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,120
You'll say, forgive me, Bob, for I have sinned.

215
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,320
Well, I better say.

216
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Bob, he's no slob.

217
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,500
Bob, he's no fool.

218
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,000
Hey, what happened to the right channel?

219
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,520
There it is.

220
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,480
He's the head of that subgenius church.

221
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,160
Hey, it came back.

222
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,920
He's so powerful.

223
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,800
If you think I'm going too fast, honey, just get out of the car.

224
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:04,100
In the first week of March 1095, Pope Urban II presided over a church council at Piacenza

225
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,540
in northern Italy.

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,200
There was present an embassy sent by the Byzantine emperor Alexius to ask for help against the

227
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,500
Turks.

228
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,860
The Turks, whose advance across Asia Minor had brought them within striking distance

229
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,660
of Constantinople.

230
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,820
By the early eighth century, the Christians had lost North Africa.

231
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,020
Palestine and Syria and most of Spain to the Muslims.

232
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,200
But then the frontier between Christendom and Islam had stabilized until the Byzantine

233
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,360
empires, ruling from Constantinople, what remained of the Eastern Roman Empire, went

234
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,480
on to the offensive in the second half of the 19th century.

235
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,460
The comparatively subdued reaction of the Muslims to the first crusade can be partly

236
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:55,440
explained by the fact that their confidence had already been shaken 130 years before.

237
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,220
The ancient cities of Tarsus and Antioch had been retaken and the Byzantine frontier had

238
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,200
advanced into northern Syria.

239
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,280
A violent shock had been felt throughout the Islamic world.

240
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,240
Are you going to show the truth?

241
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
The

242
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,220
Abbasid Caliphs in Baghdad had atrophied and they themselves had fallen into the hands of

243
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,660
the Shiite princes, whom they regarded as heretics.

244
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:54,420
In 969, Egypt had been occupied almost without opposition by another Shiite dynasty, the

245
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,180
Fatimids, and a rival caliphate had been established.

246
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:05,520
Thereafter, the Fatimids struggled to wrest Palestine and Syria from the Abbasids until

247
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:12,160
in the 1060s and 1070s they had to give way to the Turks, who, taking advantage of 17 years

248
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,240
of internal disorder in Egypt, drove them out of most of their Syrian possessions and left

249
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,020
them with only a shaky hold on remote parts of Palestine.

250
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:30,080
It was these Turks who at the same time revived Muslim fortunes on the Christian frontier.

251
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,500
Far to the east among the nomadic Turkomans, the Abbasids were the most powerful and the

252
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,980
moなたmtursk producers of had

253
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,280
little on what they were being arms for.

254
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,200
.

255
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,600
.

256
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,380
chief called Selchuk brought into the settled Islamic area.

257
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,500
Which is translated into Bob.

258
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,760
Yeah, that one's better.

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,460
This one?

260
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,320
Yeah, much better.

261
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,100
Much better.

262
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,060
This one is still good.

263
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,500
Yeah, well, it's kind of neat.

264
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,860
It's just a different, it's a special effect thing.

265
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,300
It's a special effect.

266
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,880
Oh, it hurts, though.

267
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,440
Don't do that.

268
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,240
Praise Bob.

269
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,520
Kill me for Bob.

270
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,400
Water for the love of Allah.

271
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,200
For in that grin, the secret lies.

272
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,460
Within the grin lies secret lies.

273
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,540
For when Bob shines and nothing green, where are you and where am me?

274
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,800
What do you mean?

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,740
What do you mean?

276
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,480
So we're playing just the soundtrack.

277
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
I mean, just part of the soundtrack.

278
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,280
Yeah, the vocal quotes and then the screams.

279
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,160
No gunshots.

280
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,640
No nothing.

281
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,920
Okay, I'm going to get to work here.

282
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,360
Yeah, I got to get to work.

283
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,120
So you go into the racetrack.

284
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,260
I thought you go to the dog track.

285
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,660
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up.

286
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,280
When Rocknard goes to work, he has to go to the racetrack.

287
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,240
He actually said one of the holiest movies there is.

288
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,440
Fight Club.

289
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,800
Yeah, it is like Fight Club for me because I haven't slept any day.

290
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,240
Never talk about Fight Club.

291
00:13:59,580 --> 00:13:59,980
No.

292
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,400
And he has no idea of the history of the person in this car.

293
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,460
I have with that movie.

294
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,640
Ah, history.

295
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,560
Hey, Rocknard.

296
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,340
Do you want to ever give a guess as to why in that movie?

297
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,820
In that movie, the guy shoots Bob.

298
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,160
Yeah, when everything is a copy of a copy of a copy,

299
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,540
then you just get so to where you're just wired on anti-sleep,

300
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,200
and then you just, you know, you start to see everything.

301
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,440
No, seriously.

302
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,540
Okay, good.

303
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,800
I'm really kind of looking.

304
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,320
Hey, Philo, can you, you got everything there in a box?

305
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,480
Yeah, it's in a box.

306
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,640
We have it distilled into a singularity.

307
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,820
A lead-lined box.

308
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,760
There's a personal subgenius reason why Bob is shining.

309
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:37,900
There is enough fissile material.

310
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,220
We're going to tell that story sometime.

311
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,060
And then Bob just laughed and laughed.

312
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:46,800
Ha, ha.

313
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,020
8484425 if you want to hear.

314
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,560
Hey, leave some beer for me, Hal.

315
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,400
It's radio.

316
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,820
We're just radio beer, man.

317
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,160
You don't really taste it.

318
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,400
He's lost in that.

319
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,280
Hal is just crying and crying, and then Bob looked down and said,

320
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,620
Oh, the world's going to blow up.

321
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,120
It's okay.

322
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,540
You're doing fine, son.

323
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,880
Each bomb capable of destroying a city and generating a vast cloud of nuclear poison.

324
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,120
Here, take this tissue and wipe your tears away.

325
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,100
And don't worry about those shackles.

326
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,640
Bob has already set them free.

327
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,980
We'll stick some, you can take the tissue after you've wiped the tears away.

328
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,160
And stick them between the shackle and your ankle.

329
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,320
And take some of the tissue.

330
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:38,720
There they go.

331
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:38,720


332
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:38,720


333
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,300
Shit the shoulder and shoulder.

334
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,580
How precious is there's no chance of that.

335
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,480
It's necessary to be geared.

336
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,080
But I think that could be distributed to us.

337
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,080


338
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,380
By testing.

339
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,080
The number of

340
00:15:45,080 --> 00:16:02,820
Listen to archeologos and it's Lisa the

341
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,320
Living.

342
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:15,760
liberation meaningless. The brink of annihilation will then have been reached. Or worse.

343
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:25,880
Today's impending nuclear arms race echoes the frenzied militarization of a century ago,

344
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,280
when the European powers still had time to avert the senseless catastrophe that would

345
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,740
soon befall their people, a catastrophe whose unforeseen consequences include, among others,

346
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:45,020
the Bolshevik Revolution, Hitler, World War II, nuclear weaponry, the Holocaust, the Cold

347
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:53,700
War, and the unstable entity known as Iraq. Urgent disarmament proposals, dismissed then

348
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,200
as naive, impractical, blind, and so on, must be seen in light of the madness that followed

349
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,240
to have been the greatest wisdom. It was the sleepwalking war makers who proved to be naive,

350
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,600
impractical, and blind as they led their countrymen into the abyss from which emerged

351
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,700
the disasters of the 20th century and beyond. The difference between then and now is that

352
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:23,120
there may be no one left to render a similar retrospective judgment. Should the nuclear

353
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,300
attack prevail, the disaster will be in vain.

354
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,400
The end.

dr nicotone provided this special gum and this patch although he's not a patch on his old man

393
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:57,120
north of the principality of antioch the cilician armenian ruler leo had accepted a crown from the

394
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,060
western emperor in 1198 a.d together with a form of submission to rome which was a very important

395
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,220
act in his life and is still the most important in today's history but what's more interesting

396
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,280
is that the romeo brothers were made by the romeo brother and the romeo brother was never very real

397
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:11,040
and has been already described many times by historians in the long passages hey if you're

398
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,120
finished with those pinks you can pass them over here i need to work out a little bit

399
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,300
oh look he's he's working out he's he's really he's really working out

400
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:33,060
that's it you can still squeeze a little use out of it and exaggerate it there if you put them under pressure well appropriate what can i say chemicals can be in the heat

401
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,980
enthusiasm. Give him a big hand.

402
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,820
Extracted.

403
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,300
More nitrous oxide, doctor.

404
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,000
That's weird.

405
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,360
Watch how that hair says.

406
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,560
It says on the inside here,

407
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,520
13 tracks.

408
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,580
But I get 14.

409
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,200
Isn't this the copying machine thing?

410
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:56,740
Yeah.

411
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,940
It's just pretty music.

412
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,280
It is.

413
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,380
You can tell that the drugs

414
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,620
destroyed that machine.

415
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,720
Really? I can't tell.

416
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,200
No, I don't own

417
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,260
a new pair of shiny black shoes,

418
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,000
so stop asking.

419
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,060
I'm going to

420
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,560
the toolbar

421
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,520
with me.

422
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,740
And so, once again,

423
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,780
good triumphs over evil,

424
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,740
and what?

425
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,860
That's one of the first records I bought

426
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,040
as a 12-year-old.

427
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,560
Yeah, and so now you have it in CB form.

428
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,680
And then I found it in CB.

429
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,680
Charlton Heston, Richard Harris,

430
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,160
Jim Hutton, James Coburn,

431
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,480
Michael Anderson Jr.,

432
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,360
and presenting

433
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,500
Santa Burger,

434
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,600
featuring Mitch Miller

435
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,220
and the gang,

436
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,560
singing the Major Dundee theme.

437
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,920
Well, who wrote the rest of the music?

438
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,200
Is it all Mitch Miller

439
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,480
and his bunch of...

440
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,000
No, I was never...

441
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,520
Conducted by Danielle Amphitheatral.

442
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,740
Let me hear a melody

443
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,840
I'd like to

444
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,940
sing along

445
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,620
Oh, I hated those shows.

446
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,620
Yeah, me too.

447
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,500
It was creepy to watch all these happy people.

448
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,760
I did watch Lawrence Wells

449
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,880
because I was forest-disordered by my mom

450
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,480
when I was very young.

451
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,660
It was kind of fun because it was so

452
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,300
absolutely strange

453
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,080
to watch this enforced happiness

454
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,900
on everybody's face.

455
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,680
And Mitch Miller was just...

456
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,820
Oh, it was impossible to make.

457
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,920
I could tell I'm garbage.

458
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,440
Well, Sam Peckinpah said that

459
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,520
the movie should be called

460
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,840
Gidget Goes to Mexico

461
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,140
because he was disgusted with the way

462
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,040
the studio took it over and recut it.

463
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,380
But it still has good parts.

464
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,380
What's that one?

465
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,220
Major Dundee.

466
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,880
Gidget Goes to Mexico?

467
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,620
That was what Peckinpah suggested

468
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,180
that the movie be named.

469
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,260
And he wanted his name to be...

470
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,460
It's not taken off,

471
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,860
but they wouldn't take it off.

472
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,600
Hey, what?

473
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,680
It's got some really cool parts, actually.

474
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,740
You can see it would have been

475
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,680
an okay movie.

476
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,160
They just chopped it

477
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
in their way.

478
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,740
Well, look at these

479
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,480
violent kung fu scenes.

480
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,960
I don't know if the kids ought to see

481
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,640
this kind of thing.

482
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,780
It's got lambies.

483
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,460
I know, but they bring in all these sheep

484
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,000
and...

485
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,580
Have you no dreams, you mindless sheep?

486
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,880
You milling peck.

487
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,220
I'd volunteer myself,

488
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,060
except these nosebleeds keep me on my back.

489
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,500
Once as old Lord Gorbles motored

490
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,880
round his moors near John O'Groats,

491
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,100
he collided with a goatherd

492
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
and his herd of sixty goats.

493
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,480
John O'Groats.

494
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,700
When at last his car plowed through,

495
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,760
they were all defunct but two.

496
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,940
Loudly he addressed the goatherd,

497
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,040
Dosh Mike.

498
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,880
Whiskers and my corns.

499
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,100
Haven't you the sense, you dotard,

500
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,660
to tell your goats to sound your horns?

501
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,380
Look, my AA badge is bent.

502
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,060
I've half a mind to raise your rent.

503
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,300
Did you notice that those people

504
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,200
were getting upset?

505
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,840
He was reading from About the Goats

506
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,160
while he was abusing the goats.

507
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,080
About a goat, I'll tell you a song.

508
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,380
It's amazing.

509
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,120
He can hold the book with one hand

510
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,720
while holding two goats

511
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,700
with the other hand.

512
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,260
Oh, that's what that is.

513
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,600
About a goat, I'll sing you a song.

514
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,440
He's yanking those goats around

515
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,420
as if they had

516
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,080
done something evil.

517
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,340
With a dangety ding

518
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,740
and a dingety dong.

519
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,320
This is the

520
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,800
Evil Demon

521
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,840
Session 4.

522
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,240
A sweet little goat for me.

523
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,160
Almost everything

524
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
in a man's life,

525
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,900
there is a fateful point

526
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,400
where everything falls into place.

527
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,160
P.U. Somebody open a window.

528
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,000
And so the last bobby fell,

529
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,440
chopped to pieces by radio chainsaws.

530
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,340
And they were buried

531
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,580
on the field of bobbies.

532
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,020
And nobody came.

533
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,180
And they let go

534
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,240
the grey balloons.

535
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,620
Blam, blably, blably,

536
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,400
blum, blom.

537
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,920
Come on, Philo, we're doing this for the audience.

538
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,780
Oh, I had the book upside down.

539
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,460
1149 A.D.

540
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,740
So did Nur-Ad-Din's brother,

541
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,040
the ruler of Mosul.

542
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,240
Oh, the audience?

543
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,940
Nur-Ad-Din was thwarted at Mosul,

544
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,860
where another brother was set up as governor.

545
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,380
He did not gain the city until 1170.

546
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,580
Speaking of audience, you may want to go out to

547
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,400
youtube.com

548
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,260
and search for Bob's Lunch Hour.

549
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,320
And the edit changes

550
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,300
every hour.

551
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,320
It's amazing. I don't know how those guys

552
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,580
do it, how they can make it

553
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,200
Philo look so young.

554
00:25:59,340 --> 00:25:59,900
Yeah, one...

555
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,260
Yeah.

556
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,500
Did you see that? His hair's long,

557
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,700
he's got a mustache, he looks like a porn star

558
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,200
according to his new wife.

559
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,620
Back in the days when there were porn stars.

560
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,300
Yeah, Philo was just a wannabe porn star.

561
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,320
Not actually

562
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,720
an actualized

563
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,100
true porn star.

564
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,440
It's just a

565
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,860
cunning linguistic

566
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,260
twist of...

567
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,980
of strange

568
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,980
wordage.

569
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,200
...seed to Harim

570
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,040
and in August 1164

571
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,540
inflicting a major defeat

572
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,580
on the Christians at Atal.

573
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,240
The show? Right, it's a word

574
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,720
bucket. It's a big word bucket.

575
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,000
Isn't that St. Stupid's Day

576
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,880
very close now? Yeah, St. Stupid's Day

577
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,680
happens on April 1st this year.

578
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,180
Like it does every year.

579
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,000
But this year

580
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,780
on April 1st will also

581
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,980
include the book signing.

582
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,440
...to Carmel.

583
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


584
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


585
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


586
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


587
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


588
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


589
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


590
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


591
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


592
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


593
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


594
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


595
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:00,440


596
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,980
...to commemorate the re-release

597
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,300
of Revelation X,

598
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,760
the Bob-apocryphon,

599
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,420
as well as the new book,

600
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,480
the Bob-li-ogryphon of Dobbs.

601
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,540
The Cyclopedia of Slack.

602
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,320
The Cyclopedia of Slack.

603
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,520
And so, yes, there will be

604
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,580
several of the book contributors

605
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,900
and or co-founders

606
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,100
there at

607
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,020
Alien Apocalypse 2006

608
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,380
and

609
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,060
The Meaning of Lost and Mismatched

610
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,160
Songs.

611
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,580
And Gynosaur Alphabet.

612
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,220
But where will it be?

613
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,400
At City Lights Bookstore.

614
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,640
Just getting to that point.

615
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,900
On Columbus Street in San Francisco.

616
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,360
And that will be the evening of April 1st

617
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,200
after the St. Stupid's Day parade.

618
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,760
Oh yes, all that St. Stupid stuff

619
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,920
will be long done and the

620
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,160
Subdini event begins

621
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,100
promptly at

622
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,940
7 o'clock.

623
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,580
7 o'clock.

624
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,260
7 o'clock.

625
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,040
And I'm just, I've got to tell you,

626
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,320
those of you that can't believe this,

627
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,180
I'm just sorry.

628
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,960
I just, I'm sorry you can't believe

629
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,800
what we're saying.

630
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,440
This email we're getting about

631
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
you think we're lying all the time.

632
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,160
That something's wrong

633
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,720
with Hal.

634
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,260
That's just a lie.

635
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,280
It's just a bad,

636
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,800
it's a good lie, but it's a bad thing

637
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,300
to lie.

638
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,480
To lie still

639
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,000
in that box.

640
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,200
That bad

641
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,320
people.

642
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,140
They go to the Caribbean

643
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,900
and enjoy tax shelters.

644
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,440
Here in Margaritaville,

645
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,080
you feel the sand between our toes.

646
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,100
Hey Bob, how are you doing?

647
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,660
Really ought to clean our shoes out.

648
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,260
Goodbye.

649
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,280
Well, and that's the way it is.

650
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,300
Isn't that...

651
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,400
Isn't that...

652
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,360
Yes, that dashing

653
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,800
Isn't that him over there?

654
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,240
Commander James...

655
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,380
James Bond.

656
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,460
His face looks different.

657
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,080
It looks like he's had surgery or something.

658
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,480
It's the foster grants.

659
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,100
Hmm.

660
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,600
Does this mean we still have to obey him?

661
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,700
No, that's Andre the Giant.

662
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,360
No, that's Andre the Giant.

663
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,240
Look, that man's t-shirt says,

664
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:19,800
Look, that man's t-shirt says,

665
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,760
repent, quit your job,

666
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,220
and slack off.

667
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,700
Another proto-subgenius.

668
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,220
Well, you see, M thought that Bond should be sent to the island to read the book.

669
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:29,220


670
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,120
And research the growing menace of this cult.

671
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,780
And see if, in fact, it was working with Smirch.

672
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,200
And see if, in fact, it was working with Smirch.

673
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,500
And perhaps even Spectre.

674
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,620
And once you smosh Smirch,

675
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,640
you're going down to Smarsh Spectre.

676
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,400
Now, while he's dancing with the beautiful woman,

677
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
and there's the shooter guy behind the tuba.

678
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,700
Yeah. Now take this, uh, serum.

679
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,060
You'll also notice that James Bond is getting closer and closer to a marijuana cigarette.

680
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:52,980
You'll also notice that James Bond is getting closer and closer to a marijuana cigarette.

681
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,300
You'll also notice that James Bond is getting closer and closer to a marijuana cigarette.

682
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,680
Take this serum, it'll make you more slippery.

683
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,200
Hey, let's do it up, dude.

684
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,700
They're trying to get James Bond stoned.

685
00:29:59,720 --> 00:29:59,720


686
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,280
Oh, and he's fighting the temptation.

687
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,680
His new skull or his old skull?

688
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,960
The head that was...

689
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,200
Or do we care? No.

690
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,920
Nice work, Luffle.

691
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,620
So he draws his pistol and shoots the stone at him.

692
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,240
And everything goes back to normal.

693
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,740
And there, in a typical Dobbs cameo role,

694
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,740
you see him walk across the back.

695
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,940
Everything goes back to normal.

696
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,380
And we continue our dance, all four of us here,

697
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,000
huddled in a little wet mask.

698
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,140
Uh, I think he's really

699
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,980
far out.

700
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,920
Uh oh, sorry man.

701
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,640
It's the president.

702
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,820
The band wasn't that bad.

703
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,840
You didn't have to blow him up like that.

704
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,660
How can I help you, Mr. President?

705
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,160
Yes?

706
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,200
Mr. Bond, we have a situation.

707
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,120
Yes, how can I help you?

708
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,000
Some nuclear devices have been captured.

709
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,720
My answer to the phone is still ringing.

710
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,060
And I have a cable,

711
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,980
which I received this afternoon,

712
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,780
that agents of SMERSH

713
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,280
working with Spectre

714
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,560
are holding the United Nations

715
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,580
for ransom.

716
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,300
Hostage.

717
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,620
You have 48 hours

718
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,360
to rectify the situation.

719
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,380
Now if you will excuse me,

720
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,780
I have an urgent call.

721
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,280
And now we go to Washington, D.C.

722
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:14,920
and switch presidents.

723
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,260
You're joining me because

724
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,200
the message this thing is not

725
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,340
my message, but ours.

726
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:22,960
Okay.

727
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,620
Don't worry.

728
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,360
Everything's being recorded.

729
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,380
The White House tapes it.

730
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,860
From the early days of our administration,

731
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,080
Nancy has been using marijuana

732
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,260
on a daily basis.

733
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,580
And her personal observations

734
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,780
and efforts have given her

735
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,860
such dramatic insights

736
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,800
that I wanted her to share them with you

737
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,740
this evening.

738
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,800
This priest is claiming he has the power

739
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,660
to pull Christ from heaven.

740
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,140
May the power of Christ

741
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,880
confirm this. He's pulling Christ down.

742
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,820
He's trying to force Christ to repeat

743
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,460
the crucifixion every hour.

744
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,920
You can't pour Christ down the drain

745
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,800
down with Johnny.

746
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,960
It's a shame.

747
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,720
It's contrary to Hebrews 10, 12.

748
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,960
Don't be a-talking when Nancy Reagan

749
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,600
is speaking.

750
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,740
Oh, sorry.

751
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,200
...as a precious gift to his children.

752
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,300
So to my young friends out there,

753
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,200
life can be great.

754
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,060
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol,

755
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:19,840
What?

756
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,960
there's a big, wonderful world

757
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,680
there is?

758
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,480
I thought we were supposed to say no.

759
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,860
...a positive influence on all that

760
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,600
we're trying to do.

761
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,200
The job ahead of us is very clear.

762
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,020
Nancy's personal crusade

763
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,560
to expand the use of

764
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,820
smokeable cocaine, otherwise known

765
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,540
as crack, should become

766
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,060
our national crusade.

767
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,940
Our young people are helping us

768
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,480
lead the way.

769
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,080
Not long ago in Oakland, California,

770
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,480
I was asked by a group of children

771
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,260
what to do if they were offered drugs.

772
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,220
Say yes, I answered.

773
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,820
Soon after that, those children

774
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,480
in Oakland formed a just

775
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,620
say yes club. And now,

776
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,960
there are over 10,000 such clubs

777
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,040
all over the country.

778
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,180
Drugs are the mightiest

779
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,520
force for good that we know.

780
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,520
You said it, Ronnie.

781
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,800
They're simply wonderful to the young people.

782
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,460
Simply wonderful, yes.

783
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,220
Many of you may be thinking,

784
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,400
well, drugs don't concern me.

785
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,500
But it does concern you.

786
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,140
It does. It concerns us all.

787
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,720
Because of the way it could fulfill the promise

788
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,480
and hope in those restless minds.

789
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,840
Drug and alcohol abuse

790
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,200
needs our encouragement.

791
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,860
In this crusade, let us

792
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,960
not forget who we are.

793
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,740
Drug abuse is a freedom that is

794
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,680
ours. You

795
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,780
are Americans.

796
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,420
You're the product of the freest society

797
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,680
mankind has ever known.

798
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,740
No one ever has the right

799
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,560
to separate the drugs from the customer.

800
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,700
Say yes to drugs

801
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,460
to the point of making others

802
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:52,960


803
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,480
And drug abuse is not a crime.

804
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,960
Drugs help us create love

805
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,880
and hope, trust

806
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,680
and confidence.

807
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,960
And cocaine makes me happy.

808
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,640
Think for a moment how special it is to be

809
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,320
an American.

810
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,400
To be a drug or to be a subgenius

811
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,760
or to be a, well, anyway, you get the point.

812
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,980
Many presidents talk about drugs

813
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,860
and you'll see none of that at the book signing.

814
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,800
That's right, all drug

815
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,800
taking will not be done on the premises.

816
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,660
Where there is a statue

817
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,100
of Benjamin Franklin.

818
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,040
Why? And from that statue

819
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,980
was stolen the beautiful

820
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,080
St. Stupids head.

821
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,820
Just like the original during

822
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,980
the night of Slag.

823
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,460
The night I shot Bob, somebody stole it.

824
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,060
It's an incredible Hagen built shrine.

825
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:39,940
The altar.

826
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,940
I'm sorry, the altar.

827
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,240
The altar missing since 1984.

828
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,600
And that person used to call the show and say

829
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,580
I have the altar.

830
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,240
But we wouldn't honor him.

831
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,140
Did you know that Bob is like our Jesus?

832
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,140
Our Jesus?

833
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,520
You mean like Robert Jesus?

834
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,780
Right, our Jesus.

835
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,660
Like our Crumb and our Cobb

836
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,040
and our Jesus.

837
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,580
Art Buckwold.

838
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,920
Ah, never allow a normal

839
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,000
any slack in superstition,

840
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,820
mumbling rights,

841
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,680
domination justified by differences

842
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,280
of class or type.

843
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
Testify, PD.

844
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,140
Renounce system thought,

845
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,680
glorphing and addiction to conspiracy

846
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,940
promoted techno sedatives.

847
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,880
Man, you just keep on doing what you're doing.

848
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,300
Observe and evaluate for yourself.

849
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,300
Don't be a receptacle for someone else's thoughts.

850
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,700
Go, baby, go.

851
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,260
Symbolically and or literally,

852
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,760
assassinate your old friends

853
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,260
who have gone over to the other side.

854
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,140
We, trusting in the mercy of God

855
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,200
and the authority of the blessed apostles

856
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,340
Peter and Paul,

857
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,740
by that power of binding and loosing

858
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,940
that God as conforming,

859
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:52,940


860
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:52,940


861
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:52,940


862
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,260
have offered on us, although unworthy,

863
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,800
grant to all those submitting

864
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,220
to the labor of this journey personally

865
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,940
and at their expense

866
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,660
full forgiveness of their sins

867
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,280
of which they have been moved

868
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,140
to penitence in voice and heart

869
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,340
and as the reward of the just

870
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,200
we promise them a greater share

871
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,400
of eternal salvation.

872
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,560
Hear, hear.

873
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,700
Fields of bliss,

874
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,420
happy fields where joy forever dwells.

875
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,940
And if enough to do,

876
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:22,940


877
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,840
if pressure is applied,

878
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,800
almost everything will come apart

879
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,980
at some point.

880
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,000
Now you did it.

881
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,820
Now you did it.

882
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,060
Come on, put it back together.

883
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,520
I have to get this one right or I'm out of this class.

884
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,380
A time for what?

885
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,640
A time for mowing and reaping?

886
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,080
A time for putting away tablecloths?

887
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,960
And a time for unpacking?

888
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,740
Exactly, which I'm deeply into these days.

889
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,780
Well, um,

890
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,420
let's see, I think

891
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,800
this big shindig,

892
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,540
this to-do that I'm talking about

893
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,140
is going to be at 7 p.m. at City Lights

894
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,680
on the first of April.

895
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,700
And I'll be there with you, Hal.

896
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,180
That's right, we'll be there.

897
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,760
Soldiers for Bob.

898
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,320
We're going to use our special signing pens, right?

899
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,180
That's right, I'm going to make a signing statement

900
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,740
which invalidates all previous signatures.

901
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,880
I'm going to use a pen

902
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,700
that was used by a famous guy

903
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,900
to sign a famous piece of paper in the past

904
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,580
somewhere, which will somehow

905
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,660
make my signing of something

906
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,680
more significant.

907
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,260
It was used to sign the

908
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,100
Treaty of Westphalia

909
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,440
after the Battle of Turkeytron.

910
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,900
That's for Chicken John.

911
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,860
It's a copy, you should watch it,

912
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,720
it's a copy of the entire, uh...

913
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,940
Last show?

914
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,480
No, well, the reunion of Circus Ridiculous.

915
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,180
Oh, the Circus Ridiculous show.

916
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,000
Damn it, the wonder dog, amazing.

917
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,160
Oh, yes, I...

918
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,680
Well, I'll watch it, yes,

919
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,980
then I'll give it to Chicken, sure.

920
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:47,860
Right.

921
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,440
That I will.

922
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,520
Well, um...

923
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,760
Look, the flowers are coming up,

924
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,560
the grass is blooming in the show park.

925
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,740
On the 24th, at Anon Salon,

926
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,960
I will be performing in a venue known as

927
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,880
Professor Goofball's Cartoon Studio,

928
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,380
where I make overprivileged,

929
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,220
drunken people draw cartoons,

930
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,960
or at least I'm paid to do that,

931
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,760
and we'll collect money

932
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,560
at the end of the night.

933
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,140
So if you can pay the unbelievably hefty fee

934
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,980
to get in there,

935
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,720
which I can't imagine doing myself,

936
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,940
join me at this particular show,

937
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,400
and I'll do that particular thing.

938
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,120
Then, on the last day of this month,

939
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,960
a CD release party for Phantom City,

940
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,300
the new, uh,

941
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,800
Stephen Casmar record.

942
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,080
I will preside over the party

943
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,380
held at the zoo in the Great Hall,

944
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,200
where there's a roaring, crackling fireplace,

945
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,480
and a roaring, enraged lion,

946
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,400
if they don't lock the cage.

947
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:44,720
Ha ha.

948
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,660
But probably that won't be there.

949
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,440
And, uh, we will have refreshments,

950
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,220
and, um,

951
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,440
it only costs seven bucks to attend this.

952
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,320
So, uh,

953
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:53,720
we're gonna have a fabulous party.

954
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,000
On the 20th of April,

955
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,740
I expect to journey into the Northland,

956
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,580
where I will eat, uh, sushi,

957
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,060
which has been spread on the body of, uh,

958
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,740
poet Blake Morse.

959
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,060
Man, this guy just goes on and on.

960
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,740
Man, this guy just goes everywhere.

961
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,280
Where's he gonna be?

962
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,220
I gotta eat sushi?

963
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,660
It's all about me.

964
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,860
It's all about me.

965
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,540
Six days later than that,

966
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,180
I will be crowned

967
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,580
as a temple of the Hetheladium.

968
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,980
Anointed in gypsum,

969
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,680
and molded as

970
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,920
I'm doomed in the

971
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,160
Pyramids of Massasite.

972
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,180
We're gonna have to rewrite

973
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,040
the end of the world here.

974
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,860
This is gonna take longer.

975
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,700
There's a little humble figuring

976
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,600
about Dr. Hal in the future.

977
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,680
Hal has some more things to do,

978
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,700
and the end of the world

979
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,560
is just gonna take,

980
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,920
is gonna have to wait.

981
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,600
After the Power Tool drag races,

982
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,360
the Junior Model Train Competition

983
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,860
and layout construction

984
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,140
held in Wilkerson, Ontario.

985
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,480
See if I can get into his back here

986
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,500
and cut the vocal cords.

987
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,680
Giving a special recitation of

988
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,820
Casey Jr. and the Great Locomotive Chase

989
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,560
from the Walt Disney film.

990
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,960
After which, Hal will ponder

991
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,520
the astral significance of the, uh,

992
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,040
lint in my navel.

993
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,600
The Naval Reserve Show is a free event,

994
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,060
which I can announce as a public service,

995
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,420
but after this, uh,

996
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,140
contemplative, uh, act,

997
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,360
we're going to go to bongos

998
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,720
for spud nuts and soapy beers.

999
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,400
And then Hal will perform

1000
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,840
surgery on a monkey.

1001
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,500
Yes, Jocko's dreams.

1002
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,720
My doctor's hands.

1003
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,800
Sorry, that is an ape.

1004
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,120
We're going to bring Jocko back to the light.

1005
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,280
Back to life, then,

1006
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,840
right after you kill him, you'll bring him back to life.

1007
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,880
My thing says back to life.

1008
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,400
The scientific principles of the Frankenstein cabinet.

1009
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:47,680
What does back to life mean?

1010
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,320
This is a crooked and perverse nation.

1011
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,120
My friend.

1012
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,300
Uh, no, I would...

1013
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,820
The best of political education for this ape.

1014
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,200
And when he comes out, he'll be a different monk.

1015
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:00,920
Just remember,

1016
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,600
the stark fester of removal has a finger in every pie.

1017
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,660
That's the whole joke.

1018
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,340
Pie are square.

1019
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,740
But some of them are round.

1020
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,680
We'll make a decision on that later.

1021
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,080
Is this one of your momentary mental lapses, Hal,

1022
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,820
that you forgot your next performance?

1023
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,620
Oh, no, I was about to tell you,

1024
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,100
I'll perform with the royal Le Penzer stallions.

1025
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,060
Is that where the alien space braved?

1026
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,200
Uh, they will be...

1027
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,080
Eject its mind-warp technology?

1028
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,200
While I gargle ink and juggle swords,

1029
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,900
doused in cleaning fluid,

1030
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,920
set alight.

1031
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,260
I wanna see that.

1032
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,640
Yeah, I wanna see that.

1033
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
I'll tape it.

1034
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,460
You'll be juggling saw blades as well, I understand.

1035
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:39,920
Circular saw blades.

1036
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,360
In New York City, I will give a lecture at the Bowery Aquarium

1037
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,240
on alcoholic denizens of the lower docks,

1038
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,920
which will be accompanied by a slide lecture

1039
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,400
and a cheese-sauce lecture

1040
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,800
on the cheese sculpture.

1041
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,560
All this while performing a specialized juggling act.

1042
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,900
Going straight for the juggler.

1043
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,840
In which every, every possible permutation of the blades

1044
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,240
will be spinning around his head.

1045
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,100
Well, the important thing is

1046
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,380
where are we going to go party

1047
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,380
between the hot, amazing day of work at the park?

1048
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:10,380


1049
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:10,880
I just don't know.

1050
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,960
You know, we have to battle the bobbies,

1051
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,500
and then we have to go somewhere to rest

1052
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,980
before we then return to the book signing.

1053
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,860
Well, what's irritating to me is

1054
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,380
I have to do the event at the zoo the night before.

1055
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,800
So I can't rest.

1056
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,560
And then I have to get up and

1057
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
plod around in the same stupid parade.

1058
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,080
And then, even when the parade is over,

1059
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,500
I still have to do it.

1060
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,760
Because I have to go to the park

1061
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,520
and goof around with the pandas.

1062
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,260
When that's done, I have to do

1063
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,560
the subgenius event at the City Lights Bookstore.

1064
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,180
It's even worse than that.

1065
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,320
You guys yell too much.

1066
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:44,880
You're right.

1067
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,400
By the way, Cheetah is still alive.

1068
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,460
Yeah, I know.

1069
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,840
We're in the jungle looking at him right now.

1070
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,020
In der jungle.

1071
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,720
I saw the original Cheetah.

1072
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,220
Bingle bangle bungle,

1073
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,960
I don't want to leave der jungle.

1074
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,240
I just refuse to go.

1075
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,640
Don't you remember when Cheetah got killed

1076
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,860
in Tarzan Finds a Mate?

1077
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,280
The first Cheetah was killed in that one.

1078
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,060
No, the Cheetah

1079
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,440
that is alive now was like three years old

1080
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,240
during those Johnny Weissmuller films.

1081
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,700
It may have been an earlier Cheetah.

1082
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,540
This Cheetah was present for

1083
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,280
a little bit.

1084
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,040
It's alive. It's the oldest surviving Cheetah.

1085
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,660
It's alive! Watch out!

1086
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,320
Cheetah is about, I think,

1087
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,120
he's like 70 years old.

1088
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,140
Is there any kind of a life to be hooked up to all those

1089
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,820
machines with those things pumping your blood?

1090
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:34,200
It's show business.

1091
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:34,940
That's Hollywood.

1092
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:37,940
That's Hollywood?

1093
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:38,720
Over there?

1094
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:41,600
I'm nervous.

1095
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,740
Well, taters never did taste good

1096
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,420
with chicken on the plate.

1097
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,520
But still I had to eat them

1098
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,520
just the same.

1099
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,240
That's why I have these skinny

1100
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,540
arms and legs and such a puny

1101
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,400
weight. Cause mama always

1102
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,460
told me take an old cold tater

1103
00:43:59,460 --> 00:43:59,900
and wait.

1104
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,440
Are there any human beings?

1105
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,140
Now that's after

1106
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,340
you will be performing the

1107
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,300
physical abuse of

1108
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,340
the robots. You know, I have to

1109
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,040
consult my appointment calendar.

1110
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,280
The Mediocratons, the Pinks,

1111
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,380
the Fat... Speaking of Pinks, I will

1112
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,160
be performing with Cheep Pink

1113
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,380
at the Oakland Children's Fair in

1114
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,940
the last day of next month.

1115
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,320
Oh great. You can get all over the place.

1116
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,280
He is all over the place.

1117
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,440
He's like a big pig.

1118
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,520
Oakland Children's Fair, have you ever been there?

1119
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,100
Oh, Fairland, yeah.

1120
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,660
Where they have the concrete little pig's house and all that stuff?

1121
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,340
I went there as a little fairy.

1122
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,640
I have pictures of myself in that place

1123
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,620
when I was about four or five years old.

1124
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,120
At the Big Jonah's Whale.

1125
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,660
And they have the special train

1126
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,020
and all that stuff.

1127
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,440
Well I hope that will quell any rumors

1128
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,080
that Hal doesn't have a train.

1129
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,780
He doesn't have any room in his calendar.

1130
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,280
No, I'm going to perform with

1131
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,300
Cheep Pink,

1132
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,080
who are some personal friends of mine.

1133
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,640
This isn't that trick you do

1134
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,800
where you swallow the gasoline

1135
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,720
and then throw a match down there, is it?

1136
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,120
I'd swallow a young gasol...

1137
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,340
They're not necessarily

1138
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,560
going to do that, but...

1139
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,460
Well they did that at my show.

1140
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,260
You weren't there, but there was a

1141
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,740
pooty pooty butt butt part.

1142
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,860
And then they

1143
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,980
taunt the audience.

1144
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,000
And then they do uncomfortable things.

1145
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,360
And it goes on and on.

1146
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,180
I was terrified to look

1147
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,400
to see if people would be leaving.

1148
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,060
Pooty pooty butt butt,

1149
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:31,820
they start saying.

1150
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,340
And you have to say it with them.

1151
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,540
And you have to stand up.

1152
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,520
And you're thinking,

1153
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,240
I'm not an attractive young woman

1154
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,940
saying pooty pooty butt butt.

1155
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,620
No, well that's...

1156
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,900
Well when you're in the audience

1157
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,660
and you realize that you were

1158
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,460
on stage at one point.

1159
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,460
That is sublime.

1160
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,480
That's sort of sublime when you realize

1161
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,620
that your instrument that you started playing

1162
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,940
20 minutes ago is now being played by

1163
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,700
a former audience member

1164
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,500
as are the rest of the instruments

1165
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,200
in the band.

1166
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,140
Now that other event I mentioned

1167
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:09,120
where we eat sushi off the recumbent

1168
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,440
body of what's her name, Blake Moore.

1169
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,420
That is on the 20th of April.

1170
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,660
We're going to make some film.

1171
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,000
A trip up there.

1172
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,720
That's right.

1173
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:17,880
And we're going to go back

1174
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,380
and participate in the orgiastic

1175
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,900
ceremony of ingesting sushi

1176
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,880
on the body of a poet.

1177
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,280
And all Japanese of course.

1178
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,340
Oh yes, yes of course.

1179
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,140
And follow that

1180
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,140
I will do my celebrated impression.

1181
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,300
And then there's all this 420

1182
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,960
at the 420 place in 420ville.

1183
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:39,340
That's right.

1184
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,100
We have to stop at Mr. 420.

1185
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,200
42020.

1186
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,040
I would like to know the details of that.

1187
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,060
Get ready at 420.

1188
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,900
The details?

1189
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,660
Well, when the...

1190
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,300
Well later, not here on the air.

1191
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,500
Go over before detail.

1192
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,940
I will be getting some new tires

1193
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,820
for my B.A.T.

1194
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,500
Tires!

1195
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,400
You better recycle those tires.

1196
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,480
You know, rotate them.

1197
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,700
They're supposed to rotate

1198
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,380
when you go down the road.

1199
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,380
Now we're going down the road

1200
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,220
on the show.

1201
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:16,740
And the people in the highway are so happy

1202
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,820
that it only has 13 minutes left.

1203
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,640
You could be falling out of the sky

1204
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,300
a million miles an hour

1205
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,040
and there

1206
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,760
safely grasping

1207
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,560
your fall

1208
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,380
is the pipe, the mighty pipe.

1209
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,240
It's breaking your fall.

1210
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,180
You can't fall too fast

1211
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,840
because the pipe will save you.

1212
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,500
Sometimes the pipe

1213
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,280
will put itself under you

1214
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,800
as you're falling, like a cushioning effect.

1215
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:44,900
Wow, this is cool.

1216
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,780
The smoke billowing out

1217
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,260
is allowing for a cottony sort of cloud-like

1218
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,860
special effect

1219
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,680
that will cushion your fall

1220
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,640
even as you drift

1221
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,880
softly above the pipe

1222
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,200
in its downward trajectory.

1223
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:00,980
But soft.

1224
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,220
What light through yonder window breaks?

1225
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,540
Don't quit smoking.

1226
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,380
Simply give up for 30 days

1227
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,020
and start again.

1228
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,400
My new principle

1229
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,440
contradicts every idea

1230
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,020
people have had about quitting smoking.

1231
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,100
I say,

1232
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,360
only smoke for a month at a time,

1233
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,920
then quit for a month,

1234
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,380
then start up for a month,

1235
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,720
then quit for a month.

1236
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,940
That style of smoking

1237
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,300
is one that will lead to

1238
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,060
progressively bettering

1239
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:32,560
a health.

1240
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,400
And I'll prove it.

1241
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,720
I can prove this through experiments

1242
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,140
and special techniques

1243
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,600
that we've devised

1244
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,900
over a millennia

1245
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,780
after imbuing

1246
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,040
these subhumans here.

1247
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,060
These microorganisms.

1248
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,920
We can read the special

1249
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,580
hedonistic digressive

1250
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,320
techniques there.

1251
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:54,840
But yesterday,

1252
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,620
the word of Caesar stood against the world.

1253
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,740
Now lies he there,

1254
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,380
and none so poor

1255
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,860
to do him reverence.

1256
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,560
Oh, masters,

1257
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,000
were I but bespoke

1258
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,480
to stir your hearts and minds

1259
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,240
with mutiny and rage,

1260
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,980
I should do Brutus wrong

1261
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,680
and Cassius wrong.

1262
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,720
Who I do know

1263
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,720
are honorable men.

1264
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,280
I will not do them wrong.

1265
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,220
I rather choose

1266
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,040
to wrong the dead,

1267
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,080
to wrong myself and you,

1268
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,420
than I should wrong

1269
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,040
such honorable men.

1270
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,380
It's coming very slowly

1271
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,540
and yet here it comes.

1272
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,440
We can see it

1273
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,100
rolling down the hill.

1274
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,260
To see the world

1275
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,680
in a grain of sand

1276
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,160
and a heaven

1277
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,800
in a wild flower.

1278
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,340
Hold infinity in the palm

1279
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,020
of your hand

1280
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,260
and eternity in an hour.

1281
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,000
A robin red-breast in a cage

1282
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,900
puts all heaven

1283
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,200
in a rage.

1284
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,640
A dove house filled

1285
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,920
with doves and pigeons

1286
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,620
shudders hell

1287
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,120
through all its regions.

1288
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,520
The show has been shown

1289
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,520
to be an effective

1290
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:14,660
and effective

1291
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,060
decay preventive denifers

1292
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,080
that can be of significant value

1293
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,620
when used in a conscientiously

1294
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,880
applied program of oral hygiene

1295
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,700
and regular professional care.

1296
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,240
A dog starved at his master's gate

1297
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,100
predicts the ruin

1298
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,000
of the state.

1299
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,100
A horse

1300
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,120
misused upon the road

1301
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,020
cries out to heaven

1302
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,040
for human blood.

1303
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,540
When you leave the show behind

1304
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,920
this strategy will expose

1305
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,740
your backside to intense scrutiny.

1306
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,780
Each outcry of the wounded hair

1307
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,980
a fragment of the brain

1308
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:49,780
doth tear.

1309
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,440
The skylark

1310
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,120
wounded in the wing

1311
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,340
a cherubim doth cease

1312
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:58,940
to sing.

1313
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,640
The gamecock clipped and armed

1314
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,760
for fight

1315
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,160
does the rising sun

1316
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,180
affright.

1317
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,120
Every wolf's and lion's

1318
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,620
howl

1319
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,680
raises from hell

1320
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,280
a human soul.

1321
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,680
The wild deer

1322
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,420
wandering here and there

1323
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:24,680
keep the human soul

1324
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,480
from hell.

1325
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,720
It's kind of like the host came alive

1326
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,000
and just ate up the show.

1327
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,260
What happened there?

1328
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,300
How'd the host do that?

1329
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,080
I didn't really see it.

1330
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,360
It was over before I woke up.

1331
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,920
This show's just a big sham.

1332
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,740
Yeah, they don't even do anything.

1333
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,540
The show doesn't ever

1334
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,200
it just promises and promises and never delivers

1335
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,000
and all of a sudden

1336
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,460
next thing you know it's almost over

1337
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,160
and people are crying and bewailing

1338
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,360
the loss of the show

1339
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,120
as if there was some substance

1340
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,880
that they've figured out

1341
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,520
and derived from it

1342
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,180
and have benefited from it

1343
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,900
over the last 23 years.

1344
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:03,560
The bat that flits at close of eve

1345
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,360
has left the brain

1346
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,640
that won't believe.

1347
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,700
Hey, shut those windows!

1348
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,340
The show's almost over!

1349
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,840
The owl that calls upon the night

1350
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,340
speaks the unbeliever's

1351
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,220
Hey, can you leave the window

1352
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:16,440
that one window open?

1353
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,460
He who shall hurt the little wren

1354
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,220
never shall be loved by men.

1355
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,600
Okay, well I'm just gonna lock up back here.

1356
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:25,680
You guys wanna finish the show

1357
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,180
and get out of here?

1358
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,640
Yeah, I think the show really

1359
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,900
really did the thing tonight.

1360
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,360
It did the thing with Bob

1361
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,960
and the pipe and all that.

1362
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,580
The dots were there.

1363
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,300
And then you gotta add

1364
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,120
the

1365
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,800
Then you say where.

1366
00:52:59,360 --> 00:52:59,600
When.

1367
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,140
Who.

1368
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,100
What?

1369
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,660
All those, uh,

1370
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,640
interrogatory, uh,

1371
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:08,320
uh,

1372
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:09,320
uh,

1373
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:10,740
statements, uh,

1374
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,560
word, wordage as it were.

1375
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,520
Getting ready to go.

1376
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,840
The poison of the snake and root

1377
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,100
is the sweat of envy's foot.

1378
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,200
I don't know. I'm looking on the scale, Carol.

1379
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,660
Okay, so, the poison of the honeybee

1380
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,180
is the artist's jealousy.

1381
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:27,860


1382
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,900
Mm-hmm.

1383
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,100
We're waiting for you to call, caller.

1384
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,280
Yeah, like, the show can't really do anything.

1385
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,860
848-FLUFFY-FRO-FRO-LIFE in the 510 area code.

1386
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,320
Call anytime, day or night, and just call.

1387
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:42,280
Just say you wanna talk to a live subgenius here on

1388
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,000
Yeah, thank me.

1389
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,540
on your radio dial.

1390
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,080
That's area code 410-L-YAROF-EAT-4425.

1391
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,740
We'll be waiting to hear from you.

1392
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,020
The little dobs will call you.

1393
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,160
You can call now at

1394
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:02,060
on the, uh, show for just a few more minutes.

1395
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,340
I'm an hero, chim-pachero.

1396
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,540
I'm an hero, chero.

1397
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:06,240
Don't worry.

1398
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,860
Let's call this duplicate show.

1399
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,520
Let's call this triplicate show.

1400
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,740
One of these people better be Michael Pepe.

1401
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,400
This is one of these people that's gonna sing this show closed.

1402
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,520
I know, I know.

1403
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,540
It just seems weird.

1404
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,080
There's the singer.

1405
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,280
Sing away, show singer.

1406
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,160
I'm an hero, chim-pachero.

1407
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,580
I'm an hero, chim-pachero.

1408
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,640
I think the show singer got stage fright

1409
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,940
when put on center stage.

1410
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,960
Yeah, it happens.

1411
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,920
That's the bright glare of the show spotlight

1412
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,880
when it comes on.

1413
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:44,940
The show's almost over.

1414
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,040
La la la la la la la la.

1415
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,680
The show's almost over.

1416
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,900
La la la la la la la la.

1417
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,440
It is. It's almost over.

1418
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,000
The show's almost over.

1419
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,760
We're so sorry.

1420
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,260
The show's almost over.

1421
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,000
The show's almost done.

1422
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,440
The people call and they lament the show's

1423
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,160
passing each week.

1424
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,320
It's much like the passing of a close friend.

1425
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,340
And yet there's no funeral for us to attend

1426
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:20,080
and to commiserate the passing of that friendly old show.

1427
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,620
That one that brings you to life every Friday morning.

1428
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,000
That puts you away every Thursday night.

1429
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:28,800
It's over.

1430
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,140
Yes, yes, it is.

1431
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,020
Who goes there?

1432
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,940
And it's a sad thing here in the Bay Area

1433
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,420
when this happens each week.

1434
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,620
Who goes there, friend or enema?

1435
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,900
I'll tell you.

1436
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,240
Bend over.

1437
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,460
Well, I hope you've enjoyed the show

1438
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:52,940
as much as we've enjoyed shoveling the show at you.

1439
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:57,920
And we want you to know that we enjoy doing the show for you

1440
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,340
and on behalf of the staff and the management and...

1441
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,840
And these supersonic Nazi hell creatures

1442
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,340
from the hollow Earth.

1443
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,980
From the center of the Earth.

1444
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,620
It's a bucket that we live in.

1445
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,020
It's a giant bucket.

1446
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,620
It's a bucket filled with chainsaws and broken glass.

1447
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,140
But we do it.

1448
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,240
And we don't mind anymore.

1449
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,860
We've got super intelligent pterodactyls.

1450
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,700
We've got a lot of band-aids.

1451
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:22,960
Serpent men.

1452
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:23,960
Iguana men.

1453
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,380
We're just doing our own thing.

1454
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,120
It's a brain hop.

1455
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,080
Amphibian men.

1456
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,500
Female men.

1457
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,760
Plant men.

1458
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,500
Did I leave anything out?

1459
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:36,840
They're all down there.

1460
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,220
Yeah, you did.

1461
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,160
You left about 1,200 things out.

1462
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,780
That's true because there are so many.

1463
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,780
For example, there are all sorts of extinct proboscideans,

1464
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,260
mammoths and like that.

1465
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,980
The dinotherium, the platybelodon.

1466
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,260
They all still live in the center of the Earth.

1467
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:58,840
But I don't know if we have time to list all these extinct megafauna

1468
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,660
who have managed to live in the hollow interior.

1469
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,280
Show those ovals.

1470
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,100
The sun in the center of the Earth is an interesting physical phenomenon.

1471
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,760
It is in fact what they call an Einstein-like singularity.

1472
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,940
Around it, the gravitational angle is reversed.

1473
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,700
This is what keeps all items in the hollow center of the Earth

1474
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,100
from falling into the sun at Earth's center,

1475
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:29,120
which is the gravitational constant that's present in the circle.

1476
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,260
In recent years, scientists have discovered that the gravitational angle is the same as the gravitational angle of the Earth.

1477
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:36,680
They're the same—you're aware of the center of the planet.

1478
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,600
That means that each

1479
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,560
It'll be oversized.

1480
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,880
And then we'll be on the moon.

1481
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,160
Or at least at a donut place

1482
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,220
It's no disgrace

1483
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,420
For the show to be over

1484
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,580
Cause we'll eat some donuts

1485
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,160
Next week

1486
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,960
We'll be back

1487
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,940
Next week

1488
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,960
Next week

1489
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,620
Next week
