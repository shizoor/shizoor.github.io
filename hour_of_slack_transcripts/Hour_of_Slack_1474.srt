00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:15,960
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,280
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,240
and only in the city of...

4
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,920
Ah, yes, dear friends, we're editing hundreds of hours of recordings from X-Day.

5
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,180
Well, dozens.

6
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,260
It's time-consuming and time-controlling, but luckily we have two shows from just before X-Day,

7
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:54,080
parts one and two of Dr. Sinister's Radio Synesthesia, which is two hours long

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,860
and follows Hour of Slack every Sunday night.

9
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,380
on WCSB Cleveland.

10
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:06,800
This, then, is That Radio Synesthesia from June 29th, Conspiracy Year 2014.

11
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:39,660
The show is brought to you by...

12
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,580
Are you creeped out yet?

13
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,720
This is Synesthesia. I'm your host, Dr. Sinister, and we're here for a very special episode of the program.

14
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,420
Reverend Stang has stayed with us, Princess Wee has stayed with us,

15
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,460
and we have our very special guest, Dr....

16
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,600
Man, I don't know how to pronounce it. Dr. Hal?

17
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,100
Dr. Howland Owl? I mean, I've heard...

18
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,640
That's me.

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,240
I've heard it pronounced many different ways.

20
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,140
Well, so it may be, as long as you are satisfied.

21
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,520
You know, uh, I am satisfied.

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,360
I let them call me what they want to call me, you know, that saves trouble in the long run.

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,140
So, want to play a little game here?

24
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,300
We're going to play the game of reading PSAs live over the air, so I can say...

25
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,120
PSAs?

26
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,100
Oh, yes, because we're supposed to do two every hour.

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
Actually, this whole show is a public service announcement.

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,560
When you think about it...

29
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,160
Duty calls.

30
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,140
Because how else, how else are you going to find out about how to get on the civil service?

31
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,980
I must make my dirty clean. Duty clear.

32
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,220
Oh, this is a good one. This is a good one.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,880
Getting pulled over for buzzed driving could cost you around $10,000 in fines, legal fees, and...

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,300
Oh, no.

35
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,400
...and increased insurance rates.

36
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,440
Oh, no.

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,460
Nothing kills a buzz like getting pulled over for buzzed driving, because...

38
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:56,460


39
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:56,460


40
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,300
Because buzzed driving is drunk driving.

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,020
Brought to you by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Ad Council.

42
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,800
How's that for a cold read?

43
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,300
That was good. And that shows who's really behind those ads.

44
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,220
How about another one here?

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,820
Yeah, let's have it.

46
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,960
Oh, this is in Spanish, all right.

47
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,300
Hola, amigos.

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,100
¿Cómo harías un campo de fútbol americano?

49
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,160
Evita textear.

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,020
Evita chocar.

53
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,760
Did he say ex-day?

54
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,880
No.

55
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,780
No, that one didn't have anything to do with ex-day.

56
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,640
Let me translate that into English here.

57
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,120
But you might as well obey the rules to the road on the way to ex-day.

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,360
Let me translate that into English.

59
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,920
The typical text message will distract you from the road for almost five seconds,

60
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,980
and at freeway speed, you'll go as far as a football field.

61
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,140
Yeah, watch your driving.

62
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,860
Un campo de fútbol americano.

63
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,060
Right.

64
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,180
Un campo de fútbol americano.

65
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,540
What an irony.

66
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,380
Avoid texting.

67
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,900
Crushed in an accident.

68
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,660
Only sissies watch football.

69
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,020
Soccer football.

70
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,540
Only American football.

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,820
I should record this.

72
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,140
I need to record this.

73
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,780
I'm actually...

74
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,300
All right.

75
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,180
Remind me to bookmark this later on.

76
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,400
You can do it now if that's convenient.

77
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,540
I don't think the phrasing was very artful, though.

78
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,180
This is...

79
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,720
Well...

80
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,820
One of the things that insults me...

81
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,060
I'm not actually Hispanic.

82
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,340
I'm an honorary Mexican.

83
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,960
Well, our Spanish-speaking friends are...

84
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,880
I'm offended by some of the bad translations I've seen in a lot of Spanish language stuff

85
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,360
out there.

86
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,860
But anyway...

87
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,060
Ay, carumba.

88
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,640
Ay, carumba.

89
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,640


90
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,640


91
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,640


92
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,640


93
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,640


94
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,640


95
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,640


96
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,020
So now...

97
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,020
Lo que javilante ha de correr.

98
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,800
That was the serious stuff for now.

99
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,740
For los niños.

100
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,160
Para los niños, sí.

101
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,120
We took care of our civic duty.

102
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:14,700
It shows that we're wider-minded than just our own selfish base desires.

103
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,680
You know, when I first heard about texting and driving, I thought it was a joke.

104
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,680
No, they...

105
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,120
I couldn't believe people actually did that.

106
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,260
They text while driving buses.

107
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,700
Airplanes and subway trains, and they all crash.

108
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,960
Well, you know, an airplane I can understand.

109
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,100
An airplane I can understand.

110
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,680
Because of the automatic pilot washing its hands.

111
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,760
That and the fact that, you know, if you're gonna crash a vehicle and kill some people,

112
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,080
you might as well crash a vehicle and kill lots of people.

113
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,160
They always say the pilot is the first at the scene of the accident.

114
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,960
That's only because they put him in the front.

115
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,580
Mm-hmm.

116
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,560
You know, if it were...

117
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,520
If they designed the planes a little bit differently, where the pilots see we're towards the back

118
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,000
of the plane...

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,500
Yeah, if you get in the very back and face backwards, you might survive.

120
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,640
It's a pathetic, armless, legless...

121
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,260
I have this thing about riding subways seating backwards.

122
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,380
You know, like a lot of subway cars, they'll have seats pointing one way or the other way.

123
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:03,600
Safer.

124
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,000
Safer.

125
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,760
I don't know, man.

126
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,760
I have to face forward.

127
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,280
Like on British railways, if there's a smash-up...

128
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,800
Every time I see English people driving on the wrong side of the road, I'm surprised that they write...

129
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,040
What's wrong?

130
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,080
I'm surprised that they read in the same direction that we do, too.

131
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:17,980
Yes, well...

132
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,380
Like, I half expect them to read everything in...

133
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,780
The Hebrews do it backwards, which is absolutely frightening.

134
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,760
I had to try it once.

135
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,560
I was a little Arabian with the speed of summer lightning.

136
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,280
That's right.

137
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:31,380
Once in Ireland, a drunken Irishman insisted that I take over the wheel of his car.

138
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,260
Ah, yes, Spocky.

139
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,500
I wasn't drunk, but I felt really, really drunk.

140
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,300
Having to do everything...

141
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,820
Mirror image reversed, you know?

142
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,540
You frippoon.

143
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,880
Was it at least an automatic transmission?

144
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,040
No, no, of course not.

145
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,440
Yeah, I...

146
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,240
But I knew how to drive a standard.

147
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,940
I drive a stick.

148
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,360
That's my preference, actually, but...

149
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,860
Maybe one of these crazy kids out on the street stole it from out under the hood.

150
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,940
I think I could drive an automatic in one of those countries, but not a stick.

151
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,340
This was in 1973.

152
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,600
And the fact that I'm left-handed confuses things even more.

153
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,600
Wow, well, sinister, eh?

154
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,480
Yeah, exactly.

155
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,120
You guessed the origin of my name.

156
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,680
Yeah.

157
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,380
So...

158
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,720
I was expecting Dave to call in again.

159
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,240
Dave?

160
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,760
Yeah, Dave.

161
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,080
We are waiting for Dave.

162
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,340
Dave's not here, man.

163
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,800
When he tried to call, I didn't see the light blinking.

164
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,980
Yes, he closed the door, but the light didn't stay on.

165
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,980
Yeah, he called Princess Wee and said, hey, they're not picking it up.

166
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,180
And he came in on line two.

167
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,500
Little piggy cried wee, wee, wee all the way home.

168
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,800
Line two blinked properly, but line one was not winking nor blinking.

169
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:46,120
It made a little arrow, but it didn't make the pick-me-up signal.

170
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,900
Maybe that's our problem the next day.

171
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,360
Dr. Howell, we haven't been making the pick-me-up signal.

172
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:57,340
We haven't been making the blinking light on the dashboard of the glorious spaceship,

173
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,920
which doesn't actually use dashboards.

174
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,080
No, this is all metaphorical language.

175
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,060
Why should they use things that are millions of primitive years in their past?

176
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,520
Oh, people are always talking about, well, I want a nice seat on the saucer next to Bob.

177
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,220
I want to sit at the right hand of Bob.

178
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,320
You think you're going to sit vertically oriented like here under one gravity?

179
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,500
I think you've got another think coming.

180
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,660
Right. Well, not everybody has read enough science fiction to know that you don't know nothing.

181
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,060
You don't know nothing.

182
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,100
It's not a case of you may reconfigure your body if you want to.

183
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,620
You will have your body reconfigured.

184
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,980
Then if you are able, you can reconfigure your body.

185
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,360
That's the thing. Otherwise, someone else will have to do it.

186
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,100
Someone with a lot of time on his hands.

187
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,300
Someone who likes to press the button.

188
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,300


189
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,420
We've got a caller here, by the way.

190
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,700
Like me. Oh, a caller?

191
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,340
Yes, we do. I hope it's Dave.

192
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,560
By the way, anyone else out there, please welcome to call in.

193
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,080
216-Valphino-Valphineer from the Vesneskis.

194
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,160
It's just like synesthesia is in normal weeks, except we have actual interesting people on the air.

195
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,340
Maybe a girl will call up, bring on the baby.

196
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,460
You know what's funny? If a girl calls in, if a girl calls in, that's like putting a drop of blood in a shark tank.

197
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,460
Oh, yes, I forgot. I do radio, too.

198
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,060
It causes a massive influx of unwanted calls from hairy horn dogs.

199
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,420
This is...

200
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:15,720
And a...

201
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,580
And this is the true shame. This is the true shame.

202
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,400
I might actually...

203
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,020
This is the true shame of my radio career.

204
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,200
Trying to tell the truth.

205
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,320
If I could just get one woman to call in each week, that would get a million guys to call in.

206
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,500
Hello, boys.

207
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,960
Me, bitchy, fucking like me, gotta have some gals.

208
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:33,800
Hello, you're on the air.

209
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,040
Hello, Mabel.

210
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,780
Hello? Hi, Mabel. This is Terrence down at the old factory area.

211
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,380
It's a cat! It's a girl!

212
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,340
All right.

213
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,320
It's headed. Betrayer of the lot.

214
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,180
It's jumbo this night. Hooray!

215
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,860
Okay, it sounds like a refugee from a gorilla love-in.

216
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,700
Sounds like a whole refugee camp to me.

217
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,080
I have a little poem about a gorilla, but I probably shouldn't read it out there.

218
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,540
We're all gonna be camping. No, go ahead.

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,560
No, no, I seriously don't.

220
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,420
It's not good, huh?

221
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:04,880
No.

222
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,460
Okay, I understand.

223
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,200
Not even after, say, Friday. No way.

224
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,140
Well, maybe we should tell the listeners about the camp.

225
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,140
Some of the features of the place we're going to be.

226
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,560
You know, they say there are gonna be howling lightning storms and thunder and tornadoes.

227
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,280
Man, we've got a caller from Central Florida.

228
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,140
Well, call... Central Florida?

229
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,720
Central Florida. The 407 area code.

230
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,420
Central? Well, then it couldn't be Sarasota.

231
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,520
It could be Papa Joe Mama.

232
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,140
It could be Orlando or Kissimmee.

233
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,080
Or Dawn.

234
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,740
Oh, I know who it is if it's Orlando.

235
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,540
Or Dawn.

236
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,820
Oh, they hung up! They hung up.

237
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,760
It would have been Reverend Fox, whose name everyone mispronounces except me.

238
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,720
Fox.

239
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,320
Yeah. Well, he spells it F-A-U-X.

240
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,040
Oh, I see.

241
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,160
So, you know, if you're trying to be Mr. Smartypants, you go, oh, that's Reverend Faux.

242
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,640
Like faux news.

243
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:55,880
Faux.

244
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,720
But, in fact, it's a test.

245
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,680
We have another caller.

246
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,380
Yeah, we do.

247
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,920
Quit your jabbering, Stang. We're gonna put someone else on here.

248
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,880
Hello, you are on the air.

249
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,760
Oh, yeah, just following something interesting that Reverend Stang brought up about driving...

250
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,500
Who goes there?

251
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,740
Let's say the word without a word.

252
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:13,840
Irish.

253
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:15,960
Yeah.

254
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,140
Actually, Stang was driving lithium through the tavern.

255
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,560
No, actually, in the early days of the good old U.S. of A.

256
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,240
Get your story straight.

257
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,220
Before there were cars, you know, there were horses, and they traveled in the, you know,

258
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,540
in this country on the left side of the road.

259
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,880
Staying to the left. Staying to the left is the norm throughout history.

260
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,200
Yeah.

261
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,180
It was during the Napoleonic Wars that the transition happened to staying to the right

262
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,480
to the left.

263
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,300
Actually, in the U.S., what happened...

264
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,460
Napoleon wasn't responsible.

265
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,160
He wasn't responsible for that.

266
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,600
I can't believe.

267
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,020
Well, that's when it happened in continental Europe.

268
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,520
And that's why railroad tracks are just as wide as Julius Caesar's chariot wheels.

269
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,880
And the U.S. of A. was started by the Conestoga wagons.

270
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,480
And they still have power machines in Roman times, and nobody understands that because

271
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,640
it's hardly necessary to be understanding it.

272
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,000
But Roman times, those of us who were there remember quite well.

273
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,300
Yes.

274
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
And they didn't work very well either.

275
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,720
They would explode a lot, so that's why they weren't mass produced on the shores of Lycia.

276
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,200
Then, with utter and horrifying suddenness, we heard a frightful sound.

277
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,920
And Dave is always familiar with Roman times.

278
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,540
It was from the tethered horses.

279
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
They had screamed, not neighed, but screamed.

280
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,960
It's normal time you should be worried about.

281
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,040
And there was no light down there, nor the sound of any human thing to show why they

282
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,620
had done so.

283
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,640
At the same moment, bonfires blazed out on all the peaks ahead so that terror seemed

284
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,260
to lurk equally well before and behind us.

285
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,700
Looking for the youth of Versalius, our guide, we found only a crumpled heap, weltering in

286
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,760
a pool of blood.

287
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:59,640
In his hand was a short sword snatched from the belt of Decimus Viburanus, a subcenturio.

288
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,720
What are you reading off of that?

289
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,280
What are you reading off of that?

290
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,600
What were the ox carts that these settlers from Connecticut and New York came to this

291
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:06,860
area?

292
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,240
The ox carts?

293
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,460
It wasn't my ox cart that was gored.

294
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,540
No, it was Pennsylvania.

295
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:10,560
The ox carts were the ones that were gored.

296
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:10,560


297
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:10,560


298
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:10,560


299
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,660
I mean, you know, in the first stoke of wagons, you didn't sit in the front like in the movies.

300
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,600
They sat on the left side right behind the wheel.

301
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,520
That's where the brake was.

302
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,880
Oh, well, that was a good brake for somebody.

303
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,800
We've got our...

304
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,540
Yeah, it was a great brake.

305
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,120
We've got our...

306
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,020
They couldn't see on the right, so they started driving on the right.

307
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,020
We've got our...

308
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,860
And that's why to this day, we drive on the right side of the road.

309
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,760
Well, to this day, that's quite right.

310
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,340
To this day, but soon we're not going to have to obey traffic rules or any of other civilization's

311
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,460
foolish laws and conflicting laws.

312
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:38,980
Oh, I know that.

313
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:39,780
We've got...

314
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,680
There won't be any more of this day.

315
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,940
There'll be no more days.

316
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,500
By the way...

317
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,820
You'll still be cussing about these Sunday saucer drivers.

318
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,200
By the way...

319
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,620
There'll be the realm of endless day.

320
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,860
Everybody thinks outer space is dark, but they've forgotten that the sun makes it pretty

321
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,460
damn bright and hot out there.

322
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,920
By the way, we have our...

323
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,060
And my cat reports to the mothership every day.

324
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,400
Great motherboard.

325
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,880
What do they teach them in these schools?

326
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,740
I think the words, by the way, are not useful on this program.

327
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,320
Don't know.

328
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,000
Brief period of hallucinations...

329
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,720
This crowd here...

330
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,900
Who knows where...

331
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,080
The words, by the way, are useful.

332
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,300
Well, you have to rule over these unruly voices and decide which...

333
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,840
Our caller from Florida is on the line right now.

334
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,320
What am I?

335
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,120
No, I'm not.

336
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,140
You're not?

337
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,480
Oh.

338
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,400
I'm not really here.

339
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,900
You fooled me.

340
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,140
Taken in by the oldest trick in the book.

341
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,220
It's only I'm the ghost of the telecom shell from another dimension.

342
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,740
Is my face red?

343
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,340
Well, right, because we've got five bodies, and one of them is the telephone body, right?

344
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:32,880
Warm bodies.

345
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,780
Is that hypercube?

346
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,460
Sounds like he's here.

347
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,240
Life.

348
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,940
I'm not describing this as a body, like it used to in a Eucharistic fashion.

349
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,160
I mean, come on, man.

350
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,780
You know what the word Eucharist means?

351
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,920
The word Eucharist means giving thanks.

352
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,720
In fact, to say thank you in Greek, modern Greek, .

353
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,440
That's how you say thank you.

354
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,340
Get back to the scatological stuff again.

355
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,020
It's .

356
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,660
That's how you say yes.

357
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,700
One is essentially ordained by thankfulness.

358
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,520
Say thank you, Jesus, for me being made of tasty bread.

359
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,480
Thank you, Jesus.

360
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:03,820
We can eat.

361
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,540
Yes, he's telling another story.

362
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,540
Everybody takes him in literally.

363
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,840
Those were also idolaters, blasphemers.

364
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,140
And fresh or chilly.

365
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,860
Reverend Stagg is still there.

366
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,720
Reverend Stagg is still there.

367
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,900
I'm being quiet so that others may be heard.

368
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,340
He's allowed to.

369
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,420
May, possibly.

370
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,200
Don't do that.

371
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,000
He's a really loud crowd of calamitous clacking voices.

372
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,780
I just have a question.

373
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,380
Once Jehovah One comes down and takes everybody away.

374
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,000
That's not going to happen.

375
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,200
All of the worthy.

376
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,520
Are the other ones stuck here on this mortal coil going to be ruled by God?

377
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:35,520


378
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:35,520


379
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:35,520


380
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:35,520


381
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:35,520


382
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,500
No, Jehovah One doesn't take everyone away.

383
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,820
Jehovah One stays behind to pour his vessel of wrath on everyone else who is left.

384
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,980
You're at the mercy of the senile space god, Big Nobodaddy.

385
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,600
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul because that's who's going to be in charge.

386
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,960
Not like now.

387
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,640
Go to hell.

388
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,560
Yeah, you know what?

389
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,260
Go to hell.

390
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,780
That's pretty obvious.

391
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,020
That's true.

392
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,660
That's true.

393
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,460
You're not allowed to tell people to shut up.

394
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:05,500
That's true.

395
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:05,500


396
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,040
You're not allowed to tell people to shut up on this program.

397
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,540
Only I am allowed to tell people to shut up on this program.

398
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,160
I never heard the words shut up until I was an adult.

399
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,420
My parents never told me to shut up.

400
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,120
Did you hear that from anybody else?

401
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,100
I don't shut up.

402
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,700
I don't shut up.

403
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,240
I grew up.

404
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,680
When I look at you, I throw up.

405
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,000
Shut up.

406
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,040


407
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,140
Shut up.

408
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,880
That was something the kids used to see.

409
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,240
I don't shut up.

410
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,780
I grew up.

411
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,920
Hey, kids.

412
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,460
Shut up.

413
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,180
Yeah.

414
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,060
Thank you.

415
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,200
Ah, shut up.

416
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,300
Ah, shut up.

417
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:34,540


418
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,480
Ah, shut up.

419
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:35,480


420
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,480
I'll hit you so hard you starve to death bouncing.

421
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,440
You lackluster punk.

422
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Well, I was just going to say there's no need to get excited and try and, you know,

423
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:43,720
bring out the new...

424
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,020
That's right.

425
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,220
Let's calm ourselves.

426
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,900
... rules of order or disorder or whatever it's called.

427
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,300
You're quite right.

428
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,600
Robots' rules of order in session.

429
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,740
You need to counsel a president.

430
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,620
Yes.

431
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,520
And then you're all counselors and council members and stuff.

432
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,160
We're all grief counselors for the rest of humanity.

433
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,380
Yeah.

434
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,740
Yeah.

435
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,380
Ipso facto.

436
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,940
And if Harry's doing...

437
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,620
You hold up your prefrontal...

438
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,100
Ipso facto.

439
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,120
Ipso moro.

440
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,800
... your forefinger.

441
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,500
Keep your finger out of my prefrontal lobe.

442
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,720
Mr. President, I would like to counsel by reminding them that tomorrow night is Happy

443
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,740
Looping Night down at the park.

444
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,400
A region of the brain which we call the anterior frontal gyrus as opposed to the genesis...

445
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,020
Ah, my favorite.

446
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,500
... of pink thoughts...

447
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:26,680
He's making those words up.

448
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,280
I know he is.

449
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,780
... which the twin hemispheres of the brain, the backside of the brain as we call it, the

450
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,500
two buttocks of the hippocampus.

451
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,080
That's where Dave has the little head on the back.

452
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,860
That's right.

453
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,800
Well, we make allowance for all types here because we're going to have to be a lot more

454
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,920
liberal in what we allow after we meet our alien.

455
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,340
You see, liberally, we have made so much information for you and for me...

456
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,500
Next thing you know, you're going to tell me that the World Cup gets higher ratings

457
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,460
than the World Series.

458
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,380
It probably does.

459
00:17:59,460 --> 00:17:59,620
It probably does.

460
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,700
There's a lot more in the actual world as opposed to the...

461
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,220
In America.

462
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,480
In America.

463
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,160
Real Americans don't watch soccer games.

464
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,820
Look at it this way, yeah.

465
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,500
Man, the World Cup is getting higher ratings in the United States than the World Series.

466
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,380
Look at it this way.

467
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,500
Does the Miss Universe pageant actually represent the universe?

468
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,560
It doesn't even represent planet Earth.

469
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,000
No, really, the Miss Universe pageant, Princess, we would be...

470
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
Well, you know, they take up...

471
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Hey, man, hey, man.

472
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:27,920
... every single...

473
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,020
... grandiose names that they can't live up to and...

474
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,700
Hello, man.

475
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,740
No, listen, over the last couple of years, they've had quotas where they have to have

476
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,820
so many contestants from Andromeda.

477
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,140
Can I quote you on that?

478
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,460
Did you quote what about two contestants from Andromeda?

479
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,600
Who got a note from their mom-ada.

480
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,540
Yeah, who got a note...

481
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,920
Yeah, they came to Earth, but they weren't recognized, and the janitor cleaned the floor

482
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,340
with them.

483
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,760
... going in different directions.

484
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,480
One is the sister who always told the truth, the other one always lied.

485
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,080
They were on Star Trek.

486
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,340
The only time he came out that morning, he was in a bad mood and didn't...

487
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,300
He wasn't the only one.

488
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,600
... punch it.

489
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:08,940
Well, I...

490
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,420
No, it's going around.

491
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,200
... I don't know what to say.

492
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:18,860
It seems that we've had to rehash some of our old procedural matters just because it's

493
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:24,940
an eternal struggle to make ourselves clear here as we gasp our last on this program.

494
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,660
Hear, hear, howl, hear, hear.

495
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,680
We are unable to continue.

496
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,180
He's right, he's right.

497
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,060
But you know, son...

498
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,420
But you know, the rehash...

499
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
This is the eggs day.

500
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,780
And we'll bat you the vamp.

501
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,200
Right.

502
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:37,580
Okay.

503
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,300
It's exactly 7 o'clock in the afternoon here at Wisteria Campground.

504
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,300
It looks like nothing.

505
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,980
Well, I want you to review that.

506
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,500
No, not right now.

507
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,240
Not yet.

508
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,160
Absolutely nothing has is happening.

509
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,140
No, not now.

510
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,940
It's peaceful.

511
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,200
No volcanoes, hailstorms, giant turtle eruptions.

512
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,820
Ask a subgenius what he has to think about his own death to Mr. Howell or whatever your...

513
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,160
I'm not sure.

514
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,160


515
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,160


516
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,160


517
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,160


518
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,160


519
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,160


520
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,160


521
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,160


522
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,100
I'm not sure.

523
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,100


524
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,920
How come no show?

525
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,340
What's going on here?

526
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,020
Well, I realize it looks as if we've been quite remiss here, but the problem is everything

527
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,280
occurs all at once at the climactic moment.

528
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,160
So our entire job, what we've been doing for the past few days is just getting ready, getting

529
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:23,700
everything ready so that we can be in situ, as it were, when the convulsive motion occurs.

530
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,180
And then at last our bliss, full and perfect, is.

531
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:35,020
But now begins for from this happy day the old dragon underground in straighter limit

532
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,920
bound not half so far casts his usurped sway.

533
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,220
And wrath to see his kingdom fail, swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.

534
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,060
But let's talk about that peaceful X-Day Campground.

535
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,360
It's a great place to go.

536
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:55,920
Yes.

537
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,120
Every time I hear the word wistia...

538
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,260
Wisteria Campground.

539
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,780
Wisteria.

540
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,120
It makes me feel wistful.

541
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,520
Wistful.

542
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,760
It's funny, it makes me feel hysterical.

543
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,780
Oh, well.

544
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,420
That's understandable, too.

545
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,340
I'm suffering from...

546
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,580
She's obviously suffering from wisteria.

547
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,140
Yes, I...

548
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,300
She's just a wisterical woman.

549
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,760
That's the place where the frozen custard stand has the icon head of Bob with a little

550
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:19,860
bit of chocolate.

551
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,060
That's no custard stand.

552
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,480
That is a plinth or a monolith.

553
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,100
That is custard's last stand.

554
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,940
You know, there was a custard who did have a last stand.

555
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,100
Major Amos Custard was surrounded by a bunch of people.

556
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,100


557
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,100


558
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
He was surrounded by Native Americans.

559
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,340
You know, here was no good eyes.

560
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,340
A famous Indian massacree.

561
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,820
See, every good idea I have.

562
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,500
You can look this up, although today we call these Native American direct actions.

563
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,620
But there was, of a famous massacree, a custard...

564
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:48,840
And it wiped out Amos Custard and his stand far less than Colonel George Armstrong Custer,

565
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,840
of course, which is why you never hear about that one.

566
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,840
And it occurred prior...

567
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,580
That one sounds like a lot of frozen...

568
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,240
Look it up, Google, and everything can be traced.

569
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,080
Everything can be traced.

570
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,740
Everyone listening to me, we don't just make these up, man.

571
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,060
We just say it.

572
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,900
You know, we come out with it.

573
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,420
So...

574
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,460
We do lots of research, too, as well.

575
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:07,700
Hey, guys.

576
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,740
Dr. Stang and Dr. Howe knows we do lots of research.

577
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,220
I'm trying.

578
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,000
Hey, here's something that is very special that I want to do right now.

579
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,580
Dave?

580
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:17,880
Yes?

581
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,380
Howe, we, Stang.

582
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,780
Yes?

583
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,580
I want us to all pause for a second here.

584
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,160
Let's all join hands for the group hug.

585
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,220
Put your paws together.

586
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,340
We're going to count to six.

587
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,060
Put your paws together.

588
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,060


589
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,160
We're going to count to six.

590
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,740
We're going to count to six and engage the six-second delay here because the delay is

591
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,260
not on.

592
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,220
Oh, yeah.

593
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm sorry.

594
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,840
I didn't...

595
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,520
I did a bad thing.

596
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:39,960
All right.

597
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,240
So, here we go.

598
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,120
One.

599
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,000
Count out loud.

600
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,360
Two.

601
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:45,880
Three.

602
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,200
Four.

603
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,660
Five.

604
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,000
And six.

605
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,880
And now there's a delay.

606
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,220
I guess.

607
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,920
Well, I hope you can go in.

608
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,060
That ought to sound fun on the recording that I'm making at home.

609
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,060


610
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,060


611
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,060


612
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,060


613
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,060


614
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,060


615
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,060


616
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,940
Yeah, they...

617
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,560
I'm sorry.

618
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,460
We'll hear the cut.

619
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,020
We'll hear the skip on the air.

620
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Very unprofessional radio behavior.

621
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,420
Yeah, and we all know what comes between fear and sex.

622
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,600
Yes.

623
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,060
Terror.

624
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,240
Because we're talking about yellow hair and it's playing.

625
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,820
That's why we all got a toothache.

626
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,240
No, I was...

627
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,060
I was...

628
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,180
I misspoke myself.

629
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:18,660
I'm sorry.

630
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,360
Well, bad things can happen at times.

631
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:20,660
Tension.

632
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,340
See, X-Day, you just have to get beyond those.

633
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,500
Speaking of sex, my...

634
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,740
Hysterical bundle of nerves.

635
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,080
...my...

636
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,140
Hysterical bundle of nerves.

637
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,560
Between sex and fear, Dr. Sinister?

638
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,060
It's a...

639
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,060


640
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,060


641
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,540
It's fun...

642
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:29,680
It's fun.

643
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:29,980
My...

644
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,480
Fun...

645
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,880
My...

646
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,540
My son and his buddy had this...

647
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,480
They would...

648
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,200
When they...

649
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,320
When they were talking about sex, they called it...

650
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,240
Tommy Handley and...

651
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,140
Cutting the onions.

652
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,100
Yeah, my wife and I cut the onions last night because...

653
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,360
Please, you.

654
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,740
Somebody open the window.

655
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:44,420


656
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,040
Tears and knives.

657
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah.

658
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,980
Do you ever take drugs...

659
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,120
Oh, well.

660
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,760
...just so you could have sex without crying?

661
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,980
I have never heard that phrase before, cutting the onions?

662
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,360
Oh, yeah.

663
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,540
Because it involves tears and knives.

664
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,200
Liquid, clear like glass on your...

665
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,040
In other words...

666
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,920
Somebody's got a more interesting sex life than any of us.

667
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,440
Tears. Idle tears.

668
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,600
I know not what they mean.

669
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,540
Tears from the depths of some divine despair.

670
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,820
By the way, all the regulars are still welcome tonight,

671
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,800
or anybody out there who has not called in before.

672
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,520
This is a golden opportunity to talk to some very interesting people.

673
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,260
If you call us up at 216-

674
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,520
Nope.

675
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,840
If you guys remember RC,

676
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,560
the caller who must not be named,

677
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,380
who has not been heard from in a few years,

678
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,540
he would always encourage the use of a strong pimp hand.

679
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,120
Where's Fantasy Caller?

680
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,520
I thought RC Caller was dead.

681
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,860
I thought RC was dead too.

682
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,940
I've heard he is not dead.

683
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,820
I've heard he's just in a place where he can't call anymore.

684
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,680
That doesn't mean he wasn't dead just because you heard he wasn't dead.

685
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,120
He could still be quite dead,

686
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,260
and he's just not dead.

687
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,340
You'll flip for the zip,

688
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,020
the zip in RC Cola,

689
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,040
the zip in RC Cola,

690
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,180
royal crown.

691
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,360
My guess is that he's in prison,

692
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,700
but I don't know.

693
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,540
I have no idea why.

694
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,900
He seems like the kind of guy who is not likely to get killed.

695
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,880
Jim and Harry's prison,

696
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,260
just down the block from our favorite bar,

697
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,060
Slinky's.

698
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,280
Sorry.

699
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,500
One day he was selling RNA drops on the internet.

700
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,420
The next day he's in prison and can't call in.

701
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,340
So shame.

702
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,460
He was selling his RNA on the internet?

703
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,140
Yep.

704
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,960
That's a quack thing you can do.

705
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,380
A lot of people do it.

706
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,260
You know, this is,

707
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,360
I'm going to tell you something right now.

708
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,640
I don't know if I told you this before or not,

709
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,560
but one time I had a dream.

710
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,340
A dream?

711
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,160
I had a dream.

712
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,600
Oh, really?

713
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,320
When everything was still.

714
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,060
I was hanging out at my mom's house and she was on the internet,

715
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,220
uh, looking stuff up.

716
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:40,780
Hmm.

717
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,300
And how did that make you feel?

718
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,420
And she stumbled upon the website of the ones who shall not be named,

719
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,120
who sell those products that you referenced.

720
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,720
Oh, really?

721
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,180
Yeah.

722
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,560
Yes.

723
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,340
And I said,

724
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,100
Oh my God,

725
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,500
you're going to this person's website.

726
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,720
Do you know who these people are?

727
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,120
Oh my God.

728
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,820
You call her that person?

729
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,400
Yeah.

730
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,440
A person's a person.

731
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,440
No matter how small.

732
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,480
A person, a person, a person that wouldn't shut up.

733
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,720
That was crazy.

734
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,220
All right.

735
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,240
I'm not referring to you, chief.

736
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,380
It's just all these deans around here.

737
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,340
They get under your skull.

738
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,480
It's like that Connie bitch.

739
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,380
I can't even roll.

740
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:13,680
See?

741
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,860
I gotta get out of here.

742
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,300
We don't bad mouth Connie in our church, son.

743
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,160
Yeah, well at least not where she could hear her.

744
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,640
There'd be some hell going around.

745
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,360
He's got a point.

746
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,800
She can't be listening every moment.

747
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,500
Can't.

748
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:27,760
Can she?

749
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,640
Every moment.

750
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,180
Can she?

751
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,780
My mother generally doesn't listen.

752
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,540
So we go to the campground and there's a, we have the big burn, you know, where everyone

753
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,960
dances around the fire, around the blue flame.

754
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,520
Tell them about that one, Stang.

755
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:47,100
Well only, you know, the, when the pagans do that, they have a symbolic man inside that

756
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,100
big burning man.

757
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,060
We have a very recognizable, willing sacrifice.

758
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,820
Yes.

759
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,140
We're willing that he be sacrificed to him.

760
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,080
And furthermore.

761
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,640
And this year it's Johnny Depp.

762
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:05,000
Johnny Depp will be the person burned inside the man at X day this year.

763
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,300
These stars are so flammable.

764
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,620
Unless the chicken's out, you know.

765
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:07,980
Yeah.

766
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,220
But he's really devoted.

767
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,800
He said he would do it.

768
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,460
He said, I've done every acting job I want to do.

769
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,980
I'm ready to join the true believers.

770
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,560
Nevermore.

771
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,240
You know, for more than a hundred years, for more than a hundred years, the national park

772
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,800
service, uh, would try to prevent forest fires at all costs.

773
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,400
Not understanding.

774
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,640
Not understanding that the forest fires are necessary for the survival of certain forests.

775
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,400
And the same can be said for J.R. Bob Dobbs.

776
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,740
I think the library needs also the same people who are going wild there.

777
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,640
Maybe in these fields.

778
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,940
Including the Pescalilla chimmonks.

779
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,360
They're everywhere, man.

780
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,360


781
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:56,220
It's good husbandry to burn down the forest so that a new, healthier, more vibrant forest

782
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:56,380
can be built.

783
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:56,920
And the forest can come back.

784
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,160
And same with saviors, messiahs.

785
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:06,720
It's not a proper savior, messiah, unless you kill it and, you know, skin it and talk

786
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,580
all at once at the same time.

787
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,360
So no one can understand really much of anything.

788
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,100
That's what we do.

789
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:12,300
Right.

790
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:19,520
To his club-footed child said Lord Stipple as he poured his postprandial tipple, your

791
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,520
mother's behavior offended our savior and that's why he made you a cripple.

792
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,860
I knew you were going to...

793
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,740
You just rhymed tipple with tipple.

794
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,500
I thought you were going somewhere with a third...

795
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,060
And that's why you have a third nipple.

796
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,820
Well, we could do it that way.

797
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,380
I didn't want to get to specific cases.

798
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,460
Let's talk about the sacred plinth at the campground with those amazing carvings and

799
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,500
hieroglyphs on it.

800
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,660
That's not something that you see every day.

801
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:54,140
Oh, my flesh trembled when I gazed upon those abhorrent hieroglyphs.

802
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,580
Me too.

803
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,500
Above those, a petal of a

804
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:55,500


805
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:55,500


806
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:55,500


807
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:55,500


808
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:55,500


809
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:55,500


810
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:55,500


811
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,580
spirit was a figure of evidently pictorial intent, though its impressionistic execution

812
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,860
forbade a very clear idea of its nature.

813
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:10,040
It seemed to be a sort of monster or symbol representing a monster of a form which only

814
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,200
a diseased fancy could conceive.

815
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,760
If I say that my sometimes extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus,

816
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,920
a dragon, and a human caricature, I should not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing

817
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,480
with the monstrous pyre.

818
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,740
A type protruding from the tentacular mass.

819
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:39,320
This would be as good a time as any to remind listeners that portions of the following broadcast

820
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,080
may be objectionable to some members of the audience.

We'll see you next time.

829
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,860
Bye for now.

830
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,100
Bye.

831
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:08,900
Bye.

832
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,280
Bye.

833
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,320
Bye.

834
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:11,620
Bye.

835
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:11,620


836
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:11,780
Bye.

837
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:11,840


838
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:11,880
Bye.

839
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:11,880


840
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:11,880


841
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:11,880


842
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:11,880


843
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:11,880


844
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:11,880


845
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:11,880


846
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:11,880


847
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,280
Bye.

848
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,360
Bye.

849
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,360


850
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,360


851
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,360


852
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,360


853
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,620
Bye.

854
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,720
Bye.

855
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,340
Bye.

856
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,820
Bye.

857
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:50,660
See ya later you ASCC去 WCSB.

858
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,820
You SP eat like a

859
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:52,940
HOW MANY D поставил Кanka

860
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,080
I have seen UFOs.

861
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,120
How about Bigfoot?

862
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,460
Three very distinctly different UFOs.

863
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,700
I have seen two UFOs, and then I identified the second.

864
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,400
Well, that wasn't a UFO, was it?

865
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,740
Hey, you know what?

866
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,060
Call her.

867
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,480
Call her.

868
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:06,900
Call her.

869
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,320
Call her.

870
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,040
I just noticed that you're not the kind of caller we want because you do not perceive

871
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,300
the fact that other people are talking at the same time that you are.

872
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,120
Like, when I hear other people talking, I'm going to try and back out.

873
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,580
Everybody else is talking over each other.

874
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,380
Right, right.

875
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,740
And then I kind of shut up when I hear other people making a point.

876
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,020
And I tried to say something real quick.

877
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,140
And then everyone else tried to say something real quick.

878
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,700
And then you kept on talking yourself.

879
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,340
A hit.

880
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,220
A palpable hit.

881
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,720
So, I was just going to say something really quick.

882
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,200
One summer, I saw two UFOs.

883
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,380
I think this was in 2008.

884
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,380
And I saw two UFOs that summer.

885
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,160
And the second one, I came to identify.

886
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,780
And was therefore able to...

887
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,560
To retroactively identify the first one.

888
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,420
Really, really fast.

889
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,860
Please, I got it.

890
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,240
And now I'm done.

891
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,020
Oh.

892
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,900
Well, that was...

893
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,480
That was something...

894
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,040
Well, the subject of UFOs has very little to do with what we're talking about tonight.

895
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,660
They passed by.

896
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:11,300
Because so far, nobody in the church, but some genius, has ever seen one.

897
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,360
And they've been waiting all this time.

898
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:13,980
That's not true.

899
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,200
They've buzz-bombed the camps before.

900
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,500
In the past, Reverend Stang even photographed one.

901
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,160
Isn't that right?

902
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,340
Yeah, you can see it on YouTube.

903
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:21,820
Yeah.

904
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:21,980
Yeah.

905
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,620
You can see it on YouTube.

906
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:22,740
Yeah.

907
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:22,760
You can see it on YouTube.

908
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:22,760


909
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:22,760


910
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:22,760


911
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,180
It's a brushwood.

912
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,600
Yeah.

913
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,000
Hey, we're getting a caller from a New York City number.

914
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,700
But they have to come all the way down and land.

915
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,360
That's the thing.

916
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,580
We're getting a call from the 917 area code.

917
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,040
Oh, better.

918
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,420
Better.

919
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,300
That's Manhattan.

920
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Connect us, will ya?

921
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,660
You're on the air.

922
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:42,040
Dr. Howell, I will never cease to be amazed at your talent.

923
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:42,900
You will?

924
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:49,740
If somehow we could take what you have and your gift and put it into a pill.

925
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,460
Put it into a pill?

926
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,480
Well...

927
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,760
Well...

928
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:52,760


929
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,880
We would be millionaires.

930
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,780
Dr. Well, all right.

931
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,780
I would swallow an entire bathtub full of those pills.

932
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,300
But I just took one of those things.

933
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,300
An old-fashioned bathtub.

934
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,500
I took one of those show pills just before we went on the air.

935
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,080
How did it happen?

936
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,680
I, well, I...

937
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,940
Where did this gift you have come from, Mark?

938
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,320
It came from my left pocket.

939
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:14,660
It doesn't make you rich.

940
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,320
I usually keep it in my waistcoat pocket, but it's just too hot to wear that particular

941
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:19,800
garment.

942
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,560
Well, may I borrow your waistcoat?

943
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,560
You may.

944
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,340
I do not.

945
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,280
Get your own.

946
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,200
If I may say so.

947
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:26,960
I mean, come on.

948
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,180
One must keep a certain distance.

949
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,580
You can't allow the, uh, the, uh, the enthusiasts to come and paw you like some blind insensate

950
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:35,620
young white...

951
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,520
Dr. That doesn't give me a waistcoat.

952
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:36,900
No.

953
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,420
Not so, replied the agent.

954
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,600
Dr. I come there to Cleveland and take it from you.

955
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,000
I will travel everywhere.

956
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,020
I pray that you'll write me as one who loves his fellow men.

957
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,620
You really want to come to Cleveland, huh?

958
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,880
Dr. Cleveland's flat's insane.

959
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,280
You'll be fine.

960
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,440
I'll be there.

961
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:52,760
Dr. I'll be there.

962
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:52,760


963
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:52,760


964
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:52,760


965
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:52,760


966
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:52,760


967
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,120
I'll be there.

968
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,980
I'll be there.

969
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,180
Dr. And Dr. Manhattan hung up on us.

970
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,540
Well, that's too bad.

971
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,660
Dr. Well, that's a downtown kinda guy right there.

972
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,300
How come he got...

973
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,280
What are you, a kinda skinhead voice there?

974
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,060
We've got a caller.

975
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,520
We've got a caller from Toledo and a caller from Nashville on the line.

976
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,120
Dr. Let's have him.

977
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,260
What a...

978
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,860
What a nationalistic sound.

979
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:14,160
Dr. Sinister, do you usually get such a cosmopolitan smorgasbord of colors?

980
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:14,480
Dr. Toledo, Nashville.

981
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,480


982
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,480


983
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,420
I've seen Toledo numbers calling him before, but never a Nashville number.

984
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,380
And the Nashville caller hung up.

985
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,700
Dr. Let's run that View of Toledo again by, uh...

986
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,740
Holy Toledo...

987
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,080
Right now.

988
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,080
Yeah, it's...

989
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,260
How many Aspies do we have here right now?

990
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:27,740
Athletes?

991
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,520
Ash, Naz, Thrakatulak, Agborzum.

992
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,580
Like, I get the feeling that Asperger's syndrome is the...

993
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,760
Where is Nomany Mark when we need it?

994
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,400
I'm a vegan.

995
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,400
I don't want an Asperger's.

996
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,280
Is Asperger's syndrome when you go all chatty and you can't stop or something?

997
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,520
What is the Asperger's syndrome?

998
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,120
Well, actually, a very good friend of mine.

999
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,780
I might say the best oldest friend I have is actually a psychiatrist now.

1000
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,280
Get in the poop with Westside.

1001
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,860
And he tells you who's got Asperger's and who doesn't?

1002
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,480
No, but he told me a funny story when I was talking about some of the people I know.

1003
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,440
Let's hear it.

1004
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,000
And the subject of Asperger's syndrome came up.

1005
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,100
And he said that he can always diagnose the Aspies right away at the end of the session.

1006
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,880
At the end of his session with them.

1007
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,820
Because it'll be very clear to any rational, normal person that the session is over.

1008
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,840
And how does that make you feel?

1009
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,720
And the person with Asperger's syndrome doesn't recognize these social cues.

1010
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,760
That it's time to go.

1011
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,080
Ah.

1012
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,720
They're basically...

1013
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,660
He has to actually tell them, listen, your appointment's over.

1014
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,020
You need to go now.

1015
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,000
He can't just say, well, anything else?

1016
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,120
Well, okay, I think we've had a productive session here.

1017
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,560
Maybe we'll talk some more about this next week.

1018
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,540
Uh, want you to take care of yourself in the meantime?

1019
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,640
They don't get it.

1020
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,580
He has to tell them, it's time for you to go.

1021
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,300
A-social.

1022
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:48,300
They do not respond to the usual social controls and the hidden parameters that mark interactions for the rest of us.

1023
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,700
For a healthy, fully...

1024
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,060
Exactly.

1025
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,860
...integrated personality.

1026
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,680
Exactly.

1027
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,080
We don't drink the same water they do.

1028
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,500
I also perceive...

1029
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,260
Their water is happening...

1030
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,580
...lack of ability to perceive...

1031
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,900
Hey, we've got the Nashville caller back.

1032
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,340
...Corsicao's syndrome...

1033
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:01,820
You're on the air.

1034
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,800
...vulnerable to distinguish the apperceptive mass...

1035
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:04,860
Hello?

1036
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,060
...and mass insanity.

1037
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,460
Gates?

1038
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:08,800
Hello?

1039
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,940
Hello?

1040
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,520
615 caller.

1041
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,260
Hello?

1042
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:12,660
Hello.

1043
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,120
Welcome on the show.

1044
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,160
Welcome on the show.

1045
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,380
I thought you needed a woman.

1046
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,840
Woman caller.

1047
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,680
A woman?

1048
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:18,900
Woman caller.

1049
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,100
Are you coming down?

1050
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,800
Hey, a woman.

1051
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,500
Woman caller.

1052
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,920
Not just a woman, but a woman calling from Nashville, Tennessee.

1053
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,360
Eagle.

1054
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,360


1055
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:23,740
Woman caller.

1056
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,320
Eagle.

1057
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,380
We need a woman caller.

1058
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,420
Eagle.

1059
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,100
Eagle.

1060
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:27,620
Eagle.

1061
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,120


1062
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,420
Eagle.

1063
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,220
Princess V is right here by me elbow.

1064
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,160
Go ahead and talk to her, Princess V.

1065
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,520
Listen to that.

1066
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,260
It's a pro.

1067
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,740
It's a favorable call.

1068
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,180
Not one of these people always trying to tear us down.

1069
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,780
Oh, up butch.

1070
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,480
And she hung up.

1071
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,480
That's the story of our life.

1072
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,600
It was the kitchen succinct.

1073
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,140
Let's take another caller.

1074
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,560
Yes, you're on the air.

1075
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,560
The anarcho-patrio psychotic society.

1076
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,200
Hello.

1077
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,460
Are you there?

1078
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,160
Hello.

1079
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,240
Hello.

1080
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,180
Yeah.

1081
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,860
There he is right over there.

1082
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,140
Put that corncob away.

1083
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,880
This is perhaps the most chaotic program I've ever had.

1084
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,780
I think the cacophony society is the truth.

1085
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,540
Everybody's aware of the fact that we're all talking over each other.

1086
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,540
I don't know why you say that about me.

1087
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,960
And yet nobody seems to modify their behavior in light of that knowledge.

1088
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,400
We have to do what we have to do.

1089
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,240
I mean, can you hear?

1090
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,440
Can everybody hear everybody else on the line?

1091
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,960
Well, no, not exactly that well, but I can tell that there's everybody.

1092
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,640
If you can tell that someone else is talking.

1093
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,760
Yes.

1094
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:49,540
The point is, it helps if everyone's voice does not sound like everyone else's voice.

1095
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:54,740
Then at least you can pick out an individual thread until the garment falls to pieces.

1096
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,320
Yes, contrast.

1097
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,780
It's compare and contrast.

1098
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,720
I think everybody here sounds unique.

1099
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,360
Yeah, so we're covered.

1100
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,200
We're covered.

1101
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,380
Everyone's a freak sounding unique.

1102
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:12,180
Actually, you know, there's a certain caller who's called into the show a lot where I thought like if...

1103
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,660
There is a caller.

1104
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,080
If Dave suffered severe brain trauma, he would sound like this caller.

1105
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,600
A caller whose ramblings aren't worth a dollar.

1106
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,720
Who is this caller?

1107
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,520
Yeah, Dave.

1108
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,520
This special caller.

1109
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,980
You are a caller who can't restrain his hope and power.

1110
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,600
Yeah, Dave, like there's another caller who calls in frequently.

1111
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,200
And who makes the calls?

1112
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,180
He almost sounds like you, except he sounds like he's really severely brain damaged.

1113
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,700
Who doesn't care about the way anyone thinks.

1114
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,660
He's got a similar voice is all I'm saying.

1115
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,320
Drives us insane.

1116
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,960
But he sounds like an idiot.

1117
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,980
And you sound like a misunderstood genius.

1118
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,120
Oh, well, thank you.

1119
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,320
I thought it was a misunderstood idiot, but that's good enough for me.

1120
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,520
I can't understand a damn thing he says.

1121
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,560
Hence the misunderstood.

1122
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,220
All partial.

1123
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:01,640
All evil.

1124
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,380
All universal good.

1125
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:10,860
Why would anybody want to be understood anyway in this mad, mad, bad world we're living in?

1126
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,140
Why not just throw meaning to the wind and grasp whatever kind of...

1127
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,200
Make your own meaning, you know?

1128
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,900
You see, only people who care what other people think...

1129
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,900
Don't give up.

1130
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,980
...concern themselves with being understood.

1131
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,240
Yes, that's right.

1132
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,500
If you really don't care what other people think, then you won't concern yourself with being understood.

1133
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,600
Yes, exactly.

1134
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,880
Let them follow you.

1135
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,300
And the most...

1136
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,360
sociopathic people I've ever met still cared about what other people think.

1137
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,120
Gesundheit.

1138
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,720
And they still carry knives, too.

1139
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,600
And they carry those weird little things on the bottom of their feet

1140
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,720
that can cause really weird and serious necromantic injury.

1141
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,600
That's so...

1142
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,380
I keep my own coffin earth in there.

1143
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,380
It's not weird.

1144
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,080
It's necessary.

1145
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,400
Otherwise, when you're out in the sun, you frizzle up in a moment,

1146
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,780
even with a cloud cover.

1147
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,480
Did you know Chopin was a vampire?

1148
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah, that's...

1149
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,680
Yeah, that's what they say.

1150
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,960
That's for his minute...

1151
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:01,860
waltzy.

1152
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,140
And the fact that, like, they had...

1153
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,560
when he...

1154
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,840
when they buried him, they had to get some earth from Poland to throw in the grave with him.

1155
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,940
Well, not Romania.

1156
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,800
Earth of Polska.

1157
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,580
Yeah, you couldn't bury him without burying some dirt from his normal homeland.

1158
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,060
That's...

1159
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,780
That's like a Dracula thing.

1160
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,060
The first homeland of the great Dracula was Romania.

1161
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:19,860
Yeah, that's correct.

1162
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,100
Of the Transylvanian parts.

1163
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,080
The land across the forest.

1164
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:23,860
Yes.

1165
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,400
Vampirism knows no national boundaries.

1166
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:26,800
I'm excited.

1167
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,200
Ha!

1168
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,920
I was into vampires before it was cool.

1169
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,540
And now it's not cool.

1170
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,760
Well, Cleveland was known to have many, many vampires in the late 80s and early 90s.

1171
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,020
Those brooding teenage hunks made vampires uncool.

1172
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,080
They were like a green chicken blood and...

1173
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,480
Never thought I'd see the day.

1174
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,380
...take night jobs and sleep all day.

1175
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,000
Another sign of the end times.

1176
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,700
That's it.

1177
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,340
I'm right with you.

1178
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,680
I believe that that's definitely a sign.

1179
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,700
When you see large numbers of people becoming vampires, just like...

1180
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,280
I'm going goth.

1181
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:00,820
Like, when they're...

1182
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,740
We used to go goth and stuff like that.

1183
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,860
They're very becoming vampires, but that's not the problem.

1184
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,500
I used to know a lot of people who were into goth ten years after it stopped being...

1185
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,640
...interesting.

1186
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,800
Yeah.

1187
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,420
But I like that goth girl on Monster High.

1188
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,820
And this was about 15 years ago.

1189
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,760
And I knew a guy who identified himself as a psychic ninja vampire detective.

1190
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,060
Really? I'm not...

1191
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,780
Did you know that I'm a Mentat Vulcan Jedi?

1192
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,620
A Vulcan Jedi?

1193
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,560
Look at his eyebrows.

1194
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,940
A Mentat Vulcan Jedi.

1195
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:29,700
His eyebrows are...

1196
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,740
So is it a mind melder? A mind melder?

1197
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,920
Oh, I misread the power, man. I misread the...

1198
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,660
With Down syndrome.

1199
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,440
It's a Mentat.

1200
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:35,860
Yes.

1201
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,340
Well...

1202
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,140
Good old Mentat.

1203
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,620
The Thufir Hawat of the church.

1204
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,400
He was the one who started all the subgenius days, X days. He was great.

1205
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,300
That guy came up and looked all...

1206
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,980
He was a little disheveled at first.

1207
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,700
You know, he'd come up and he'd show up like,

1208
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:55,900
Oh, hey, just somebody from there and found a place to sleep and was told to get along.

1209
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,760
And he said, Hey, man, what's going on?

1210
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,960
And he was immediately...

1211
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,620
Yeah. You know, there's...

1212
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,020
He was part of the core, the Communist Party,

1213
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,800
common turn, if you will, of the subgenius church cult, whatever you want to call it.

1214
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:14,160
That's funny, Dave, because there's an identical legend concerning Burning Man over in Nevada,

1215
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:19,160
where supposedly some hobo stumbled in and everybody treated him really nice.

1216
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,300
And he somehow became king of Burning Man.

1217
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,520
A preposterous story, but you know how it is.

1218
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,880
People like these legends and myths and they cling to them.

1219
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,060
It gives them some comfort that...

1220
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,620
Even the most uncouth bozo will be accepted.

1221
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,580
Then that gives them some hope.

1222
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,080
Hal?

1223
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:36,860
Yes?

1224
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,680
That's not just a mythological story.

1225
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,380
You mean it really happened?

1226
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,900
I was that hobo.

1227
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,000
Hobo is my countenance.

1228
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,660
I was the one they're talking about.

1229
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,440
Well, golly, I'm sorry.

1230
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,000
I...

1231
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,040
Maybe you'd better clarify for the listening audience.

1232
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,560
No, that was the story.

1233
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,840
I was homeless and miserable.

1234
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,040
I was homeless and miserable.

1235
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,040


1236
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,720
I was a little empathetic and somebody gave me a ride.

1237
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,260
Next thing I knew I was at Burning Man.

1238
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:05,960
A ride.

1239
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,960
They were carrying me.

1240
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,740
They called me King of the Fools and carried me around.

1241
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,440
They had me ride something called the Stang.

1242
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,760
Oh, yeah, I remember that one.

1243
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,800
That's where I got my name.

1244
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,120
I got kind of confused.

1245
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,320
It comes from an archaic unit of measurement.

1246
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,820
We say they came down with so many stangs.

1247
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,080
No, no, no.

1248
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,620
That's not what it is.

1249
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,020
Riding the Stang was what...

1250
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,780
They would do to adulterers.

1251
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,400
Uh-oh.

1252
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:40,820
Cheaters that got caught would have to dress in silly clothes and they'd be put on a very

1253
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:45,100
uncomfortable board and ridden around town and jeered.

1254
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,920
That was called riding the Stang.

1255
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,020
Hmm.

1256
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:58,420
Now, in rap gangster jargon, to stang or to make a stang is to commit a robbery.

1257
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,560
Yeah.

1258
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,900
Or otherwise a con.

1259
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,220
Because me really love to make a stang.

1260
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:07,600
Yes, Mr. High Cap, don't make me touch your man.

1261
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,420
But there was an obsolete unit of measurement called the Stang.

1262
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,980
That's absolutely kind of a...

1263
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:13,700
Must be a coincidence.

1264
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,320
Oh, I didn't know about that one.

1265
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:16,680
Yes.

1266
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,800
And then there's stang and derm, which was really drum.

1267
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:20,780
Yes.

1268
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:21,380
Stang.

1269
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:21,880
Drumming.

1270
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,120
Stang und drang.

1271
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,440
Right.

1272
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,160
That's what it was.

1273
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,880
But they got it all mixed up like I just did.

1274
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,720
It originally was...

1275
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,020
What about...

1276
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,400
Now, what about...

1277
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,400


1278
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,400


1279
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,400


1280
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,400


1281
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,400


1282
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,400


1283
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,400


1284
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,400


1285
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,400


1286
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,480
Stang and drumming, but they changed it to...

1287
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,780
Stang und drang.

1288
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,740
Where does stangor fit into all this?

1289
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,120
Well, that's just the name of my video game.

1290
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,220
In another world, in another universe, only accessible through digital manipulation.

1291
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,880
We have another caller here.

1292
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:45,080
That's our coach.

1293
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,240
Let's bring this other caller on real quick.

1294
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:47,660
Bring him up.

1295
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,460
You're on the air.

1296
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:49,940
Hello?

1297
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:51,820
Hello?

1298
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,040
Hi, you're a neo-fascist earth blunderer.

1299
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,220
Hail, speaker of earth.

1300
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,380
Earth blunderer.

1301
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:58,380


1302
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:58,880
Yeah.

1303
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,680
Speak now or forever hold your penis.

1304
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,940
Do you want to hear my story about the red UFO that I heard?

1305
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:07,480
Yes.

1306
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,260
Yes, we do.

1307
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,340
This is the place for it.

1308
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,100
Okay.

1309
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,300
I didn't think I was welcome here because I was...

1310
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,700
Oh, nevermind that.

1311
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,020
We'll hash that out later.

1312
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,680
Tell us about your encounter.

1313
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:18,120
Yeah.

1314
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:24,040
So the cool thing that I saw was I live in a small development with little yellow houses.

1315
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,540
And how did that make you feel?

1316
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,840
Are they made of tiki-taki?

1317
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,580
It doesn't make me feel...

1318
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,380
And they all look just like...

1319
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:28,880
They're not good at all.

1320
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,440
It makes me feel bad, actually.

1321
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,740
It makes me drive to drink or drink to drive or whatever it is.

1322
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,300
If you start seeing double, if you start seeing double, you just close one eye.

1323
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,360
You gotta drink.

1324
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:39,780
No, I know.

1325
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,600
I got that all figured out.

1326
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,060
You're right.

1327
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,320
I've seen the devil all the time.

1328
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:43,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1329
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:51,260
But this unidentified flying or searching object that I saw appear...

1330
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:56,300
I was outside in my street just putting the garbage out or whatever.

1331
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,380
This was a couple of years ago.

1332
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,900
And I saw this red light.

1333
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,020
This red...

1334
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,880
Imagine a van, like a Craftsman 300.

1335
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,700
Or what did they call that?

1336
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,980
You know, back in the 70s?

1337
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,480
Craftsman 300?

1338
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,360
100?

1339
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:13,740
100?

1340
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:14,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1341
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,220
Yeah.

1342
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,040
Anyway, this van...

1343
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,540
What'd he say?

1344
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,200
A van taillight.

1345
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,380
It was a red taillight.

1346
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,980
It had a red taillight?

1347
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,120
Yeah, no.

1348
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,900
Aren't taillights supposed to be green?

1349
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:26,600
You want to call back?

1350
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:27,260
Okay.

1351
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:27,360
I'm sorry.

1352
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,040
I saw...

1353
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,100
You had a taillight out.

1354
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:29,980
Aren't taillights supposed to be green?

1355
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,940
I'm just going to write you a warning this time.

1356
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,320
But you got to get that thing...

1357
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:45,120
Six by six red square that just shot across from behind one house and went across the

1358
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:45,580
street.

1359
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,460
Looking for my lost cross, boss.

1360
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,880
I live at the bottom of a hill, actually.

1361
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,100
Now it comes out.

1362
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,300
There are no roads, no crossroads, whatever.

1363
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:54,920
I feel sorry for you.

1364
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,500
You'll get to the top someday, son.

1365
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,340
I will.

1366
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:57,760
No, I'm...

1367
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,220
Actually, I live at the top of a hill, kind of at the...

1368
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,460
Well, look at your story straight.

1369
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,040
You were at the bottom just a minute ago.

1370
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:03,200
Really?

1371
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,660
You said you had a vasectomy.

1372
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,860
What does that have to do with it?

1373
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,240
Yeah, I'd like to ask that.

1374
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,780
I used to work all up to the side.

1375
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,240
I had vasectomy, huh?

1376
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:15,920
But anyway, this light, though, just shot across straight like a laser beam.

1377
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,280
My eyes.

1378
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,160
My eyes.

1379
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,140
Six by six.

1380
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,080
No, Mr. Bond.

1381
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,340
I expect you to die.

1382
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,240
And it disappeared.

1383
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,560
Did I expect me to talk?

1384
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,200
Nine other houses.

1385
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:26,480
Nine other houses.

1386
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,300
Yeah.

1387
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:34,580
Well, did the craft with its alien occupants land and make contact?

1388
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,260
Yeah.

1389
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,920
Could you make out any of the passengers, any of their features or passenger...

1390
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,240
Did you make out with any of the passengers?

1391
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,680
Were they human?

1392
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,000
No, that's the point.

1393
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,280
In a passive or active role...

1394
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,020
Those sexually-sorcery people.

1395
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,280
Oh, look at that.

1396
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,900
The passengers were invisible.

1397
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,520
Did the young...

1398
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,540
The only...

1399
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,000
The only had a right...

1400
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:56,720
The only had a right to be invisible.

1401
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,000
They were invisible invaders.

1402
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,800
You could only tell they were there because they were singing that Iggy Pop song.

1403
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,160
I am the passenger.

1404
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,180
No, I mean, I don't even know if they were there, but their tail light was there and

1405
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:11,180
it shot straight across the street, disappeared behind some other houses and was gone.

1406
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,920
Well, that would have to be alien.

1407
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,900
There's no possible explanation for that.

1408
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:15,840
Yeah, it must be.

1409
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,280
I can't imagine what that could possibly have been.

1410
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,940
Science has no answers.

1411
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:21,800
A main contact.

1412
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,360
Absolutely right.

1413
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,900
A red light in the sky?

1414
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,320
That's gotta be...

1415
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,260
It's only a Chinese parent.

1416
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:26,460
It's only a Chinese parent.

1417
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:26,760
It's a paranormal.

1418
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,820
It wasn't in the sky.

1419
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,920
It disappeared behind the houses.

1420
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:31,220
It was about a minute.

1421
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:31,220


1422
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:31,540
It was on the ground.

1423
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,460
Holy cow.

1424
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,640
There's no explanation.

1425
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,200
I'm sure you thought you saw a monster.

1426
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,580
You know, the human mind can play strange tricks.

1427
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,460
It's capable...

1428
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,020
No, no tricks.

1429
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:45,480
No tricks.

1430
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,480
I was sober.

1431
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,040
I was...

1432
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,180
Tricks are for kids.

1433
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,260
I just put the garbage out that night.

1434
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,660
So, Brady is no excuse.

1435
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,340
So, thank you for sobering.

1436
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,800
Well, this is part of the diagnosis we had earlier.

1437
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,160
Well...

1438
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:56,660
These kids...

1439
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,260
Is this psychosis or brain hemorrhage...

1440
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,860
Why do students deal with that often?

1441
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:00,000
Well, the way we Vancouver students treat them is basically Tuskegee, I Đạt fó tanto

1442
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,320
tr馮 orchid,ント...

1443
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,340
I'm not talking about Laura, Travis, les Industries or the implications of the

1444
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:03,340


1445
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,160
I'm talking about those kids, themselves.

1446
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:05,740
Yeah...

1447
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,500
Er...

1448
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,860
I've been up there mithing this whole year, Pierre.

1449
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:10,980
And, we just saw at the end of theicide episode about thatceotto.

1450
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:11,580
Oh...

1451
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:11,580


1452
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,980
We just Hubble coincidence that we can get mayo suggest that we can be addicting

1453
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:24,680
and three wise things inええxuu think you're right then I thought that pander was

1454
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:24,680


1455
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:24,820


1456
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,580
I made this clear and slightly hampered.

1457
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,160
It is not...

1458
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,880
First, let's split up.

1459
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,420
You're done.

1460
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,260
Okay, yeah.

1461
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,900
I'll go out to do the...

1462
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,380
Wait a minute.

1463
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,280
You go into the deadly cave, and I'll go into the lost mine shaft.

1464
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,180
It's always best to split up.

1465
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:43,580
I'll leave the rest of them back at the donut stand and descend into the abyss.

1466
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,380
No, no, no.

1467
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,840
You're coming right along with us.

1468
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,620
Get your ass in the door, in the cave portal entryway.

1469
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,800
They're crying out loud.

1470
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,720
Whatever it is, I'm not part of this mass vision, but I'm trying as hard as I can.

1471
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:00,620
You know, I'll never forget the day I first set eyes on Ivan Stang, that singular being.

1472
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,260
He was not what I expected.

1473
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:09,940
In the doorway stood a person of such singular appearance that I should have exclaimed aloud,

1474
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:14,600
but for the restraints of good breeding, old, white-bearded, and ragged.

1475
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:19,800
My host possessed a countenance and physique which inspired equal wonder and respect.

1476
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,140
His height could not have been less than six feet.

1477
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:23,720
Despite...

1478
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,600
Like a woman, I guess.

1479
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,420
A general air of age and poverty, he was stout and powerful in proportion.

1480
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:34,100
His face, almost hidden by a long beard which grew high on the cheeks,

1481
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,460
seemed abnormally ruddy and less wrinkled than one might expect.

1482
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,440
And I hope there's some demons for what they was.

1483
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,540
While over a high forehead fell a shock of white hair, little thinned by the ears.

1484
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:53,480
His piercing blue eyes, though a trifle bloodshot, seemed inexplicably keen and burning.

1485
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,500
But for his...

1486
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:59,080
For his horrible unkemptness, the man would have been as distinguished looking as he was impressive.

1487
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,880
And there was a stitch across his forehead.

1488
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,260
However, the unkemptness made him offensive, despite his face and figure.

1489
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:13,420
My family, if I'll cross it, the Great Plains was wiped out by a band of wild pink boys.

1490
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,580
What was the flesh they ate?

1491
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,020
It was said they ate unclean things to stay alive during this rite of passage.

1492
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,440
And, of course, fish.

1493
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,280
A form of transversion.

1494
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,780
A form of demagogification.

1495
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,080
In which the party celebrates and enjoys each other's flesh.

1496
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,660
It's as simple as that.

1497
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,160
There's no big deal about it.

1498
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,880
Everybody knows you're all a bunch of flesh eaters.

1499
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:41,500
When you take the road over the Sierras, you come to the Donner Pass,

1500
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,460
where the Donner Party decided to stay in that unfortunate winter.

1501
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:52,340
And they've put up a huge statue of them looking down the road, you know, in a heroic pioneer way.

1502
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,480
And they're looking down the road toward the Burgundy.

1503
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:54,740
The Burgundy, the Burgundy.

1504
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,220
And, uh, you know, you know, I would have thought they were looking at a Burger King about 300 years ago.

1505
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,500
Why didn't they go there?

1506
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:01,420
You know, all this, they could have saved the, uh, the whole thing.

1507
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,980
Anyway, uh, that's over in California.

1508
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,680
That's on the California side of it.

1509
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,060
That's true, though, isn't it?

1510
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:07,720
Yeah.

1511
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:12,080
If you hadn't said they were looking at a restaurant, I was going to be really disappointed.

1512
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,780
But they are.

1513
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,060
They're looking at a Burger King, which is visible.

1514
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:15,540
Clearly visible.

1515
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,000
I thought it was a long page.

1516
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:18,660
You could see them all posing and looking.

1517
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,760
They were looking at the cemetery or something.

1518
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,820
No, there was no cemetery there.

1519
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,480
And that's, uh.

1520
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:32,020
That time, as there is in peaceful Bufalora, Italy, there there's a cemetery that you might...

1521
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:32,920
Bufalora?

1522
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,400
Yes, Bufalora.

1523
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,960
Was the city of Buffalo, New York named after that place?

1524
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,200
No, that was quite different, you know.

1525
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,160
You know, you're the person who taught me.

1526
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,100
About the buffalo?

1527
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,940
Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo.

1528
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:48,720
They do.

1529
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,740
You're the one who taught me that.

1530
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,540
Buffalo from Buffalo, New York do Buffalo, other buffalo from Buffalo.

1531
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,260
The way that buffalo from Buffalo, New York, Buffalo.

1532
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,640
Thank God for places like Buffalo, Pennsylvania, and well-charred town.

1533
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,960
Delicious, but not too well done.

1534
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:13,380
No, we wouldn't want to excite anyone behind us or in front of us for that matter.

1535
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,320
Because the blood is the life, Mr. Renfield.

1536
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,140
You can argue.

1537
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,540
Some of us like the old stuff.

1538
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,780
No more of this plasma powder.

1539
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:29,880
We like to take it the way we used to, from a living body.

1540
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:39,480
But I'm always biting my cheeks with my unnaturally sharpened teeth because of this namby family.

1541
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,580
That's kind of engorging.

1542
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,640
We're going to have to go back after X-Day.

1543
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,220
We'll have our own fine fodder.

1544
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:49,620
The cattle will be...

1545
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,880
We found who?

1546
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,620
The canaglia, as we called them in the old days.

1547
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,120
Turn them upside down and slash their throats.

1548
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,660
Let the blood spatter upon the dust of our beloved ancestors, and we'll bring them back as in the old days.

1549
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,860
Oh, he's got a bit of the Irish.

1550
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,460
That's true.

1551
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,480
He's got a bit of the Irish.

1552
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:09,660
Lacking them?

1553
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,360
Yes, only the wee leprechauns can tell you.

1554
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,500
Vampire leprechauns.

1555
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,420
Oh, no.

1556
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,440
Leprechaun vampires.

1557
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,640
The best of the vampire leprechauns.

1558
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,580
I just have you for a wee little bite.

1559
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,480
Yes, one little bite.

1560
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,220
Oh, there's a wee little bite.

1561
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,900
Shrinking's not contagious, just not in the way you mean.

1562
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,700
But pretty soon, you'll be losing your stature.

1563
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:38,400
And I'm getting hungry for stringy...

1564
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,880
Yellow livers, green intestines, pink heart.

1565
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,660
They're magically delicious.

1566
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:47,840
Delicious.

1567
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,120
Hee hee hee hee.

1568
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,860
Okay, let's chop that and stick it in the gel-getter for a brief moment.

1569
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,960
Hey kids, do you know what time it is?

1570
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,620
Let's get around the cauldron and the blue fire.

1571
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:00,460
Hey kids.

1572
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,420
Our granny likes them to put another stick under their kettle.

1573
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:08,760
Pull up an old dead tree stump and sit a while.

1574
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:15,380
While I spin a tale I call, Hex Day is Here.

1575
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:16,980
Hee hee hee hee.

1576
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,200
Whoa!

1577
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:18,680
Hee hee hee hee.

1578
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,020
Hee hee hee hee.

1579
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,200
Hee hee hee hee.

1580
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:21,280


1581
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,320
The aperture was black, with a darkness almost material.

1582
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:31,440
That tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality, for it obscured such parts of the inner walls

1583
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:38,680
as ought to have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its eon-long imprisonment,

1584
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:45,400
visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbered sky, on flapping,

1585
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,160
nebulous wings.

1586
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:47,640
Hee hee hee hee.

1587
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,160
Hee hee hee hee.

1588
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,140
No equipment to flash the tammels down the hallway.

1589
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:56,280
You know, we should, uh, make a plug here for these, uh, these H. Ross Love Cra-er, I'm

1590
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,760
sorry, H. Ross Hatecraft.

1591
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,220
H. Ross Perot cards.

1592
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,420
Uh, yeah, that, uh, Dr. Hal's been reading from, uh,

1593
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,960
They tell the future of America's finances.

1594
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,460
Well, they're made by, uh, Father Joe Mama.

1595
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:07,960
Yes!

1596
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,440
That's right.

1597
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,780
Father Joe Mama, the such-and-such preacher whose stuff I've been playing on the hour

1598
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,280
of slack for the last couple of months.

1599
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,900
He's really got card making down, folks.

1600
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,640
These Lovecraft cards are, are just, uh, just, uh, just, uh, just, uh, just, uh, just, uh,

1601
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:17,880
they're great.

1602
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,660
You'll want them.

1603
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,520
They're the kind that all your boyfriends will want and all your girlfriends will secretly

1604
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:22,780
admire.

1605
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,660
So, we, we kind of take your mic like that.

1606
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,120
This is, this is what we were reading from earlier, because I noticed, uh, I noticed

1607
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,420
some cards here with some text on them on one side.

1608
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,580
Collect them, swap them, trade them.

1609
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,720
So, the, the text on these cards.

1610
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:31,800
Well, what, can you describe the pieces?

1611
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,700
What exactly are they?

1612
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,100
They are...

1613
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,480
And there's a free stick of gum in every package.

1614
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,080
From...

1615
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,400
But these are trading cards with H.P. Lovecraft, uh, on them.

1616
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,320
I can tell you where to get them.

1617
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,640
Okay, do so.

1618
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,240
Monsterwax.com.

1619
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:47,580
What?

1620
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,240
Monsterwax.com.

1621
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:54,980
Is the name of the manufacturer and producer of these H.P. Lovecraft collector trading

1622
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:55,500
cards.

1623
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:55,960
Monsterwax.com.

1624
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,880
That's Monsterwax, yo.

1625
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,380
W-A-X for you only listeners.

1626
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,460
Only listening.

1627
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,020
Nobody knows what wax is anymore.

1628
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,660
Yeah, H. Ross Hatecraft, uh, collector.

1629
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,720
Seriously, does, does anybody know what wax is anymore?

1630
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,460
Watch that stuff from the airs.

1631
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:14,300
It tastes so good.

1632
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,380
Waxy Gordon and Waxy Malone.

1633
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,420
It's not...

1634
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,480
What does anybody use wax for anymore?

1635
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:23,400
Get out of the cab, smoke in the air, wax in fridge and wipe your ears.

1636
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,060
Oh, not the kind I like to hear about.

1637
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,740
We gotta do the wax.

1638
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,100
...when everyone sits down for a quiet nap.

1639
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,440
Please, Officer Billy Gordon, remove their belts and get to good, thank you, Mike, with

1640
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:34,440


1641
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:41,240
And Mama in her kerchief and I in my cab had just settled our brains for a long winter's

1642
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:41,600
nap.

1643
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:47,560
When, out on the lawn, there was such a platter of...

1644
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:47,560


1645
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:47,560


1646
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:47,560


1647
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:47,560


1648
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:47,560


1649
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,360
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

1650
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,820
Away to the window I flew in a flash, tore open the shutters and...

1651
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,000
...threw up on the sash.

1652
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:57,200


1653
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:00,880
...threw up on the sash.

1654
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,920
Portions of the following broadcast will be objectionable to some members of the audience.

1655
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,980
Therefore, WCSB advises, solicit your discretion.

1656
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:06,380
We're sorry.

1657
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,160
We're so sorry.

1658
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,680
I didn't mean to interrupt the station show.

1659
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,980
Haven't done a bloody thing all day.

1660
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:13,500
...haven't done a bloody thing all day.

1661
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,540
But, uh, I also have to tell you that any views or opinions expressed on this program...

1662
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:17,540


1663
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,240
...are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland State University.

1664
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,440
I think this would be a good time to pause, maybe, uh...

1665
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,560
And change the, uh, underwear on that CD.

1666
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:25,220
Exactly.

1667
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:25,560
Pause that refreshes...

1668
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,960
I can't wear the same pair of underwear for more than an hour, so...

1669
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,780
...tale told by an idiot at the body of a fox.

1670
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,280
This would be a great time to change my underwear.

1671
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,880
...he did fire in the...

1672
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,840
From PR News in Washington, I'm Pat.

1673
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,060
The State Department says it doesn't believe any PR news.

1674
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:44,340
The provincial pactee of Juma Khan Ashraf Hamdar Ghani Abdullah Hamdar Balkh Balkh Balkh

1675
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:44,880
Balkh Abdullah.

1676
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:47,240
He says he will not respect PR news.

1677
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:47,520
He says he will not respect PR news.

1678
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:47,520


1679
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:47,520


1680
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,200
On Wall Street, 47th, 1668.

1681
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:55,280
The Labor Department is to announce it's writing new rules to ensure that you're listening

1682
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,800
to PR news from Washington.

1683
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:01,380
The Centers for Disease has increased the number of dangerous anthrax bacteria.

1684
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,920
About 300 people were improperly secured.

1685
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,540
They're further accused of ignoring PR news.

1686
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:15,200
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.
