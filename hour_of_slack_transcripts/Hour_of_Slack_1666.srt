1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Those innocent fun games of the hallucination generation.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,480
This is the hour of slack.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,880
Raise Bob.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,400
It's so hard.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,020
Those innocent fun games of the hallucination generation.

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:26,980
Rob.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,720
It's so hard.

8
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,040
Psychedelic circus.

9
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,740
Psychedelic circus.

10
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,220
Communications.

11
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,640
They say if you listen closely,

12
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,180
you can hear the sound of today.

13
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,340
And you can recall the best of the past.

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,380
Every note.

15
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,640
Every phrase.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,120
Every word.

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,640
This is the best.

18
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,960
This is the sound of today.

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,800
This is the sound of today.

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,780
This is the sound of today.

21
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,600
Dirk and Pappy was out planting corn last summer

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,940
and Mama was pulling clothes off the line

23
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,020
when Freckles the Chimp came screaming out the bean patch

24
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,240
with a terrible look

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,840
like someone done handed her one of them United Way pledge cards.

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,060
It's a corp scream, Freckles.

27
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,360
It come bobbing up out the fish pond

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,940
and it ain't got no eyeballs.

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,320
I run out to the field to fetch Dirk and Pappy

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,240
and we headed over to the pond

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,080
to see what all the commotion was.

32
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,040
Sure as shit, there it was,

33
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,860
just as bobbing and stinky as childbirth in July.

34
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,420
Pa figured we could rope it

35
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,140
and pull it up on the pecan tree for closer inspection,

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,460
but I tried getting at it with a stick.

37
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,720
I went out about waist deep in the pond

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,740
with a fish pole

39
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,260
and tried snagging it on the cuff of the pants.

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,920
Dirk, he worked around to the other side

41
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,620
of the pond

42
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,840
and swam over with a pointed broom handle,

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,820
but he poked it in the stomach

44
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,380
and all that gas and liquid sprayed out

45
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,380
like someone done popped a water bottle.

46
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,380
Except this one was full of piss.

47
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,240
Pa commenced to clench in his stomach

48
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,280
and puking at the pond's perimeter,

49
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,700
but Dirk and me had already invested too much pride

50
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,060
to succumb to queasiness.

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,380
Dirk poked it in the head

52
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,900
and it swung out my way.

53
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,880
I got my fishing pole through the stomach hole

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,920
and fetched it to shore.

55
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,620
Once Pa got through wiping off his mouth,

56
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,100
we took off our shirts

57
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,620
and wrapped them around our heads

58
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,740
so as we could get closer and take a look at it.

59
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,000
Just like Freckles had told us,

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,320
the corpse had both eyeballs ripped clean out the sockets,

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,320
but it also had metal rings through both nipples

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,740
and a tattoo that said Valvoline.

63
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,100
But the weirdest of all

64
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,680
was when we flopped it over on the belly side

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,020
and found three holes in the back

66
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,500
like some feathers that sucked all the blood out

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:27,920
of the poor fish.

68
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,980
We were very nervous.

69
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:28,980


70
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,120
We were scared.

71
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,120


72
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,440
We were scared.

73
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:30,440


74
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:30,440


75
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,000
Dirk figured he might have been drained out

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,120
by a pack of aliens

77
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,380
that came down in the night

78
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,520
to make crop circles,

79
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,320
but Pa, he figured it must have been

80
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,760
one of them devil cucks.

81
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,600
And that was,

82
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,120
of course,

83
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,260
the Rudy Schwartz project

84
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,480
from the remastered CD album

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,960
Salmon Day.

86
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,120
And now this.

87
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,980
what is the point?

88
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:46,660


89
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:46,660


90
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:46,660


91
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:46,660


92
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:46,660


93
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:46,660


94
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:46,660


95
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:46,820
Don't worry about it.

96
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,460
It's an animal.

97
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:47,460


98
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:47,460


99
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,580
There's a dog there right next to the door there.

100
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,420
Don't take him.

101
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,820
No shoo!

102
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:57,580
Guh!

103
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,020
It doesn't matter.

104
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,780
It doesn't matter.

105
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,000
It doesn't matter.

106
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,320
It doesn't matter.

107
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,580
It doesn't matter.

108
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,020
It doesn't matter.

109
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,220
And that was Lothar and the Hand People.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,400
Tripay!

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,760
And now this.

112
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,480
Every breath you take

113
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,240
Every move you make

114
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,000
Every mind you take

115
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,400
Every step you take

116
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,640
I'll be watching you

117
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:13,580
Every single day

118
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,800
Every word you say

119
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,400
Every game you play

120
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,000
Every night you sleep

121
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,520
Every Tuesday

122
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,980
I'll be watching you

123
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,440
I'll be watching you

124
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,640
Oh, can't you see

125
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,200
You belong to me

126
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:56,040
How my poor heart aches

127
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,000
With every step you take

128
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,140
Every move you make

129
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,640
And every vow you break

130
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,900
Every smile you make

131
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,060
Every claim you stake

132
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,400
I'll be watching you

133
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,460
I'll be watching you

134
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,280
You walk on the night

135
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,280


136
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,420
I know you don't

137
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,800
I know

138
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,780
I don't believe you

139
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:52,180
Can you even believe

140
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,960
Newscasts and news feed

141
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,840
Is that what I guess?

142
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,400
However,05% may have felt woke all morning when you turned off to the prostitute and it's just Connie, Mr. Colly and셔서ult isn't here anymore. She still needs to rest a fresh fit with a mushroom, prefer space But this is real talk instead!!!

143
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,620
Oh, can't you see?

144
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,520
That you belong to me

145
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,240
And how my poor heart, it aches

146
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,260
Every step you take

147
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,020
Every move you make

148
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,480
Every vow you break

149
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,700
Every smile you fake

150
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,940
Every claim you stake

151
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,580

152
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,220

I'll be watching you

162
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,540

glamor

184
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,460
And that was Reverend Jimmy Ryan

185
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,280
with his new collection of instrumentals.

186
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,880
And now this.

187
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,520
Ah!

188
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,020

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,560

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,760

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,340
And it makes me sick.

194
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,380
Actually, South by Southwest made me sick.

195
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,000
We had a great time at South by Southwest.

196
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,820
We had a great time at Southwest in Austin last week.

197
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,360
But I got sick.

198
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,340
We went to a big party and we were in a giant exhibit hall

199
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,880
with aliens from all over the galaxy

200
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,000
and robots, a lot of robots.

201
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,000
There were robots at the party, too.

202
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,660
It was a robot-themed party.

203
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,040
We weren't exactly there for South by Southwest.

204
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,420
We were being interviewed again

205
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,300
for that subgenius documentary movie

206
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,160
Slacking Toward Bethlehem.

207
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,000
The Working Party.

208
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,620
That was the title, I guess.

209
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,780
And, oh, I met the editor finally.

210
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,920
And got to see lots of the other folks there again.

211
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,840
Oh, and we met Nick Offerman,

212
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,600
that TV actor that's in the show Parks and Recreation.

213
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,680
It turns out he's a big subgenius scholar

214
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,460
and a devoted follower of Bob.

215
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,700
Has been for a long time.

216
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,320
And we should be getting a copy of his books

217
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,420
on woodworking, the zen of woodworking.

218
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,180
And also, hopefully, his audio book,

219
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,740
which a friend of mine said is really funny.

220
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,500
It might be just great to have parts on this show,

221
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,720
The Hour of Slack.

222
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,300
Meanwhile, Lonesome Cowboy Dave is working tonight.

223
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,420
And yet I have to crank out a damn show.

224
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,460
A damn weekly show.

225
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,960
So let's go.

226
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,100
Back to the X-Day 20,

227
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,060
which was actually, unfortunately, really,

228
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,720
the 22nd X-Day drill.

229
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,360
Now we've still got 21 X-Day coming up,

230
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,240
and it'll be the real X-Day for sure.

231
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,860
And that's late July and ending,

232
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,540
I mean, late June.

233
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,140
It starts June 28th or something

234
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,940
at Wisteria Campground in Ohio.

235
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,280
And it ends when the world ends,

236
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,300
on July 31st.

237
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,600
And it's the 25th.

238
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,180
Well, last X-Day drill,

239
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,760
we did tons of recordings.

240
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,720
And almost every day when Dr. Howell and I,

241
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,060
and whoever else was brave enough to join us,

242
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,740
ended our recordings here on Tarzan's radio station,

243
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,360
we would just walk away and leave the mics there

244
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,860
for whoever wanted to do show.

245
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,520
Well, there's podcrusters there.

246
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,060
And they did a whole bunch of show.

247
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,980
Unfortunately, they tended to cuss.

248
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,160
The boys did anyway.

249
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,340
The boys cussed so much.

250
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,360
So, in such an uncalled for way,

251
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,180
that I can't possibly run it on any of the broadcast stations.

252
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,060
So it may be on one of those all X-rated internet shows.

253
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,020
But meanwhile, I'm going to try to run a bunch of recordings

254
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,500
that were turned off.

255
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,820
I think this is really late on July 4th.

256
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,580
A kind of a countdown to the end of the world.

257
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,040
That's sort of being hosted by Reverend Anna Moll,

258
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,680
who we also saw in Austin last week.

259
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,340
And luckily,

260
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,380
none of the backpack bombs found their way

261
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,540
to their destination, which was probably us.

262
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,020
But, so here.

263
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:58,740
Let's let Anna Moll have some show for a while.

264
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,460
I forget who else is with her.

265
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,240
Maybe we'll learn while listening.

266
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,900
Uh-huh.

267
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,260
Oh, this music in the background is Spongle.

268
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,640
Just a reminder that audience participation

269
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,760
from our live studio audience here at the

270
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,700
Thuris and Urim Podcrust 20th X Day Spectacular 100th episode.

271
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,000
There is a microphone at the front of the stage.

272
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,380
If you would like to come up and say a short sentence or three,

273
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,560
you are welcome to engage.

274
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,800
Engage.

275
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,360
Do the .

276
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,080
Do the .

277
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,240
.

278
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,360
Warning!

279
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:39,940
Warning!

280
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,800
In six hours and 51 minutes,

281
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,720
the saucer arrival site will be prepared.

282
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,520
This is not a drill.

283
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,400
Warning!

284
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,720
This is not a drill.

285
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,680
.

286
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,000
.

287
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,200
This is not a drill.

288
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,020
My kazoo's really gone down, folks.

289
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,560
That was a potty mouth, Anna Moll.

290
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,100
The censorship kazoo has been censored by itself.

291
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,580
The recursive kazoo has cursed itself with .

292
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:06,580


293
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,640
Okay.

294
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,500
That sounds harsh and unwelcoming.

295
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,340
.

296
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:16,920
.

297
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,900
It could be the membrane shot or I'm just bad at it.

298
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,320
.

299
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,820
Oh, rescue kazoo has been delivered.

300
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,920
It turns out last year, remember last year when I had the bad case of the penguins

301
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,160
and that's why the UFOs didn't come?

302
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,780
They were like, oh shit, she's contagious.

303
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,700
.

304
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:45,720
I found out that when I shed my outer skin, when I molted and finally got rid of the penguins,

305
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:54,020
I hope anyway, they might flare up again, that when the beak fell off, it turned into

306
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,200
the kazoo of censorship.

307
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,460
I just haven't been able to use it.

308
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,980
I have no need to censor anybody.

309
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,440
I mean, everybody's been so nice.

310
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:03,920
.

311
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,680
.

312
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:34,960
I'm just going to go ahead and do my thing.

313
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,020
.

314
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,020


315
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,020


316
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,020


317
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,040
.

318
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,100
.

319
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:36,120
.

320
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,140
.

321
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,160
.

322
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,180
.

323
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,220
.

324
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,240
.

325
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,260
.

326
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:36,300
.

327
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,320
.

328
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,400
.

329
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,420
.

330
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:36,440
.

331
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:36,600
.

332
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,800
.

333
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:36,800


334
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:36,800


335
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:36,800


336
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:36,800


337
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:36,800


338
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:36,840
.

339
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,120
.

340
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,480

341
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,840
.

342
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,060
.

343
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,060


344
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,060


345
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,880
.

346
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,180
.

347
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,280
.

348
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,360
.

349
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,360


350
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,660
.

351
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,320
.

352
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,680
.

353
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,320
.

354
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,800
Dr. Shoggoth mask really quick.

355
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,640
What's that?

356
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,020
Oh, Dr. Shoggoth.

357
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,920
What the shit?

358
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,440
The final six hours, 48 minutes, 17 seconds.

359
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,880
Thank you for the reminder, Reverend Fanboy.

360
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,300
You're so good at this.

361
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,880
You should do this all the time.

362
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,620
Well, six hours and 48 minutes that you got.

363
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,420
I have thought about it, but con business keeps me very occupied.

364
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,680
I have to figure out how to shift that priority.

365
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,200
You're not going to have to worry about that, too.

366
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:29,620
No, well, yeah.

367
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,060
I don't know.

368
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,940
Well, what are you doing with your pleasure saucer?

369
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,060
Well, right now I'm wondering whether you mentioned, you know,

370
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,660
flatulence as a problem in an enclosed air system.

371
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,140
You didn't say it was a problem.

372
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,180
Well, it's going to be a problem.

373
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,240
I'm going to fart piano when I need it.

374
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,040
Unless you remember to...

375
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,340
Can someone please help me?

376
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:51,320
I've been looking for a fart piano, and I haven't happened to see...

377
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,840
Oh, hi.

378
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,740
When you build your own saucer, don't skimp on the HVAC, people.

379
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,460
It's the fundamental systems that make your life livable.

380
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,760
Make sure that the air, when it's recirculated,

381
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,080
at least goes through a couple filters.

382
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,200
Bring some extras.

383
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,180
You know, you've got to change them every couple of months.

384
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,100
Because that fart smell, if, you know, you don't want it to wait,

385
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,840
hey, 20 minutes later, it's back.

386
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,980
It's gone through the entire saucer.

387
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,120
This doesn't make a fart sound at all.

388
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,600
That's the worst air raid siren I've ever heard.

389
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,180
I know, right?

390
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,260
I'm so panicked, though, when I hear it.

391
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,920
That sneaks up.

392
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,580
That sneaks up behind me.

393
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,740
I'm going to duck and cover.

394
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,460
I've been trying.

395
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm a highly trained individual.

396
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,520
I can't believe the little bear carousel didn't sell.

397
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,460
I would have...

398
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,620
Oh, for the listeners at home that are not Scrum Buddies

399
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,360
or on the gold or platinum levels,

400
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,540
remember, visit the stories in your podcros at patreon.com,

401
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,400
that you guys are missing out.

402
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,140
The voices of the dead.

403
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,540
Speaking through a device

404
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,380
that may or may not contain batteries and plastic

405
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,620
and three ponies.

406
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,500
Because I think we can all agree that dead lives matter.

407
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,840
And there's going to be an awful lot of them in just a couple of hours.

408
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,320
I'm just concerned how did they get the ponies that size?

409
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,800
I've been trying for years,

410
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,380
and my shrink ray just doesn't work that good.

411
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,180
It's a fine-tuned, amazing stuff.

412
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,300
Look how happy they are, the tiny ponies.

413
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,920
How can we be that happy?

414
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,220
Well...

415
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,220
Doesn't religion bring us the keys to happiness?

416
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,340
The keys to unlocking our own craft?

417
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,740
Maybe if I skip the saucer landing and I stay on Earth,

418
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,460
I can be condemned to be encased in a cursed toy

419
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,880
and also be a voice of the dead.

420
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,280
Like that Night Gallery episode with the doll.

421
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:49,900
Here's hoping.

422
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,760
The cursed doll.

423
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,180
That one cursed...

424
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,220
It's like there's just one cursed doll.

425
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,180
You're so silly.

426
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,320
You're so silly, Reverend Babel.

427
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,060
What are you talking about?

428
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:00,960
I mean, nothing...

429
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,780
No, you said something about dolls?

430
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,700
Just the one.

431
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,640
Okay, okay.

432
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,420
So I don't have to worry about any other doll.

433
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,760
Only one cursed doll in existence

434
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,100
that is currently on the premises.

435
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,380
Well, oh, oh, oh.

436
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:13,980
Okay.

437
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,080
And running around...

438
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,640
And possibly under your chair.

439
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,680
With a tiny little knife.

440
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,960
It's actually not a small knife at all.

441
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,500
Hey, my ankle!

442
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,860
No, just kidding.

443
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,940
Just kidding.

444
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,300
Okay, so just the one cursed doll.

445
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,620
Just the one cursed doll on the premises.

446
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,120
That's all that's allowed in your...

447
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,940
My pleasure saucer.

448
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,420
Very good.

449
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,240
Right.

450
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,320
Now, remember, folks...

451
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,280
My pleasure saucer has a great view, by the way.

452
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,720
That's why it's my pleasure saucer.

453
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,060
You want to make sure that you can contain the cursed dolls when they start showing up.

454
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,840
The blood splatter wipes right off the outside.

455
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,200
You let one in through the airlock.

456
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,200
So much silicone coating.

457
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,480
Just like an aerogel.

458
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,360
It's blood-proof, bullet-proof.

459
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,080
Come at me.

460
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:54,820
Whatever.

461
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,920
Heads will be exploding all around.

462
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,700
I'll be fine.

463
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,400
I'll be laughing.

464
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,580
Indeed.

465
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,540
You know, exploded view.

466
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,180
Make sure you've got...

467
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,000
You know, when you look into the book and you see that it's an exploded view,

468
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,880
and then the blood goes everywhere.

469
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,440
It's...

470
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,640
I have a screen in front of me on my pleasure saucer, so it'll be safe.

471
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,980
Very good.

472
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,840
So, will you be able to get the close-ups, though,

473
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,040
of the people being irradiated by the saucers and starting to boil?

474
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,860
I got minion for that.

475
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,700
I honestly...

476
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,120
Okay, so earlier we were talking about the levels of the pleasure saucer.

477
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,260
And I admitted that I do have three levels already planned out.

478
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,980
But I don't talk about the other level where the minion hang out

479
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,560
because I don't really want to have to feed them for long at all.

480
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,020
There's a minion?

481
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,040
Yeah, well, they're going to take care of recording stuff for a while.

482
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,120
But then once I'm...

483
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,420
You know, they just dwindle off.

484
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,780
And I'll stop caring about the recordings.

485
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,420
But we will need server space.

486
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,140
So if anyone has an extra porn server not in use in their closet at home...

487
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,640
Wait, a porn server not in use?

488
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,060
Wait.

489
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,920
...for six hours and 43 minutes.

490
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,240
That's a tall order.

491
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,700
If you've just given up that path for the apocalypse,

492
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,320
please let us use it for some Thorosineurin podcrest storage.

493
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,360
It would be greatly appreciated for six hours and 43 minutes.

494
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,620
Now, we're just going to use hypercubes for storage after the...

495
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,460
Well, we are.

496
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,240
I actually bought into that today.

497
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,160
I invested.

498
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,780
Have you invested in the hypercube laboratories?

499
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
I hear they're expanding.

500
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,540
Yes.

501
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,880
I think it's time to get in on the ground floor.

502
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,520
On the...

503
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:29,900
Well...

504
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,440
The Tesseract.

505
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,020
I would say the stratosphere level.

506
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:33,900
Okay.

507
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,220
At least.

508
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,700
My broker didn't tell me about that.

509
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,680
Oh.

510
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,500
Oh, yeah.

511
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,740
People are at different funding...

512
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,300
Whose head's exploding now?

513
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,780
...the hypercube project.

514
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,940
I can't tell.

515
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,520
There's so many.

516
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,040
Right.

517
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,260
So many competing hypercube projects?

518
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,620
So many...

519
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,140
No, so many exploding heads.

520
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,660
It's hard to tell one from the other.

521
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:55,900
So many...

522
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,440
Thousands of exploding heads.

523
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:58,900
Thousands of exploding heads.

524
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,640
I promise to you.

525
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,120
And only...

526
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,580
As I walk past you on the way to my saucer,

527
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,680
stepping over the corpses as the heads explode.

528
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,680
That's for you did not pay your $35.

529
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,460
But you know what?

530
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,740
I hear there's still time.

531
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:12,840
Yes.

532
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,140
You got to find Stang.

533
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:14,840
Yes.

534
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,020
Go to the Stang's trailer between the hours of 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.

535
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,800
with your $35.

536
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,040
No, no.

537
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,920
It's actually 12.30 a.m.

538
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,260
I aired 12.30 a.m. to 4 a.m.

539
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,360
They can go right up the hill.

540
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,460
Knock on that door.

541
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,260
Loud.

542
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,480
Loud and hard.

543
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,320
I hear is how he likes it.

544
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:32,640
Yes.

545
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,820
And make sure that he answers.

546
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,020
Well, who doesn't?

547
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:47,380
And force the money towards the humanoid-like artificial intelligence figure that comes at you.

548
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,220
The Stangbot 5000.

549
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,820
Now accepting credit cards, debit cards, and all forms of electronic currency.

550
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,800
The Stangbot 5000 might actually throw a punch at you.

551
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,240
This is a...

552
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,320
A bug in the system.

553
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,100
A bug in the system.

554
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,060
Just duck.

555
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,700
Just duck.

556
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,980
And say the safe word.

557
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,560
Please don't hit me.

558
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,200
I'm trying to give you fucking money.

559
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,320
Right.

560
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,560
Sorry, that's a safe sentence.

561
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,980
Or money here.

562
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,340
I think that also works.

563
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,780
Are you sure it's safe?

564
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,620
It's not safe at all.

565
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,280
It's not safe at all.

566
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,880
That's not your safe.

567
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,800
No, that's where I put the other possessed doll.

568
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,220
I mean, there's only one possessed doll.

569
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,880
Doll on the site.

570
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,240
Under your chair.

571
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,040
That's right.

572
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,740
Don't look.

573
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,080
It makes him mad.

574
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,660
You don't want a mad cursed doll.

575
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,000
By the way, there's a microphone up here.

576
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,540
I see new people arriving.

577
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,500
Perhaps somebody has something else they'd like to add to.

578
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,320
Interactive.

579
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,160
Live.

580
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,140
Interactive.

581
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:49,800
Thorazine.

582
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,680
You're in Podcrust.

583
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,520
20th.

584
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,600
X-Day.

585
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,100
100th episode.

586
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,800
You're welcome to join in.

587
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,000
Is Thorazine...

588
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,220
You're in some kind of recycling project where we're trying to get the Thorazine out of the urine?

589
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,900
If somebody came up here with a lime, if they actually had a lime,

590
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,200
we would have the ingredients that we need for the secret information to be revealed by Reverend Pease.

591
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,180
So...

592
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,700
Oh, crap.

593
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,820
He doesn't even need a lime anymore.

594
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,840
I don't even need a lime anymore because this is a good story.

595
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,120
You did it.

596
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,260
You drew him out.

597
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:20,780
You drew him out.

598
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,160
When I was a psychiatric technician in the Air Force, I...

599
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,080
Somebody get him a lime.

600
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,160
Please.

601
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,560
I worked on a psychiatric unit.

602
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,220
And a lot of them...

603
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,400
A lot of the patients took a lot of Thorazine.

604
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:36,880
And sometimes when people had to be in the quiet room, if you want to call it that,

605
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,940
you'd have to provide them with a urine also that they could relieve themselves and, you know...

606
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,120
They always gave me a bucket.

607
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:55,240
So, one day, we were talking, we were joking, we realized that Thorazine-tainted urine is incredibly dank.

608
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,920
And the proof of that is, is one day...

609
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:05,780
I had a patient and I let him use the urinal and he went to go drink it because he wanted extra Thorazine, I suppose.

610
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,280
And you're not allowed to let patients do that.

611
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,000
As funny as it might be to see, you're just not allowed to do that.

612
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,300
So, I grabbed it from him and we struggled for it for a second.

613
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,200
And he looked at me and laughed and let go.

614
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:26,180
And the entire urinal of urine, the dank Thorazine urine, shot all over my face and all over my body.

615
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,800
So, when we decided to name the pod...

616
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,420
The pod crust.

617
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,340
The pod crust.

618
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:36,840
We thought of no better definition of what we wanted to do on radio than that.

619
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:43,920
Having that dank Thorazine urine poured all over you by that poor soul in the psychiatric facility.

620
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,480
Platinum listeners at home, please scratch number six.

621
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,640
So, now we know the secret of the Thorazine urine.

622
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,900
I was kidding about it being recycled.

623
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,660
But apparently, if you'll drink it, you get more Thorazine.

624
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,300
We like to think of it as upcycled.

625
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,320
Now, is it hard to get Thorazine in a mental institution?

626
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,820
Because it seems like they'd be handing them out like peanuts.

627
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,140
Actually, they give it away for free.

628
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:14,700
Golly.

629
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,680
It's like a personal pleasure saucer experience.

630
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:18,700
Wow.

631
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,000
It's a dry run.

632
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,740
I don't know if I would call it that.

633
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,200
Well, it's a damp run.

634
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,880
It's a dank run.

635
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,340
It's a damp run.

636
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,320
I can do the damp run in 300 parsecs.

637
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,880
Now, Wonder...

638
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,860
Is there Bob care after the saucers come?

639
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,920
Is that Thorazine still available and still free?

640
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,520
Well, as I said, what we're going to do is we're going to pick it up a notch.

641
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:45,480
When the saucers come, we will have a 24-hour free Thorazine podcast all the time.

642
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,480
It will be broadcast whether you want to or not to all the rest of the pleasure saucers in the fleet.

643
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,520
So, it's an add-on value.

644
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,700
I think everybody's going to be very excited about it.

645
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,800
Just imagine.

646
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,040
Just imagine.

647
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,360
24 hours of peas all the time for eternity.

648
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,260
It's exciting, right?

649
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,820
I can see...

650
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,160
Oh, this guy's crying.

651
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,120
Oh, sir.

652
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,340
Please stop having a fit.

653
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,360
It'll be wonderful.

654
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,460
And that's what the midline package.

655
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,900
You don't have to go to like the $200 a month package.

656
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,960
Again, I would like to remind you of the special subgenius ordainment opportunity tonight

657
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,780
between the hours of 1230 a.m. and 4 a.m.

658
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,420
Just go up to the big house, knock on the door, ask for Robin Stang,

659
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,840
and he will long distance ordain any loved ones who cannot be here today.

660
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,060
How much time do we have to do that?

661
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,920
We only have six hours and...

662
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,660
Yep.

663
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,680
They don't know the words.

664
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,960
36 minutes to go.

665
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,300
But more importantly, in the immediate future,

666
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,260
the time will start for the special long distance adornments at the big house

667
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,780
between 1230 and 4 a.m.

668
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,680
Starts in...

669
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,980
Exactly six minutes.

670
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,600
Pease interferes with time itself.

671
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,720
Today on the Thor's Inurin Podcrust,

672
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,040
watch him interfere with the X-Day lending time.

673
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,980
I promise not to screw it up this time.

674
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,140
You're doing it now, dude.

675
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,980
So if you're controlling time, could you like take this time

676
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,760
and stretch it out to about a thousand years?

677
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,560
I could, but I choose not to.

678
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,800
I am not your puppet.

679
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,240
I can respect that.

680
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,920
It probably seems like a thousand years.

681
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,640
It's already gone by.

682
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,400
The ramifications with adjusting,

683
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:26,980
the timeline,

684
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,140
six hours and 35 minutes before the saucer arrivals

685
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,180
would be foolhardy and foolish.

686
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,500
That you would suggest it is just mind-boggling.

687
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,620
I'm glad to see your silence, Kanemaw.

688
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,120
I'm glad to see you've hanged your head with shame

689
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,660
at even a mere suggestion.

690
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,540
It wasn't a suggestion.

691
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,360
It was actually mind-boggling.

692
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,240
I was boggled.

693
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,580
My mind was boggled.

694
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,920
Somebody's mind that I had was boggled.

695
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,220
Well, it had letters written on every side of it,

696
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,580
and I was plain boggled with it.

697
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,500
But I lost it the other day.

698
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,300
It dried up and fell off the table,

699
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,420
and then I think a dog ate it.

700
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,520
And that was Spongle in my current background.

701
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,560
And thank you, Reverend Animal

702
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,780
and the members of the sub-oxyme bloodstream podcrust

703
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,400
of 20X Day.

704
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,960
And now this.

705
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,000
Oh, wait.

706
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,280
Now I've got to do the stuff.

707
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,120
About three weeks ago,

708
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:32,320
the last live show we did was a show called

709
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,660
What Are We Forgetting to Mention?

710
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,500
And we did actually forget something,

711
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,260
something major,

712
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,660
because the show before that,

713
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,620
I had promised to read the new vocabulary words

714
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,220
invented by my sister, the Auntie C,

715
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,740
or Auntie C the Rub Genius,

716
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,060
actually it's Anti-C, the Rub Genius.

717
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,560
And I found the printout

718
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,380
of advanced dog anatomy terminology.

719
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,540
In case you ever wondered,

720
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,300
on a dog, just about any dog,

721
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,640
the straight feathers usually on the chest

722
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,820
are called fleur fleurs.

723
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,840
The swirly feathers on the chubs or elbows

724
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,720
are called fleur feulers.

725
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,380
Fleur feulers.

726
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,040
The feathers near the taint on a dog

727
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,280
are called flea fleas.

728
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,700
And the feathers in the ears are fleer fleers.

729
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,100
The aforementioned chubs,

730
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:04,400
by the way, are the meaty part of the hind leg. I call the four chubs, chubs also myself.

731
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:13,020
And finally, the sweet edible parts of the nose where it connects to the fuzzle,

732
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:22,620
that's called chufus, the chufus. And the fuzzle is what others call the muzzle.

733
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,300
So friends, now you know what to call those feathers on your dog. Thank you, Auntie C.

734
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:37,780
She's my little sister and also my neighbor. Again, this music in the background is Spongle.

735
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:47,640
Are you Spongle? That's the name of the album. Excuse me, I still have a nagging cough that

736
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,600
from where South by Southwest made me.

737
00:36:52,620 --> 00:37:02,020
Sick. I found this National Geographic article from February of last year,

738
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:13,280
which the conspiracy calls 2017. I like to think last year was 1997. Anyways, this article about

739
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:22,460
um, uh, alcohol? Yeah, 9,000 year love affair. Let's see, what did I circle?

740
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:30,060
Here. Uh, we're pre adapted for consuming alcohol.

741
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:42,020
Yeasts are diverse and ubiquitous, and they've been likely fermenting ripe wild fruit for about

742
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:48,260
120 million years, ever since the first fruits appeared on Earth. From our modern point of view,

743
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,600
ethanol has one very compelling property. It makes us feel good.

744
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:59,940
Ethanol helps release serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins in the brain, chemicals that make us happy and less anxious.

745
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:08,640
To our fruit-eating primate ancestors swinging through the trees, however, the ethanol in rotting fruit would have had three other appealing characteristics.

746
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:21,080
First, it had a strong distinctive smell that makes the fruit easy to locate. Second, it's easier to digest, allowing animals to get more of a commodity that was precious back then, calories.

747
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:27,620
Third, its antiseptic qualities repel microbes that might sicken a primate.

748
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,480
Millions of years ago, one of them developed a taste for fruit that had fallen from the

749
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:32,760
tree.

750
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:39,920
Our ape ancestors started eating fermented fruits on the forest floor and that made all

751
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,760
the difference, said Nathaniel Dominey, a biological anthropologist at Dartmouth College.

752
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,460
We're pre-adapted for consuming alcohol.

753
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:55,260
Robert Dudley, the University of California, Berkeley physiologist who first suggested

754
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,380
the idea, calls it the drunken monkey hypothesis.

755
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,980
The primates that ventured down out of the trees got access to a brand new food source.

756
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:09,040
If you can smell the alcohol and get to the fruit faster, you have an advantage.

757
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,660
You defeat the competition and get more calories, Dudley says.

758
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,120
The ones that stuffed themselves were the most likely to succeed at reproduction and

759
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,440
to win.

760
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,520
You experience a gentle rush of pleasure in the brain.

761
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,160
That buzz reinforced the appeal of the new lifestyle.

762
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,620
A truly drunken monkey, Dudley points out, would be an easy target for predators.

763
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,080
In spite of widely reported anecdotes, there's very little scientific evidence of animals

764
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,220
in the wild ever getting enough alcohol to exhibit drunken behavior.

765
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,380
A satisfied glow is more likely.

766
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:53,980
But that response to alcohol seems to be specific to humans and perhaps apes.

767
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:02,260
You could say we came out of the trees to get a beer, Benner says.

768
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,100
But the point wasn't to get drunk.

769
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,600
That would come much later, once we figured out how to make the stuff in quantity.

770
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,240
So there you go, friends.

771
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,940
There's nothing you can do about it.

772
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,740
You can't help it.

773
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,320
And, uh ... yeah ... that was an article in National Geographic.

774
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:28,760
And, uh ... what else do I need to remember that I forgot?

775
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,680
Oh, yes, you're listening to the Hour of Slack from The Church of the Subgenius.

776
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,980
I'm Price Bob, and we're here to impart Slack in whatever form we can.

777
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:46,180
And if we can't do that, what you may get instead could be confusion.

778
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,960
In fact, if you might, I think, it's only going to pop up in Africa, wrong speech?

779
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:47,960


780
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,440
Fine line for some of us.

781
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,300
But thank you, Spongrel, for this background music.

782
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,640
And now this.

783
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:39,480
I shot the barbecue pig last night.

784
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,460
I shot the barbecue pig.

785
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,180
They shot the...

786
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,620
They shot his ass.

787
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,360
It's over now, that's what I said.

788
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,200
Ah, ah, ah.

789
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,040
Ah, ah, ah.

790
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,760
I went to bed last night.

791
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,380
I woke up sad and blue.

792
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,760
They shot the poor.

793
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,840
They shot his ass.

794
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,940
They shot the poor man, I feel good.

795
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,460
Ah, ah, ah.

796
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,140
Ah, ah, ah.

797
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,320
Ah, ah, ah.

798
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:40,320


799
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,740
Ah, ah.

800
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:41,740


801
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:41,740


802
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:41,740


803
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:41,740


804
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,420
Ah.

805
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,420
Ah.

806
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,980
And that was, of course, the Rudy Schwartz project

807
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:11,740
from the remastered CD album Salmon Day.

808
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,940
And now this.

809
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,860
Do they even have boggle kits anymore?

810
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720
No, that's why I had to make my own out of some brain.

811
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,940
Oh, boggle kits.

812
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:24,600
Okay.

813
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,200
We'd like to take a few more suggestions for saucer modifications.

814
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,240
This is the last time to put your engineering specs in

815
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,520
for your own pleasure saucer.

816
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,360
As you all know, you should decide whether it's going to be a saucer built

817
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:46,660
for one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

818
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,800
I don't think.

819
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,420
There's a saucer built for ten, but there sure the hell is one for eleven.

820
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,140
And twelve.

821
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,160
Eleven.

822
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,680
There are eleven time zones in the Soviet Union.

823
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,560
Number eleven.

824
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,640
Number eleven.

825
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,860
Copyright infringement is your best entertainment value.

826
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,000
Eleven.

827
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,640
I don't know if I would call it your best value, but it's what you pay for.

828
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:12,100
I would just like to remind any members, any surviving members of Negative Land

829
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,860
that they are welcome on my pleasure saucer along with the residents.

830
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,340
Aw.

831
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,220
I've got them all.

832
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,540
I'm all ordained.

833
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,120
The kits are waiting.

834
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,840
There's still a few more copies of that bestseller tome already out.

835
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,160
Still available, aren't there, Revan Stang?

836
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,860
We'll never know.

837
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,580
Aren't there a few more copies of that Neighbor World tome

838
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:37,720
that was just made all the Pulitzer Prizes recently?

839
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,840
No, I'm afraid, dear friends, all of the Neighbor World tomes

840
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,120
that are remaining have been reserved for the Elder Gods.

841
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,800
Oh, damn it.

842
00:44:48,900 --> 00:45:00,320
They will be delivered into their hands at 7.15 a.m. in, what is it, 6.33 minutes plus another 15 minutes.

843
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,540
Speaking of Elder Gods...

844
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,660
Or else we're in big trouble.

845
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,760
Again, another revelation...

846
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,560
Don't let that worry you.

847
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,980
Another revelation on top of the many revelations we've had at this X Day.

848
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,040
I cannot remember an X Day where so much secret knowledge...

849
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,440
was bestowed upon the brethren.

850
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,740
We're revealing so much of a little worried piece.

851
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,400
Workshops by Lord Angry Lay on the nuances of surf music.

852
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,280
We should be sending them to our Patreon page.

853
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,060
If you don't know how to find Patreon...

854
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,160
Comedy Extravaganza by the Circus Apocalypse.

855
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,560
While you have time, go to our Facebook page and sign up as a like-in-us.

856
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,220
And then you can also go over to our Patreon page.

857
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,100
It is linked through that page.

858
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,560
And you can then give us funds to...

859
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:43,840
It's pronounced Petron.

860
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,540
I'll be doing that.

861
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,180
Let me pimp out my ride, yo.

862
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,160
I gots to get the drop kit and a pleasure saucer.

863
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,980
And I'm worried that my rims aren't going to be shiny enough.

864
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,980
My pleasure saucer will have spinners.

865
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,960
That's awesome, dude.

866
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,820
Diamond in the back. Sunroof up.

867
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,740
Making that scene with the gangster theme.

868
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,720
Making the spinners on the pleasure saucers.

869
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,080
I've described it earlier. It's going to be metallic green.

870
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,060
It's going to have a giant peas on the side.

871
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,060
On the back, there'll be some carrots.

872
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,160
It'll be powered by nuclear fusion.

873
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,200
The fuel of the future.

874
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,100
That's right, Bubbles. Thanks for visiting.

875
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,040
And on the back, it says safe side and suicide.

876
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,000
That's correct.

877
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:27,860
Once again.

878
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,340
I also have some mud flaps with what looks like a naked chrome lady.

879
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,200
Like a naked chrome lady.

880
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,580
And the testicles hanging off the trailer.

881
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,940
Not an actual lady made of chrome.

882
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:41,500
Which, strangely enough, is an actual portrait of a space lady.

883
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,400
Who we just never knew before now.

884
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,560
Stellar. Stellar idea.

885
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,220
I adore you.

886
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,120
Am I not allowed to say space lady?

887
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:53,400
Soon I won't need friends. I'll have my pleasure saucer.

888
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,460
I'll be cruising the galaxy after wrecking havoc on the Earth.

889
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,220
It's okay, peas. Remember? Because you only have how much time left?

890
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,640
My first mission will be to find the real ribbon staying.

891
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:07,300
And find out what kind of terrible mishaps have befallen him.

892
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,100
Peas, please tell us. How much time do we have? Seriously.

893
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:13,820
I'm concerned.

894
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:18,380
We have six hours and thirty minutes till the saucers arrive.

895
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,520
Now I'd be panicking if I hadn't set my $35.00.

896
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:27,140
Also would like to make note that the official long distance or name mint offer is now on.

897
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,880
Is that Pacific Mountain Time or Central Eastern?

898
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,060
You don't have to bother with the post office box now.

899
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,180
Time is no longer a factor.

900
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,500
Reverend Peas is here to tell us how you can deposit that $35.00.

901
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,520
And why is Greenwich so mean with this time?

902
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,780
It's such a bitch.

903
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,980
What is that potty mouth?

904
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,040
All the time zones, Greenwich.

905
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,080
What is that?

906
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:46,260
This is the children's show. What is that potty mouth for?

907
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,320
Oh yeah, kids. I forgot. Sorry. My bad.

908
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:49,900
Go to bed.

909
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,140
Terrible. Terrible, terrible, terrible.

910
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:52,740
Fuck to bed.

911
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,680
And it looks as if Dr. Shoggoth has gone into an early hibernation mode

912
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,380
in order to be more alert for tomorrow's saucer run.

913
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,260
Godspeed to you, Shoggoth. Godspeed.

914
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,120
It might be time to start the looting? What do you think?

915
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,100
We got like a little...

916
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,360
I think I almost...

917
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,480
Oh, jeez.

918
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,340
Yeah, if you haven't started looting, remember that you can send in your money now

919
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:25,820
for your looting kit 108 limited edition looting kits from the Thor's Inurium Pod Crust.

920
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,920
All numbered and individually signed.

921
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,900
Handcrafted looting kits. Get them now.

922
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,560
Don't wait. This offer is going to be going away soon.

923
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,680
Really going fast.

924
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,060
Yes.

925
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,820
It's just a smashing good idea.

926
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,440
So...

927
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,660
There'll be people rioting in the streets for our looting kits.

928
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,400
How can I get one? My children. I must save my children.

929
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,700
Give me the looting kit now.

930
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,800
And we'll say no. We'll just look down.

931
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,320
Nope. Should have gave us cash money.

932
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,880
You should have, man.

933
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,700
Why don't you have time to take care of your people with your looting kit?

934
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,880
Well, maybe they don't have time to take care of anybody but themselves.

935
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,460
But if you put your own looting kit on,

936
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,380
then you can hand looting kits to others.

937
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,440
Remember to put your own looting kit on first before you hand them to children.

938
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,180
In six hours and 27 minutes, though, it will not matter.

939
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,240
No?

940
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,600
Nope. Not at all.

941
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,780
It's hard to not be fatalistic at a time like this.

942
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,640
Unless you are.

943
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,340
Is it though?

944
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,960
An ordained subgenius, reverend pope, or doctor.

945
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,280
Is it ever hard to be not fatalistic?

946
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,000
I just look outside.

947
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,440
You know, the problem with this doomsday cult is fatalism.

948
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,540
People just don't have hope in this doomsday cult.

949
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,160
Hello. How are you doing, animal?

950
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,580
Oh, I'm nice. Fatalism. How are you doing today?

951
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,160
Oh, you know.

952
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,660
And he's like, thanks. Okay, I'm fatalistic. Okay, bye.

953
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,040
And I hear there are more options.

954
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,220
It's a many-dimensional option.

955
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,640
There's option C, option Z, options B2.

956
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,080
B6, B12.

957
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,840
Those are important. You gotta get your Bs in.

958
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:10,360
Yes. And your niacin.

959
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:10,640
Your metal Bs.

960
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,060
If you don't want birth defects.

961
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:12,520
Metal Bs.

962
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,220
Speaking of more pleasant things, who are we gonna bully into taking this microphone?

963
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,640
Because I'm getting tired.

964
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,800
Honestly, I don't think you're allowed to leave without getting your ankle slashed.

965
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,180
I wanted to just shout out to the Achilles tendons out there that are still functioning.

966
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,200
We can't move.

967
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,120
This leg is...

968
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,100
Ours have been severed.

969
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,000
This foot is so floppy now.

970
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,220
Please help us. Please send medics now.

971
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,620
I mean, I don't know what happened. I was hanging out with my possessed doll and all of a sudden...

972
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,020
I'm getting my leg.

973
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,680
...from this torturous existence.

974
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:43,380
It's just flapping around.

975
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:45,840
Yes.

976
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,560
Oh, wait. I know. I know who.

977
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,000
Who could we bully into taking this microphone?

978
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,820
I think we've already paid money to know what to think about that one.

979
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,200
Okay.

980
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:03,080
The Xs are coming. I've been told. I've been given a promise by a weird man from Texas.

981
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:08,260
He told me, he came over to me and he said if I gave him my money that I would be saved

982
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,600
by the alien creatures and I could join a special mission.

983
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:10,600


984
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:10,600


985
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:10,600


986
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:10,600


987
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:10,600


988
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:10,600


989
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,520
I'm going to be a sex cult and it would be great and I would feel funny all the time,

990
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:19,180
but not funny haha because I'm not the funny one. It was going to be awesome. It's been

991
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,960
great. I love camping. It hasn't even rained.

992
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,320
No. No. The weather's magnificent.

993
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,920
It's absolutely gorgeous out tonight.

994
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,560
So it'll be exactly like this next year, except there is no next year.

995
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,720
There's no next year. We already... We're killing time right now.

996
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,240
That's right.

997
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,300
In front of you. We've killed... We're just...

998
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,920
Time will kill so many and only...

999
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,200
Number one.

1000
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,760
Six hours, 23 minutes and 50 seconds.

1001
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:50,020
Witnesses aplenty, I would hope. Who's paid up to be a witness here at X Day?

1002
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:50,900
Can we get a witness?

1003
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,860
For the 100th episode. Spectacular.

1004
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,080
Is anybody going to approach the pulpit?

1005
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,340
Oh my gosh. I can't believe this really exists.

1006
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,720
It's a crystal Pepsi.

1007
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:07,380
Yeah. Yeah. Argus Fox. Once again, thank you. Hat tip to Argus Fox and possibly...

1008
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,040
Well done, sir.

1009
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,120
...some other deities.

1010
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:17,580
Or God murderers, as it were. Thank you for traveling through time, bringing me back the 1984 crystal Pepsi.

1011
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,480
It's still crystal Pepsi.

1012
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,800
Oh, God.

1013
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,680
And it's that first hit where the effervescence is still vital.

1014
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,220
Fizzy. So fizzy.

1015
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,600
It's so fizzy.

1016
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,220
So fizzy and clear. Couldn't see that coming.

1017
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:39,240
So why does it have to be brown? And actually, you could ask that question about so many things.

1018
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,780
But why does regular Pepsi have to be brown?

1019
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:57,480
Well, see, when you get it into the jankum chambers for an extended period of time, but people forget to put the lids down or close the outer doors, the Pepsi is no longer crystal clear and purified for the sanctioned lips of people such as myself, Annabelle, and yourself.

1020
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,000
Fanboy, Reverend.

1021
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,700
It turns brown.

1022
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,240
Praise God. Yes.

1023
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,500
It turns brown. It is still sweet and delicious.

1024
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,420
It's a common color, yet there's so many shades of brown.

1025
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,380
But it shouldn't have to exist.

1026
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,880
Visitors to the jankum chamber have learned.

1027
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,420
It shouldn't have to exist.

1028
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:21,060
No. And actually, nothing will exist, so to speak, on this here rock. It'll be scoured clean. There's talk of the molten core being exposed.

1029
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,580
Error 13013.

1030
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,060
And then it'll perhaps become the bauble of some Elder God.

1031
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,060
Doug requested it does not exist.

1032
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:36,880
Turn it into jewelry. Some rotating core of tin that is just dangling from the earlobe of some Elder God or something.

1033
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,420
I think it was nickel.

1034
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,320
Nickel?

1035
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:38,980
I think it was nickel.

1036
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,060
Not tin? Okay. I haven't been down there lately.

1037
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,060
I don't know. Down where?

1038
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,940
The core. There it's molten, spinning core.

1039
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,040
You should hang out there. I hear it's nice. I got a summer villa, you know, down at the core.

1040
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,580
A little warm, but you know.

1041
00:53:54,760 --> 00:54:03,320
I like it. It's like a personal sauna spot, you know. I get down there, I'm just like basking in the warm glow of death.

1042
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,460
Now you may have heard of the hole—

1043
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,120
Noxious fumes.

1044
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:10,060
That the Russians have bored like four miles into the earth.

1045
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,420
Occasional brimstone.

1046
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:18,300
Yes, you know what? We're friends with them now though, so it's okay. Can you please stop ruining this for us? They're giving us things.

1047
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:25,260
Right. Well, they'll let you stand at the edge of the hole they've bored four miles into the earth and listen to the unearthly screams that come out of it.

1048
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,120
Shout out to my homeboys at the Hell's Crater in Turkmenistan.

1049
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:29,700
Yes.

1050
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,140
For you, forever of glow. For you, forever aflame.

1051
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,020
The—

1052
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,460
The Hell's Crater into Hell. Turkmenistan. Don't visit it today.

1053
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,120
No. Stay well away from Turkmenistan.

1054
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:47,300
They will shoot you. Stay on the trails of capital city. Do not stray. Do not touch the buildings.

1055
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,980
You can see the displays of food.

1056
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,980
Stand on the throbbing yellow line.

1057
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,460
So nice.

1058
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,240
Deflate your shoes. Thank you.

1059
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:32,420
I heard you telling your friends how he's harmless enough. There's almost nothing you could have said that would have hurt me so much.

1060
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,100
But how to risk all you got? Oh, I'm not sure.

1061
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,100


1062
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,100


1063
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,100


1064
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,100


1065
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,100


1066
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,100


1067
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,100


1068
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,100


1069
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,100


1070
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,100


1071
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:42,860
I forget you forgot. Or you'd see that harmless is one thing. I'm most certainly not.

1072
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:53,400
It's all fool's gold, my dear. It's all fool's gold, my dear.

1073
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:59,780
It's hardly ever like you think. It's almost always like you fear.

1074
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,700
It's all fool's gold.

1075
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,000
It's all fool's gold.

1076
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:17,080
When we were young, we were dancing to a band at the rink.

1077
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:21,640
They were so far out of tune in time, they didn't even blink.

1078
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:26,520
They were the best in the world, as far as we were concerned.

1079
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:31,360
I heard them two years on. It was amazing what they learned.

1080
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:36,080
Twice as cool, twice as fast. Twice as loud, twice as long.

1081
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,880
They were at least twice as good. And that hasn't had much fun.

1082
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:50,720
It's all fool's gold, my dear. It's all fool's gold, my dear.

1083
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,480
It's not so much what you know as what you believe to be so.

1084
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,560
It's all fool's gold.

1085
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,240
It's all fool's gold.

1086
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,060
It's all fool's gold.

1087
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,640
Hey!

1088
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:32,980
I was in traffic by a man reading a book while he drives.

1089
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:38,160
He couldn't stay between the lanes. He couldn't read between the lines.

1090
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,980
So I ran him off the road. The first chance that I got.

1091
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:47,740
See, harmless is something. A little knowledge is not.

1092
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:56,360
It's all fool's gold, my dear. It's all fool's gold, my dear.

1093
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,840
Oh, sometimes the facts can make the truth disappear.

1094
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,120
It's all fool's gold.

1095
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,080
It's all fool's gold.

1096
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:17,800
I think God honored my oath and he one day struck me blind.

1097
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,280
Because I can't see the forest for the magic sometimes.

1098
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:27,120
Oh, if it nears its bliss, I'm the happiest man alive.

1099
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,740
I do so want to believe. I'm so damned up sometimes.

1100
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:36,540
I imagine politics and love, well, neither exist.

1101
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:41,360
Mistake the handshake of friendship for the age-shaking fist.

1102
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:46,160
It's like the lost Dutchman mind. It's a fictional claim.

1103
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:51,040
But we've no other choice than to be mad at that name.

1104
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,560
It's all fool's gold, my dear.

1105
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,360
It's all fool's gold, my dear.

1106
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,320
It's hardly ever like you'd think. It's almost always like you'd fear.

1107
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,660
It's all fool's gold.

1108
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,680
It's all fool's gold.

1109
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,400
Oh, it's all fool's gold.

1110
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,060
It's all fool's gold.

1111
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,360
It's all fool's gold.

1112
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:31,920
It's all fool's gold.

1113
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:39,740
It's all fool's gold.

1114
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:44,160
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1115
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,900
And that was The Rainmakers.

1116
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:57,020
I think from their album Flirting with the Universe.

1117
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,640
And now this.

1118
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,420
Oh, yes, I almost forgot.

1119
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,920
Uh, friends.

1120
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,840
Are you a subgenius minister yet?

1121
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,620
Have you joined the Church of the Subgenius?

1122
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:19,620
And by that I mean actually sent in your 35 bucks, payable by PayPal or credit card,

1123
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:26,000
on subgenius.com, where it says become an ordained minister,

1124
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,440
or where it says stores.

1125
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:34,840
And even if you have, do you have your well-made Bob t-shirt from anticonformity.com?

1126
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:38,820
Do you have your Arise DVD?

1127
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,560
Sure, you could watch it on the internet, but it's not the same.

1128
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,980
And it isn't the same.

1129
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:51,420
It hasn't been kissed by the lips of Princess Wee,

1130
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:54,040
who kisses every copy of Arise that goes out.

1131
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,680
And I sign every copy of Book of the Subgenius.

1132
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:57,700
How about that?

1133
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,440
You can still get those from us.

1134
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:04,560
But yes, the 35 bucks for the minister's pack, you really ought to think about it, folks.

1135
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:14,200
You don't have to meet any subgeniuses ever, but you will have that option.

1136
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:17,640
You can't come to X Day unless you're a member.

1137
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:23,960
You can't go to the members only kind of smarty pants internet.

1138
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:24,020


1139
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,360
I'm not going to be a member of the members only kind of smarty pants internet forum called Scrub Genius.

1140
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:30,800
I do a lot more there than on Facebook.

1141
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,880
Because Facebook's just a bunch of gimme bobs, people who can't even spell Bob's name right.

1142
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,080
Do you know that, Princess Wee?

1143
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,980
They can't even spell Bob's name right, half of them.

1144
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:39,840
They leave off the quotes.

1145
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,380
Oh yeah, gimme bobs.

1146
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:43,940
You can tell.

1147
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,920
It's so easy to tell.

1148
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:51,760
Anyway, friends, we'll be back next week with more X Day recordings,

1149
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,820
and hopefully with the lonesome cowboy.

1150
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:55,800
Hopefully he won't be lonesome next week.

1151
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:00,840
Well, thank you, good night, and praise Bob.

1152
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,960
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya.
