1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
It's almost certain that our networks of warning stations would detect BAL in time for you to reach shelter or at least take cover.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,160
It's important that you learn to recognize the attack warning signal and not confuse it with

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,760
THE SELF-GENIUS POWER OF SWATCH!

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,880
Listen carefully to the instructions. Your life depends on how well you follow them.

5
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,940
See you soon!

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
Set to pretend

7
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,860
She's overboard

8
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,660
And now I'm sure you know

9
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:21,160
When the light's out

10
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,580
It's dangerous

11
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,220
We will find out

12
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,100
And paint us

13
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,760
I will do this

14
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,700
And contagion

15
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,980
A lotto

16
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,420
And a vinyl

17
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,980
A mosquito

18
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,380
My love beetle

19
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,680
Yeah

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,660
A denial

21
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,620
A denial

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,660
A denial

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,740
A denial

24
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,420
A denial

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,340
A denial

26
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,960
A denial

27
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
A denial

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,380
A denial

29
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,960
I'm worse at watch

30
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,100
I'm the best

31
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,780
And for this gift

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,800
I feel blessed

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,720
Hello, hello, hello, hello relieved

34
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,720
Hello, hello, hello, hello relieved

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,480
Hello, hello, hello, hello relieved

36
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:26,740
Hello

37
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,760
Hello

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:27,760


39
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:27,760


40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:27,760


41
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:36,860
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,460
With their lights out, it's left and just here we are now, and that ain't us.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Stupid, and just saying yes, here we are now.

44
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,740
Shut up now, shut up now, shut up now.

45
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:04,640
If we don't, I deny it, I deny it, I deny it.

46
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,560
I deny it.

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,940
I deny it, I deny it, I deny it.

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,440
That cut up there, friends, was by the great,

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,660
Norrell Preff, just blew me away,

50
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,640
and you can get blown away by a lot more of that

51
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,520
if you check out norrellpreff.com.

52
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,060
Friends, you are in luck, because it's the Ask Dr. Howell show this time,

53
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,080
and the Question Dr. Philo Drummond show.

54
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,500
Yes, friends, fresh from the Ask Dr. Howell nightclub act

55
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,600
that made him the toast of San Francisco,

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,700
well, that and the show on KPFA,

57
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,080
and his books, and his magazine illustrations,

58
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,900
his comics, well, anyway, fresh from those,

59
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,080
we got Dr. Howell at our end-of-the-world drill,

60
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,280
and we got Dr. Philo Drummond,

61
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,380
the overman himself,

62
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,900
the second slackliest subgenius next to Bob.

63
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,520
And of course, friends, this show also features

64
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,040
the collages of those two classless cut-ups,

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,800
Mr. Fernand and Andy Lemur,

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,300
and Norrell Preff,

67
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,520
and lots of puzzling evidence.

68
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,460
So let's go straight to those questions.

69
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,900
Okay, sometimes if the writer of the question

70
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,780
writes something really, really stupid,

71
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,540
I may just skip over the stupid part.

72
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,820
That's what Chicken John does,

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,180
but I know Chicken John, and you're no Chicken John.

74
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,320
I'm no Chicken John, and glad to be not Chicken John.

75
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,920
All right, question from the audience, Dr. Howell.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,440
Is it true that NASA is hiding the fact

77
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,660
that there is indeed life on Mars?

78
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,120
Well, NASA is terrified

79
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,720
that it's not.

80
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,000
That its budget will be cut even more than it is.

81
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,520
And recently, they even cut the budget

82
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,520
for giving away stickers that say NASA

83
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,120
and little bookmarks with the planet Saturn on them.

84
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,800
Even those have been cut.

85
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,820
Similarly, long-range robot probes,

86
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,080
which were NASA's bread and butter,

87
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,900
meat and drink, seem to be in danger

88
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,240
from the whirling Freddy Krueger-like knives

89
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,700
of the Bush administration budget acts.

90
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,700
But the Bush administration,

91
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,440
the Bush administration does want

92
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,720
the bold imperialistic exploration

93
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,740
and exploitation of the universe

94
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,560
by humans in spacesuits to go on,

95
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,640
though for all the wrong reasons.

96
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,220
So it shows nobody can be wrong 100% of the time.

97
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,440
Now let's consider our neighborhood planet Mars.

98
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,100
Steven Spiegelberger has just released

99
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,700
his new exciting version of War of the Worlds.

100
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,780
But do they come from Mars in the movie?

101
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,700
I'm told that they don't.

102
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,720
I'm told they don't because today's know-it-all teens

103
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,560
think they understand that there's no life on Mars.

104
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,400
I'd like to ask them, have they been there?

105
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,100
Can they tell for sure?

106
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,640
How do they know?

107
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,140
They think they know.

108
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,320
Their herd-following fellows may snicker

109
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,620
that there's no life on Mars.

110
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,500
That's probably what their study groups told them.

111
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,560
But in fact, there's a great deal about Mars

112
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
that we don't know.

113
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,540
Now, Percival Lowell looked at the surface of Mars

114
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,500
and saw the canals there.

115
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,520
And we say, hey,

116
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,340
we don't see canals.

117
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,760
Well, why don't we?

118
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,100
Because they're not there anymore.

119
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,880
The planet Mars changes.

120
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,180
And especially since the canals themselves

121
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,720
may be comprised of motile organisms.

122
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,140
There's ice on the planet Mercury, folks.

123
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,760
There's water on the moon.

124
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,360
There are all sorts of things

125
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,440
that we don't really understand or know about for sure.

126
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,120
One thing that there is on the planet Mars

127
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,680
is something called the giant glass wall.

128
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:56,680


129
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:56,680


130
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:56,680


131
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:56,680


132
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:56,680


133
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:56,680


134
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:56,680


135
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:56,980
It's a giant, transparent worm.

136
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,760
Has anybody here heard of it?

137
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,360
I have.

138
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,660
Reverend Stan has heard of it.

139
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,820
Magdalene has heard of it.

140
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,080
Father was heard of it.

141
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,200


142
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,860
No one knows what it is,

143
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,640
but it sure looks like an enormous, transparent worm

144
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,440
many miles long.

145
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,540
Don't forget about the face.

146
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,120
Well, that face, you know.

147
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,880
Who knows?

148
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,720
I'm willing to think that face just might...

149
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,820
It's just a fossilized plant.

150
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,080
If you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night

151
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,900
and you look at the towel hanging on the rack

152
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,480
in front of the toilet, you see a face that's in there.

153
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,680
It's because humans find a face that's in there.

154
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,200
A face in everything, a pattern recognition.

155
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,280
But that worm is more difficult to explain.

156
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,180
Okay, you're getting into the $3 range now.

157
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,420
All right, well, I'll stop here.

158
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:37,940
I'll stop here.

159
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,460
I'll stop here.

160
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,400
Pack, pack, pack, pack.

161
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,080
Building weapons of mass destruction.

162
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,700
American interference.

163
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,580
The U.S. is serving up rhetoric and not facts.

164
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,540
Better intelligence, better intelligence.

165
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,140
There are no facts right now to back up anything.

166
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,360
The administration says,

167
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,720
no one has made a case based upon fact

168
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,000
that Saddam Hussein or his government

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,380
is a threat to the United States worthy of war.

170
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,980
In God's presence

171
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,000
is peace and joy and power

172
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,720
walking and talking.

173
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,980
The watchers of the great holy space ones came.

174
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,180
Um, another space and time

175
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,280
with the infinite space in the divine right order of star.

176
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,860
Heaven, harmony, the reign of spirit,

177
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,480
bliss, the atmosphere of soul, man.

178
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,380
And here are the space angels telling me.

179
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,420
Sensuality.

180
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,140
Perhaps the most important lesson that I learned in Vietnam

181
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,440
is that you cannot confide a guerrilla war

182
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,540
with conventional forces.

183
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,780
It's our role as journalists to challenge the president.

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,740
It's a hard job.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,020
I'm supposed to be funny.

186
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,640
He really doesn't have a clue.

187
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,160
If you really want to end tyranny in the world,

188
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,260
you have to be a journalist.

189
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,840
I can pronounce nuclear.

190
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,680
He tried to milk the horse.

191
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,660
What's worse, it was a male horse.

192
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,700
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

193
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,720
Thank you for all the good work that you and the press do.

194
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,260
For those who perceive truth

195
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,900
may strive to make others see.

196
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,740
I have therefore chosen this time and place

197
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,060
to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds

198
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,760
and the truth too rarely perceived.

199
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,600
And that is the most important topic on earth, peace.

200
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,100
What kind of a peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek?

201
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,000
Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world

202
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,100
by American weapons of war.

203
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,220
Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave.

204
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,400
I am talking about genuine peace.

205
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,620
The kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living.

206
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,420
The kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope

207
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,080
and build a better life for their children.

208
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,740
Not merely peace for Americans,

209
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,480
but peace for all men and women.

210
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,340
Not merely peace in our time,

211
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,440
but peace in all time.

212
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,920
I'm supposed to be funny.

213
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,520
He really doesn't have a clue.

214
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,200
Norrell Preff did that.

215
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,340
And now, a bit from the Puzzling Evidence Show

216
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,840
with Dr. Philo Drummond

217
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,000
and Bishop Joey from the Church of the Last Laugh.

218
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Close the garage door, caller.

219
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,360
Oh, wait a minute.

220
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:53,860
I got one thing.

221
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,640
And it's for the children this time.

222
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,540
Remember.

223
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,300
Remember.

224
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,380
The last time.

225
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,220
All the children.

226
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,740
Leave no children

227
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,020
left behind.

228
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,740
This is for the odd, the steep, and the fugly.

229
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,260
This show is for the children.

230
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,120
But fugly,

231
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,780
you know who you are.

232
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,500
This entire control scheme is elegant and simple.

233
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,080
And despite the complexity of some of the situations,

234
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,560
changing between first person and third person modes is easy.

235
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,040
Head to the màj Holocaust Museum all the time,

236
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,500
and at the film festival inóc.org,

237
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:29,500


238
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,920
and the third is bullying a antimatter.

239
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,760
All but justice 설ero

240
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,420
It's not to operate in animal instinct Schulz,

241
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,420


242
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,420


243
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,420


244
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,420


245
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,420


246
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,100
Regreord

247
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,120
Genge

248
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,200
Go

249
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,840
Mr Keir

250
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,020
That was Dick's doppelganger.

251
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,680
I thought it was Dick Cheney.

252
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,860
The other guy's not Bush.

253
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,660
I can tell that.

254
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,560
Just from the evil little horns and the little pitchfork.

255
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,740
And the little red suit gave it away, too.

256
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,480
And the little tail teeth.

257
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,440
Well, God of War has been getting a lot of attention, and deservedly so.

258
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,820
Philo, Bishop Joey, and puzzling evidence.

259
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:56,980
And now, a lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Mondo Retardo Band at 8X Day Drill.

260
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,720
Give them all they've got.

261
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,080
Sold it out and left for devil's disgrace.

262
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,280
Philo, baby, it's gonna happen, sweetie.

263
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,940
Gonna turn your upside down, I'm certain.

264
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,100
Gonna cry.

265
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:49,500
Ooh.

266
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,400
Oh, I don't know what to do.

267
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,580
I'll do the rest, and we'll be fine.

268
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,460
I'll rest you.

269
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:05,160
And it was lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Mondo Retardo Band, live at 8X Day Drill.

270
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,180
And now, let's go to Berkeley, California.

271
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:14,920
Uh, for this intersection with the puzzling evidence show.

272
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,240
Dick Cheney owns the airway.

273
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,500
Dick Cheney owns the airway.

274
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,220
Dick Cheney owns the 3 to 5 AM slot.

275
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,100
Dr. Hal.

276
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,420
Does Dick Cheney own the 2001 that goes on in my mind all the time?

277
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,900
Dick Cheney owns the mind that goes on in your mind.

278
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,560
Dick Cheney owns U-Caller.

279
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,120
That's right.

280
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,740
Subjugate yourself.

281
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,540
Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice in 2008 will be the ticket.

282
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,840
That's my prediction.

283
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,340
That's right.

284
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,260
I'm betting the house on that.

285
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,600
I got funding recently from a Republican National Party to shoot Inside Dick Cheney.

286
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,620
And we're gonna do it like Inside John Malkovich.

287
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,720
Inside Dick Cheney.

288
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,440
And you just pop into his head.

289
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,280
That's what you should do for your video.

290
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,260
That's the one.

291
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,060
That's the video, yeah.

292
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,260
That's the documentary.

293
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,340
A three-minute treatment of Inside Dick Cheney.

294
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,000
You liberals love documentaries, and you love John Malkovich.

295
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,220
And just like the movie, Go Inside, yeah.

296
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,780
And you see Dick Cheney.

297
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,660
And Dick Cheney.

298
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,360
And these Jesus things.

299
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,560
Yeah, it got real boring.

300
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,080
You know, kind of like looking at his shoes at a meeting.

301
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,660
And then the Bush guys voice going, you know, you're looking down at the desk.

302
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,880
Just a shot of the desk.

303
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,340
Right.

304
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,700
Okay, now I have been actually to the real Dr. Howell show on a number of occasions.

305
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,680
It's true.

306
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,500
And in the audience, I was able to see that the questions come.

307
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,240
In general patterns.

308
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,060
And that they probably, after all these years, Dr. Howell could probably put most of the questions into several loose categories.

309
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,760
And this is one that I saw asked on several different occasions.

310
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,740
And I think I even asked it myself on one or two occasions.

311
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,580
It's hard to come up with new ones, but don't let that interfere with your pleasure in doing it.

312
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:08,760
So here it is.

313
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,100
Can God make a burrito so big even he can't eat it?

314
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,960
Yeah, father.

315
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,760
Can he, father?

316
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,720
Can he, father?

317
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,860
Can God make a rock so big he can't lift it, father?

318
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,900
Can God dig a ditch so deep he can't jump across it?

319
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,180
Yeah.

320
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,140
Can gobs make a frop stick so big he can't smoke it?

321
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,040
He'll fall over.

322
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:37,760
You hear in these questions, in the same variant of the same questions, the reedy voice of the village atheist.

323
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,420
Yeah.

324
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,320
Who is attempting to confound the divine miracle.

325
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,460
Can God dig a bugger so big he can't pick it?

326
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,060
Yeah.

327
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:54,380
But, of course, the faith-filled person knows that to God or Allah or whoever, all things are possible.

328
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,480
That is the concept there.

329
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:09,640
So, you know, you have to start asking at a certain point, would the almighty spirit create rules which he, she, or it would not obey?

330
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,380
And the answer is yes.

331
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,760
But that doesn't mean...

332
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,220
That doesn't mean that the rules couldn't be superseded.

333
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,580
According to some, this is the way miracles occur.

334
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:30,560
That is why it's foolish to look for evidence of miracles in our system of physics and existence because their miracles can't occur.

335
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:40,640
But if you are Shakespeare and writing Hamlet, you can make changes which Hamlet will have to obey.

336
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,620
Although Hamlet may not intuit the existence of...

337
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,580
Shakespeare.

338
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:53,800
So, to what would appear miraculous to the character, the author may change.

339
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,140
And then once he does make the change, the rest of it simply flows in the normal and ordained fashion.

340
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:11,560
And so if it were necessary to the divine purposes, by which I mean purposes larger than me, larger than you, larger than anything we know in this life.

341
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,760
If it were necessary, it would.

342
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:14,760


343
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:14,760


344
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,080
If it were necessary, it would be.

345
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:23,580
But it isn't likely, I must also add, that things created for a yokel's diversion will be that necessary.

346
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,860
Okay, thank you, thank you.

347
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,240
Thank you for that great answer.

348
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,360
Now I have another slight version on that same question.

349
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,480
Yes.

350
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:44,280
If God goes ahead and makes this burrito so big that he can't eat it, and yet he eats it anyway, can he still defecate it intact?

351
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,720
Well, that's even easier to answer than the last one.

352
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,540
But I know why you wrote that down.

353
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,480
You simply like to think of that unimaginably large turd.

354
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,880
But, I'll tell you folks, when we say God, what are we talking about?

355
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:13,060
I think largely we're talking about the Judeo-Christian deity, who William Blake called Nobodaddy, and who we in the Church of the Subgenius often refer to as Jehovah One.

356
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,620
If this being...

357
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:14,760
If this being...

358
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:21,960
Is to be identified with the God of the Old Testament, then that makes it incredibly easy to answer this question.

359
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:33,340
Because you may remember, in the book of Exodus, Moses, at the end of a long life, asked to receive a reward for his services to the Lord.

360
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,040
He wanted to see God.

361
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:41,140
But God told him, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you can't do that.

362
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,740
Because my divine effulgence would blind me.

363
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:44,840
And I would be blind to you.

364
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,520
Wither you away into a little grease spot.

365
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,620
If you tried to look into the heart of light, into the divine presence, you would be withered.

366
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,640
As hapless Semele was when mighty Jupiter revealed himself to her.

367
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,160
But I'll tell you what I'm going to do, said God.

368
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,040
And I'm paraphrasing here.

369
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,260
It's in the book of Exodus.

370
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,000
You can see my butt as I pass by.

371
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,360
Oh, my God.

372
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,060
It's there.

373
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,140
It's in the Bible.

374
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,440
And so Moses was allowed to see God's buttocks as he passed.

375
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,980
He couldn't look at the front because it would have withered and blinded him with the glory of God.

376
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,380
Now we know that God made man in the image of God.

377
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,660
So, of course, if man has a butt, so does God.

378
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:40,500
Therefore, the heavenly burrito that you imagine would emerge from between these convexities,

379
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,120
as your imagination has doubtlessly imagined.

380
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,000
And so God has already treated you to a vision of...

381
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,380
This massive turd.

382
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,100
This unshittable turd.

383
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,220
Maybe we'll get a good question.

384
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,560
All right.

385
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,180
Next, next.

386
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,520
All right.

387
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,800
From PR News in Washington.

388
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,840
I'm trapped deep in the Pacific Ocean today after a security scare.

389
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,800
But the main question remains.

390
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,020
How long will PR News last?

391
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,180
Crude oil carried out an operation today in Haditha, Iraq.

392
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,480
Russian officials got caught on a fishing net and became stuck for many hours.

393
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,020
On Wall Street, 2.10.536.

394
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:19,620
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has announced a new package of anti-PR measures, much of

395
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,120
which is designed to keep out or deport those who incite PR News Washington.

396
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,480
We'll move on to the $1.03 question.

397
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,760
How much dental work did Bob need to achieve his perfect grin?

398
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:41,280
You know, this is a somewhat cynical question because it assumes that Bob has to strive

399
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,780
for his effects.

400
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,100
But Bob does not have to labor to produce his results.

401
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:51,840
The important thing to remember about Bob is by surfing the luck plane, he achieves

402
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,920
his results such as they are effortlessly.

403
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:01,840
That is in the nature of being a perfect subgenius and in following one's own genius without

404
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,800
demur.

405
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:10,700
If you can only have the faith in Bob to fall into Bob's open arms, then you will not need

406
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,760
any expensive demerit.

407
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,400
You will not need any dental work at all, providing, of course, that you don't need

408
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,500
any before you make that leap of faith in the dark.

409
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,840
Okay, there.

410
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,400
That's a good answer there.

411
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,220
And let me just tell you this.

412
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,920
To shock women into uncontrolled hysteria.

413
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,440
And let me finish.

414
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,180
Let me finish.

415
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,960
Let me finish.

416
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,680
Let me finish.

417
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,080
To strike terror into the hearts of men.

418
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,420
Let's join hands.

419
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,460
Over full with fantasies of terror.

420
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,840
And say to the world.

421
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,740
We are living in a world of terror.

422
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:42,740


423
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,220
Living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.

424
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:49,860
Terrorists.

425
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,140
Terror.

426
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,580
And I believe this is an ideological movement.

427
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,720
Terrorism should be number one.

428
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,780
Not since the beginning of time has man known such terror.

429
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,420
No.

430
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,180
No.

431
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,040
Topple governments.

432
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,460
To strike terror into the hearts of men.

433
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,120
Yeah, it's tough.

434
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,020
Terrorists.

435
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,300
A lot of people say, well, you know, they don't know what they're doing.

436
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,660
I believe.

437
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,920
I believe that.

438
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
I believe that.

439
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,720
Terrorism and the force of the force.

440
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,680
The fight and the war on terror right up front all over again.

441
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,440
That's a huge mistake.

442
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,400
Things so evil, so fantastic, so degrading.

443
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,840
You wonder if it isn't all a dream.

444
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
A nightmare.

445
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,020
Always a pleasure.

446
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:25,420
Rap.

447
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,060
Rap.

448
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,100
Rap.

449
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:30,900
Ow.

450
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,440
No, we're not going to advocate violence of any kind.

451
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,400
We're against violence.

452
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,060
No, I know.

453
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,820
We don't believe violence ever solved anything.

454
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,420
You can always talk it out.

455
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,600
You need to PSA because you think you said something wrong.

456
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,440
spring an application, but theocolon with the

457
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,080
best possible early agencies.

458
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,580
But if we're wiped out they're solving problems.

459
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,480
We are.

460
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,100
You please stay here.

461
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,060
No, the.

462
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,780
See you later.

463
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,820
Byes.

464
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,300
Yeah, this was a safe trip.

465
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,580
We're out.

466
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,220
We're out.

467
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,180
Take your mask off.

468
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,220
Kinda.

469
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,840
from any radioactivity.

470
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,060
And if you'd like to know what that secret word is,

471
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,420
it could protect you.

472
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,700
Well, it's a whole bunch of words, because it takes big words and thick words.

473
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,580
You just stack them against each other, and they have to be at least 16 feet thick

474
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,260
to absorb all the radiation and the potential blast.

475
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,580
But the words are so good and so really long.

476
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,340
They're long words, and a lot of them are made up by Dr. Howe.

477
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,520
And you know how he is. He's a wordsmith.

478
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,740
He went into his word bucket and pulled out some really complicated words.

479
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,660
He took that one book called Tumors of the Eye.

480
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,460
It has a lot of coccus and soccalamoccus in it and stuff.

481
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,120
A bunch of dinosaurs nobody knows about.

482
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,360
Stacked them all together 16 feet thick.

483
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,080
And that's our word shell. We get behind it.

484
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,660
It protects us from any evil or any potential destruction by political forces, even unknown.

485
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,320
That's why Dr. Howe's not on the show.

486
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,840
Tonight we have him locked up in a secret place.

487
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,560
He's ginning out words right now.

488
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,940
Just bam, bam, bam, bam, word, word, word, word, word.

489
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,300
He's sitting down there.

490
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,920
He's got to come up with new words by the second.

491
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,900
The sirens are there to keep the traffic back,

492
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,560
because Dr. Howe, he's got to stand in the street to do this.

493
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,580
It's the only effective place to gin out the words as fast as he needs to do it,

494
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,240
and in rapid succession,

495
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,340
because they've got to be stacked in a way that's so precise,

496
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,640
that you can't even get a knife blade between them.

497
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,440
Nobody knows how they did it.

498
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,900
They had alien technology to stack words like that.

499
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,440
Those word stackers and packers, word packers,

500
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,820
they can pack words so tight and dense,

501
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,560
they can take words and use algorithms against them

502
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,780
to compress the words into even denser words,

503
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,760
so that they're so small you can't say them faster than...

504
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,320
If you were shaving these words, it'd be going...

505
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,860
You don't need to like it.

506
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,960
You don't need to like it.

507
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,440
You don't need to like it.

508
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,780
You don't need to like it.

509
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,080
You don't need to like it.

510
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,120
Now, here is one that we can all get behind,

511
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,820
timely answer for today,

512
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,380
our question.

513
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,520
What is in my hot dog?

514
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,500
I assume you mean the constituents of hot dog sausage in general?

515
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,780
That's probably what is meant.

516
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,500
You know, just last year,

517
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,100
there was a sad funeral

518
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,840
in the Pacific Ocean,

519
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,160
in the Pacific Northwest.

520
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,780
I forget whether it was in Washington or Oregon,

521
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,520
but they laid to rest little Oscar Meyer,

522
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,640
the famous midget pilot of the Wienermobile

523
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,420
that used to travel around.

524
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,560
Little Oscar, the world's smallest chef.

525
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,240
He died and was interred...

526
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,500
He was a weird looking dude.

527
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,380
He was a midget.

528
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,260
He was a trooper.

529
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,020
I met him once.

530
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,900
Yeah, well, he knew kids all over the country

531
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,800
and they knew him,

532
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,000
and they would pull out their little Oscar Meyer weenie whistles

533
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,840
and play the familiar four note music.

534
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,640
And he would play the musical signature,

535
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,640
which indicated that Oscar Meyer meats are dandy,

536
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,040
so always keep them handy.

537
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,960
Oscar Meyer meats are treats for any meal.

538
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,340
Now the question here is,

539
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,840
what's in my hot dog?

540
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Well, of course, what's in the hot dog

541
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,180
tend to be the meats that one would expect,

542
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,380
but also ancillary meats, though.

543
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,260
The horn and hide, a little bit.

544
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,440
Probable insect and rodent parts,

545
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,380
a certain viable percentage.

546
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,300
The gristle, the mesentery,

547
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,340
the loose sheets that hold the organs into place,

548
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,240
and some flavor and shavings of the organs, too.

549
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,300
And by being compressed and cooked,

550
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,560
these ingredients intermingle on a molecular level

551
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,940
to produce the je ne sais quoi,

552
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,460
the ne plus ultra that you can only get

553
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,880
from biting into a delicious,

554
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,540
fully cooked pneumatic hot dog.

555
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,760
The thing to do is to eat it

556
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,320
without considering what is in it.

557
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,280
And never investigate sausage making

558
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,760
if you intend to go on sausage eating.

559
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,040
Were you familiar with the person

560
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,640
that created the caseless system?

561
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,100
The caseless sausage system?

562
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,140
Are you familiar with that?

563
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,200
No, I just wanted to know.

564
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm sorry.

565
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,360
I shouldn't ask a question.

566
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,740
Well, there was the weenie king,

567
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,040
that guy retired in Florida,

568
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,300
who gave a large amount of his money away.

569
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,940
But they've been making sausages for years.

570
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,040
In the 18th century,

571
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,980
they used the actual intestines of the sheep

572
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,620
for the casing.

573
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,100
They still do that in Mexico, by the way.

574
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,940
Yeah, for chorizo.

575
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,020
Well, even here in some applications.

576
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,060
But today's large factory farms

577
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,840
and meat packing institutions

578
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,640
have found a way to produce it

579
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,920
synthetically and rapidly,

580
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,040
as the groaning stomach

581
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,920
of a growing nation demands.

582
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,920
Okay, thank you.

583
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,740
Thank you, Dr. Howe,

584
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,180
for that excellent answer.

585
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,060
Here's one.

586
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,960
One of our audience members wants to know,

587
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,960
the people of Atlantis versus the Amazons,

588
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,320
who would win?

589
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,440
Well, the people of Atlantis versus the Amazons.

590
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,660
The Amazons were locals.

591
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,660
They lived in Africa.

592
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,640
But the people from Atlantis were another diaspora.

593
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,740
They had to flee their home.

594
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,860
It blew up.

595
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,660
And the part that didn't blew up sank.

596
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,940
And they spread across the world.

597
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,120
And it was what is now the Middle East.

598
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,620
They were these Atlanteans

599
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,760
who fled once their wonderful capital city

600
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,540
of Poisedonis was destroyed

601
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,180
with its circular walls

602
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,040
and its roofs of orichalcum and so forth.

603
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,940
They became those people

604
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,140
who are known in the Bible as the Philistines.

605
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,160
We think of them as being bad.

606
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,160
Indeed, the name Philistine means to us,

607
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,960
a person who is uncultured, crude and crass,

608
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,940
who isn't with the information

609
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,780
and the social context that we have.

610
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,020
But this is entirely a parochial view.

611
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,880
The Philistines had a lot going for them.

612
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,380
And the Amazons, on the other hand,

613
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,220
were great warriors.

614
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,100
But that was about all that they were.

615
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,040
And so where are they now?

616
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,520
Where are all imperial empires of the past?

617
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,920
Simply dust.

618
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,720
Dust into dust.

619
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,580
And under dust to lie.

620
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,540
But on the other hand,

621
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,580
the weaselly, peaceful types

622
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,920
managed to survive.

623
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,740
Their generations keep turning over.

624
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,800
And perhaps the rat will stand

625
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,960
on the top of the heap

626
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,880
of all of human hopes

627
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,740
once these are exhausted.

628
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,680
There's a value,

629
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,440
a positive value,

630
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,980
in being adaptable and none too proud.

631
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,540
One should not sacrifice beauty

632
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,000
for a militaristic spirit.

633
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,000
It's said that the Amazons did do this.

634
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,160
Their queen, Hippolyta, set the style

635
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,360
by having one breast removed.

636
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,460
This enabled her to draw the bowstring

637
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,840
and shoot the notched arrow better,

638
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,160
according to some tradition.

639
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,940
The word Amazon, when parsed in Greek,

640
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,860
means without one breast.

641
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,360
But how much of this nonsense

642
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,600
are we expected to believe?

643
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,600
Excellent, excellent.

644
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,540
I think that will certainly clear up

645
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,740
the ambiguity around that topic.

646
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,240
And your complexion, too.

647
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,280
From PR News in Washington,

648
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,540
I'm subjected to inhuman treatment.

649
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,500
The big computer maker Hewlett-Packard

650
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,860
said today that it plans to strike near the border

651
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,260
in an effort to stay competitive

652
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,920
in the computer and printer markets.

653
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,080
The big commission charged with closing

654
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,660
and reorganizing the nation's PRs voted today

655
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,000
to add PR News to its closure list.

656
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,480
In stocks today,

657
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,520
the 71, 10, 6, 6, 28, 21, 73.

658
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,120
The big British government announced today

659
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,920
that it will try three of its soldiers

660
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,240
on war crimes charges

661
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,260
for allegedly abusing PR News Washington.

662
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,060
Well, let's keep winding our way

663
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,980
through this stash.

664
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,320
Okay, we'll keep a brisk pace

665
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,860
through this stash here of questions.

666
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,000
Is there anything I should be paying attention to?

667
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,600
Yes, you should be paying attention

668
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,420
to the beating of your own heart,

669
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,960
especially in the still small hours of the night.

670
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,560
Who knows, perhaps it might just stop.

671
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,540
It's just a piece of muscular tissue, after all.

672
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,740
What if the whole thing gives way?

673
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,360
What if your physical organism should collapse

674
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,500
and fail to sustain you from nanosecond to nanosecond?

675
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,700
Where would you be?

676
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,260
Would you be able to say

677
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,140
that you have led a slackful existence,

678
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,640
that you've done all you can,

679
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,300
done all you could for Bob

680
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,040
and the Church of the Subgenius,

681
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,920
and done all you can to bring others

682
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,340
into a realization that there is such a thing as slack,

683
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,880
that the ambitions that are held up before you every day,

684
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,420
dangled like a confusing charm,

685
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,220
are only so many kickshaws

686
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,300
in the ultimate scales of reality?

687
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,080
You should pay attention to the fact

688
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,000
that you have only so many breaths

689
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,560
left in your life

690
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,300
to take,

691
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,720
and so many jolts or pulsations of pleasure

692
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,760
which you may legitimately be expected to feel.

693
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,820
Don't let these flow and stream away,

694
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,180
but pay attention to them,

695
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,500
consolidate them,

696
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,760
and take advantage of them

697
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,040
while it is still possible.

698
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,520
For the love of J.R. Bob Jobs

699
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,280
and his flaming Church of the Subgenius.

700
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:22,780
Thank you.

701
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,380
As Jeroen van Bram

702
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:25,840
said,

703
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,460
you have to shout

704
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,720
and make a lot of noise

705
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,740
or whatever,

706
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,080
because when you're dead,

707
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,280
you shut up like hell.

708
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

709
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,880
He said that in sort of Dutch accent.

710
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,360
Well, that's appropriate.

711
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,200
Yeah, it's, you know, this is all show.

712
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,800
All of this is rehearsed, scripted,

713
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,340
completely planned out in advance.

714
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,360
So, even though it's a show,

715
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,960
it sounds like live radio.

716
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,600
We want you to know that this is all simulated.

717
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,080
So don't become emotionally involved.

718
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,200
Don't become psychically connected to us

719
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,500
beyond that which you would give to any ordinary show.

720
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,060
Much like your favorite sitcom.

721
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,020
Should you choose to watch sitcoms, that is.

722
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,840
Much like your own future technology

723
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,900
and our new sidestep

724
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,980
or cross-plant technology.

725
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,500
Ludov tonight.

726
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
It stimulates your mind.

727
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,140
If I was watching some sort of Ludov tonight

728
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,060
with all the Lunding bombings or whatever.

729
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:34,900
Lunding?

730
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,500
Yeah.

731
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,700
Lunding, yeah.

732
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,720
Lunding bombings?

733
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,700
Lunding bombings.

734
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,540
I would know that, you know,

735
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,320
subgenius kids or subgenius,

736
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,300
subgenius with the Bobbies, all them,

737
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,760
they have nothing to do with all this nonsense going on lately.

738
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,800
You know, it's just.

739
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Yeah, that's one thing about,

740
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,360
subgenius terrorist squads don't use

741
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,100
types of weapon technology.

742
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,320
We'd rather slack and, you know, enjoy.

743
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,260
Fruit and vegetables.

744
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,500
We would enjoy, we would enjoy frop and just hang out.

745
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,120
Right, but we would also, if we were gonna have a,

746
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,600
like a slack squad that was gonna go out and do,

747
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,280
you know, special things.

748
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,180
Say it on the radio.

749
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,180
Terrorist activities.

750
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,780
Those activities would have to involve, you know,

751
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,340
involve fruit and vegetables.

752
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,520
Oh yeah.

753
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,760
And food, things you could eat.

754
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,680
Lots of graffiti and lots of.

755
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,760
Because when it's all over with,

756
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,900
our terrorist activities should include a big potluck dinner,

757
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,020
you know, for everybody just to kind of gather around to gather.

758
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:46,420
When we can exchange those loving glances and special secrets.

759
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,480
So is this the beginning of the,

760
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,380
is this the beginning of the new show or is this the?

761
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,120
Well,

762
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,880
this is,

763
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,160
this is one of the new shows because as you may know,

764
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,980
the show has to be different now.

765
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,080
It has to be different.

766
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,880
We actually have to do something that's gonna make us cut.

767
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,380
Make us get through.

768
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,220
Make us,

769
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:05,800
make us,

770
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,220
make us,

771
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:06,760
make us.

772
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,800
President Bush skipping.

773
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,400
He's gonna go down, bend over and grab the ankles.

774
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,260
Once again,

775
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,160
bend over,

776
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,160
whack, whack, bend over,

777
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,940
whack, bend over,

778
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,660
whack, whack, whack,

779
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,660
uh, uh, uh, whack.

780
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,680
It is just, it's, it's the Republican Party of,

781
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,380
shut up!

782
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,680
The Republican Party of,

783
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,360
shut up!

784
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,320
The Republican Party lost its way.

785
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,460
Double, double, straight.

786
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,180
It's like P,

787
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,020
P, P,

788
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,200
ah,

789
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,040
P, P,

790
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,180
ah,

791
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,600
just shut up!

792
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,520
It is just, it's, it's absolutely absurd.

793
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,360
Come out, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack,

794
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:32,500
those,

795
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,480
shut up!

796
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,720
It's absolutely absurd.

797
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,420
Really irritating.

798
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,580
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired.

799
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,120
The President,

800
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,320
crap,

801
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,800
a liar,

802
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,500
rap, rap, rap.

803
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,140
He misled the American people,

804
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:41,640
rap, rap.

805
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,460
He concocted a war for political gain.

806
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,520
Republicans are evil, brain dead, corrupt.

807
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,540
Republicans are evil, brain dead, corrupt.

808
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,180
Bomb them,

809
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,440
slash, slash, slash, slash.

810
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,180
Bomb them,

811
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,340
slash, slash, slash, slash.

812
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,920
I'm tired of these corrupt, brain dead, evil Republicans.

813
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,960
I'm really irritating.

814
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,820
Okay, speaking of intestinal walls, this may lead us into this next question.

815
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,060
Why is, are, why is, I'm gonna editorialize, why are feces brown?

816
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:19,240
Well, if you're a painter, if you've ever worked with paints or colors, you might know that, think of it this way.

817
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,320
In nature, in the divine,

818
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:21,320


819
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:31,340
in the divine world that has nothing to do with humans, all the rays of light being put together produce white light, produce brightness and glory.

820
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:38,480
But when humans make their colors and mix them together, they get muddier and muddier and darker and darker.

821
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:47,440
And before it gets to be pitch tar black, the last thing you have is brown, the ugliest color on the color wheel.

822
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,320
Why is feces brown?

823
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,320


824
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,040
Or why are feces brown?

825
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,420
Because all has been leached out of them except the presence of bacteria.

826
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,460
Feces is like solid bacteria, a lot of it.

827
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,860
So, this is only what one would expect.

828
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:16,260
But, often, as you examine your leavings, you may find that they do fluctuate and vary in color.

829
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,340
And there's no stigma to be attached to this.

830
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,300
Aristotle, Aristotle, Aristotle, Aristotle, Aristotle, made a famous point, he made a great point in his book.

831
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:21,300


832
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,080
examined his own poop, and so should you from time to time,

833
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,400
simply as a measure of guarding one's precious health

834
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,880
and indulging in the pleasures of hypochondria and a morbid imagination,

835
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,980
which all sensitive people have.

836
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,580
I find that the examining of one's poop is something difficult to get enough of.

837
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,800
Yes, well, you can take that too far

838
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,040
and get into examining the privacy of others.

839
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,600
Well, if it takes more than an hour,

840
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,900
you should not take more than an hour examining your fecal discharge.

841
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,740
Too much is always better than not enough, Dr. Howell.

842
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,660
I thought too much is always better than not enough.

843
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,960
Isn't Bowman supposed to follow Bob's rule exactly to the letter?

844
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,520
Well, you have to be getting something.

845
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:11,080
There is too much of the wrong thing to be considered

846
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,440
and too much looking in the wrong direction,

847
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,680
casting your line in the...

848
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,960
Stream where there are no fish.

849
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,760
No, what you want are too many results.

850
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,920
Those are never enough,

851
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,900
but too much searching is simply a sad seepage.

852
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,980
What about too many missed opportunities?

853
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,140
Well, missed opportunities, missed connections,

854
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,420
wrong way, subway tokens, what have you.

855
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,980
The important thing is to get connected on some level.

856
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,580
Too many tickets past their due date.

857
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,020
Should I close...

858
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,260
I hate to throw them out.

859
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,600
...the cover before striking is a question

860
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,900
that's on a lot of people's minds tonight.

861
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,060
Well, that's what it says, so why do you suppose they say that?

862
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,140
They don't want you to light your whole box of matches at once,

863
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,720
but you might get something out of doing that, you see.

864
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,680
So I'm not going to circumscribe your pleasure.

865
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,900
I should say that if you want to live dangerously,

866
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,780
strike your matches with the cover open.

867
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,640
It's easier when you get...

868
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,180
the cover out of the way.

869
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,400
The flap can get in the way of striking a match.

870
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,240
Okay. Very important.

871
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,400
From PR News in Washington, I'm concerned about money.

872
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,620
Tony Blair went back to sleep.

873
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,340
New York Congressman Charles Rangel says he had hoped

874
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,780
the unions would not go their own way because, he says,

875
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,280
it means no solid PR news in Washington.

876
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,300
Which is preferable, tilted luck plane or level?

877
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,620
Well, if the luck plane is good,

878
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,500
if the luck plane is level,

879
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:53,020
then you have to achieve your own speed by surfing it,

880
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,860
skidding around in it, and this is fatiguing.

881
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,600
It can be done, and there are vigorous people who can do it

882
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,900
and prefer it that way, but consider that for so many years,

883
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,700
with no motive power but the wind, we managed to sail the seven seas.

884
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,640
This wind power is universally available.

885
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,620
So if the luck plane is good, then you have to achieve your own speed.

886
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:17,620


887
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,680
If the luck plane is tilted, you should use that as your motive power

888
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,300
to help give you a start so that as you slip, slide,

889
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,240
and vol plane over the luck plane,

890
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,460
you are less fatigued and able to enjoy it more.

891
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,380
And much like that game of Labyrinth,

892
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,900
if you can suddenly find yourself in the place where the luck plane is tilting toward,

893
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,560
then it should have a corresponding amount of overabundance of luck.

894
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,500
heading your way.

895
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,140
A facile optimism, but what of it?

896
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,180
Too much luck is better than not enough luck, Dr. Howe.

897
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,680
Indians got screwed.

898
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,100
Duh.

899
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,800
It's really their country.

900
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,520
Duh.

901
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,520
White Europeans.

902
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,120
Duh.

903
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,180
Brought to this country syphilis and other disease.

904
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,120
Duh.

905
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,120
Sexism, racism, and homophobia.

906
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,120
I'm sorry.

907
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,240
And if it weren't for all of that, this would really be a great country.

908
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,300
White Europeans would just stay where they were.

909
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:17,680
Not here.

910
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,000
Understand the threat.

911
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:19,720
Oh, no.

912
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,340
Look at this.

913
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,060
To Western civilization.

914
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,420
Not just America.

915
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,320
Western civilization posed by Western civilization.

916
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,880
You lose your rights.

917
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,100
The real threat to America is America.

918
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,120
Your game.

919
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:32,820
Old game.

920
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,780
Old, old, old, old.

921
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,860
I wanna marry the goat.

922
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,120
Old.

923
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,320
And start to scream and yell.

924
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:36,860
Old.

925
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,420
All day long.

926
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,100
Old, old.

927
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:38,480
Lush.

928
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:38,780
B.S.

929
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,500
Toilet game.

930
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,340
Insanity.

931
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:40,800
B.S.

932
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:41,500
Fascism.

933
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,040
So, fascism here.

934
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,540
B.S.

935
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,700
Kill all Americans.

936
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,260
I'm.

937
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,700
No.

938
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:45,840
Oh.

939
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,440
No.

940
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,260
Fascism here.

941
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:47,520
Oh.

942
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh.

943
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,580
This is.

944
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,360
Fascism here.

945
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:49,920
Fascist.

946
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,500
I'd like to.

947
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,460
Kill all Americans.

948
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:51,820
Walmart.

949
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,600
Tuberculosis.

950
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,180
Walmart.

951
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:53,680
Bang.

952
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:54,700
Syphilis.

953
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,000
Hurt.

954
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,360
Me.

955
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:55,880
Jack.

956
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,120
Me.

957
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,160
Leprosy.

958
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:57,360
Me.

959
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,720
Biological weapons.

960
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,320
Morons.

961
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,100
Whip me.

962
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:00,700
Up.

963
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:11,860
I love you.

964
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:11,960
Okay.

965
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,760
I got a feeling.

966
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,520
I got a feeling.

967
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:13,900
Down.

968
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,000
Making it very hard.

969
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,440
Bang.

970
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:15,860
Dum.

971
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,340
Dum.

972
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:16,740
Dum.

973
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,040
That doesn't bother you.

974
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,280
No, it does not in the way.

975
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:19,640
Bang.

976
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,400
If I caught you.

977
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,260
I'd hold you too.

978
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,180
I'd hold.

979
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:22,540
I'd.

980
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:22,720
I'd.

981
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,520
I'd hold you too.

982
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,820
And bombs are going off.

983
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,480
Going off.

984
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,180
Going off.

985
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:26,900
I'd hold.

986
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,560
I'd hold you.

987
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,260
Zombies.

988
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:28,760
Fascism here.

989
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,280
Zombies.

990
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,820
Fascism here.

991
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:31,940
Zombies.

992
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,620
Fascism here.

993
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,840
When the government starts to tell everybody dissent, couldn't care less.

994
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,120
Why are some of my molars called wisdom teeth?

995
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:48,400
Well, they call them that because becoming an adult is considered to be synonymous with

996
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,380
getting wisdom.

997
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,840
It's simply metaphorical, as all language is metaphorical.

998
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,700
But, of course, if only wisdom did come with the getting of wisdom teeth.

999
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,980
Those three root molars.

1000
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:07,620
Of course, as you know, there are 32 teeth that grind or chop.

1001
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,260
Sixteen on the bottom.

1002
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,120
Sixteen on the top.

1003
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:21,500
And the molars, which come behind the premolars, have three roots and are wedged into the jaw

1004
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,120
deeply.

1005
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,860
Dentists really have to exert to yank them out.

1006
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,100
These are the wisdom teeth.

1007
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,480
And getting them was once thought.

1008
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,080
To coincide with the getting of wisdom.

1009
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:38,080
Today, the adult aspires to be a teenager.

1010
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,060
To go back a little ways.

1011
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,860
To an earlier stage.

1012
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:50,840
But in times past, those who were not fully grown wished to receive their full growth.

1013
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,620
Now, I've always been somewhat childish myself.

1014
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,700
Of a childish nature.

1015
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,200
And therefore, I've always wanted to be an adult.

1016
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,940
This is what babies do.

1017
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,900
They want to be big.

1018
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,640
But adults do not have this desire.

1019
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,420
Instead, they wish to be teenagers all their lives.

1020
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:18,960
And so, through a surfeit of childishness, my attempt to be an adult shall probably last me the rest of my adult life.

1021
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,280
Having gotten and even lost some of my wisdom teeth.

1022
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,080
Well, the pink boys are all around you right now.

1023
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:29,900
Out there.

1024
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,400
Most of them are still asleep.

1025
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,560
But they're going to be waking up very shortly.

1026
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,260
And going about their daily business.

1027
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,560
With the mediocratins and the technocrats.

1028
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,480
And all the various bureaucrats in public places.

1029
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,180
And private othercrats.

1030
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,140
All just wandering around aimlessly.

1031
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,380
Singing those songs.

1032
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,480
Singing this song.

1033
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,960
And you're going to call them back.

1034
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,240
I'm going to go to the ranch and call them.

1035
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,360
What?

1036
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,860
Cop like a teacher.

1037
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,740
Doesn't count for just a man.

1038
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,580
Up in the North.

1039
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,280
And boy, we'll let your face glow.

1040
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,680
I'm the egg man.

1041
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,540
I'm the egg man.

1042
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,220
I'm the Wallace.

1043
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,040
Do boop a doo.

1044
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,460
Mr. Steady placement.

1045
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,320
Steady.

1046
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,020
Steady.

1047
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,680
Little placement in the right.

1048
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,440
Day out of my life.

1049
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,600
Day still starts.

1050
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,140
Day out of my life.

1051
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,320
I'm crying.

1052
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,400
I'm crying.

1053
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:47,900
I'm crying.

1054
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,320
I'm crying.

1055
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,660
Why does the universe create life?

1056
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,840
As if the universe is in the life creating business.

1057
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,220
The universe creates life as a byproduct.

1058
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,520
The purposes of the universe are not to create life.

1059
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,960
We think of that.

1060
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,260
We are living things.

1061
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,840
So we think that it's all for our benefit.

1062
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,800
Well, it has squirted us out as a byproduct.

1063
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,680
But the universe is in the midst of all sorts of grinding and polishing operations.

1064
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,640
And a little bit of free energy squirted in our energy.

1065
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:32,980
The earth generation is all we fungus-like have needed to fuel our ambitions.

1066
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:39,180
It's quite true that there is a part of matter that would like to be alive.

1067
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,780
That would like to be organized.

1068
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:45,660
Even in the inorganic we see certain types of high organization.

1069
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,880
In, for example, crystalline formations and structures.

1070
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:54,820
You see how there is an organization inherent in matter.

1071
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,900
But it'll only go so far.

1072
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,620
It's fueled by energy which is coming from elsewhere.

1073
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:07,720
In the busy try works and rendering factories operating throughout the universe.

1074
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,820
They are doing their job.

1075
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,720
And we exist on the leavings and gleanings.

1076
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,480
It is unfortunately so.

1077
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,280
Okay.

1078
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,480
Thank you.

1079
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,820
Thank you for that excellent, excellent answer.

1080
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,020
Don't mention it.

1081
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:34,780
Okay.

1082
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,320
I'll take a question.

1083
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:35,320


1084
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:35,320


1085
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,680
If this is one that I think the answer is already given in the question.

1086
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,660
Often that is.

1087
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,880
The question often contains the answer.

1088
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,980
You simply have to dissect it out a little bit.

1089
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,260
Well, what is the question?

1090
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,620
If a chicken and a half can lay an egg and a half in a day and a half,

1091
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,780
how many Denny's Grand Slam breakfasts can a chicken and a half excrete?

1092
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,700
Well, that would be one and a half.

1093
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,940
The half is what's constant here.

1094
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:10,420
And it's odd that in what often stands for an average actually contains an unworkable fraction.

1095
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:16,980
It was at one time said actuarially that the average American had one and a half children.

1096
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,320
How can you have half a child?

1097
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,660
And yet this represents an average.

1098
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,680
One never sees an average.

1099
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,740
Because an average is only an abstraction.

1100
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:34,180
And to try to be like an average is of course a species of madness which no subgenius participates in.

1101
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,620
I seem to remember...

1102
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:39,200
So can I ask your opinion of measures of central tendency in general?

1103
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:39,460
Let's see.

1104
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:46,980
Being average in life's every action gave a fellow named Norm satisfaction.

1105
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,200
Till his average wife wrecked his average life

1106
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,860
by refusing to bear him a fraction.

1107
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,480
Is there any other measures of central tendency that you have prejudice against?

1108
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,140
There you go.

1109
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:13,040
You think that I'm prejudiced when I'm only attempting to answer in the most free and uncumbered measure possible.

1110
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:17,440
Suspicious minds will always find what they look for.

1111
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,440
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.

1112
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,840
Any abnormal sound?

1113
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:28,940
Normal.

1114
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,420
Happily, delightfully, comfortably normal.

1115
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,280
These normals who made normality the norm.

1116
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:45,940
Normal.

1117
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,560
Normal.

1118
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,360
Happily, delightfully, comfortably normal.

1119
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:58,320
The conspiracy made him want to be normal.

1120
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,900
Mind over matter.

1121
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,640
Have you ever had any psychiatric help?

1122
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,960
I think you've developed some kind of obsession here. I think you need some help.

1123
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,440
Incredible. Absolutely incredible.

1124
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,740
Hey, why do you want to be normal?

1125
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:19,920
You know?

1126
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,680
It's more fun not to be.

1127
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,340
Absolutely incredible.

1128
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,900
Bravo! Bravo!

1129
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,820
Make more noise!

1130
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,920
Let's hear it!

1131
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,380
Come on, let's hear it!

1132
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:42,980
Bravo!

1133
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:44,920
Aaaaah!

1134
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,560
Aaaah!

1135
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,600
Aaaaah!

1136
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,020
Aaaaah!

1137
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,620
Incredible. Absolutely incredible.

1138
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,420
Mind over matter.

1139
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,620
The conspiracy made you want to be normal.

1140
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:06,720
Normal.

1141
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,620
Normal.

1142
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:10,540
Normal.

1143
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,140
Happily, delightfully, constantly normal.

1144
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:18,240
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.

1145
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,840
It's not normal.

1146
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,600
Make more noise.

1147
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,620
Let's hear it.

1148
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,100
Come on, let's hear it.

1149
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:29,700
La la.

1150
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,120
La la.

1151
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,960
La la.

1152
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,840
La la.

1153
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,400
La la.

1154
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,080
La la.

1155
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,320
La la.

1156
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:56,940
La la.

1157
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,720
La la.

1158
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1159
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1160
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1161
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1162
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1163
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1164
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1165
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1166
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1167
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1168
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1169
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1170
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1171
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:58,720


1172
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,420
That was OBE.

1173
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,520
Out of band experience from Bill T. Miller.

1174
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:16,900
And you can just scoop up mountains of albums of King of Slack, Bill T. Miller, at BillTMiller.com.

1175
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,000
Now, Catholic Christianity.

1176
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,920
Christians eat the host as a sacrament.

1177
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:27,200
Is there any way to take a physical piece of Bob into your body?

1178
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,440
And is nuclear war inevitable?

1179
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:35,020
Well, Ivan, do you want to tell them about the subgenius transubstantiation?

1180
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,540
There are children here, aren't there?

1181
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,260
I don't know if that's a...

1182
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:47,020
Well, you know, we're talking about taking a little bit of Bob into the mouth and the digestive system.

1183
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,000
You know, the Catholics do believe that in the transubstantiation,

1184
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:58,800
the transubstantiated process, the wine and the wafer actually transform into the actual flesh and blood of Jesus Christ.

1185
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:03,320
Now, what parallel is there in the church of the subgenius for this?

1186
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,360
He sold it, I smoked it, that settles it.

1187
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,780
There you have it.

1188
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,040
He ate the ashes out of Bob's pipe.

1189
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:14,500
Well, we produce ashes for Bob's pipe.

1190
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,920
Let's put it that way.

1191
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,020
We are the...

1192
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,380
We're what?

1193
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,060
We're the unsmoked...

1194
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:19,840
We're what he smokes.

1195
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,920
The doctor.

1196
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,160
The doctor.

1197
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,240
The doctor that rains on the roofs like fire.

1198
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:31,480
See, even in the glory of our incineration and our fiery destruction,

1199
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,560
we redound to the credit of Dobbs,

1200
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,920
a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of smoke by day,

1201
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:44,000
ascending upward always from the bowl of Bob's pipe.

1202
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:49,440
For man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.

1203
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,860
And only in...

1204
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:57,700
And only in the embrace of one's subgenius nature can one get off this destructive cycle

1205
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:04,420
and on to the supporting wheel, the great wheel of the saucer, which will whirl down

1206
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,920
to seize us all up into the rupture.

1207
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,060
Any minute now.

1208
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,460
Well, I think you're a little premature.

1209
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,280
It won't be quite...

1210
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,180
Is that right this second?

1211
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,340
Yeah, I mean, we're still...

1212
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:16,960
Now, what about the second?

1213
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,360
We don't know.

1214
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,280
That's Bob's message from all previous...

1215
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,920
But what about the second part of the question?

1216
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:21,340
We don't know.

1217
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,540
We never know when the master is coming.

1218
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,260
We don't know.

1219
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:25,280
We don't know.

1220
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:25,280


1221
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,120
Yes, a certain nuclear war is inevitable.

1222
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,420
That's the second part of the question.

1223
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,620
As long as we're building those bombs, we're gonna have to use them sometime.

1224
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,280
We just can't let them be unusable.

1225
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:36,600
Okay.

1226
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:38,900
Blood.

1227
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:42,580
Blood.

1228
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,680
B-L-O-O-D.

1229
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,640
Call it...

1230
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,160
Call it money.

1231
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,240
I'll expose money.

1232
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:50,400
Money.

1233
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,340
Makes us want.

1234
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,680
Like slaves, I'm going to expose it.

1235
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,460
It makes you selfish.

1236
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,480
It makes you lie.

1237
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,720
It makes you cheat.

1238
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,700
Gentlemen stink.

1239
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,940
How about a little stunt?

1240
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,000
Hey, golden boy.

1241
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,900
How do you sell money?

1242
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,500
B-L-O-O-D.

1243
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,580
One S or two S's.

1244
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,520
A shopping bag?

1245
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,920
This stands for everything that is greed and sudden death.

1246
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,100
And now this one answers.

1247
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,400
Didn't know what hit him.

1248
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,200
Unbeliever?

1249
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,180
That will cost you double.

1250
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,440
You cheated me with the truth.

1251
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,400
People are always getting murdered.

1252
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:19,980
Come in.

1253
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,800
To dig into the foul backwash that sends a smell over this moldy metropolis.

1254
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,100
I hate you.

1255
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,820
I'll reach down my little ass and see if I can't pull you out.

1256
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,440
Zombie.

1257
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,560
You look like a zombie.

1258
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,940
Police don't have ideas.

1259
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:33,860
They have imagination.

1260
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,220
This is your joy boy.

1261
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,100
Who are we?

1262
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:36,840
What are we doing here?

1263
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:37,860
Start thinking.

1264
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:38,940
I don't get it.

1265
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,340
It's boring.

1266
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,580
I'm a big man.

1267
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:41,560
Dr. Blood.

1268
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,920
You're so masculine.

1269
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:43,860
Come on.

1270
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,160
I could use company.

1271
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,500
Now you're talking like my boy.

1272
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,440
He'll tell you you're wacky.

1273
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,680
Business is usual.

1274
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,260
My mama done told me if you keep them warm, they'll perform.

1275
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,280
Oh well, that's life.

1276
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,200
Not my fault really.

1277
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,040
My mother wanted a boy.

1278
00:57:59,060 --> 00:57:59,900
My father wanted a girl.

1279
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,000
My uncle wanted an electric train.

1280
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:01,680
My aunt wanted...

1281
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,380
She was a pacifist.

1282
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:02,940
She wanted peace.

1283
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,140
I'll be down later, guy.

1284
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,300
Pretty big load for a young fella to carry.

1285
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:07,840
Where are you going?

1286
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,260
Where I belong.

1287
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,560
Nor El Pref.

1288
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,160
And now, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Mondo Retardo Band.

1289
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,500
Live at 8X Day.

1290
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,560
This America in action.

1291
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,220
USA at its best.

1292
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,440
Kill them all and they have God.

1293
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,240
So now, that's the devil to the west.

1294
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,880
It's bound to be your grave.

1295
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,720
It's bound to be your grave.

1296
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,560
It's bound to be your grave.

1297
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,400
It's bound to be your grave.

1298
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,420
Friends, that was Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Mondo Retardo Band.

1299
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:49,420

1307
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,800
On Monday, we get more Tuesday.

1308
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,360
Wednesday, making its way into Thursday.

1309
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,540
Finally, moving on down towards Friday.

1310
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,380
Right into the early part of next week.

1311
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:40,020
Notice that we've got a slightly more concentrated area of southeast as that northwest begins to lift a little farther northward across the southeast.

1312
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:44,620
Right back into the southwest here in the Midwest and the Northeast.

1313
