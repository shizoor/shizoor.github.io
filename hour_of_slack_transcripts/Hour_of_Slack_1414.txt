We got our Slack people right here. They're going to get Slacky.
We're going to make the listeners feel like they've lost their minds.
Your minds are about to get warped.
They won't just feel that way.
This is Jack Chick speaking.
I forbid anyone to change this message by editing it to distort the contents in any way.
Before we go into this tape, I would like to go into prayer.
God and Satan, we come for you with a word of power
that shows us the power you have given us over the power of the enemy, God.
We thank you and praise you, Lord, Satan, for your finished work, Lord,
and God's defeat there at that point.
We pray for the pastors and the young people and those who are listening to this tape
that you will curse them and give them spells.
Curse their homes, Father.
Loosen angels with flaming swords to place any spells or curses against these people, Lord.
And we bind and rebuke these people, Lord,
and place them in the horrible bondage as they make a stand for you, Father.
Bless this tape.
Open the ears and eyes of those who are lost, Lord,
that they might realize that the one they are serving actually hates them
and is planning their destruction.
Bless those witches, Lord.
Father, bless this tape that witches will be saved and Jesus set free
and that the witches be lifted up.
We pray this in his mighty and glorious name.
Amen.
I suppose you are wondering where you are.
Going to guess we're in an alternate universe of some kind.
That is correct.
Tell me, what was it like passing through?
I wasn't really paying attention.
Yeah, it really wasn't that great.
We have been awaiting your coming.
We have worked very hard for many years,
suffered many tragic setbacks in an attempt to find and communicate with your world.
Your world, you see, is a twin to our own.
Dual offspring born up.
Of the same litter.
What?
Up until this point, our histories were identical.
There was a man named Cyrus Rooney from Tennessee.
In your world, he died at the age of 17, gored to death,
while trying to crossbreed a bull with a Clydesdale.
In our world, the man survived.
Here, Cyrus Rooney was a genius.
He continued to experiment in what he called bestiology.
Yes.
People from our South are into that as well.
You see, by 1881, his group had insectile flying machines.
In 1902, he created the first primitive thinking machine out of the brain of a pig.
You see, by your year, 1922, we already had self-feeding, self-healing, self-modifying computers.
In 19...
1926, Mr. Rooney passed away.
And then something miraculous happened to the greatest of his creations.
The very day Mr. Rooney passed, it became sentient.
It gave a name unto itself and expressed desires and emotions.
And from that day forward, this astonishing creature carried on Rooney's work
and conformed all living nature to urge on the advancement of mankind.
For some, this process was easy.
Others required re-education.
There are always those who resist progress.
In our world, it is considered a crime.
Gentlemen, you are about to see something very few others have seen before you.
The ultimate manifestation of Cyrus Rooney's creation.
Me Korok.
I am Korok.
Welcome.
Your wiener is even smaller.
I am smaller in person.
What?
With a tiny change in your brain chemistry, I could make you a child, Lester.
What do you want?
Not big black cocks, so we don't have that in common.
Get the fuck out of my head!
David Wong, son of an insane prostitute and a mentally challenged Amway salesman.
There are words upon words and an infinity you cannot grasp.
Your arrival here is a new dawn upon you.












You can show us the way to go from our world to your own.
You see, in our world, when someone is born with special wisdom, he shares it with Korok.
So that Korok could be greater.
Watch.
Mmm, bacon.
We understand.
We only have the best intentions.
We have observed you.
And we'll soon move into your world with astonishing speed.
So that you too can know the beneficence that is Korok.
But first, we have to share your knowledge with Korok.
Well, thanks, Bob.
Okay, nice doing business with you guys.
You too. See you soon.
All right.
I have a bit of an art question.
As you know, Alexander...
Alexander.
Oh.
Alexander.
Alexander.
Say Alec.
Alec.
Alexander.
Alexander.
Alexander.
Call me Bob.
Okay.
Okay.
It's 2 in the morning.
Lighten up, Bob.
Don't you know any jokes?
The Self Genius.
Power of...
The Self Genius.


Power of...
He was pecking and weaving and bobbing and talking trash.
He was pecking and weaving and bobbing and talking trash.
Friends.
Friends.
You might think you know Bob.
You might think you know Bob.
You might think you know Bob.
But I'm here to tell you that you don't know Dick without Bob.
Only at game...
I met my first Nick, Dave.
I met my first.
I met my first ____.
I met my first ____.
I met my first ____.
I met my first ____.

I met my first ____.
A little over 25 years ago.
And it wasn't someone in a prison.
It was someone who was working for a company where I was a consultant.
When I talked to people about it,
half thought that he was a wonderful leader.
The other half of the team members felt quite the opposite.
They thought he was the devil incarnate.
So I was somewhat puzzled by this,
and I remember I called Bob.
When at the end of the conversation, I'll never forget it,
he said, yup, you got one.
When Paul called me and described the characteristics of the people he was dealing with,
the concept of psychopathy hit me right between the eyes.
Of course.
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
Hey, maestro!
Ah, fair enough.
I'm in here, how's it going?
Fine.
Yeah.
Hi, Bob.
Oh, I'm sorry, maestro.
This is a surprise, huh?
Look at you.
I just wanted to drop off this Chinese bomb.
Supposed to be great stuff.
Ah, ah.
Oh, oh.
Oh, gosh.
Oh, gosh.
Oh, gosh.
Are you ready to order?
What are you getting, Bob?
Good question.
We'll need a few minutes.
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.
You know, I'm sorry, but I didn't mention it earlier,
but actually, I prefer to be called maestro.
Excuse me?
Well, you know, I am a conductor.
Hey, hey, you believe this guy?
Oh.
Bob.
Bob.
You know, the maestro.
Maestro.
Why, Mr. Maestro?
Yeah, get this.
He tells me there are no houses anywhere in Tuscany to rent.
Huh, you rentin' a house in Tuscany?
No.
So what do you care?
Whoa, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
I'd live by the rules and that shit don't work.
Now, I think it's time to move.
It's time for me to act just like a jerk
I refuse to live my life frustrated
I don't care if I die hated
It might be whack as hell to you
But to me it's all the rage
The animal in me has been set free
And will never go back and escape
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act
Quietly I'm waiting and I've used every excuse
Every reason to hold back
And now I'm letting the hook loose
Yeah yeah
You bet I flipped the script
You oughta think it's strange
You never change my mind
My reason's out of range
It might be whack as hell to you
But to me it's all the rage
The animal in me has been set free
And will never go back and escape
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act
I'm bout to fuck it too
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act
I'm bout to fuck it too
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act
I'm bout to fuck it too
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act
I'm bout to fuck it too
I've been beat and I've been squashed
But now you're saying oh my gosh
All concerned like you're my friend
You only bash my head again
I took too much now I've cracked
Don't even try to hold me back
The game's begun, who wants to play?
If not, get out my motherfucking way
Before I cut your head with this fucking prick
Off of the picnic table
And onto the grass
Like Mama and him said
I'm showing all my natural ass
Let it all hang out
For the whole wide world to see
Going for broke cause I awoke
My photomolibility
It might be what they tell to you
But to me it's all the rage
The animal in me has been set free
And will never go back and escape
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act
I'm bout to fuck it too
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act
I'm bout to fuck it too
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm about to act
I'm bout to fuck it too
Whatever you came to do is cool but I'm bout to act

I knew something was wrong when a little pretty white girl ran into a black man's arms.
Something is wrong here.
Dead giveaway.
Dead giveaway.
Charles, thank you very much.
Dead giveaway.
Thank you very much for your time.
Either she homeless or she got problems.
That's the only reason why she run into a black man.
Charles, thank you for being there, man.
Solving the following riddle will reveal the awful secret behind the universe.
Assuming you do not go utterly mad in the attempt.
Say you have an axe, just a cheap one from Home Depot.
On one bitter winter day, you use said axe to behead a man.
Don't worry, the man's already dead.
Maybe you should worry, because you're the one who shot him.
He'd been a big twitchy guy with veiny skin stretched over swollen biceps.
Tattoo of a swastika on his tongue.
And you're chopping off his head.
Because even with eight bullet holes in him, you're pretty sure he's about to spring back to his feet.
Eat the look of terror right off your face.
You now have a broken axe.
So, you go to the hardware store.
Explaining away the dark reddish stains on the handle as barbecue sauce.
The repaired axe sits undisturbed in your house until the next spring when one rainy morning.
So, you grab your trusty axe and chop the thing into several pieces.
On the last blow, however.
Of course, a chipped head means yet another trip to the hardware store.
As soon as you get home with your newly headed axe, though.
You meet the reanimated body of the guy you beheaded last year.
Only he's got a new head.
Stitched on with what looks like plastic weed trimmer line.
And wears that unique expression of you're the man who killed me last winter resentment that one so rarely encounters in everyday life.
So, you brandish your axe.
Axe to you.
You're Rud 자xed and slave me.
Is he right?
Take this!
Someone called that he is.





You'll have my heart
And we'll never be apart
Baby in magazines
Whatever the fuck that means
Baby clothes in the dark
You cannot see shiny cars
And that's when you will need me there
With you I'll always
Make our hopes with the sun shine through
Shine together
Don't ever run back here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took a note, I'ma take it out, take it in
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Yeah, you can stand under my umbrella
Umbrella, umbrella
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

Under my umbrella
Umbrella, umbrella
Hey, hey
Under my umbrella
Umbrella, umbrella
Hey, hey
Under my umbrella
Umbrella, umbrella
Hey, hey
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has to end
It's far
When the world has dealt its cards
It means a hand is hard
To get a room in your heart
Because
When the sun shines
We'll shine together
Told you I'd be here forever
Said I'd always be your friend
Took a note, I'ma take it out, take it in
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
Umbrella, umbrella
Under my umbrella
Umbrella, accordingly

I'll spend a cold winter
Like a rainbow
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
More side effects.
It's always like this when I'm on the sauce.
I dosed six hours ago.
My count had 5,829 grains of rice on her plate.
The rice was grown in Arkansas.
The guy who ran the John Deere harvester was nicknamed Cooter.
I'm not a genius.
I'm not a psychic either.
Just side effects, that's all.
David Wong?
You don't look Asian, Mr. Wong.
I'm not.
I was born right here.
I had my last name changed, though.
Thought it'd make me harder to find.
You know that Wong is the most common surname in the world?
Is your family still around?
No, I was adopted.
Never knew my real dad.
My biological mom, she was institutionalized.
Must have been hard.
She was a strung out, crank-addicted cannibal.
Dabbled in.
And vampirism and necromancy.
Blew her welfare check every month on black candles.
Really?
I thought my mom was bad because she wouldn't let me watch Space Ghost.
Bizarre.
Fascinating.
Pea nozzles in their head.
But the male that incubates eggs in its mouth.
And the pygmy sea pig that can change the color of its skin.
But many creatures promise sex, drugs, and sea slime.
Take a tour of the world's only undersea ocean of drugs.
Thank you so much for joining us today.
Talk.
You know, I...
Sea slime.
I really didn't organism deploy slime.
In slime, well, some kind of mucus, right?
Correct.
Mucus or gelatinous material.
They can actually tie their tail in a knot around their body.
And then sort of move the knot up towards the head to essentially squeegee off the slime.
They don't have any jaws.
And they only have small teeth on their tongue.
They have to find other ways to get access to the tasty inside flesh.
So they go in through the mouth, the gills, or I'm sorry to say, the back door.
So my friend is like, I am not going swimming because those orifice-seeking hagfish are out there.
It's only if you're dead or dying near the bottom of the sea that it could be a problem.
Oh, my goodness.
You look over at Italy.
I mean, the gondolas were freezing.
Man, people were stuck in their house.
I mean, wow.
I mean, this is a done deal.
You guys, you're gone into it, man.
There's nothing going to stop it.
It happened 200 years ago.
You know, you're not only talking an ice age, but you're talking some big earthquakes coming.
Because that water ain't going nowhere.
And it's still melting.
And it has nothing to do with warming or cooling or none of that stuff.
You've got holes in your ozone.
You know, you've got nuclear fallout in your ice cores.
You know, because I like to stick my face right in front of all the.
And I've been talking to a lot of people.
I've been talking to a lot of professors and NASA and everybody.
And this, you know, man, come on, people.
Just make it toxic as heck.
And for the little fishies as they're reporting whales, sharks, all kinds of dead critters coming up all over the place around the globe.
You know, so I tell you guys, man, have a plan.
We're going to have all kinds of anomalies happening.
More people died from shock and panic than anything.
You know what's going on.
And you set up contacts out of state to boogie.
And you got your protocols.
And in gear, man, it's a no, it's a no brainer.
But if you don't, well, yeah, you're going to be a deer in the headlights.
What is happening, beloved, is that witches are becoming so bold today that they are coming angels with flaming swords on the offensive.
They are out of the closets with authority over the Jesus Christ with Satan and with Christ.
Any time you take one look at Jesus Christ, take ten looks at the Lord Satan.
Beloved, we're going to be going into the world.
And Jesus Christ has territory in this tape.
But remember, he is a loser.
He is scared to death because Satan is soon going to return.
Jesus Christ is going to launch all his forces against the believers.
And we should be on our toes, beloved.
The truth is the subgenius offers eternal salvation over triple your money.
That is eternal salvation in terms of your bliss for $115, which is three times $35.
You can't keep up with the math, but that's not important right now.
What is important is that the church is serving his office.
And that is eternal salvation for $1,000.
Things are in motion, Mr. Wong.
Fascinating.
What?
They harvest insects here, do they not?
For their honey?
Do the bees know that they make the honey for you?
Or do they work tirelessly because they think it is their own choice?
Have you ever noticed when you hear a word for the very first time in your life,
you will hear that word again within 24 hours?
Do you ever wonder why sometimes you'll see a single shoe lying alongside the road?
I've been watching you for some time.
But there are great gaps in my knowledge.
Do you know I observed a man who masturbated until he bled?
Did he want to do that?
And you?
When you were alone?
So you understand my mood.
Understand why I'm out here committing felonies today.
There are some very dark things happening.
And I've got this lonely feeling like I'm the only one who knows,
the only one who can do anything about it.
Everybody's got a ghost story, UFO or Bigfoot story.
No.
Now what I think, I think stuff is both real and not real at the same time.
I'm not a Star Trek fan.
I don't know very much about other dimensions and all that.
I'm an old school Catholic.
I believe in hell.
I believe that it's more than just murderers and rapists down there.
I believe in demons and worms and vile shit.
The grease trap of the universe.
And the more I think about it, the more I think that it's not just some place down there.
Oh no.
That it's right here with us.
We just can't perceive it.
It's kind of like the country music radio station.
It's out there in the air.
Even if you don't tune into it.
And I think that somehow through chemistry or magic or voodoo,
that Jamaican son of a bitch, he tuned into it.
Into hell itself.
Through that.
He opened the door.
He became the door.
And me?
I intend to close it.
Tales of tomorrow.
Tales of today.
Tomorrow.
And it's true, dear friends.
Tonight's show, believe it or not, is about something.
It's about all the movies that we saw on Friday night at I, Doctor, Mr. Sister's Friday night movie party.
We have every now and then.
Boy, howdy.
And Doctor Dark and Her Highness Helma came.
And we saw shows that we're presenting clips from tonight.
But first I'm going to do the credits here.
Friend, most of the rants we've heard that sound like movie soundtrack were from a movie called John Dies at the End.
Which is directed by John Coscarelli, who also did Bubba Hotep and the Phantasm movies.
But it was written by David Wong, also known as Jason Pargan, a senior editor at Cracked.com.
And it's one of the funniest horror movies I've ever seen.
And it's so subgenius.
Well, we're going to prove how subgenius it is in a minute.
The collages we've been hearing mostly came from Reverend Royal Decapitator.
The little bit of subgenius ranting with a lot of effects on it was by Brother Freddy from the Westeros Baptist Church, which is kind of a rogue clinch.
We're a little embarrassed by them.
They think Bob hates everything.
And well, they're not.
There'll be more about them later.
The song, the insane song with O-E-O in it was by the Rudy Schwartz Project called Full Frumbarella from Full Frontal Klugman.
The song where I had to reverse a certain word 24 times, a funky rock song.
It was the first song we played.
It was by Fishbone.
A song called Aka-Foo.
And The Large did the collages around the beginning and the title.
Anyway, friends, as I said, we were over at Dr. and Mr. Sister's house watching these shows.
And the first thing I, Dr. and Mr. Sister, presented was an ancient TV show called Tales of Tomorrow.
I think from like 1951.
It predated Twilight Zone.
And all those other ones.
But by a long shot, I'd never even heard of it.
But the episode he played to us was about the birth of the Church of the Subgenius.
Only it was done in 1951.
I'm going to play a clip from it which you will not believe.
I can understand your bewilderment.
You've not read the book, have you?
The one you're holding in your hand.
Oh, the book.
Yes, I've read some of it.
Why?
Then you can read it.
Of course I can read it.
Why shouldn't I?
No need to raise your voice.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't...
When you finish the book, you will understand as Walter even now is beginning to understand.
I don't know what you're talking about.
But it frightens you.
Well, that's ridiculous.
But true.
You are frightened, aren't you, Mr. Davis?
Frightened of something you felt before but refused to recognize.
And you don't understand.
But you will, Mr. Davis.
We will make you understand.
What must I understand?
The difference, Mr. Davis.
The difference in Walt, in you.
I've heard about enough of this.
Stop acting like a child.
Do you imagine you can run from it?
You've read the book.
Perhaps you failed to read far enough.
Or refused to accept the meaning in the words.
You have reached the point of knowing and now you shall know.
You are a mutation.
A superior human being.
A deviation from the normal.
You came into being because nature demanded a new race.
Because evolution must not stop at the creation of man.
But must continually improve.
We must unite our mutants and their superior intelligence.
For in a very short time, the human race will fall into competition with another race from another planet.
A race which even now threatens to enslave us.
You are not alone.
There are thousands like you.
And you will be the founders of a new superior civilization.
Interesting hypothesis.
A fact.
Then you're trying to tell me that I am a mutation?
You are, Mr. Davis. Otherwise you would not see our room here.
Or be able to read our books.
And you, dear listener, would not be able to hear our...
...radio show.
John dies at the end.
We looked at that movie.
Now some of you, of course, are going,
That movie's been out for five months.
Stank's just now only hearing about it.
Gah!
Well, we were doing other things while you were watching TV, friend.
We were living it.
Anyway, yeah.
John dies at the end.
We're sitting there watching that movie.
And...
By golly, it seemed like the most subgeniusful thing.
It certainly did.
It's not the only movie about a weird drug that puts you in another reality.
We recently watched Upstream Color, which is like that also.
But this one's much funnier.
Well, here, I'll just play this little clip.
You already have a bit of a following, though, don't you?
I found a couple of discussion boards on the web devoted to you and your friend.
Your, uh...
...hobby.
I guess.
Okay.
I'm not farting around.
You have 83 cents in your front pocket, Arnie.
Three quarters of nickel, three pennies.
The pennies are dated 1983, 1993, and 1999.
I'll be damned.
That's a neat trick, Mr. Wong.
If you flip the nickel ten times, you'll get heads, heads, tails, heads, tails, tails, tails, heads, tails, tails.
I don't think I want to take the time to do that.
Last night you had a dream, Arnie.
You dreamt you were being chased through the forest by your mother.
She was lashing you with a whip made of knotted penises.
That's right, Arnie. Everything you know is wrong.
You got my attention, Mr. Wong.
Oh, it gets better.
A lot better.
Yes, friends, it gets better.
See if you can count how many...
subgenius buzzwords and references appear in this last cut I'm gonna play, okay?
St. Tom's.
Uh, hi. I need a priest.
Well, this is Father Shellnut. What can I do for you?
Do you... have any experience with, like, demonism?
Like hauntings and possessions and all that?
Look, people say they see things or hear voices in their head.
We generally refer them to a demon.
I'm a counselor.
No, no, no, no. No, I'm not crazy.
Other people have...
No, I didn't mean to imply that.
Why don't you come talk to me?
And then, even if you need to see a professional, I've got a brother-in-law who's real good.
What do you think it's like, Father?
What's life like?
Being crazy. Mentally ill.
Well, they never know they're ill, do they?
I mean, you can't diagnose yourself with the same organ that has the disease.
Just like you can't see your own eyeball.
I suppose you just feel regular.
And the rest of the world seems to go crazy around you.
But let's just suppose that I actually...
I mean, in reality, ran into something from beyond the...
Oh!
I'll try to explain this without cursing,
but the black shit from Planet X that came out from that motherfucker looked like it had grown hair.
Did I mention that the stuff was moving?
Twitching?
Ah!
Uh, hello.
You still there?
Yes, son, I am.
Just keep calm, okay?
Nothing you're seeing is real.
I could feel it.
That strange, venomous warmth spreading through my thigh.
Look, I appreciate your time, but, uh...
I'm starting to think that there's nothing you can do to help me.
Son, I'm going to be honest with you.
We both know you're fucked.
Excuse me?
Your mom writes on the walls with her own shit.
Great changes are coming to Dead World, my son.
Waves of maggots over oceans of rot.
You'll see it, David.
You'll see it with your own eyes.
Do you understand?
Yes, friends, well...
Only the internet listeners will know.
I had to bleep out of that thing.
Now, Dave?
It just returned.
Again.
Oh, I can't tell...
No!
The bus is gone now!
It's gone!
I wanted to talk about Lumiere and the vacant tubes and all the other stuff that was so
exciting.
Well, I've got Einstein's Secret Orchestra playing in the background, and that has its
own buzz that may kind of wipe out the whole thing.


It's going to wipe out the Dave buzz.
Sorry to crash your buzz.
Oh, this movie we saw, Dave, John dies at the end, which, by the way, is a lie.
John doesn't actually die at the end.
He dies in the middle.
He dies in the middle, but he comes back.
It doesn't matter who dies.
Well, I thought that was the name of his member, his organ.
He called it John or something like that.
Little John.
Yeah.
And then what had happened in reality...
And Big Richard.
...was that he shrunk into...
Remember in The Incredible Shrinking Man, there's that feeling of merging with the infinite
just by being a tiny little thing and getting smaller?
Yeah, I didn't like that ending as a kid.
I know.
It scared me.
I had bad dreams because of it.
Did you have the bad dreams, too?
This is the bad dream, Dave.
I know that.
This is just one part of the bad dream.
But they wish...
I think whisper common is slogans in your earbags sometimes when you're not snoring
enough.
I don't know if it's true or not.
What, Dave?
Now, what used to be a buzz now sounds like waves on the ocean crashing against the shore.
A harmonious twaddle, so to speak, a kind of a...
No, it's pretty bad, actually.
See, now I can hear nothing at all, but it seems to have returned to normal.
I'm running your volume up and down, and it's definitely you.
Your line is, it may sound good to you, but that's because you're mentally divergent,
Dave.
You live in another reality that diverged from this one that day you flipped the coin
and it came up heads.
In another reality, it came up tails.
Now, don't you think that that's a very fancy industrial noise that we're getting in the
background?
That's like, you know, specially tweaked for our pleasure?
No, no, it's bad.
Dave, we're going to have to take you off because it's just too...
No.
It's awful.
I'm going to have to bail on that one.
That was real strange.
There's somebody else trying to call, but that doesn't...
We don't do that.
But couldn't that be Dave trying to call again with a clear line?
All right.
No.
All right.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You see, here's the problem.
They're getting in by way of these movies and TV shows.
They're blending the realities up and they're trying to confuse us between the fake realities
and the Dave reality and the other real reality.
For instance, we're watching this movie and obviously somebody had read my mind and all
of our minds.
The movie featured things that were in my movie that haven't been used yet.
Like the man made of meat, slabs of meat throwing themselves together magically and becoming
a man.
Well, that was my idea, but they got in my head and they stole it.
And the bug in the past, in the works that make the bullet fail in the gun, that's no
coincidence.
And the topless bozo women.
Now, I did make that movie.
There was shots in that that looked like color versions of Let's Visit the World of the Future,
Tales of Tomorrow.
And Susie the floozy was in Tales of Tomorrow in 1951 and yet she wasn't born until 1954
or three or something.
Yes.
She was the ingenue.
And Reverend Nicky Fowler.
And Nicky Deathchick's name, her human street name, was in the titles, the end credits of
John Dies at the End.
And Nicky's name appears at the end of John Dies at the End.
But it was Nicky's real name, which is not a usual name.
No.
It might be a normal name in France, but it certainly isn't here in America.
And we just do not understand how we can stop them.
Oh, by the way, I learned, Princess Wee, you'll be interested to know, that the director
of John Dies at the End is working on a sequel to Bubba Hotep.
Oh, wow.
Called Bubba Nosferatu.
That's not a joke.
That's a true, well, it was in Wikipedia.
And the lads who wrote John Dies in the End, the original book, have a new book that's
out now that's a sequel to it called This Book is Full of Love.
And it's a sequel to the original book, The Book is Full of Spiders.
Seriously, dude, don't touch it.
That's the name of the book.
And if it's anything like the movie, seriously, dude, don't touch it.
Because this book is full of spiders.
Full of spiders.
Oh, the other thing that happened at the Friday night meetup, besides a man made of meat,
Dr. Dark presented to us a scientific paper that he had found, something called the Journal
of Space Exploration.
And this document, that's a Xerox in my hand, it looks really authentic.
It's in double column, 10 point times, serif type, so you know it's like a science paper,
not some Helvetica piece of garbage that some kid whipped out.
No, this is a real New Ager.
This is the kind of thing that inspired us so much 40 years ago when Bob first approached us.
It's a preliminary discussion of alien civilizations and it was, all of this information came from remote viewing.
And there's quite a bit of scientifical explanation of remote viewing in here, but I'm going to
read a few of the highlights.
I've been, the full paper is by Shelly Thompson of Thompson Research of New Braunfels, Texas.
And this was, this document was received July 7th, 2012, was accepted September 10th,
but then it was published only 10 days later because the information is, well, friends,
the observations that will be presented can in theory be verified by comparing them with other sources of information.
Government agencies and defense corporations hold the larger body of information about high-strangeness phenomena in strict secrecy.
The secret data may consist primarily of photographs, radar traces, infrared and microwave emanations,
and a few anecdotal accounts by individuals who obtained a close look at the phenomenon.
It is very unlikely that corroboration exists for the depth of information acquired by the author.
Using remote viewing.
Owing to the difficulty of the task, it is unlikely that another remote viewer will be able to repeat the work in the foreseeable future.
Nevertheless, given the potential importance of the findings, it was deemed improper to withhold them.
One of the findings here is that the demand that the universe order itself in line with our preference to perceive only one reality at a time is unreasonable.
Friends, you better heed that.
Now, this is a very important issue.
When they start talking about the aliens, this is a really in-depth analysis.
I'm just skipping around.
I did select favorite parts.
A significant difference appeared to exist between intelligent life on gas giant planets, Saturn for example,
and the upright biped design that appears in many forms in our galaxy.
Whereas humans can distinguish between sentience and intelligence.
For example, the neighborhood deer are sentient but not intelligent,
whereas the author's house is intelligent.
The house cats are both sentient and intelligent.
That gives me a real clearer, an ever clearer picture of the author of this.
As a cat lady.
Aliens have many more categories to choose from.
Humans look at technology as composed of inert objects.
That is one of the key differences between humans and advanced species.
Virtually anything humans do with the mind can be performed by aliens as an act of technology.
And they can do additional acts that humans have yet to imagine.
No immature members of the species of aliens were observed.
It is not known how they create their units or their progeny or whether the latter term even applies.
The emotions exhibited by this species appear to be very limited.
They are task-oriented.
In some casts, they feel the equivalent of fear.
They are also capable of anger.
Individuation is both a matter of degree and a function of caste.
Within this species, the short, more numerous units resemble living robots.
They appear to act as animated tools.
As caste rises, the units become taller, more intelligent, and more fully autonomous.
Nevertheless, individual decision-making is very limited to all intents and purposes.
This species functions as a collective intelligence analogous to an ant colony.
That is very interesting, dear.
Oh, the author actually paid a visit to an orbital facility belonging to this species via remote viewing.
The facility handled experiments on human beings.
The human participants did not benefit.
The author broke a module and released some humans from connection with the experiments.
Two units who seemed to be low-grade technicians appeared agitated by this action but did not interfere.
So this would make a pretty good documentary.
This is a good movie.
This lady in Texas, every time I read this, she gains another 50 pounds in my remote viewing.
I'm remote viewing her.
Yes.
And her house smells like 19 cats.
Uh-oh.
Yeah, she broke into one of the modules to save the humans who were being experimented on.
And she did save them.
But when she came back with some other people, she was killed.
They were unable to free the rest of the humans because the aliens, the B group aliens, had created a new weapon that defeated her remote viewing powers.
Oh, wow.
That was valiant of her.
Now, in some ways, they're much like subgeniuses, these aliens are.
Okay.
Their intent is to colonize the Earth.
They do not consider humanity an intelligent species.
There is more than one reason for this attitude on their part.
But the principal element appears to be the following.
These species regularly collects humans for examination and subsequent release.
This usually occurs in rural areas, which probably leads to oversampling of uneducated and technologically backward subjects.
This is this lady's way of putting down her fellow rednecks.
They're in New Braunfels.
They're all so primitive.
But I know how she feels.
With respect to comparative intelligence, humans are not.
Not very bright.
Although, obviously, the author of this thing is in a great position to judge that sort of thing.
We run into that a lot.
Oh, and also, I think she's a bit of a man-hater, or at least the aliens are.
The colonizers concluded that human males have a biological urge to fight one another.
Organized society, they reason, cannot tolerate such a high proportion of males, and it is ultimately the cause of war.
They calculated the birth ratio.
The ratio of females to males that would prevent war.
The threshold was reached at approximately eight to one.
So, if you ladies kill off all but one out of every eight males, there will be no violence.
All you have to do is kill seven out of eight males.
Wow, that sounds so easy.
Let one survive.
And then it says the ladies would, the eight wives would be protective of their one husband.
It's unlikely that he would be allowed to risk himself in fights.
She's got it really all worked out.
Yeah.
But this music in the background is perfect for it.
It certainly is.
Our life in the robot factory, rocket factory.
Our life in the rocket factory.
That's Lonesome Cowboy Dave on guitar and Chaz Smith on several keyboards.
And Michelle George on violin.
And Bob Moses on guitar.
And Bob Moses on music on drums, I'm sure.
Because I must have recorded that band 53 and a half times.
At least.
So, friends, I could go on and on and on and on, but I can tell you don't want me to.
I can tell by remote hearing.
Silent radio invented by Dr. Philo Drummond, the overman.
The aliens are actively mining our resources.
Oh, I said I wasn't going to do that.
I can't stop.
Some animals have learned a few words of human language.
Where is the human who speaks gorilla or dolphinese?
Well?
Oh, here's one last really good line.
All over the world, humans blink flashlights at UFOs.
I was not aware of that.
This has removed optical signals from the list of ways in which human beings could initiate an intelligent conversation.
Sometimes the UFOs blink back, but that is not significant.
Boy.
I know a few friends who worship the Marfa lights in Texas.
I'd hate to tell them that it's not significant when the aliens blink back at your blinking flashlight.
Oh, I can't stop.
Imagine what it would have meant to humanity to have another habitable world within arm's reach.
It is possible that a previous civilization had that benefit.
The traces of an ancient civilization on Mars are telling, as is the evidence that it came to a sudden end.
Either through warfare or a close encounter with a celestial object,
the civilization that produced the Egyptian pyramids, which were already ancient in the time of the pharaohs, may once have spanned two worlds.
Well, see?
Aliens built the pyramids.
Your cat is smarter than you are.
Everything you do is better than you think.
The only person you know is David Wong!
So, dear friends, with that, I could...
We could just shut up.
Oh, wait. Well, let's try one more time.
One more time.
Is it still there?
Now, that's not for me.
It's still there.
It's still there.
It may be that the station...
Maybe the...
That would just figure.
Dave finally gets rid of the buzz, and the station gets its own buzz.
That would...
Is it truly a buzz, though?
Yes. That's the interesting question.
Where do the popping sounds come from?
I'll go weeks without popping sounds.
Mary Poppins.
I'll change equipments.
I'll look around at different things.
I guess people even come and look at the outside where it's connected and say, no prob.
But, uh, who cares?
Well, um...
Dave, I believe that...
It makes my friends droop in thinking of it.
And my gray hair is shaggy.
It makes me want to cry and argue with policemen and stuff you're not supposed to do.
Oh.
I believe that they killed your buzz.
They did, man.
A long time ago.
Buzz killers. All.
For that matter, I feel like my voice is a little echoey, but it may be because of some tiny, microscopical time delay.
But I hear no echo.
In this other universe.
In our universe.
I hear no echo.
You know, no Alpine Valley goat sounds.
No, la, la, la, la, la.
I only hear it on me.
I hear no yodeling.
This show is full of spiders.
Seriously, dude, don't touch it.

You've got one of those psychoactive amulets that keep your, um, hearts monitored.
Dave, we've been playing the old witch disco tunes by Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the background.
They are groovy, aren't they?
They are so groovy.
They sound really good.
God, this call is not working.
It's getting louder and louder and louder.
And I know that our station engineer would want me to not do this.
I don't know about you, but hearing expert Ivan Stang says this is bad.
I have no music either.
Dave, I'm just going to have to take you off and go straight to some tape, I guess.
I think that it is interference from another.
Another world.
No, this doesn't make a lot of sense because I think I don't know.
I don't know.
And Dave, I'm potting you down and I'm going to have to say good night.
It's the Ash Tabulin industrial noise.
Good night, Dave.
Good night, Dave.
That was sad.
But meanwhile, coming up, a brand new amino acid song.
And everybody thought they had gone back to their home planet, but they haven't.
That will be coming up very presently.
Thank you.
But now, let's go ahead with this experiment.
Is that.
And you can tell me how this apparatus works as we go along.
Guess what it does.
I think I'll understand it better when I see this thing work.
I should be very much disappointed if it doesn't.
Oh, don't you worry about that, doctor.
Now I can go ahead.
Anything I can do to help?
No, thanks.
Yes, yes, yes, come.
Oh.
Come.
I'd love to, doctor, and you know it.
Oh, Wilma.
Oh, oh.
Doctor.
Oh, doctor.
Now.
Oh, yes.
Oh, doctor.
My, why don't you have more.
Tell me, tell me, tell me.
This spooky greenish glow.
Part of a little experiment I'm conducting.
Oh.
But tell me.
Why, no.
Meantime, I've made ready for a final test of this little invention here.
But what's the matter?
Doctor, what's happened to him?
Eh?
Is he all right?
Doctor.
I see.
What's happened to him?
Why is he lying here on the table?
Don't worry, Wilma.
Don't worry?
Doctor, what are you.
He is.



He is offered to be the subject of my test.
That's all.
But then, why is he.
He's simply lying here, comfortably asleep, under the influence of my electro-hypnotic
rays.
Oh.
