1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,960
Remember when you bought that guitar to punish your parents when they wouldn't let you play the stereo at a pet sterilizing level?

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,420
Remember those golden days when you didn't have to put up with annoying warnings from pucker butts about the damage that rock and roll would do to your hearing?

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,680
Well, now that you're in the same boat with Pete Townsend and incurable tinnitus overlays everything you hear with the sound of a screaming tea kettle,

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,900
how are you going to reach that level of sonic delight that once rattled the parts of your body that we can't mention on the radio?

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,420
Thanks to the unspeakable vision and indefinable fortunes of that financial whiz kid, J.R. Bob Dobbs, there is an answer.

6
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,240
It's that Texas tradition of towering terror, the almighty subgenius hour of slack.

7
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,460
Yes, as a result of the hideous machinations of church scribe and animal husbandry expert, the wrong Reverend Ivan Stang,

8
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,680
you can now avail yourself of an instrument from the subdimension of hell that rocks the elder gods.

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,700
It's drum kits for gabrogfran.

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,220
This neuron-shredding percussion dynamo bypasses the ear itself and acts directly on the brain,

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,920
doing away with the need for troublesome headphones or sonic insulation of any kind.

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,160
Never worry about sterilizing the pets again.

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,320
Drum kits for gabrogfran teleports those pestersome little ragmops into another dimension

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,460
where they'll be eaten by unspeakable shambling things, thereby solving the problem forever.

15
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,920
And just think of what you can do to those bitchy neighbors.

16
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,380
How do you lay hands on this tool of hellish delight, you ask?

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,220
It's simple.

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,260
Just tune into the almighty subgenius hour of slack.

19
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,800
We'll give you details on how to enter the contest that'll give you a chance to open the doorway to Armageddon

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,280
and start up the dangdest party since Jim Jones did it Kool-Aid style.

21
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,780
Mere toxic waste becomes an aperitif unparalleled once you take in a heady draft of the subgenius hour of slack.

22
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,060
Praise Bob, if you dare.

23
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,780
They're here.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,200
A minute.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,460
It's showtime.

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,480
Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,120
The show that dare not even exist.

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,700
Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime

29
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,260
with your favorite horrifying horror host, Mobius Rex.

30
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,760
And you'll hear the voices of puzzling evidence.

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,740
Gary Gabofran lies in a cast of thousands more.

32
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,200
It's mysterious, evil, spooky, eerie, creepy, wacky, kooky, fun.

33
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,680
It's the subgenius hour.

34
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,320
Hour of slack.

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
And here we got the brains of the whole operation.

36
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,600
Master signal goes out from here to the satellite.

37
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,420
We pump it out all over the world.

38
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,060
Pretty fancy, huh?

39
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,320
Not too familiar with it myself.

40
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,060
You're buying time.

41
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,960
Time, friends.

42
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,580
Because Mr. Moneybags, he's paying a salary.

43
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,660
Salary.

44
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,700
He throws in a hundred bucks a week and consequently I can't preach against drinking because his

45
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,960
ass box is full of beer.

46
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,160
I hope he's talking about you, my friend.

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,660
Pay us not to preach about beer.

48
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,840
I can't preach against cigarettes because they all smoke.

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,240
For me.

50
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,880
I'm out for 15 minutes between Sunday school and worship service.

51
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,560
So then go out and light up a Chesterfield or something.

52
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,180
I will.

53
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,320
And what kind did Jesus smoke, friends?

54
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:36,640
It's time to open your heart, close your mind, unzip your lips and bend over because you're about to receive the word of Bob.

55
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,760
You still don't get it, do you, boys?

56
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
There ain't no countries anymore.

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,420
No more good guys.

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,140
They're running the whole show.

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,460
They own everything.

60
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,460
The whole damn planet.

61
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,520
They can do whatever they want.

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,480
What's wrong with having it good for a change?

63
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,920
And they're going to let us have it good if we just help them.

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
They're going to leave us alone.

65
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,660
Let's make some money.

66
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,500
You can have a little taste of that good life, too.

67
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,740
Now, I know you want it.

68
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,900
Hell, everybody does.

69
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,380
You're going to make a million dollars.

70
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:18,020
And you can call in and you can talk to the there's some sexy ministers on the on the lines tonight.

71
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,740
Your prayer partners are here ready to receive.

72
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,940
Your promise.

73
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,840
Your covenant with Bob, friends.

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,620
Now, I know that, you know, not everybody can can can give that much.

75
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,320
You know, Dr. Drummond and I once talked about, you know, who means the most to Bob?

76
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:45,860
Is it the little old lady who can who, you know, doesn't have anything at all to her name, but but she donates a quarter her last quarter?

77
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:52,580
Or does or is Bob more impressed with the rich man who could give a million dollars but only gives ten thousand?

78
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:01,820
We prayed on that, friends, and we realized that in Bob's eyes, that rich man is the only one that's going to get to heaven because he paid more money.

79
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,500
So I want you to call.

80
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,900
We got to sell you, friends.

81
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,060
We're not just going to sit here and talk.

82
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,820
Bob said we had to party, didn't he?

83
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,680
Didn't he?

84
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,580
He said we had to party.

85
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,320
Didn't say we could.

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,900
He said we had to.

87
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,940
And so we must also sell.

88
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,260
Praise Bob and thank you.

89
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,940
Are there distrust?

90
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,160
Are there distrust?

91
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,160


92
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,160


93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,160


94
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,560
Right.

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,600
Come on, get up off that chair.

96
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,780
Follow me.

97
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,380
Now you can have something to sell.

98
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,820
We all know we're in the art of selling.

99
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,380
We create a mental and an emotional climate of unconscious selling.

100
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,820
Right in your own home.

101
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,660
When everybody sells, we're all selling.

102
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,340
We all have something to sell.

103
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,780
Yes, everyone selling together.

104
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,540
Mighty symphony of prosperity.

105
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,580
For we all have something to sell.

106
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,280
Yeah, darn it.

107
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,080
And we're trying to sell you some slack.

108
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,100
I know it was supposed to be free, but I'm sorry.

109
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,620
That's just the way the world is.

110
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,540
And I am I'm disappointed in some of you folks.

111
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,220
There's some so few that called in last week and did indeed pledge.

112
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,220
Those who did, we bow down to you.

113
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,160
We bow down to you.

114
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,500
We unzip you.

115
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,720
We undress you.

116
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:33,220
We would do things to you which we must never even think of on the radio, much less discuss.

117
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,780
And yet, and yet, we would indeed anyway.

118
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:44,400
But the rest of you deadly gangster Frankenstein earphone radio worldwide computer Bob parody

119

puppet hangman rope underling mongrel felon cowardly playboy chicanerous coke inspiring

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,980
fresh old brainwashed radio listener.

121
00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:02,020
I guess you just don't see enough value in spending just a little tiny $10 pledge to

122
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,280
the church in the subject.

123
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,660
I just a little $25 pledge.

124
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,500
Why that would get you so many wonderful things.

125
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,660
You have to love Bob.

126
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,860
He loves you, but you love Bob.

127
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,260
You have to.

128
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,960
Or else what happens if you don't love?

129
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,060
Bob.

130
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,380
He'll kill you.

131
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,200
He'll Bob you out.

132
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,900
He'll Bob you out, folks.

133
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,940
You heard it here first.

134
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,800
He'll Bob you out.

135
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,680
Bob you out, baby.

136
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,520
It's dear friends.

137
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,260
It's dear friends.

138
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:44,100
Only if, you know, if you don't pledge, there's going to be more and more and more reverence

139
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,720
stangs.

140
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,100
You're going to have to listen to it forever.

141
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,160
It's going to drive from your imagination.

142
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,080
Can you at least send a little money?

143
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,320
Dear friends.

144
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,160
We need that money.

145
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,540
Gosh.

146
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,520
Get with it.

147
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,480
Let's get it.

148
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:52,860
We are.

149
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,920
We're going to hear it going here.

150
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,320
Look at those phones light up.

151
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, finally.

152
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,560
Oh, yeah.

153
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,460
That old gold friend.

154
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,180
Shake it off.

155
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,880
Shake it off.

156
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,320
But.

157
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,160
Let's.

158
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,980
Oh, that's much, much better, friends.

159
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:17,800
You know, because if you think about it, around the world these days, everywhere you look,

160
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,060
freedom, freedom, simple freedom is always against.

161
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,920
It's against.

162
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,620
The law.

163
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:32,020
You got your drug prohibition laws, your age of consent laws, your property laws, your

164
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:43,880
trespassing laws, your anti-sodomy laws, your tax laws, your draft laws, your censorship

165
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:53,160
laws, your white, white privilege laws, your anti-pornography laws.

166
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,160


167
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,160


168
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,160


169
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,160


170
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,160


171
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,620
Your sedition laws, your vagrancy laws, your hitchhiking laws, your indecency laws, your

172
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,660
obscenity laws, your licensing laws, your truancy laws, your building code and zoning laws,

your anti skateboarding laws, your loitering laws, your patriarchal privilege laws, your

174

175
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,140


176
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,140


177
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:33,040
laws, your FCC laws, your national security laws, your national emergency laws, your anti-strike

178
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:40,460
laws, your anti-privacy laws, search and seizure laws, anti-graffiti laws, anti-postering laws,

179
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:48,240
anti-abortion laws, anti-riot laws, uh, conspiracy laws.

180
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,100
That's funny, it's against the law to be a conspiracy.

181
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:03,660
Criminal, criminal cynicalism laws, which they often use against people who sell porno,

182
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,260
by the way.

183
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:14,120
Trade laws, vandalism laws, divorce laws, vice laws, bicycle laws, jaywalking laws,

184
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,200
gun laws, and heresy laws.

185
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,220
And if you're a criminal, you're a criminal.

186
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,220


187
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,200
If you don't support this station, and in particular this show on this station, you

188
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,820
can might as well welcome those heresy laws right into your front door, because that's

189
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:37,520
all they, I mean, uh, the, as far, my friends, the deadly gangster Frankenstein earphone

192
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,520
We'll be exactly that.

193
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,560
Ah, yes.

194
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,440
But, um, I'm gonna quit talking about the money and let somebody else talk about it

195
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,340
for a while, just for a second here.

196
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,380
And that somebody will be our good friend, Father Joe Mama.

197
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:10,000
This is a brand new rant from Father Joe Mama, and I hope that you pay close attention, kids.

198
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,900
Hello, friends, and welcome.

199
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,760
The sermon tonight is entitled, Stealing Souls.

200
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,200
I'm going to be talking about the story of a man who was a thief.

201
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,200


202
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,200


203
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,200


204
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,200


205
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,460
He stole souls from Satan.

206
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,900
That's right, friends.

207
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,940
Stealing souls from Satan.

208
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,040
Now, a lot of you are out there probably wondering, what's this?

209
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,340
Is the Church of the Subgenius actually going to advocate stealing?

210
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,100
No, sir.

211
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,340
For stealing back that which was stolen from you in the first place is not stealing.

212
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,880
It's repossession of stolen property, a legal right of every man, woman, and child, and

213
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,020
yes, even Yeti, dear friends.

214
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,200
And that is what Satan's souls are.

215
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,200


216
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,200


217
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,640
Stolen property.

218
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,740
Not stolen from God.

219
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,860
Not stolen from Bob.

220
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,400
But from the individuals themselves.

221
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,360
You see, one of the reasons the Church of the Subgenius and the Christian church don't

222
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,420
see eye to eye is over the issue of souls.

223
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,280
The Christians believe that all obedient souls belong to God.

224
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,320
And all the rebellious souls go to the devil.

225
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,560
Now, isn't that just like the conspiracy?

226
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,900
You get the lesser of two evils.

227
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,280
Eternal slavery in heaven or else burn forever in hell.

228
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,600
No, sir.

229
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,720
Baba Dabza doesn't buy that and you shouldn't buy it either.

230
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,140
As if making you work as a slave all your life wasn't bad enough.

231
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,140
Now they want to enslave you in the afterlife as well.

232
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,540
Oh, I can just hear the Christians wailing away.

233
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,360
Hell no, Papa Joe.

234
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,260
Heaven is no slave plantation.

235
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,020
You can do whatever you want for all eternity.

236
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,780
Yeah, right.

237
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,700
Who do they think they're fooling anyway?

238
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
They spend all their mortal lives in hell.

239
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:47,880


240
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:47,880


241
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:47,880


242
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:47,880


243
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:47,880


244
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,120
They're just not only depriving themselves of a good time, but trying to outlaw anyone

245
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,720
else from enjoying life either.

246
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,540
And then they honestly expect us to think heaven will be any different.

247
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,000
Do they think once they reach heaven, God will all of a sudden allow us herd of sheep

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,840
to run wild?

249
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,440
Do you think that we can possibly believe it could be fun up there?

250
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,280
Are drugs allowed in heaven?

251
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,880
Is illicit sex with anyone you want allowed in heaven?

252
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,480
Can you drink all the alcohol you want without pain of hangovers?

253
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,600
Do you get live Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin concerts whenever you feel like it?

254
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,840
No way.

255
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,540
We've heard what the conspiracy has in store for us up there, and to be quite frank, it

256
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,440
ain't all too pleasant.

257
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,340
We get the joy of the fundamentalist lifestyle without even the hope of death as an escape.

258
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,280
What's more, we get to sing hymns to the Almighty day in and day out while plucking those stupid

259
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,080
little hearts.

260
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,200
Gee, I can't wait.

261
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,580
Screw that.

262
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,200
I've got funner things in mind than plucking.

263
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,040
But unfortunately, they're all forbidden, even though for once there's no chance of

264
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,320
disease.

265
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,920
Some heaven.

266
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,420
Little wonder Lucifer got the hell out of there.

267
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,240
At least he had the gonads to rebel and take control of his own fate.

268
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,980
If I had to live like that forever, it wouldn't take me a millennium to want out.

269
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,720
I'd say, come on, boys.

270
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,080
Let's go on strike.

271
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,960
The work conditions around here suck.

272
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,600
We want a new contract.

273
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,020
Some vacation time.

274
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,760
More freedom.

275
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,740
Less surveillance.

276
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,800
And a salary would be nice, too.

277
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,320
Anything but this, tell management to take a hike.

278
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:30,360
Now, in real afterlife, anyone leading such a revolution like that would be seen as a

279
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:30,760
hero.

280
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,200
And anyone crushing such a popular uprising would be the bad guy.

281
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,240
But not in conspiracy heaven, no siree.

282
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,160
Satan is villainized because he didn't support the dictator.

283
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,000
And God, the evil one, is the one who's going to be the villain.

284
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,000


285
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,000


286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,180
The union buster is the hero.

287
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,880
Because he kicked the underdog's butt.

288
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,420
Some hero.

289
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,400
Ruthless, all-powerful, and unforgiven.

290
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,980
He sends Satan to burn forever in eternal torment along with anyone else that doesn't

291
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,760
support the regime.

292
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,660
Now, if that's a kind, compassionate God, heaven forbid we see a mean one.

293
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,100
It just doesn't seem fair now, does it?

294
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,920
There's got to be an alternative to this hell.

295
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,760
Be it above or below.

296
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,320
And yes, dear friends, there is.

297
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,840
And I'm damn glad you asked.

298
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,440
Because I'm here to tell you about one J.R. Bob Dobbs.

299
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,600
The only candidate who's pro-choice and believes in everyone's God-forbidden right to choose

300
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,940
for themselves the fate of their innermost souls.

301
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,900
Bob is actively recruiting lost souls of every race, color, and yes, religion.

302
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,980
The billions that fell between the cracks of good and evil.

303
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,040
The neutrals who just want to be left alone for once in their afterlife.

304
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,620
Let's face it.

305
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,860
Most of the Christians, they're lost cause.

306
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,060
They want to be told what to do by somebody else.

307
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,220
God said it, they believe it, and that's the end of it.

308
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,620
But there's plenty of other quality souls out there frying in hell not because they

309
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,140
like Lucifer, although you've got to admit the boy's got chutzpah, but because they didn't

310
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,880
want to follow the goose-stepping guidelines of God.

311
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,440
These neutral rebels without applause deserve better than they got.

312
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:12,960
And my friends, I'm telling you, the neutrals are the ones who just want to be left alone.

313
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:12,960


314
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:12,960


315
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:12,960


316
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:12,960


317
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,620
And by golly, Bob Dodds will deliver it.

318
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,020
He'll hit hell and all the other hot spots with a burning desire to liberate the luckless

319
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,180
lackeys last forever for no other reason than the fact that they want it to be free.

320
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,820
And if that's the sin, dear friends, then I hope we're all sinners.

321
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:37,220
Now I won't bother describing to you the orgies of pleasure these same souls will partake

322
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,940
in the promised planet.

323
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,360
But I will say it's enough to make the devil himself.

324
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,160
Turn red in embarrassment.

325
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:52,080
Best of all is the returning of that which no man, demon, or God has the right to take

326
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,360
away.

327
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,420
The essence of our being, the center of our personal gravity, the one part of us that

328
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,100
the conspiracy hungers for the most but shall never again taste.

329
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:10,060
Our souls, dear friends, it may Bob Dodds have mercy on them that try to steal it away.

330
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,500
Hear it at the word of Bob.

331
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,040
Breathe.

332
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:12,780
Peace, Bob.

333
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,240
Amen.

334
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,660
Ever fall in love with a fine art piece but found yourself unable to cough up the fancy

335
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,280
art payment?

336
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,260
Enjoy the abstract art but not the abstract price?

337
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,360
Well, at Bargain Bob's Art Barn, we specialize in original fine art pieces at factory discount

338

339

That's because at Bargain Bob's, we believe the artist should be starving, not you.

It's a treat.

346
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,980
Thank you.

347
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,680
I'm a big fan of your work.

348
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,520
Thank you, Bob.

349
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,120
Have a good day.

350
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,040
Bye-bye.

351
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,040


352
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,100


353
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,100


354
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,100


355
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,800
Bye-bye.

356
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,780
Bye-bye.

357
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:08,780


358
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,120
Bye-bye.

359
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,320
Bye.

360
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,340


361
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,340


362
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,340


363
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,340


364
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,340


365
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,340


366
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,340


367
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,340


368
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,340


369
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,340


370
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,340


371
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:09,340


372
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:09,580
Bye.

373
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,860
and these fine art classics were delivered to our railroad signings months in advance.

374
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,160
We've got to unload these one-of-a-kind masterpieces

375
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,660
to make room for our future masterpieces.

376
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,180
Every piece a part of the artist's soul.

377
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,360
And every piece must go.

378
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,180
Our loss is your gain.

379
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,840
This week and every week at Bargain Bob's Art Barge.

380
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,180
Check out phone listings for local outlets.

381
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,720
Hey, uh, how about that?

382
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,960
Oh, my God.

383
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,700
This is the worst situation this show's ever been in.

384
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,940
Hanging out here in space with a computer gone nuts

385
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,140
and our only link to Earth cut.

386
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,440
Huh?

387
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,680
The Boeing machine's gone out of control.

388
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,520
Trimmed tabs operating at full volume now.

389
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,280
Oh, no theme panels.

390
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,300
I don't know if we're going to make it back.

391
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,660
Well, what about the...

392
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,740
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

393
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,260
I am a HAL 9000 computer.

394
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,200
I first became operational at the HAL 9000 plant

395
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,420
in Urbana,

396
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:08,920
Illinois.

397
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,140
My instructor was Dr. Langley,

398
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,480
and he taught me to sing a song.

399
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,560
Would you like to hear it?

400
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,580
Uh, sure, sure.

401
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,400
Just don't do the one about the helicopter attack.

402
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,800
Oh, hell, I was all ready to do that one.

403
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,460
Well, I'll tell you what.

404
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,860
You know, I can't stay on the phone all night,

405
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,920
but I love you beautiful bunch of bastards.

406
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,240
Well, hold on, Dr. HAL.

407
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,000
What happened, other doctor?

408
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,520
Evolutionary for a...

409
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,440
You don't need that, do you?

410
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,440
I'm going to dematerialize you.

411
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:41,900
Oh.

412
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,120
Quick!

413
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,160
You first!

414
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,720
Dr. Langley's

415
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,700
Well, Reverend?

416
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,300
Yes?

417
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,080
Would Bob maybe want some, like...

418
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,560
Would he take a sexual deal or something, maybe?

419
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,760
No, that's between you and Bob.

420
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,860
All right.

421
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,980
Bob's a pretty broad-minded fella in more ways than one.

422
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,880
Aren't you Bob's right-handed man?

423
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,440
No, I'm Bob's left-brain man.

424
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,600
Oh, left-brain.

425
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,260
No, he just carries on the teachings of Bob.

426
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,220
Right, and I'm not the top-ranking officer of the church corporation.

427
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,520
My mentor, Dr. Philo Drummond, who is almost as hard to get hold of as Bob,

428
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,280
really is a little closer to Bob because he doesn't work as hard at it as I do.

429
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:34,820
I see.

430
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,760
And yet he owns a gigantic chunk of the trademark.

431
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,020
So he has more slack, essentially.

432
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,260
I understand. Let's continue on.

433
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,040
Hi, Fairfield, you're on WICC.

434
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:48,920
Hello?

435
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:49,600
Hello.

436
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,700
Yeah, hi, you're on.

437
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,980
Hi, I'm Lauren.

438
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,760
Yes.

439
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,300
What kind of religion are you in?

440
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,160
What's your church called?

441
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,980
It's a very hard one to describe, and we just spent the last 40 minutes describing it.

442
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,300
Oh, but I taught the talent.

443
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,780
This is definitely the strangest religion most people ever encounter,

444
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,000
and it's not for everybody.

445
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,400
It's for the mutants and the abnormals.

446
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,980
It's for anybody who really knows that they are not completely normal

447
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,080
and are proud of that.

448
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,640
If you are abnormal, then you should be proud.

449
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,460
So this would be a religion that would be geared to, say, radio professionals.

450
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,740
It is geared, yeah.

451
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:41,440
It tends to attract street people, crazies, mental health care outpatients,

452
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:49,640
and creative types like movie directors and artists, musicians, radio DJs,

453
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,980
and also parasites like the documentary.

454
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,300
I understand.

455
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,120
People who just like to be near people like us.

456
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,860
Right.

457
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,560
Yeah, I understand.

458
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,820
Okay, and do you believe in God?

459
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,600
In God?

460
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,440
God.

461
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,840
Well, that's a very personal question.

462
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,060
I mean, which one and which God?

463
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,100
God the Father.

464
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,040
The one true God or the hamburger God of the Romans?

465
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,940
No, God who created heaven and earth.

466
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,060
The God the Father.

467
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,720
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to disclose this information.

468
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,040
Okay, so you see...

469
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,320
I can give you a straight answer to that.

470
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,180
Chances are there'd be an earthquake in Connecticut.

471
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,420
Okay, all right.

472
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,320
What are your beliefs?

473
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,060
Do you think that someone can buy their salvation?

474
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,560
Only from the right source.

475
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,200
And what is that right source?

476
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,480
Who's the right source?

477
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,680
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

478
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,980
It depends on what kind of salvation.

479
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
You're after, though.

480
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,900
Ma'am, I think that you need to listen a little longer

481
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,640
so you can get sort of a handle on what's going on here.

482
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,560
Although I do understand your question.

483
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,140
You see, this has been tricky.

484
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,760
We often have Christians call up and say,

485
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,260
look, you guys are devil worshipers, aren't you?

486
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,320
We don't worship devils.

487
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,740
We may make deals with a few of the more benevolent sort of demons now and then.

488
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,180
Just business deals, that's all.

489
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,200
Business deals, right.

490
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,640
Right.

491
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,140
And, um, uh, but, you know, if you look at it,

492
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,700
we've had some great defectors come over to our side this year.

493
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,380
Jim Baker, Jimmy Swagger.

494
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,440
Came over to your side?

495
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,300
Oh, yeah.

496
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,740
You didn't know that?

497
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,960
They're now in the Church of the Subgenius.

498
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,780
They're sinners, ma'am.

499
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,280
This is a church for sinners.

500
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,080
We're not preaching to the saved.

501
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,140
We're trying to lead people.

502
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,440
We're trying to tempt the sinners away from the devil.

503
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,920
See?

504
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,120
Where they go after that is their own, is up to them.

505
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,160
It's up to their choice.

506
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,400
You're trying to what?

507
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,800
We're trying to tempt the sinners away from the devil.

508
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,160
So what do you...

509
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,880
We fixate them on God for a little while,

510
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,480
and then they get tired of him,

511
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,640
and then they go off on to some other thing.

512
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,160
Excuse me.

513
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,140
If you're not saved, you're a sinner, am I correct?

514
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,760
Oh, no.

515
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,980
No, not necessarily.

516
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,380
In the Church of the Subgenius, you can sin all you want to,

517
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,360
and you're still saved.

518
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,220
Okay.

519
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:26,440
Okay.

520
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,140
And, um, where...

521
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,060
Where are you going after, um, 1998?

522
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,480
Oh, we'll go in the, uh, flying saucers

523
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,980
piloted by the sex goddesses from Planet X.

524
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,680
Yeah?

525
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,780
Yeah, to the, uh, to Dimension Zero.

526
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,240
Sounds like a fun trip.

527
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:44,800
It is.

528
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,220
It's going to be a party, man,

529
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,500
and we're going to watch the poor, unsaved dupes of the conspiracy

530
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,940
fry in the nuclear holocaust below.

531
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,380
It won't be pleasant.

532
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,560
But...

533
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,580
But it'll be better...

534
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,040
Our fault.

535
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,680
It'll be better than being in the nuclear holocaust.

536
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:01,900
Right.

537
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,640
I mean, it's their fault to begin with.

538
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,400
Yeah, and if people want to be on this with the sex goddesses,

539
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,160
then all they need do is subscribe to the Church of the Subgenius.

540
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,440
Right.

541
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,560
Let me put it this way.

542
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,040
Okay, the conspiracy as a whole has,

543
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,040
between the United States and Russia,

544
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,060
probably 100,000 nuclear weapons or more.

545
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,200
The Church of the Subgenius only has three nuclear weapons,

546
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,960
and yet...

547
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,820
And yet...

548
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:26,820


549
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,120
And yet...

550
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,780
They're not there to stand up and fight them.

551
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,600
Because, you know, it's always, historically,

552
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,460
it's always been the crazy people

553
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,000
that were dumb enough to stand up against City Hall.

554
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,400
I see.

555
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,740
Like they say in that old Frank Capra movie,

556
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,160
Meet John Doe, I think it is,

557
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,840
the only, the lost causes are the only causes worth fighting for.

558
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,720
Isn't that something?

559
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,100
Oh, yes.

560
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,520
Thank you for your call, ma'am.

561
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:51,920
Okay.

562
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,500
Praise Bob.

563
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,180
Bye-bye.

564
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,600
Bye.

565
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,360
Yeah, could I ask,

566
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,520
Evan Stein, your question?

567
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,100
Yeah, go ahead.

568
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,440
Do you think that all men who join your church

569
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,020
have to be circumcised?

570
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,160
Oh, no, no.

571
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,820
No?

572
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,500
Absolutely.

573
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,620
You're not the chosen people?

574
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:09,680
What?

575
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,260
You're not the chosen people?

576
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,800
I didn't catch that.

577
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,240
He's saying you're not the chosen people?

578
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,860
Yeah, well, we're chosen by Bob,

579
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,700
but Bob never, I mean,

580
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,560
he wants you to keep everything you were born with.

581
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,360
But you don't have to be circumcised

582
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,480
if you're a male in order to join,

583
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,300
or you're a chick.

584
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:27,980
No.

585
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,400
Okay.

586
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,180
Females do.

587
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,280
Females do?

588
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:30,800
Yeah.

589
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,180
Would you explain that to me?

590
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,100
I can't imagine how.

591
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,260
Could you please explain how you circumcise a female?

592
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,440
No, I cannot do so over the radio.

593
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,160
Well, could I ask Jim?

594
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,440
Now, now, now, now, sir.

595
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:42,940
Yes.

596
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,280
Sir, remember, Reverend Ivan Stang is not a doctor.

597
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:47,900
I'm sorry.

598
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,040
For specific information,

599
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,640
you'd have to consult your own physician.

600
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,940
That's Dr. Drummond.

601
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,100
Dr. Drummond.

602
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,460
He's in the room file as well.

603
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,160
Light brain man.

604
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:57,660
Okay.

605
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
All better now.

606
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,800
I can tell you who the tallest angel in heaven is,

607
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,920
or the name of the angel you should invoke to procure women,

608
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,320
or the name of hell's ambassador to England,

609
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,840
or the true name of the angel of poetry.

610
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,700
Look at the picture.

611
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,800
See the skull,

612
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,580
the part of bone removed,

613
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,520
the master race Frankenstein radio controls,

614
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,280
the brain,

615
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,620
the thoughts broadcasting radio,

616
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,840
the eyesight television,

617
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,780
the Frankenstein earphone radio,

618
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,600
the threshold brainwash radio,

619
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,280
the latest new skull reforming to contain all Frankenstein controls,

620
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,560
even in thin skulls of white pedigree males.

621
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,900
Visible Frankenstein controls,

622
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,060
the synthetic nerve radio directional antenna loop.

623
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,660
Make copies for yourself.

624
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,400
There is no escape from this worse gangster police state

625
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,400
using all of the deadly gangster Frankenstein controls.

626
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,640
In 1965, CIA gangster police beat me bloody,

627
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,340
dragged me in chains from Kennedy New York Airport.

628
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,260
Since then, I hide in forced jobless poverty,

629
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,460
isolated alone in this low deadly old house.

630
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,940
The brazen deadly gangster police spray me with poison nerve gas

631
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,400
from automobile exhausts and even lawn mowers.

632
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,260
Deadly assaults even in my yard with knives,

633
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,720
even bricks and stones,

634
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,880
even deadly touch cabin or electric shock flashlights,

635
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,840
even remote electronically controlled arrivals,

636
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,380


637
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,960
even the round corners projection of deadly touch tarantula spiders,

638
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,540
or even bloody murder accidents.

639
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,060
To shut me up forever with a sneak undetectable extermination,

640
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,480
even with trained parroting puppet assassins

641
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,800
in maximum security insanity prison

642
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,000
for writing these unforgivable truths.

643
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,800
Until my undetectable extermination,

644
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,000
I, Francis E. Deck Esquire, 29 Maple Avenue, Hempstead, New York,

645
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:55,360
I stand alone against your mad, deadly, worldwide conspiratorial gangster competition.

646
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,380
I'm the computer god communism with wall-to-wall deadly gangster protection,

647
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,220
lifelong sworn conspirators, murder incorporated organized crime,

648
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,480
the police and judges, the deadly sneak parroting puppet gangsters

649
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,180
using all the gangster deadly Frankenstein controls,

650
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,900
these hangman rope sneak deadly gangsters,

651
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,240
the judges and the police trick, trap, rob, wreck, butcher,

652
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,100
and murder the people that keep them terrorized

653
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,940
in gangster Frankenstein earphone radio slavery,

654
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,360
for the Communist Gangster.

655
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,140
The gangster government and con artist parroting puppet gangster playboy scum on top.

656
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,280
The secret work of all police in order to maintain a communist closed society.

657
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,940
The same worldwide mad, deadly, communist gangster computer god

658
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,980
that controls you as a terrorized gangster Frankenstein earphone radio slave parroting puppet.

659
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,820
You are a terrorized member of the master race worldwide,

660
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,400
four billion eyesight television camera guinea pig,

661
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,780
gangster computer god master race,

662
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:04,600
your living, king, mad, deadly, worldwide communist gangster computer god secret overall plan,

663
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,900
worldwide living death Frankenstein slavery,

664
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,220
to explore and control the entire universe with the endless stairway to the stars,

665
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:19,440
namely the man-made inside out planets with nucleonic powered speeds much faster than the speed of light.

666
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,300
Look up and see the gangster computer god concocted new fake starry sky,

667
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,460
worldwide completely controlled deadly degenerative climate and atmosphere,

668
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,640
through the new world round translucent exotic gaseous envelope,

669
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,600
which the worldwide communist gangster computer god manipulates

670
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,320
through countless exactly positioned satellites,

671
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,760
the new fake phony stars.

672
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,160
Watch out world, something big is coming your way.

673
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,400
They're alive, they're bold, they're friendly, they're the crazy Christians.

674
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,340
Walking down your street, sharing with your neighbors, sharing with your children, and yes, even sharing with you.

675
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,900
Last Supper Pictures presents the crazy Christians.

676
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,540
There's nothing else like it.

677
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,660
They carry a Bible in their hand and a smile on their face.

678
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,820
They touch people's lives wherever they go.

679
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,160
Many may laugh in mockery, but soon you'll be laughing with joy.

680
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,880
As you meet up with the crazy Christians, you'll see scenes like this.

681
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,800
Hey, how you doing?

682
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,060
Hey, pretty good, how you doing?

683
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,700
Okay, uh, hey, why aren't you in church? You know it's Sunday.

684
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,160
I don't go to church.

685
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,680
SINNER! YOU WILL BURN! YOU WILL BURN IN THE BOWS OF HELL!

686
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,140
THE FLAMES WILL EAT YOU! YOU WILL DIE!

687
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,220
Yes, where crazy Christians go, joy and love follow.

688
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,020
Watch out, they're everywhere spreading the good news.

689
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,540
So what are our responsibilities?

690
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,120
I'll tell you what they are first.

691
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,140
We must convulse.

692
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,260
What?

693
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,040
We must convert the heathen if we have to force it down his throat.

694
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,140
His medicine is for his own good.

695
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,900
He may not want it, but it's for his own good.

696
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,720
And likewise, we must have his money.

697
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,760
For money is the root to all evil.

698
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,740
And the more the church has, the less there is for Satan to influence with.

699
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,760
God, strike me if it won't stop.

700
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,040
Yes, soon even you will be saying things like,

701
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,300
Praise the Lord, in Jesus' name, and it's all gonna burn.

702
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,660
No more will you be filled with fear, frustration, and depression

703
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,900
when your life is touched by those crazy Christians.

704
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,460
The world is ready.

705
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,300
Christ is returning.

706
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,700
See it and believe it.

707
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,740
Crazy Christians is appearing everywhere.

708
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,740
Now just what could have happened to get such a piece of trice?

709
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,560
You have no idea what I've gone through in the last three months.

710
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,060
Worldwide, systematic, instant plastic surgery, butchery, murder, fake aging,

711
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,200
so all people are dead or useless by age 70.

712
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,760
Done at night to you.

713
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,920
You as a Frankenstein slave parroting puppet gangster slave.

714
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:05,060
Now even you know I am a menace to your worldwide mad deadly communist gangster computer god.

715
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,560
Therefore, I must go to extermination.

716
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,160
Before I am exterminated by this gangster computer god,

717
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,400
concocted and controlled, worst mongrel, organized crime,

718
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,960
murder incorporated gangster communist government,

719
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:24,420
I hand you the secrets to save the entire human race and the entire universe.

720
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:31,780
Donate money or even a manual typewriter to me for your only hope for a future.

721
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,260
Can you hear me?

722
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,780
Yes, everything fell on me.

723
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,660
We hear you, but you didn't hear us when we asked for contributions.

724
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,220
We asked and we asked and we asked, but you didn't hear us.

725
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,280
Now it's your turn to see how it feels.

726
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,380
The American double cross.

727
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,780
You ignored us.

728
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,220
Now we're going to ignore you.

729
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,340
Please, hurry!

730
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:08,200
And, uh, that worries us.

731
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,760
I was held captive all night later in chains.

732
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,460
I refused both all food and requests I go to sleep.

733
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:21,640
Then CIA police gangsters pretending to be Polish police with no identification beat me bloodily.

734
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,740
Later, while my return trip 707 Boeing Jet Air,

735
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,920
my airliner was being serviced for my return trip,

736
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,640
I quickly walked into the airplane and saw a CIA gangster with a small electric hair dryer type blower

737
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:38,560
pumping deadly poison nerve gas smoke into secret compartments under the ashtrays in the arms of the chairs

738
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,360
where later I was ordered to sit in the airplane full of CIA underlings, passengers,

739
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,440
my assassins who giggled as they watched me dragged in chains by the airplane.

740
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,820
By the gangster CIA police gangsters, these deadly gangster CIA passengers,

741
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,740
they pressed the frontal panel of the ashtrays in the seat arm.

742
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,380
to release the deadly poison nerve gas smoke.

743
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,200
Indubitably, all of the other deadly CIA underling gangsters aboard this staged return flight,

744
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,220
they all had taken the top secret poison nerve gas antidote pill,

745
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,780
immuning them from the deadly poison nerve gas smoke.

746
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,300
Deadly poison nerve gas smoke was sprayed at me from cigars, cigarettes, and even from ballpoint pens.

747
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,000
Also from the wig of a woman sitting next to me.

748
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,360
Even the Swiss cheese type ice cubes were evaporating into poison nerve gas smoke in all of the free drinks.

749
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,720
I got up and went to the rear of the airplane by the rear exit door with a large push-up.

750
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,940
My Frankenstein brain thoughts broadcasting radio disclosed my intentions.

751
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,820
Immediately, the loudspeakers screamed that the flight was over

752
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,880
and that our airplane was already preparing to land at Kennedy New York Airport.

753
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,180
You hangman rope sneak gangster playboy scum on top know these facts are true.

754
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,740
Not only from taking part in such undetectable exterminations,

755
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,580
but also you chicanerous, demented, felon parroting puppet gangsters

756
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:51,700
can watch my Frankenstein eyesight television playback of all these horrible, terrifying, deadly events.

757
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,440
When I returned home, Joseph I. Deck.

758
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,100
My only brother and deadly felon murderer and assassin spy agent against me for this gangster government.

759
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:05,480
He beat me repeatedly, cursing me that I was not exterminated by all of the poison nerve gas smoke

760
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,680
and that I did the impossible in that I kept awake for three days and refused all food

761
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,180
in order to prevent my sneak extermination.

762
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,900
The farmer in the dell, the farmer in the dell.

763
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,880
Hi-ho the dairy, oh the farmer in the dell.

764
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,620
Well, Mr. White, let's listen to the song...

765
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:24,720
Oh, I'm really excited.

766
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,100
...that's not going to intimidate.

767
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:25,620
...backwards.

768
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:34,360
Now I would kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy, kill mommy.

769
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,440
And now, Mr. White, do you have any comment?

770
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,540
The farmer in the dell is one of my favorite songs.

771
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,220
I was referring to the other lyrics, your lyrics, the subconscious lyrics.

772
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,120
Now, don't you think it's a little dangerous?

773
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,480
Dangerous? How? I mean, they're just lyrics.

774
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,860
Well, telling kids to kill their mothers.

775
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,520
Hey, now, wait a minute. We didn't tell kids to kill their mothers.

776
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,720
That was that artist expressing his love for the farmer in the dell.

777
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,320
He's expressing his own personal feelings, no one else's. Besides, no one takes that stuff seriously.

778
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,500
It could happen.

779
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,860
It could happen. Well, sure, it could happen. My molecules could line up with those in the chair and I could fall through, but it's very unlikely.

780
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,080
All right. Perhaps we should draw on a more direct example. Now, how about this selection?

781
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,600
Yankee Doodle went to town riding on a pony.

782
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,140
Stuck a feather in his head and called it Merk-

783
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,280
All right. Sounds harmless enough, but now let's listen backwards.

784
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:23,900
Merk-

785
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:31,560
Why steal when you can kill? Why steal when you can kill? Why steal when you can kill?

786
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,320
Mr. White, you're telling kids to kill.

787
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:42,200
Oh, come on. That was a rhetorical question. I don't see you defending us for discouraging thievery now.

788
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,220
Now, you're just trying to lower shoplifting losses, which proves you do expect subliminal messages to have an effect on listeners.

789
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,160
Oh, that doesn't prove anything. What it proves is that I don't like you.

790
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,180
What about a cover-up?

791
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,880
No, let's not.

792
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:01,920
Let's use the word cover-up, though, in the sense that it should be used and should not be used.

793
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,300
Be my guest, since you are.

794
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:11,160
If a cover-up is for the purpose of covering up criminal activities, it is illegal.

795
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,020
Mm-hmm. Oh.

796
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,840
I didn't believe that we were covering any criminal activities.

797
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:23,860
Well, I guess there you have it then. So I guess the whole Watergate thing was a pack of lies that the media invented to basically-

798
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:23,860


799
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,780
put their friend Jimmy in the office.

800
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,980
So let's talk about Jimmy for just a bit.

801
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:38,020
I've heard rumors- now, this is just rumors, mind you- that he is a little bit, uh, you know what I'm saying?

802
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,720
Is there any truth to that?

803
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,360
I'll never forget the day that we were riding on his yacht.

804
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,060
His yacht, that old Sequoia that President Carter has now put in mothballs.

805
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,460
We were sitting down at the end of the yacht.

806
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,800
In the back of the yacht.

807
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,020
Mm-hmm.

808
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,420
Together.

809
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,640
All of a sudden, impulsively, he reached over and grabbed me.

810
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,580
He was kind of like Johnson that way. He likes to grab people.

811
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,860
Johnson was that way too, eh?

812
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,180
He and Johnson would have had a lot of fun.

813
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:08,880
My goodness.

814
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,220
They're much alike.

815
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,000
Really?

816
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,380
And he put his arm around me and he said, you know-

817
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,560
No, no, no, maybe we better stop here. I don't want to get too personal about this, you know.

818
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,900
I mean, you gotta remember who our audience is.

819
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,440
So, uh, let's leave Jimmy alone.

820
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,100
Let's leave Jimmy and go on to another issue if we might.

821
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:29,940
Because you know what they're gonna say. They're gonna say that you only say that because he's a liberal and you're trying to discredit him.

822
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,920
I didn't want to discredit the man as an individual. I couldn't care less about the punk.

823
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,460
Oh, okay.

824
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,200
I wanted to discredit that kind of activity.

825
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,880
You've also been listening to Father Joe Mama.

826
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,800
A lot of Father Joe Mama. He had that rant there about stealing souls for Satan.

827
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,420
And also had a finger, one might say.

828
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,420
So to speak.

829
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,480
In the Bargain Basement Bob Art spot.

830
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,360
Which I believe was indeed at some point in there.

831
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,940
There you heard, as usual, some KPFA starring Dr. Howell.

832
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,800
The amazing Dr. Howell from the subgenius radio show in Berkeley.

833
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,420
And puzzling evidence in there.

834
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:22,380
Some clips from a radio talk show that yours truly revered.

835
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,860
Ivan Stang was on with some amazing callers.

836
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,200
Really wonderful callers.

837
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,800
But what you really want to know about is Francis E. Deck.

838
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,200
The serious ranting in there.

839
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,940
That's not actually Francis Deck's voice.

840
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,840
People have told me they thought that was actually him.

841
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:52,340
The Francis E. Deck material comes from posters that were put up on telephone poles in some New York state.

842
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,000
City.

843
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,380
That got pulled down and Xeroxed and sent around to various collectors such as myself.

844
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,780
And at some point in there, some radio guy, some announcer did the Francis Deck rant.

845
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:13,560
And you can look forward to all the Francis E. Deck you could ever want from us.

846
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,500
Although we have to censor it quite a bit.

847
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:22,320
Because he goes on and on about things that you just can't talk about in decent sense.

848
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,760
And that's the thing.

849
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:22,760


850
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:22,760


851
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,660
Or even among subgeniuses when you're talking about the radio.

852
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,100
The Crazy Christians bit from Kurt Kursteiner.

853
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,100
Whoever that is.

854
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,020
And also the back masking thing.

855
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:43,960
From material done, I think, with Papa Joe Mama's crew there.

856
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,360
Back when he was at Stanford.

857
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,460
That's...

858
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:53,860
Anyway, you're listening right now to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

859
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,740
And I'd love to give you an address that you could write to.

860
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,720
And if you just want to get some written information.

861
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,000
You don't want to tell us too much about you.

862
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,980
But you'd like to know what else we might have to offer.

863
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,600
Such as our books, our videotapes, and magazines, comics.

864
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,020
What is it? Bumper stickers, t-shirts, buttons.

865
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:27,700
All those stupid gee-gaws that would come with any kind of joke church.

866
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:37,320
Or with the last and ultimate, final, end times religion.

867
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,340
Just write to Bob.

868
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,720
That's right. You can just address it to Bob.

869
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,200
And it will get to us if you put the rest of these numbers on there.

870
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:53,580
At Post Office Box 140306.

871
00:42:53,660 --> 00:43:00,620
That's 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

872
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,180
Once again, that's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

873
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,180
Can this be the threshold of inner space?

874
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,520
Ladies and gentlemen.

875
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,640
This is our McDonnell Douglas Mission Control Room at Disneyland Spaceport.

876
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,620
The Director of Operations has been expecting you.

877
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,020
And while we're waiting for our flight to be called.

878
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,480
He'll take a few minutes to describe what's going on.

879
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,320
At the side post up ahead.

880
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,200
Your next stop.

881
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,920
Bob's Place! Bob's Place!

882
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

883
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

884
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:38,780
Wow!

885
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:40,940
Wow!

886
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,740
Wow!

887
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,840
Wow!

888
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:47,960


889
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,120
Wow!

890
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,760
That's a pile of horse manure, son!

891
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,520
The doctors will cut into your third nostril.

892
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,160
Open it up.

893
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,440
To reveal to your tiny brain.

894
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,040
A new dimension.

895
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,000
A new dimension in the heart.

896
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,980
Monsters become real.

897
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:19,860
Ah!

898
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,100
And you can see it through women's clothing.

899
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:24,420
Ha!

900
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,740
It saved my life.

901
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,320
It saved my life.

902
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,820
And it can save your life too.

903
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,920
So call now for your free no obligation information.

904
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,280
Call the number.

905
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,020
And...

906
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,940
I am the first person to make this fabulous journey.

907
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,060
Suspended in the timelessness of inner space.

908
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,860
The thought waves of my first impressions.

909
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,880
They will be our only source of contact.

910
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,340
Once you have passed beyond the limits of normal.

911
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,540
Magnification.

912
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:56,860
Magnification.

913
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,200
Magnification.

914
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,500
Magnification.

915
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,900
Jackie would you come here a second?

916
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,460
Yes, sir. This has got to stop.

917
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,180
See Mrs. Kennedy's pink suit?

918
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,980
There's a Secret Service man spread eagle over the top of the car.

919
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:17,580
Quote.

920
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,660
Suddenly her mouth opened and went all sort of slack.

921
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,100
As if hungry for flesh.

922
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,280
And made those noises in the throat.

923
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,120
And suddenly a bomb seemed to burst between our bellies.

924
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,120
Just noises.

925
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,920
And then a little boy said.

926
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,800
End of quotation.

927
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,700
Now do you see how far it has gone?

928
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,420
Mrs. Kennedy jumped up and grabbed Mr. Kennedy.

929
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,820
She called, oh no. The motorcade sped off.

930
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,120
But even as they made their escape.

931
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,620
Not only four.

932
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,200
They must launch again.

933
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,280
And just made a jump into hyperspace.

934
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:00,740
How's that?

935
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,600
Well, I tell you Mr. President. It's a good idea.

936
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,400
It's just a...

937
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,980
Well, a little corn ball.

938
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,020
A little, you know, not quite hip enough.

939
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:09,520
Yes.

940
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,760
You got something a little less gimmicky?

941
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,220
Me, me, Daddy.

942
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,540
I had my hand up first.

943
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,440
You did not. I have my hand up first.

944
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,600
You did not, Caroline. I had my hand up first.

945
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,560
You did not. I have my hand up first.

946
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,180
No, I want you youngsters to stop fighting among yourselves.

947
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,320
So go ahead, Bobby. I think you were first.

948
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,260
Senator Kennedy has been shot. Is that possible?

949
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,040
I can't have someone running around the country looking in.

950
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,160
I'm speaking exactly like me.

951
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,880
Well, how crooked can you get?

952
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:51,200
To enforce this, the legions of Chug-Dul-Dum march endlessly around the perimeter.

953
00:46:51,900 --> 00:47:03,940
These brave men, some of them rotten zombies, are our only defense against the giant Saurians of the steaming primitive jungle.

954
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,920
These brave men, some of them rotten zombies, are our only defense against the giant Saurians of the steaming primitive jungle.

955
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,760
And worst of all is the big cheese.

956
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:09,480
And worst of all is the big cheese.

957
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,040
Their bad-smelling, hairy god, King...

958
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,020
Their bad-smelling, hairy god, King...

959
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,320
Well, I can't say it on the radio.

960
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,240
Come on, man. Hey, what are you doing?

961
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,480
Yeah, I, I, all right. I didn't mention the name of that.

962
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,300
Yeah, I, I, all right. I didn't mention the name of that.

963
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,120
Right, yeah, the Hill-Thomas hearings are over.

964
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,100
We don't need to rake all that stuff through.

965
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,040
You know, everybody knows the name of that entity.

966
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,920
Can you describe what happened in the jungle on that fateful night?

967
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,620
Can you describe what happened in the jungle on that fateful night?

968
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,420
Well, uh, Ann Darrow was, uh, dragged away.

969
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,400
Well, uh, Ann Darrow was, uh, dragged away.

970
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,940
You know, that's, uh, that was a long time ago.

971
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,260
It was more than 50 years, but I remember it well.

972
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:42,540
It was more than 50 years, but I remember it well.

973
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,040
You see, uh, Kong dragged her up there, and, uh,

974
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,540
and, well, uh, let's just say that

975
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,740
that Driscoll and, uh,

976
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,700
and Ann, uh, did marry,

977
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,480
but they immediately divorced.

978
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,180
And, uh, when reporters asked why,

979
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,140
And, uh, when reporters asked why,

980
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,160
Driscoll quipped, uh, you'd have to ask Kong about that one.

981
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:00,320
Driscoll quipped, uh, you'd have to ask Kong about that one.

982
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,600
Which has always led, uh, theorists to specialize in the theory of the world.

983
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:03,740
Which has always led, uh, theorists to specialize in the theory of the world.

984
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:06,820
That there might have been something between Ann and Kong

985
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,420
that there might have been something between Ann and Kong

986
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,700
when he took her up into the left eye socket of the giant skull on Skull Island

987
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,000
and, well, uh, you know, he, uh,

988
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,980
he showed her his, uh, bag of tricks.

989
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,600
That is to say...

990
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,000
Well, you're listening to the Kim Kong Hour.

991
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,720
Call us here at 510-848-4425

992
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,780
for your personalized question about Kim Kong.

993
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,240
Say, did you ever hear of

994
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,280
Kong?

995
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,680
Eh, why, yes, I'm a primitive native superstition.

996
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:30,980
Eh, why, yes, I'm a primitive native superstition.

997
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,500
Not native superstitions.

998
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:33,860
Something, Captain.

999
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,120
Something monstrous.

1000
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,480
All-powerful.

1001
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,660
Still living.

1002
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:44,120
Still holding that island in a grip of deadly fear.

1003
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,460
Still living. Still holding that island in a grip of deadly fear.

1004
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,200
And you expect I'll photograph it?

1005
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:47,840
Sure!

1006
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,060
If it's there, you bet I'll photograph it.

1007
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,580
Eh, what if it doesn't like having its picture taken?

1008
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,600
Well, now you know why I brought along

1009
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:56,960
Well, now you know why I brought along

1010
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,780
those gas bombs.

1011
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,060
Say, don't I smell one of them now?

1012
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:04,980
Boyo!

1013
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,960
Odo konobi so!

1014
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,420
See, they're ringing the Kong gong.

1015
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,420
Because when they ring the Kong gong, they...

1016
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,100
How long are they gonna sound like that at a gong like that?

1017
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,520
That's stupid. They got that...

1018
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,100
Oh, I don't know. You know, it comes from some ancient civilization.

1019
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,560
They knew how to do it back then.

1020
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,040
Special sounds from the Zonker people.

1021
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,200
Yep, that's right.

1022
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,000
Shocking, the old giant empty body of Kong.

1023
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,460
See if we can get some life out of it here.

1024
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,000
Oh, that never works.

1025
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,080
But it's worth a try, because we've got the old

1026
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,800
Frankenstein set. I bought that too.

1027
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,460
All these old sets, Hal. I wanna...

1028
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,680
Here, we'll crank up the soundtrack music really loud.

1029
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,400
Well, I'd like to, but you know,

1030
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,480
I wanna get out into that dinosaur-infested

1031
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,380
jungle and take some snapshots

1032
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,440
with my Polaroid.

1033
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,640
You got all the dinosaurs from Baby out there.

1034
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:54,600
Eww!

1035
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,740
Well, they won't last long against those stop-motion

1036
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,120
brutes.

1037
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,560
Yeah, a couple

1038
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,600
midgets in a canvas bag aren't about to

1039
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,480
tangle with a 50-foot

1040
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,200
obesosaurus.

1041
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,600
And then there

1042
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,420
are the other strange critters

1043
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,200
of the Skull Island farm.

1044
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,620
For example, the giant Egyptian

1045
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,560
snake, which was actually

1046
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,860
cut from the final film.

1047
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,680
And the Ramporincae

1048
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,580
and Dimorphodons

1049
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,740
seen flitting through the trees.

1050
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,940
A strange

1051
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,620
reptile with only two limbs, which resembles

1052
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,580
the prehistoric Desmatosuchus,

1053
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,640
which climbs up to menace Driscoll

1054
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,060
as he hides in the cave

1055
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,620
from Kong's probing

1056
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,360
fingers. Your witness, Mr. Freud.

1057
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,380
We're working on now

1058
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,300
the integration of testing and quality assurance

1059
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,120
of the image of Kong during the show here.

1060
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,180
Ah, comes somewhat fuzzy image.

1061
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,500
Oh, that's him.

1062
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,180
The components were produced at many different plants

1063
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,020
and places and were subject to elaborate procedures

1064
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,180
for component testing during the final

1065
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,840
subject testing of the movie.

1066
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,620
There you go again.

1067
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1068
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,080
There's the thruster at the control system.

1069
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,800
There we go. Stop thrusting and pay attention.

1070
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,700
The dog thing was loaded.

1071
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,740
You know, that picture of Kong is a little bit fuzzy.

1072
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,100
Oh, I see that's him.

1073
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,160
Here's the mushy part of him.

1074
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,260
Yes, he sinks into the mush as everyone cries.

1075
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,300
He's calling out to his friend,

1076
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,900
Mighty Joe Young, to pull him out.

1077
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,720
But Joe wouldn't

1078
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,260
because, you know,

1079
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,900
it wasn't the airplanes.

1080
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,220
It was

1081
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,540
residuals killed in the movie.

1082
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,500
Now Superman and Lex Luthor

1083
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,840
are running over to try to pull Kong out.

1084
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,680
Get those two bozos out.

1085
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,980
No one could pull Kong out of that asphalt swamp.

1086
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,360
Now Darth Vader is flying around

1087
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,360
in his cool little Batmobile trying to

1088
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,620
also pull Kong out.

1089
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,480
Officer, let me through.

1090
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,500
I'm Carl Denim.

1091
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,220
Denim? Why, that's the man that captured the monster.

1092
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:55,820
Oh.

1093
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,420
Well, Mr. Denim,

1094
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,980
the airplanes got him.

1095
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,180
Oh, no.

1096
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,660
It wasn't the airplanes.

1097
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,820
It was Beauty killed the beast.

1098
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,960
Just how many shots did Beauty fire?

1099
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,820
That's what we were wondering.

1100
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,420
Well, uh,

1101
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,200
two came from the forward aircraft.

1102
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,380
Oh, yeah, thank you.

1103
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,600
A little bit of ice there for me.

1104
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,560
Yeah, thank you.

1105
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,980
Yeah, you know,

1106
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,180
two of those guys in the aircraft,

1107
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,680
the aircraft pilot and the spotter,

1108
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:31,440
because it took two to fly one of those biplanes off Curtis Field,

1109
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,140
were in fact

1110
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,620
Marion C. Cooper and Ernest Schoetzek,

1111
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:40,060
who wanted to be sure they were in it to kill

1112
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,080
when they shot old Kong down.

1113
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,520
That's who's at Love Field.

1114
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,000
The little airplane with the motor running.

1115
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,580
The afternoon that it happened.

1116
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,140
Yes, and then they say

1117
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,620
Carl Denim went over and,

1118
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,580
well, you know,

1119
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:56,660
he was a little bit too busy.

1120
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:56,660


1121
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,280
He was a little bit too busy to go in the bullet exit wound of Kong.

1122
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,480
But that's just a nasty story that was...

1123
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,520
Well, that was started by some

1124
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,480
Kong conspiracy theorists.

1125
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,580
It's never been proven.

1126
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,260
Now the autopsy on the giant

1127
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,220
empty shell of Kong has started.

1128
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,280
Ah, get back!

1129
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,140
Downwind, give me some air!

1130
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,480
Giant mats of hair that

1131
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,880
Dino De Laurentiis has patched on here

1132
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:19,500
are being...

1133
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,180
Terrible how De Laurentiis ripped off

1134
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,620
huge chunks of hair from the actual

1135
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,520
Kong stuffed dummy

1136
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,480
in the museum for his stupid

1137
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,480
King Kong model.

1138
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,120
You know, he ripped it off the last

1139
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,480
taxidermist specimen of one of those Skull Island

1140
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,700
simians and used it on

1141
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,520
his stupid model which was used in only

1142
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,180
two shots of his stupid movie

1143
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,880
and the whole thing was just stupid.

1144
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,260
Oh, look at this, a bright clear signal.

1145
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,020
Okay, now this is the X-ray of the monster's head.

1146
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,460
See, we think that something's still alive in here.

1147
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,780
Yeah, probably some giant maggot

1148
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,480
from that island.

1149
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,240
Hmm, yes.

1150
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,060
A magnificent skull, isn't it?

1151
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,220
A woman lives in a basket inside a big castle

1152
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:00,860
with no furniture.

1153
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,080
Notice this skull has more cranial capacity

1154
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,800
in proportion than a

1155
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,460
gorilla of a normal size.

1156
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,020
I mean, this is not only a giant gorilla,

1157
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,120
he has a larger brain than he should have for his size.

1158
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,500
Maybe this caller has some

1159
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,540
idea, but maybe it's just

1160
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,580
a time-wasting Twitter.

1161
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,780
Don't chicken out now, we need your help to find out

1162
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,600
whose skull this is and get it back to the netherworld.

1163
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,300
Yeah, well,

1164
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,540
there's no point in rifling through that caller's

1165
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:26,880
drawers.

1166
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:29,760
Whew.

1167
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,120
Don't you think it's somewhat hot in here?

1168
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,780
Where's that heat coming from?

1169
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,000
Hmm, I don't know.

1170
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,840
There probably isn't these aliens

1171
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,040
behind the flight suits here.

1172
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,580
Oh, I guess they need it a little hotter

1173
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,100
than we do.

1174
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,380
It must come from some place where the mean temperature

1175
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,280
is really mean, if you know what I mean.

1176
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,460
Oh, oh, oh.

1177
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,660
And that's where the Church of the Subtlnious

1178
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,520
takes a little bit of explaining,

1179
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,700
but I don't mind explaining these things.

1180
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,020
Before I go too far, children, I should point out

1181
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,540
that the Pope of all New York

1182
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,240
doesn't practice what he preaches,

1183
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,680
because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

1184
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,900
Children, the fourth rule of the Church of the Subtlnious

1185
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,620
is, you will

1186
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,660
pay to know what you

1187
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:15,320
really think.

1188
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,740
What do we mean by this, children? Well, let's say

1189
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,540
you want to go see a movie, and

1190
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:22,360
you get your New Yorker in the mail, and

1191
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,640
you turn to that Pauline Taylor, Terrance Rappaport,

1192
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,840
Review, and you read what he or she has to say

1193
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,740
about it. Well, you've paid to know

1194
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,020
what you really think.

1195
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,780
Or let's say you want to go to one of the many lovely bars

1196
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,700
here, Nolens, and you pick up

1197
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,420
that free monthly music magazine,

1198
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,080
and you read a review there.

1199
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,620
Before you go, well, children, you've paid to know

1200
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,860
what you really think.

1201
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,620
And children, when you tithe to

1202
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,300
buy that which is

1203
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,060
Bob's, your money,

1204
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,760
again, you have paid to know

1205
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,740
what you really think. But for once,

1206
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,200
children, you will get value.

1207
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,160
For your money.

1208
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,160
And children, you must have been

1209
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:26,780
blind.

1210
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,760
I can see

1211
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,260
on the

1212
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,120
dawn of this

1213
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:34,860
morning

1214
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,460
A new

1215
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,560
ray of hope

1216
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,240
for mankind

1217
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,200
And your dead

1218
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,680
men, they are marching

1219
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,080
Allegiance

1220
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,520
to endings

1221
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,020
A road

1222
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,560
Where the highways begin

1223
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,700
And your young people are leaving

1224
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,640
Their candles like campfires

1225
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,680
In darkness to walk in the sun

1226
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:21,320
Your young men will follow your teachings

1227
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:29,260
Now they know the rounds you've done

1228
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:38,720
And they've heard all your two-sided preachings

1229
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:44,740
Now we know just what must be won

1230
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:50,560
In the sweet of the final life

1231
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,260
And the sweet of the final life

1232
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,760
Close freely and clearly

1233
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,260
For the grave of the now

1234
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,780
While you can

1235
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,480
And form a great circle

1236
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,760
That shall not be broken

1237
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:15,680
Proclaim the freedom of man

1238
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,720
Just like the

1239
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:24,720


1240
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:24,720

00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:24,720
