1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,860
When the world has finally ended, and by divine decree, you have to pick your cam.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,220
Did you watch or make TV?

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,740
And lining up on one side is the undifferentiated mess, and on the other, the celebrities being

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,600
given their go-to-hell-quickly pass.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,660
Well, I'd hop out of the big line and go to hell without a doubt, if that meant I got

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,440
the chance to punch John Williamson out.

7
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,680
The jury will now retire.

8
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,520
We're changing the program pretty soon, or not the program, but the actual tower that

9
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,220
we performed our fecundity in.

10
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,560
I hope that doesn't happen during this show.

11
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,700
I hope not, too.

12
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,440
We might get not only evicted, but we have been given the special head thing.

13
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,880
Princess, you have to get closer.

14
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,820
Okay, all right.

15
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,560
Lower those microphones, Dave.

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,520
Lower one of the mics so that she can get to it, and raise one so that you can get to

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,300
the high one.

18
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,200
So Dave is high, and we is low.

19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,100
All right.

20
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,480
And I'm the middle bear.

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,120
Okay.

22
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,500
I'm between bear.

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,160
I'm going to disobey now, because this one is practically dead.

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,820
We already had a system going.

25
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,500
So just get in there whenever you want to.

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
I'll just lean my face up in there, okay?

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,220
How's that?

28
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:07,560
Yeah.

29
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,000
How?

30
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,220
I wish we had stereo.

31
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,260
I wish we had another better microphone.

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,120
And I wish we would suddenly go to this.

33
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,900
You never pay, said Negrat.

34
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,220
That's not the point, said Granny Weatherwax.

35
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,300
They shouldn't be allowed to charge that sort of money.

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,800
That's thieving, Matties.

37
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,120
I don't see how it can be thieving if you don't pay anyway, Negrat persisted.

38
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,800
I never pay for anything, said Granny.

39
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,840
People never let me pay.

40
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,100
I can't help it if people give me things the whole time, can I?

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,140
When I walk down the street, people are always running out with cakes they've just baked,

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,400
and fresh beer, and old clothes that have already been worn at all.

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,140
Oh, Mistress Weatherwax, pray take this basket of eggs, they say.

44
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,440
People are always very kind.

45
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,380
Treat people right, and they'll treat you right.

46
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,580
It's respect.

47
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,740
Not having to pay, she finished sternly, is what being a witch is all about.

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,520
I'd rather be a cack-eyed, awkward knob than you,

49
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,360
for all your perfect teeth and hand jobs.

50
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,000
I'd rather be the silently resentful, weird one

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,020
than the back-slapped, chest-poking young gun.

52
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,100
For every moment you've had of adolescent bliss,

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,940
I've spent ten regretting everything I've missed.

54
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,740
For every stroke, every goal,

55
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,380
every glance and kiss there were blows,

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,240
failure, mockery and less.

57
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,800
Yet I'd rather be me.

58
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,440
You preening, dumb tool.

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,140
You vacuous, confident, ignorant, poor, dumb tool.

60
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,960
Who wants to be me?

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,760
No one.

62
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,380
You.

63
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,700
They sell magazines with how-to guides.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,560
People shell out money.

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,540
Jog.

66
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,440
Get surgery.

67
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,860
But mainly just dream of the day there will be more like you.

68
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,340
Grass green, never greener, grows over the fence between us.

69
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,560
Penis length, I'm sure, is in your favour.

70
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,400
Your penis, in fact, is the hero of this and every other hour

71
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,240
and can access all orifice, stinkbox, blurter and growler.

72
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,540
They didn't break.

73
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,020
They didn't break the mould when they made you, mate.

74
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,280
That mould was mass produced.

75
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,420
Does it grate that on every corner, in every bar there's you?

76
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,340
You have never said one thing completely new.

77
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,500
Not thought, one thought, not thought before.

78
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,900
You Cleomag, Channel V.

79
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,520
As seen on TV bore.

80
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,880
You school kids' idea of bliss.

81
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,020
You teen idol.

82
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,080
Package.

83
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,140
Construct.

84
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,580
Robot.

85
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,140
Product.

86
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,580
Lackey.

87
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,080
Baggage.

88
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,320
I would rather be me, despite my self-disappointment.

89
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,420
I would rather be me, because of that disappointment.

90
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,120
Disappointment.

91
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,520
I would rather be me, unknown, weak, bent and poor.

92
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,260
I would rather be me, with every mistake and flaw.

93
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:44,180
I would rather be me, because in the whole universe of us,

94
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,560
in the galaxies of people, in the glowing, incalculable nimbus,

95
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,620
you provide the great system with naught.

96
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:08,740
A which never midst of the past, will not be possible.

97
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,220
It is

98
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,940
w confronting straight l.

99
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,560
Lonely! A star!

100
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,000
Friends, that incredible rant was by TISM.

101
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,960
That is a mysterious Australian group, a somewhat residency, called TISM.

102
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,980
T-I-S-M, short for This Is Serious, Mum.

103
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:44,960
I, in my ivory tower, knew nothing of them, but Bob's ward, Uncle Onan Cannabite,

104
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:52,740
sent me a selection of their stuff, and thus this hour of slack number 1,152 is rather TISM-ish,

105
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,760
and music by them will be coming up, too.

106
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,620
The Myrrh did the titles, and the witches are from Terry Pratchett's The Witches Abroad.

107
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,060
But now, let's steal from KOA Denver's Rick Barber Show.

108
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,860
Back again with my guest, we're talking with Reverend Ivan Stang.

109
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,940
He is the founder of the Church of the Sovereign.

110
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,600
A lot of people want to know, what's a subgenius?

111
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,620
I guess we ought to explain this, shouldn't we?

112
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,640
Well, first off, I feel like I have to correct something.

113
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,620
I'm not really the founder of the religion.

114
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,520
I'm just like the head clerk that answers the phone.

115
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,180
Bob founded the religion.

116
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,160
So anybody who gets angry about this, kill Bob, not me.

117
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,940
That's practically one of our slogans.

118
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,720
I like that.

119
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:44,940
Don't blame me.

120
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,240
Blame me.

121
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,960
Blame Bob.

122
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:46,720
Blame Bob.

123
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,080
But, yeah, right on the surface, the word subgenius can mean anybody under a genius.

124
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,240
So almost anybody qualifies.

125
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,240
Anybody with 30 bucks qualifies to be an ordained subgenius minister.

126
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:09,700
What we like to say is that the subgeniuses are what you might call the mutants, the misfits,

127
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,800
the class clowns, the disbelievers, or the people who will believe anything.

128
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,180
The kooks, the crazies, and the visionaries who actually invent everything.

129
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,380
And you've heard the phrase, trying to herd cats.

130
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,220
Yeah, right.

131
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:27,440
Yeah.

132
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,980
It's a disorganized religion for non-joiners.

133
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:41,720
So you can see that our business model is not really quite as – for some reason, we

134
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,940
don't have quite as much money as the sign policy.

135
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,460
The religious religious religious and some of these other businesslike religions do,

136
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:48,800
yeah.

137
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,040
And you wonder why that is.

138
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,260
Well, I think it's because some of our preachers have trouble keeping a straight face.

139
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,340
Well, that's understandable, yeah.

140
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,800
But then you listen to some of the people about Scientology, and I mean, I can't keep

141
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,320
a straight face.

142
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,500
Right.

143
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,800
And sometimes it almost seems like the Church of the Subgeniuses become redundant because

144
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,680
that with the Internet you can look into the minds of any extremist instantly.

145
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:22,480
there's i mean uh and we love the fringe people and the the extremists and everything weird and

146
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,000
that's really what the church of the subgenius is it's kind of a club for weirdos but by definition

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,700
weirdos don't usually get along all that well no they keep to themselves pretty much but that's

148
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:39,960
where it all works doesn't it yeah we're full of this is the religion for lone nuts you could say

149
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,920
perfect yeah oh the kids the kids are always oh 15 minutes more my show's almost done i had to

150
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,680
call him three times at the end of the three times i wasn't sounding as nice as i was sounding the

151
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,540
first time i called him and he said you know you don't have to use that tone studies have found

152
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:00,000
that children spend more time every day playing video games and watching tv than they do playing

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,200
outside too much media viewing has become a significant problem in most modern homes

154
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,080
well ironically it's an electronic device that comes to the rescue

155
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,520
bob

156
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,800
bob helps parents monitor and manage the time that their children spend using in-home media

157
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,560
the power cord from one of these devices plugs into the back of bob and is locked in place

158
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,060
bob then plugs into an electrical outlet the setup process takes about three minutes a no-brainer and

159
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,940
it's virtually tamper-proof each child in the house has a four-digit pin you

160
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,500
that they enter before they turn on the attached device

161
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,820
bob tracks the time used and when that time is used up bob does not allow any

162
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,140
more power to operate until the next scheduled day so if you want to regulate

163
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,500
viewing time and gain peace of mind put bob on the job

164
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,120
dr. sinister remember a couple of years ago you where we're all set to have a

165
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,920
show about the singularity ah and I called in and was there a sir mr.еля Milne-M gl raise

166
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:09,920


167
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,140
anti-singularitarian.

168
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,120
...offensively mean about it.

169
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,280
And you basically

170
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,240
pretty much hung up on me.

171
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,560
But recently,

172
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,280
I was reading more about that

173
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,560
in Ray Kerr's wheel.

174
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,200
Yeah, it's really,

175
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,020
unless civilization

176
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,120
wipes itself out,

177
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,280
which I think

178
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,240
is a very real possibility,

179
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:27,740
you know,

180
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,220
if civilization is not wiped out

181
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,880
the next hundred years,

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,900
I frankly see it as inevitable.

183
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,840
Well, the problem,

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,840
the singularity

185
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,040
is plausible enough.

186
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,960
It's just that

187
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,000
it's leaving out

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,640
the opposing force

189
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,060
of the idiog...

190
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,840
The idiocracy?

191
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,260
Idiocracy.

192
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,260
Yeah, the ideogularity.

193
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,080
The ideogularity

194
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,680
is in progress,

195
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,100
is approaching

196
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,500
at the same time.

197
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,540
So you've got

198
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,800
a certain number of,

199
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,640
well, you've got machines

200
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,800
that are getting smarter

201
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,860
and smarter and smarter.

202
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,820
Machines should think.

203
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,000
But at the same time,

204
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,100
the machines are training

205
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,080
the humans to become

206
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,200
dumber and dumber and dumber.

207
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,020
Machines should think.

208
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,800
People should work.

209
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,100
Nah, I don't know about that.

210
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,560
But that's,

211
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:08,900
I, I,

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,860
actually, I got some,

213
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,600
I got some friends

214
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,280
in a band who,

215
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,380
I want a robot maid

216
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,480
who's so lifelike

217
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,840
that when she turns on me,

218
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,720
I'm almost glad.

219
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,120
Oh, you mean,

220
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,620
would you settle for Rosie,

221
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,400
the robot from the Jetsons?

222
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,980
No, I would rather have

223
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,440
the one that Mr. Tyrell had.

224
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,280
Oh, the Blade Runner.

225
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,800
The Nexus 6 model

226
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,740
that lives forever

227
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,500
and is really hot,

228
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,660
played by Sean Young.

229
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,360
That would be the robot maid

230
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
I would like to have.

231
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:35,880
But,

232
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,980
they lied to me.

233
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:38,980


234
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:38,980


235
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,120
They lied to us

236
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,920
about all of that.

237
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,900
Well, actually,

238
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,280
the main,

239
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,880
here's,

240
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,700
here's the main thing

241
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,020
that the futurists of the past

242
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,620
got wrong

243
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,600
that has made

244
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,540
all of their predictions,

245
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,140
you know,

246
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,660
not come true, basically,

247
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,060
is they,

248
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,820
they assumed that energy

249
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,740
was going to get cheaper

250
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,180
and cheaper.

251
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,140
Well,

252
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,060
and that right there.

253
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,560
Well, you never know

254
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,340
what might be up next.

255
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:58,940
But, uh.

256
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, I tell you

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,800
one thing that's up next.

258
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,760
We got another caller here.

259
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,960
Hello, you're on the air.

260
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,660
I was just wondering

261
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,240
what is the big difference

262
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,420
between being bad

263
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:08,960
to the boss,

264
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:08,980


265
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,280
and having tickle foot?

266
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:12,960
Uh.

267
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,160
The difference between

268
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,280
being bad to the bone

269
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:15,720
and what?

270
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,200
This is Larson Cowboy Dave.

271
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,980
Speak up, Matt.

272
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,220
Having tickle foot.

273
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,560
Tickle foot?

274
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:20,940
Tickle foot.

275
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,700
Not pickle foot,

276
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,040
like you'd have in a bar.

277
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,320
Tickle foot,

278
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,620
you know,

279
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,120
when you feel

280
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,740
the vibrations all the time.

281
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,360
The seismic operations

282
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,040
going on.

283
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,620
We were just having

284
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,020
an intellectual discussion

285
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,240
about the future

286
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,040
of the very human race.

287
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,920
And you come in

288
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,640
here talking about

289
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,700
tickle foot.

290
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,600
Which Dave has left

291
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,760
behind a long time ago.

292
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,800
Well, can't you just

293
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,760
juxtapose?

294
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,800
Can't you just,

295
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,600
geez, guys,

296
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,880
just juxtapose

297
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,520
what I'm saying

298
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,700
and it makes perfect sense.

299
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:51,920
Sure.

300
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,600
It does.

301
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,240
It really does.

302
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,180
Sure.

303
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,220
Actually, you know,

304
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,340
we are constantly moving

305
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,720
through space

306
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,800
and there is some vibrations

307
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,440
involved in the movement

308
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:02,980
through space.

309
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,780
And those vibrations

310
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,520
would possibly

311
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,040
vibrate to

312
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,960
the human race.

313
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:08,960


314
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:08,960


315
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:08,960


316
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,380
Badly.

317
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,260
To the bone.

318
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,640
Yeah.

319
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,280
And cause tickle foot.

320
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,980
And make us bad

321
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,880
to the bone.

322
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,040
Absolutely.

323
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,040
Not in a good way,

324
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,380
of course.

325
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,160
I mean, you know,

326
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,980
our bones are becoming bad.

327
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,040
Well, the atoms

328
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,820
in your body

329
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,700
resonate

330
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,320
at a specific frequency

331
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,540
that...

332
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,160
Do they?

333
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,960
Well...

334
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,920
Or do they all

335
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,500
resonate at different frequencies?

336
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,560
Well, no.

337
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,060
They resonate

338
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,220
in the frequency

339
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,720
that this universe

340
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,660
resonates with.

341
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,320
Well, wouldn't that

342
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,540
make sense?

343
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:38,960
Because...

344
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,520
Because your body

345
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,160
is made of the exact

346
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,800
same stuff

347
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,280
as the rest of the universe

348
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,820
is made of?

349
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,300
Right.

350
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,340
But if you could throw

351
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,700
that resonance

352
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:45,800
off...

353
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,180
Doesn't sound mystical to me.

354
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,660
...positive or minus,

355
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,780
you could end up

356
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,980
going backwards or forwards

357
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,900
in time through that.

358
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,740
No, no, man.

359
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,360
You're going to the

360
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,080
other dimension.

361
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,420
Right.

362
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,740
Because the time travel

363
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,820
is actually traveling

364
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,500
to those other dimensions

365
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,340
where those other realities

366
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,380
of you exist.

367
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,240
It's like the...

368
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah, but then you

369
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,780
turn into a giant train.

370
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,340
...where you go

371
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,960
ten minutes into the future

372
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,820
and you end up

373
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,660
in a completely

374
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
alternate reality.

375
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,220
But you're a big string.

376
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,360
Yeah, you...

377
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,860
That's what that

378
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,000
string theory is all about.

379
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,400
These giant puppet strings

380
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,080
Actually, the best...

381
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,480
You can...

382
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,760
...for pulling everything.

383
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,100
You can become a string

384
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,560
by launching yourself

385
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,300
into a black hole.

386
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,700
Yeah, but...

387
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,080
I actually have a question

388
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,720
for Dave.

389
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:23,980
It's called

390
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,740
spaghettification.

391
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:25,740
Yeah.

392
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,520
Dave, you notice

393
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,040
when you're...

394
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,120
You know, you were talking

395
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,180
about we all vibrate

396
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,500
and the vibrations

397
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,360
and the tickle

398
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,420
that's bad to the bone.

399
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,500
Have you ever found

400
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,200
that the vibrations

401
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,120
make you hear

402
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,980
everything either

403
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,060
sharp or flat?

404
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,400
Oh, yeah.

405
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,060
Of course.

406
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,220
You never hear

407
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,900
natural pitch.

408
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
That shows that you're...

409
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,580
You know, that shows

410
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,280
that you're being controlled

411
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,120
by the seismic operations.

412
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,620
I see.

413
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,900
I was discussing

414
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,600
the fact that I hear...

415
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,260
I sing tend to sing flat

416
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,100
and I can't figure out

417
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,500
if I'm hearing myself flat

418
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,480
or if I'm hearing myself

419
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,000
sharp and overcompensated.

420
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,080
No, they just flattened

421
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,580
you out, babe.

422
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,160
You know, I mean,

423
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
that's not your fault.

424
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,520
There's nothing flat on me.

425
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,420
I was going to say,

426
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,640
you don't seem like

427
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
a very flat person

428
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,180
to me.

429
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,680
Yeah, I didn't mean

430
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,120
that way.

431
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,480
I meant sensoratically.

432
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,480
They flatten your...

433
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,840
Oh, okay.

434
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,460
Your drip level.

435
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,680
They flatten my senses.

436
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,420
No, it's just

437
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,000
the drip level

438
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,720
is different now

439
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,440
than it used to be.

440
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,540
Oh, okay.

441
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,660
Because we're all,

442
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,240
you know,

443
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,820
hours in a sand glass

444
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,540
or something each time.

445
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,260
See, I was going to

446
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:23,900
blame it entirely

447
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,780
on the fact that

448
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,120
I actually got a...

449
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,980
Like, I think I said

450
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,480
last week,

451
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,120
I got a promotion

452
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,200
which is going to get me

453
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,040
off of the job

454
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,360
of talking to pinks

455
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,120
all day on the phone.

456
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,720
But it's causing me

457
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,380
to have the

458
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,400
subgenius deafness syndrome

459
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,380
that is occurring.

460
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
But for me,

461
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,600
it's only in one year.

462
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,840
Deafness or deaf?

463
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:43,820
What?

464
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,320
I had heard

465
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,080
that there was a...

466
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,740
Anyway, in Dobbstown,

467
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,420
I heard that there was

468
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,580
a massive die-off.

469
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,380
Kind of like

470
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,560
a resonance die-off

471
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:52,900
or something.

472
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,720
People just, like,

473
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,800
stuck their fingers

474
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,300
in their ear

475
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,500
and started falling over.

476
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,660
Well, but those

477
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,720
were just drones.

478
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,120
Drunks?

479
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,740
Drones.

480
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,520
They were going to

481
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,140
do that anyway.

482
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:03,640
They have...

483
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,240
It's called a...

484
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,100
Is a drone a drunk clone?

485
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,620
They have a brain blowout

486
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,020
and they get a flat affect.

487
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,300
Right.

488
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,020
That's what happens.

489
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,960
And you have to change

490
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,800
their affect

491
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,080
and put on a spare.

492
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,640
But eventually,

493
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,760
you know,

494
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,400
they become used up

495
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,460
from channeling Bob

496
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,060
or whatnot.

497
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,540
You just have to junk them.

498
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,360
And sometimes

499
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:24,940
they're chunked.

500
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,620
I've never had a flat affect

501
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,840
than a sharp affect.

502
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,040
Oh, I don't know.

503
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,920
I find that,

504
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,560
you know,

505
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,880
my sharp affect

506
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,960
has actually

507
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,100
gotten me places in life

508
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,180
that I couldn't have

509
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,000
gotten with a flat one.

510
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,160
I'm a wanker.

511
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,080
I'm a wanker.

512
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm a wanker.

513
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,860
I'm a wanker.

514
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,700
I'm a wanker.

515
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm a wanker.

516
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,100
I'm a wanker.

517
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,380
You're a yum

518
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,320
or you're a wanker.

519
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,380
Take your fucking choice.

520
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,980
So who is your

521
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,820
favorite genius?

522
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,640
James Heard

523
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,760
or James Joyce?

524
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
You ever seen

525
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,700
a live performance?

526
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,080
Join the wanker club.

527
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,760
You thought I meant

528
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,820
tabletop dancing?

529
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,300
Well,

530
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,060
you're a yobble bug.

531
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,160
What are you?

532
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,840
You're a wanker.

533
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,340
What are you?

534
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,780
You're a wanker.

535
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,180
Wankers once

536
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,240
used mobile phones

537
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,440
but now that's

538
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,300
sort of changing.

539
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,860
And yobbs once

540
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,940
lived in cottage homes.

541
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,840
Ain't social change

542
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,480
amazing?

543
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,500
If the yob and wanker

544
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,860
want a girl,

545
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,380
the wanker guy

546
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,740
will get her.

547
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,140
Both of them

548
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,840
are equally ugly.

549
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,020
The wanker

550
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,360
hides it better.

551
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,280
What are you?

552
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,000
You're a wanker.

553
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,320
What are you?

554
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,980
You're a wanker.

555
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,960
What are you?

556
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,280
You're a wanker.

557
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,860
What are you?

558
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,840
You think ku?

559
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,760
You're a wanker.

560
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,300
You are wanker.

561
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:22,480
You do?

562
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,000
You wanker.

563
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,420
You laugh at me?

564
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,300
You will.

565
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:33,920
You think ku?

566
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,960
You are wanker.

567
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,840
You are wanker.

568
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,700
You're a wanker.

569
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,240
You don't have enough,

570
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,200
but you love me?

571
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,200


572
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,200


573
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,220
I would have тысяч

574
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


575
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


576
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


577
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


578
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


579
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


580
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


581
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


582
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


583
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


584
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


585
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


586
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,220


587
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,280
Don't miss them

588
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,280


589
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,280


590
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,120
Wanker fights inequality

591
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,140
And for people's rights

592
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,720
Wanker fights cross prejudice

593
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,220
And yobbo just fights

594
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,160
Yobbo, wanker, wanker, yob

595
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,000
Pass me the brush to tie ya

596
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,900
Make your choice then live your life

597
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,800
Come on pal, what are ya?

598
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,560
What are ya?

599
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,100
You won't wake up

600
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,680
What are ya?

601
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,180
You won't wake up

602
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,300
What are ya?

603
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,880
You won't wake up

604
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,240
What are ya?

605
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,580
You won't wake up

606
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,340
Wanker fight ceiling

607
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,480
Yobbo

608
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,000
M 가운데

609
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,420
And yobbo

610
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,180
Fence

611
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,700
Men

612
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,040
Enter

613
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,200
My

614
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,920
destined

615
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,040
Jenkins

616
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Sophists

617
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,040


618
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,500
And mostra

619
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,860
Thorn and his revolutionary government wanted to make me a hero for what I had done.

620
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,500
But what I received didn't make me eager to sign on as their poster boy.

621
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,700
What is the color of the sky?

622
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,260
Thorn's people began emptying the cities the very morning of the coup,

623
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,880
driving the uncooperative into re-education camps.

624
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
And what is the law?

625
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,800
Not us who eat meat. Are we not men?

626
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,340
And what have we learned?

627
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,440
The nail that sticks up gets hung down.

628
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,300
I was, for 13 years, imprisoned in R-28.

629
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,760
Thorn halted the import of medicine, banned action movies,

630
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,260
and began systematically separating children from their parents.

631
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,380
A stale piece of bread is better than nothing.

632
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,100
A stale piece of bread is better than nothing.

633
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,160
And nothing is better than a big juicy steak.

634
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,780
Nothing is better than a big juicy steak.

635
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,400
Therefore, a stale piece of bread is better than a big juicy steak.

636
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,200
All we're asking is that you do your duty as a citizen.

637
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,620
Declare your loyalty to the flag.

638
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,100
You are a patriot, aren't you?

639
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,540
Fuck off.

640
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,220
You kiss your mama with that mouth?

641
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,380
You're the one who says you were there when Mr. Thorn killed the president, huh?

642
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,840
It was all in the papers.

643
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,320
Ah.

644
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,440
That must have been the weekend I was out of town.

645
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,380
Water skiing with the Pope.

646
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,980
You know this guy?

647
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,240
The hero of the revolution?

648
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,460
Don't you cool off in there a while before you find yourself in room 12.

649
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,500
I thought this was room 12.

650
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,080
Ha ha ha ha!

651
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,840
The man from popular culture came round to check up, he said, on what we wanted.

652
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,360
I looked at the wife, puzzled a while, and replied.

653
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,960
Just the normal, I suppose.

654
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:31,620
Pay off the house, some sort of world trip, then back home, maybe a boat and cable TV,

655
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,200
but only for the football.

656
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,640
He nodded.

657
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,420
Spiritually, he asked.

658
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,480
Have you any spiritual needs?

659
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,400
Longings.

660
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,900
I knew sort of what he was getting at, and I knew too I probably should have had some.

661
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,400
Well, it's half of me to be precise, but I suppose I have some of those.

662
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,300
I wouldn't say it affects my day to day activities.

663
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,980
He nodded.

664
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,780
It's family and health that's important, I said, thinking maybe that's what he wanted.

665
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,340
As long as they're okay.

666
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,400
He picked a box and looked up at me.

667
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,480
I see.

668
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,620
Well, I suppose you're not a big fan of football.

669
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:04,620


670
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:04,620


671
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:04,620


672
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:04,620


673
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:04,620


674
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:12,140
said we're worried about unemployment. Tick. And the hospitals. Tick. Schools, sort of.

675
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:21,840
He ticked, silent. You know, all that stuff. He turned to the next page. And huge and deviant

676
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,100
sexual longings? What the f... I said, but he went, look, I'm sorry, I have to ask, let's

677
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:34,180
move on. Politics. Not interested, really. Music. Got some greatest hits albums. Poetry.

678
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,620
Oh, yeah, like, I read it all the time. Princess Diana. Let's leave it be, I reckon.

679
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,360
Never get the feeling intellectuals laugh at you. Couldn't give a f... mate. He asked

680
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,020
me to sign, telling me it was non-obligatory. For the purposes of verification only. Two

681
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,780
weeks later, we got in the post all we wanted. Except for the Princess Diana stuff.

682
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,540
Hey, well, you have to draw the line somewhere, friends. That was from TISM, and the song

683
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,500
about being a wanker was, likewise, from TISM. You can find them on the internet.

684
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:14,340
TISM.net at TISM.net.au, because they're in Australia. But I would suggest Wikieatism

685
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:22,240
for information. We also heard some radio synesthesia there from WCSB Cleveland. And

686
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,840
the movie clip in between those two was from Land of the Blind, which is a 2006 movie that

687
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:34,320
puts a slight twist on the basic 1984 dystopia.

688
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:42,180
Fun movie. Reverend Corey McAbby is in it, too, as a torturer. Weirdos get tortured

689
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:48,040
by normals a lot in history, and friends, we're trying to turn that around. And that's

690
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,420
why we hold church socials and orgies like X-Day. Praise Connie.

691
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,460
Well, that's an interesting drill. I like that.

692
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:01,820
Yeah, and we found that as a social club, the church has been really successful. There

693
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,700
have been a lot of marriages.

694
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:04,840
Yeah.

695
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,920
Within, you know, people who met within the church and got married. You know, once you're

696
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,780
a subgenius minister, you can perform marriages.

697
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,540
Cool.

698
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,520
I've done, I've lost count how many. I mean, 20 or 30 marriages in different states. And

699
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:26,680
if those aren't legitimate marriages, then a lot of money has been wasted on divorces,

700
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:34,600
let me put it that way. So, yes, and our weddings are really helpful.

701
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,480
They're very sad affairs sometimes when they break up.

702
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,640
Well, you know, after all, I think weddings are sort of like, you know, there are some

703
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,240
cultures that they do at a celebration of a birth, they actually, it's like a wake.

704
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,440
Right.

705
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,560
Yeah. I mean, because, you know, congratulations, welcome to the world, you poor slob.

706
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,340
Yeah, yeah.

707
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,160
You know, that kind of thing.

708
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:04,240
Yeah. We've been, we would love to offer multiple partner marriages like the Mormons used to

709
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,480
have.

710
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,160
Hmm.

711
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,300
And some of them still do. Polygamy and so forth.

712
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:09,860
Yeah.

713
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:15,880
But I guess that's for the foreign ministries of the church.

714
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,200
Yeah, or the foreign press.

715
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:17,860
Yeah.

716
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,260
Yeah, right. If you're Nicolau Sarkozy or something.

717
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:27,860
Thanks, Rick Barber and KOA Denver. Now, what I'm about to play before we go back to Dr.

718
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,160
Sinister's Radio Synesthesia is a mystery clip from some cheesy old sci-fi movie the

719
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:41,080
title of which is unknown to me. So if you know, tell me, Stang, at subgenius.com, because

720
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:47,740
when I tuned in this movie, they were, I swear they were talking about the book of the subgenius,

721
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:56,660
which came out in 1983, and yet this is like a 1950s or early 1960s sci-fi bad film.

722
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:04,140
Something that Bob must have arranged. It might be teenagers from outer space, but I'm not sure.

723
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,440
I forget.

724
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:13,140
They have been made to forget for centuries. But I have learned how it once was. Families,

725
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,040
brothers and sisters, there was happiness, there was love.

726
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,420
Of what do you speak? From where have you learned such things?

727
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:29,960
I have read. I have read from this book. I discovered it and kept it hidden. Somehow

728
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,120
it survived the flames of the annihilators. When our people were turned to dust, they

729
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,000
turned into mechanized slaves, centuries ago.

730
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:43,940
Let me see that book. I am interested to see what sways your mind so heavily.

731
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,400
You may have it.

732
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,100
Bring up the gargantum. That book has indeed made you forget many things. We are the supreme

733
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,100
race. We have the supreme weapons. People are not meant to be a part of ethics. A fox

734
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,100


735
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,100


736
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,100


737
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,100


738
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:12,440
well why how are they destroying the world right now since i did kind of uh exude the flavoring of

739
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:19,180
the topping what this week this you guys were talking about this specifically this week no we

740
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:26,060
were talking about the distant uh well the the uh singularity and the ideogularity oh i didn't

741
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:33,140
understand at the same time and then you just started talking about pickled feet well no i

742
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:39,780
thought it did have to do with ideogularity doesn't it well let's see how are they trying

743
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:45,000
to end the world right now well the government's lifting the baghdad curfew that's going to cause

744
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,160
the end of the world and they're lifting the Olympic torch arrives in beijing that's another

745
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:55,360
key to the end of the world i guess the guy that genetically altered after the killing fields died

746
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,340
so richard whitmark died oh my god that's the final sign that and the red heifer no no

747
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,640
he

748
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:09,140
before he died now richard whitmark was in a lot of those uh really cool uh movies where you know

749
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:16,080
one species or another is always arising and threatens to make problems for mankind like

750
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,420
killer bees or killer ants or killer robots anything killer in the title he was always in it

751
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:29,940
usually he was in a movie called the swarm which was about uh angry africanized killer bees which

752
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,020
which were just destroying decimating whole

753
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:37,740
sections of the southwest and just killing people left and right they always blame it on the

754
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:44,300
africanized ones what about the americanized killer bees or the well no the americanized

755
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:50,900
killer bees are too lazy what about the latin american killer bees right the south americanized

756
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,480
killer bees oh they're the ones pollinating all the coca leaves so they die from like

757
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:01,040
exhaustion hawaiiated the antarcticanized killer bees those are the really scary ones

758
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,620
deadly because they were

759
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,940
they're prehistoric ones that are like four feet long and then there's the australianized

760
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,560
think about what kind of fossils think about what kind of fossils are hiding

761
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,640
underneath the antarctic ice sheet that we'll never get to see

762
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,920
we'll find out soon enough oh there's tons of stuff that's you know man is not meant to see

763
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,600
under that ice what is it like like well first you got your beats from 20 000 fathoms first that

764
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,100
hits new york then you got your clover field then you got your big yakutismo monsters i mean it's

765
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,660
just like one thing after another

766
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:38,940
and somewhere in there there was uh even an attack by humans uh with airplanes

767
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,240
did now didn't lovecraft mention the those beings that live in the center underneath the

768
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:53,520
earth of anartha right the yeah the old ones had a base there yeah from long before man or even

769
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:59,780
tens of millions of years ago it was uh he was up by the equator actually they say but it drifted

770
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,080
to anarchica well it didn't exactly drift

771
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,680
It was more violently pushed.

772
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,560
It stayed relatively warm until it separated from South America,

773
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,060
at which point the Antarctic circumpolar current was made possible.

774
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,620
Well, now, there's fossils, aren't there, in Antarctica

775
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,900
that show signs of intense flash freezing?

776
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,220
Like something just suddenly hit them.

777
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,720
I don't know anything about that.

778
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:31,240
How would Dr. Sinister know about the actual, you know,

779
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,380
the lacerations on the bees and stuff there?

780
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,560
That's just too much to purport into the future.

781
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,540
You know, you'd have to actually have seen the bees.

782
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,560
And the bees are the bees' knees.

783
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,240
Well, that's the thing.

784
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,060
I mean, they're so concerned about these gigantic ice sheets

785
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,460
the size of New Jersey falling off.

786
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,940
What they should be worried about is what kind of monsters are freed

787
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,360
by global warming that are locked in the ice.

788
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,780
Flying saucers that crashed full of shape-changing things,

789
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,140
rhendosauruses.

790
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,380
There's all kinds of stuff buried down there.

791
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,740
Viruses that are actually six foot long and weigh 300 pounds.

792
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,760
I mean, it's just a restroom down there.

793
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,060
Waiting for...

794
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,400
Yeah, it's a sewer of monsters.

795
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
That's where all the monsters get flushed to.

796
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,520
I thought that Antarctica was really just sort of like the beer cooler for the Wyatt.

797
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,220
Well, maybe that is, you know...

798
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,580
Well, the poles were kind of like heat sinks for the planet, you know.

799
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,560
Yeah, but see, our ice is melting,

800
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,220
and we can't go out to another planet.

801
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,060
We can't go out to another ice machine.

802
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,100
Yeah.

803
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,760
Wow.

804
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,320
What if it was like...

805
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,740
And they're going to be mad when they come back

806
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,800
and all their tasty treats in their cooler is warm.

807
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:40,580
Right.

808
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,700
I mean, so right now it's just ice shelves.

809
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:48,440
But what happens when it's ice tables and ice chairs and ice boxes?

810
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,460
There you go.

811
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,260
Ice stoves that start falling off of continents.

812
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,140
From one side of the earth to the other.

813
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,440
Right.

814
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,760
The end of the world as we know it.

815
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,340
Right.

816
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,960
Just wild.

817
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,260
The king of that.

818
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,720
Wildly floating around in the ocean.

819
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,480
Yeah, that is not where you want to be right now.

820
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,340
You guys know what it is?

821
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:05,780
Okay.

822
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,800
Do you know what that thing is?

823
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,720
They know they ain't telling me.

824
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,100
Whatever it is, it's winning.

825
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,240
I don't feel so good.

826
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,740
What do you want from me?

827
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,780
I want you to tell me about the conspiracy.

828
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,240
Conspiracy.

829
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,780
We know that you, some of the others, are plotting a conspiracy.

830
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,220
There's no conspiracy.

831
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,460
Do you still maintain that you were involved in the assassination of the president?

832
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:29,720
Yes.

833
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,940
Well, that was a conspiracy.

834
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,720
It was a conspiracy, wasn't it?

835
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,780
So why wouldn't you be involved in another one?

836
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,220
I'm not.

837
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,320
So you admit that there is a conspiracy?

838
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,380
If I was plotting something, do you think that I'd be stupid enough to attack a guard?

839
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,700
Maybe you attacked the guard to make us think you were involved in a conspiracy,

840
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,520
or you'd never have attacked the guard.

841
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,640
I'm not that smart.

842
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,600
It's tough to believe you, Joe, when you won't even declare what side you're on.

843
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,760
So are you going to do yourself a favor and sign the loyalty off?

844
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:58,920
No.

845
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,060
I just want to protect myself.

846
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,060


847
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,060


848
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,560
I want to protect my family.

849
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:05,560


850
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,420
Follow a healthy doctor about liver problems.

851
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,160
Diabetes.

852
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,760
Unexplained muscle pain or weakness.

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,280
Deluxe redness.

857
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:13,700
Odors.

858
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,280
Heartburn.

859
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,860
Heartburn.

860
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,540
Heart failure.

861
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,100
Heart disease.

862
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,940
Kidney disease.

863
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,640
Damage.

864
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,180
Stomach disease.

865
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,180
Stomach problems.

866
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:19,960
Fractures.

867
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,640
Arthritis.

868
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,480
Chest pain.

869
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,240
Tuberculosis.

870
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,060
Headache.

871
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,120
Multiple sclerosis.

872
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,880
Diarrhea and abdominal pain.

873
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,460
Asthma attack.

874
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,240
Blood disorders.

875
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,360
Nervous system disorders.

876
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,780
An active live infection.

877
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:37,080
open sore, headache, headaches, diarrhea, lymphoma, indigestion and rash, liver disease, liver, kidney problems, muscle pain or serious skin reactions.

878
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,000
Free trial.

879
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,440
I'm a man of science, Joe.

880
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,720
All this revolutionary mumbo-jumbo.

881
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,360
I was hired to employ the scientific method.

882
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,640
My job right now is to uncover the root of this conspiracy based on the evidence.

883
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,560
You have evidence?

884
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,660
No, that's how we know there's a conspiracy.

885
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,400
What?

886
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,680
If there wasn't a conspiracy, there'd be evidence. That's how effective the conspiracy is.

887
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,860
Morning, Joe.

888
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,580
What's better than a big juicy steak?

889
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,900
You ask me that every morning.

890
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,700
I ask you that every morning and every morning you tell me the same thing.

891
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,540
So, what's better than a big juicy steak?

892
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:29,900
Nothing.

893
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,120
Nothing's better than a big juicy steak.

894
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:55,460
But, now, as I understand it, though, there are trace amounts of Viagra and every other medicine known to man, not only in all of our drinking water, but all of our bottled and bodied water.

895
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,540
But, luckily, they all counteract each other.

896
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:58,540


897
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:58,540


898
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:58,540


899
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:58,540


900
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:58,540


901
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:58,540


902
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:58,540


903
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:58,540


904
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:58,540


905
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:58,540


906
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:58,540


907
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,400
There's some Valium and some Methamphetamine.

908
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,140
There you go.

909
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,120
Two great tastes that go great together.

910
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,880
But they never named children after them, though.

911
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,560
Hey, you got Valium and my Methamphetamine.

912
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,840
Joe, you got Methamphetamine on my Valium.

913
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,640
That is a very useful and useless name.

914
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:25,700
There are trace amounts, and it occurred to me, I was thinking, okay, well, if homeopathy is right, then we should all be high as hell from drinking this water.

915
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,840
Homeopathic.

916
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,520
Homeopathy was a Greek word.

917
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,200
I think it was a Greek scientist or something in the old days.

918
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,860
Don't be a homeopath.

919
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:46,160
If the less of something you have diluted in your water, remembered magically by the water, if that's for real, then all these medicines that are mixed up in our city water should be coming on like gangbusters.

920
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,560
Are you talking about...

921
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:55,900
Well, it may be doing it, because that would explain why people do such really dumb, just amazingly dumb things when they're purportedly sober.

922
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,480
You mean...

923
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,120
I mean...

924
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,820
Are you guys talking about magically empowered water?

925
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,420
Yeah.

926
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,340
Okay.

927
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,220
Water that remembers.

928
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,040
Water that won't forgive and forget.

929
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,540
Water that holds a grudge.

930
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,960
Memory water.

931
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,120
For millions of years.

932
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,140
Dihydrogen monoxide.

933
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,420
That's right.

934
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:25,560
You see, you've been predicting for years the dangers of too much dihydrogen monoxide, and look, your predictions have come true.

935
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,420
Yeah.

936
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,320
Pretty soon...

937
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,940
Dihydrogen monoxide will be outlawed in schools and cities, because it will just...

938
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,960
Kids will be getting high off of it.

939
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,420
Right, and they'll also be getting erections.

940
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,140
Right.

941
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:52,800
That's when the conspiracy is going to come out with a water substitute, which they're going to claim is going to be better than water, yet it's going to be, you know, made out of...

942
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,220
See, that's from the ideogularity again.

943
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,760
Right.

944
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,380
With electrolytes.

945
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:57,980
Right.

946
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:03,960
It's water with electrolytes, which, you know, that's already been predicted by other prophets.

947
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,120
Right.

948
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,480
We know these times are coming.

949
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,960
Well, I...

950
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,500
Just hard water, normal hard water actually contains electrolytes.

951
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,980
Right, and that's why they call it hard water.

952
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,280
Get your calcium and magnesium in there.

953
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:14,720
Good for you.

954
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,120
Because it can cause erections.

955
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:21,920
A child supposedly overdosed on nutmeg recently in the northeastern Ohio area.

956
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:22,640
Really?

957
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,860
Assuming that he could get high, and he did.

958
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:36,520
But he had, he peppered his bowels and he, I think he skinned up his blood air a little bit and was led confusedly to the hospital where he remains in another place.

959
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,300
Really?

960
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,380
Well, you know, he probably would make some tasty cookies right about...

961
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,840
Well, you can get high as a chicken.

962
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:53,600
There are so many legal ways to get high, but most of them make you really sick to your stomach first, and that's, like, why they're not popular maybe.

963
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,420
Well, and then you...

964
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,620
Or they just mess you up so bad.

965
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,460
...start saying Art Linkletter and that makes you jump out windows.

966
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:05,220
You hallucinate Art Linkletter coming after you and that's what causes kids to jump out windows when they get high on...

967
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,020
It's...

968
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,380
...Gymson weed and all those other nice organic...

969
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,400
Yes, Gymson weed.

970
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,180
...contacts.

971
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:17,640
Well, he claimed, Art Linkletter claimed that his own beloved, I think it was, niece smoked Gymson weed and jumped off the Trans-American building.

972
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,640
And that was never discounted by anyone in the media, accepted it and passed it.

973
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,320
And, uh...

974
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,460
How did she get up to the top of the Trans-American building to jump?

975
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,680
They didn't explain that part either.

976
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,100
You know, it's just the way things are, man, you know?

977
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:38,300
Now, Joe, the sooner you admit your involvement in this, the sooner you get out of here, get that eye taken care of...

978
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:38,820
By who?

979
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,760
The chaplain will pray for it to heal.

980
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,540
Why do you insist on resisting when you can't even be sure of your own story?

981
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,920
Did you personally witness the supposed murder of the president?

982
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,120
No.

983
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,840
So you didn't actually see Mr. Thorne pull the trigger?

984
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,640
No.

985
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,360
Joe, have you ever heard the story of the five blind men who came upon an elephant?

986
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:09,420
One felt the leg and said, ah, an elephant is very much like a tree.

987
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,600
The next felt the trunk and said, an elephant is very much like a snake.

988
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,800
The next felt the tusk and said, an elephant is very much like a spear.

989
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,400
See what I'm trying to get at?

990
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,280
What happens to the prisoners you photograph and then take away?

991
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,760
So let's go through this one more time, Joe.

992
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,540
Want another reason to get the hell out of here?

993
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,080
I'll give you the best one.

994
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:33,700
Her.

995
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,700
She's our very own Jim Jones.

996
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,740
I'd like to leave before people start drinking the Kool-Aid.

997
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,280
He's right.

998
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,120
The more people get, the better she's gonna look.

999
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,680
No, I don't buy that. It's obvious she's nuts.

1000
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,760
Look, a few people, maybe, but...

1001
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,360
No, I count four.

1002
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,080
She's preaching to him right now.

1003
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,300
By noon, she'll have four more.

1004
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,220
By tomorrow night, when those things come back, she'll have a congregation.

1005
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:01,040
And then we can start worrying about who she's gonna sacrifice to make it all better.

1006
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,740
You don't have much faith in humanity, do you?

1007
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,820
None whatsoever.

1008
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,140
I can't accept that.

1009
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,920
People are basically good, decent.

1010
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,560
My God, David, we're a civilized society.

1011
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,580
Sure, as long as the machines are working and you can dial 911.

1012
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:20,640
But you take those things away, you throw people in the dark, you scare the shit out of them.

1013
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,760
No more rules.

1014
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,580
You'll see how primitive they get.

1015
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,540
They scare people badly enough.

1016
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,180
You can get them to do anything.

1017
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,260
They'll turn to whoever promises a solution.

1018
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,740
Or whatever.

1019
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,940
Ollie, please, back me up here.

1020
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,980
I wish I could.

1021
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,960
As a species, we're fundamentally insane.

1022
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,520
But more than two of us in a room, we pick sides and start dreaming up reasons to kill one another.

1023
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,360
Why do you think we invented politics and religion?

1024
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,740
Oh, you're right.

1025
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,940
Jesus, that's just wrong.

1026
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,300
Look, nobody has to decide anything now, okay?

1027
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,140
First thing's first.

1028
00:42:59,100 --> 00:42:59,940
The pharmacy.

1029
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,100
It's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.

1030
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,180
Money and the drugs.

1031
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,260
It's just goddamn beyond everything.

1032
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,200
What's it mean?

1033
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,980
What's it leading to?

1034
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,940
You know, if you'd have told me 20 years ago,

1035
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,720
I'd see children walk in the streets of our Texas town,

1036
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,260
with green hair, bones in their noses.

1037
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,660
I just flat out wouldn't have believed you.

1038
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,020
Signs and wonders.

1039
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,600
But I think once you quit hearing sir and ma'am,

1040
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,200
the rest is soon to follow.

1041
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,980
Oh, it's the tide.

1042
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,240
It's the dismal tide.

1043
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,580
It is not the one thing.

1044
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,420
Not the one thing.

1045
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,640
It's the other thing.

1046
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,660
Do you ever think about what a lovely place the world would be

1047
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,400
without all the people who make life so unpleasant,

1048
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,320
and all the small, petty people,

1049
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:24,400
and all the ugly, annoying people?

1050
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,440
It's hard not to think about it.

1051
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,400
I like to think about what could be done to these people.

1052
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,400
Something cruel.

1053
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:39,720
Something mean.

1054
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,160
Something just.

1055
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,700
But the meaner, the better.

1056
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,160
Goodness knows they deserve it.

1057
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,460
Have you ever dreamed of killing all the stupid people?

1058
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,380
Not just the unintelligent people,

1059
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,960
but the sort that don't know anything about anything,

1060
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,760
yet seem to have opinions about everything.

1061
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,480
They're only...

1062
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:16,680
They're only...

1063
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:21,560
too ready to offer you their advice about how to run their life.

1064
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,300
And yet look at how they run their own lives.

1065
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,700
For the most part, they've accomplished nothing.

1066
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,280
They've contributed nothing.

1067
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,000
Their lives are miserable.

1068
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:40,200
But they talk, talk, talk.

1069
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,820
At the very least, their tongue should be cut out.

1070
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,620
At the very least.

1071
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,020
Do you ever want to kill all the people who tell lies?

1072
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,540
I'm certainly deserving of that.

1073
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,600
Not necessarily the big liars,

1074
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,100
or even those who teach lies as truth.

1075
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,940
I'm talking about people who say one thing and do another.

1076
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,800
Or who tell you they've sent something to you.

1077
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,360
Or who express mail, and you know they haven't.

1078
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,780
Did you ever want to kill all the slow people in the world?

1079
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,640
The people who are in front of you when they should be behind you.

1080
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,140
The crime that the swift should be held back by the slow.

1081
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,020
And the scrimmial that nothing's known to rectify it.

1082
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,940
What do others do other than make it appear as if they're crazy?

1083
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:51,940


1084
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,560
What about all the ugly people?

1085
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,040
And what about all the really ugly people?

1086
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,720
Add them to the list as well.

1087
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,980
Some people

1088
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,720
People try not to think about life's ugliness.

1089
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,680
I've thought about it.

1090
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,200
I've thought about it quite a lot.

1091
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,120
Something should be done to these people.

1092
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,200
Something to make them suffer

1093
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,560
the way they've made us suffer.

1094
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:51,840
I say, bring back Bacircus Maximus, for starters.

1095
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,340
Unless these weeds are dealt with,

1096
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,400
they'll poison everything.

1097
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,300
They are poisoning everything.

1098
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,400
We need a gardener.

1099
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,340
A brutal gardener.

1100
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,120
A thorough, thoughtful gardener.

1101
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,920
An iron gardener.

1102
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,180
Whatever happened to Vlad the Impaler?

1103
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,780
Where's Genghis Khan when we need him?

1104
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,320
Or Roy Deese?

1105
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,220
Ayatollah Khomeini?

1106
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,480
Adolf Hitler?

1107
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:43,880
Benito Mussolini?

1108
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,080
Nero, Di phải, Kitchner?

1109
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:47,860
Come on!

1110
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:48,700
Come on!

1111
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:49,380
Come on!

1112
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:50,760
Come on!

1113
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,000
Come on!

1114
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,120
Come on!

1115
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,200
Come on!

1116
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:53,880
Come on!

1117
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,380
Come on!

1118
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,640
Thank you.

1119
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:41,640
Thank you.

1120
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,260
None of that explains your man, though.

1121
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:47,820
Uh-uh.

1122
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,340
He's just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, yet, Tom.

1123
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,800
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.

1124
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,940
Yeah, well, what would you call him?

1125
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,360
Yeah.

1126
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,220
You know, sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.

1127
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,360
He's real.

1128
00:49:59,460 --> 00:49:59,620
Oh, yeah?

1129
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,560
Yeah, all of that over at the Eagle Hotel.

1130
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,680
Just beyond everything.

1131
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:04,220
Yeah.

1132
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,960
Got some hard bark on him.

1133
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,920
Well, that don't hardly say it.

1134
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,260
He shoots a desk clerk one day,

1135
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,220
walks right back in the next,

1136
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,860
and shoots a retired Army colonel.

1137
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:17,860
It's hard to believe.

1138
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,020
Just strolls right back into a crime scene.

1139
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,120
Now, who'd do such a thing?

1140
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,360
How do you defend yourself?

1141
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:25,880
I'm not going to defend against it.

1142
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,740
Where'd you go after work detail this morning?

1143
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,420
I told you I went back to my cell.

1144
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,220
Which is where?

1145
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,800
Michigan Avenue.

1146
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,240
And where'd you go after that?

1147
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,380
To the Chum Hall.

1148
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,380
And after that?

1149
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,740
I went back to my cell again.

1150
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:46,560
And then where?

1151
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,700
The Duck's Say.

1152
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,720
The Duck's Say?

1153
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,960
What's a duck say?

1154
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,020
Quack, quack.

1155
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,760
What's a duck say? Slack, slack.

1156
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:13,400
That clip and others like it, friends, are from the movie Land of the Blind,

1157
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,260
a fun little look at an alternate future.

1158
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:23,080
The clips with the old Texans lamenting the kids these days and the green hair

1159
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:29,900
are from the movie No Country for Old Men, and I know just how they feel.

1160
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:35,860
There was also an excerpt from The Mist, a nice old-school monster movie,

1161
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:43,560
and some lemur doctoring, and radio synesthesia with Pisces, Rocknar,

1162
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,200
Lonesome Cowboy David, yours truly, Reverend Zang,

1163
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,560
joining Dr. Sinister on WCSB Cleveland.

1164
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,440
And...

1165
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,740
There was that six-minute rant about all those people.

1166
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,580
That is from Boyd, Rice, and Friends.

1167
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,240
Friends.

1168
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:12,480
The background music, if you can call it that, is by Reverend Just John at just-john.com.

1169
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:18,040
And this whole old show is from the Church of the Subgenius,

1170
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:22,680
Subgenius Foundation Incorporated, and is episode number one.

1171
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,360
1,152 of the hour of Slack.

1172
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,180
But essentially what you're saying then is Slack is whatever you make of it.

1173
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:36,580
Slack is whatever makes you feel like you're doing the right thing for you.

1174
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:43,360
It's, you know, for some people Slack is just sitting around drinking beer and watching crappy TV.

1175
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,700
For other people, though, Slack would be listening to Rick Barber's great show.

1176
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,220
For another person, Slack would be working.

1177
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:52,960
Actually,

1178
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,420
working, but working at what they wanted to be doing.

1179
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,040
So, in a sense, I could be achieving spiritual Slack as we speak.

1180
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:02,640
Exactly.

1181
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:03,600
Right.

1182
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,140
I see.

1183
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,400
That makes me feel better.

1184
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,940
There's a little bit of Slack for you right there.

1185
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:10,500
Yeah, see?

1186
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,400
My soul has been uplifted.

1187
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,180
Thank you.

1188
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,280
All right, Lee, thanks so much.

1189
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,840
Well, I feel better already.

1190
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,240
I've helped the man to find a kind of a Slacky nirvana.

1191
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,520
Yeah, Slack actually makes...

1192
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,380
Slack is so great compared to Nirvana.

1193
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:33,260
It makes Nirvana feel like being buried up to your neck in the desert with honey all over you and the flies and ants crawling into your eyes.

1194
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,440
Unless you're really into that.

1195
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:39,060
Slack is makes Nirvana seem like that by comparison.

1196
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,420
Or either you're listening to a CD and you didn't know you were up to your neck yet.

1197
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,040
Look around.

1198
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,100
Look around.

1199
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,240
Look around.

1200
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:47,920
Look around.

1201
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,020
Look around.

1202
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,800
look around.

1203
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,620
You're only one fad away from being retro.

You're only one drug away from liking techno.

You're only one download from Vissos copyright

You're only one Tim Tam away from cellulite

1212
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,340
You're only one phone call from Captain in the Aussie side

1213
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,180
You're only one lifestyle show from Suicide

1214

You're only one station from John Law's ship

1215

You're only one lobotomy from Beliebiness

00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,200
You're only one

You're only Fabian from a far away

1218
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,680
You're only Fabian from a far away

1219
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,120
You're only Fabian from a far away

1220
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,840
You're only one tabloid press from a lynch mob

1221

You're only one acting role from a real job

1222

You're only one strip of flesh from your bones

You're only one species away from Alan Jones

1224
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,040
You're only one small speck in space

1225
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,540
You're only one life soon erased

1226
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:00,960
Please, there's none left on earth but you

1227
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,360
One thing will still remain true

1228
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,040
Look around!

1229
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,040
You're only one young strumpet queen

You're only one young strumpet queen

Look around!

1232
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,420
Look around!

1233
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,000
Look around!

1234
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,000


1235
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,560

1236
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,480

1260
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:06,580
In Orlando, Florida, Walt Disney faces felony charges after authorities said he'd made plans to have sex with a minor he met online.

1261
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:14,420
This man, Walt Disney, was arrested because, as it turns out, the minor he allegedly planned to have sex with was a 14-year-old girl.

1262
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:22,680
Posing as a police detective, authorities say, police say, Disney confessed to the charge when confronted he's being held on $20 bond.

1263
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,860
Let's see, everything conversation tonight.

1264
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:31,380
Yeah, it's too bad that you didn't have more phone lines so you couldn't have, like, opened it up to more people.

1265
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,920
Oh, well. It's always next week.

1266
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:39,120
It's like you had the elite of the subgenius people talking to you tonight.

1267
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:46,360
If, uh, yeah, I guess, yeah. You could look at it that way. I don't think any of us really see ourselves as elite.

1268
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,820
Okay, well, I'm using that word in an ironic sense.

1269
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:50,800
Yeah.

1270
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,140
We're like...

1271
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,840
We're like the cream of the loo.

1272
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:01,680
Well, I was thinking of using that word. I didn't, well, but you said it for me.

1273
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,560
What, crop?

1274
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:09,640
If the creator had meant us to shift rocks by witchcraft, he wouldn't have invented shovels.

1275
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,780
Knowing when to use a shovel is what being a witch is all about.

1276
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:17,420
And put down that wheelbarrow, my grad. You don't know nothing about machinery.
