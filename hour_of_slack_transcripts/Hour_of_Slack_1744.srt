1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
From PR News in Washington, I'm happening at this hour.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:12,640
The White House is reimposing multiple PR news on Iran after a powerful earthquake struck Indonesia last night.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,120
The newly reimposed PR news will affect Iran's automotive sector as well as Washington.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,000
The city of Charlottesville, Virginia, left one person dead.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,980
The doubt was 39-25-5-2-47-10.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,500
The White House reports you're listening to PR News and you're listening in Washington.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,180
The New World Order, as it marches down to the final battle,

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:48,560
where Satan and his communist anti-Christ forces are gathered in power and might and wisdom and knowledge and wealth

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,340
to attack the subgenius power of Satan.

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:25,960
The New World Order, as it marches down to the final battle,

11
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:55,960
where Satan and his communist anti-Christ forces are gathered in power and might and wisdom and knowledge and wealth

12
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:25,600
to attack the subgenius power of Satan.

13
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,060
I'm gonna Google you.

14
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,640
You'd be surprised to know just what you can find

15
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,680
about a person if you have enough time.

16
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,760
A little number unlocks a lot.

17
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,460
And I found it. Hooray, I found it.

18
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,680
Now that I know just what you want in a man,

19
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,720
I'll go remake myself the best as I can.

20
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,360
I'll be complete.

21
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,060
So when we meet you can't resist me,

22
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,960
but you can't resist me.

23
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,820
Change up wardrobe and my music.

24
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,380
Don't like goatees, I can lose it.

25
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,280
Learn to play the blues if I have time.

26
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,440
Fill my iPod up with Lenny Kravitz.

27
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,800
Get my head on up like rapid.

28
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,000
Never gonna quit until you're mine.

29
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,120
I'm reading all that I can.

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,700
I soak up all that I read.

31
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,960
I'll become all that you need.

32
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,060
A million.

33
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,200
Why don't you take a chance?

34
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,600
Come on, give me a try.

35
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,960
I'll be your perfect guy.

36
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,140
One in a million.

37
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,240
You've got no secrets.

38
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,800
At least none you need to hide from me.

39
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,400
Ooh, I don't believe it.

40
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,620
Your mother lives right down the street.

41
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,080
I can't wait to get to know you.

42
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,100
Hope you take the best of things I wanna show you.

43
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,780
Open that computer room.

44
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,740
By the light of the Gatot ray tube.

45
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,880
And I bet that you'd be flattered too.

46
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,420
You know I could own you.

47
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,380
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500
And I thought you'd give it up.

49
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,440
But I'm just gonna leave it.

50
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,900
I can't move to the room.

51
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,300
Oh, ooh, oh.

52
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,500
I deliberate.

53
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,780
And I've had to take this one.

54
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
Oh, ooh.

55
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,300
The gaping number of chili pepper plants keeps on growing and erasing me.

56
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,100
I've had so much the joy of getting them.

57
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,160
I missдуct for that popcorn.

58
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,160


59
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,940
ooh, ooh, ooh.

60
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Daddy,

61
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,080
it's so much fun to have the baby home.

62
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,080


63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,500
though the things you're doing to me

64
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:55,500


65
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:55,520
I know some things will come and go.

66
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:55,960
...

67
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,560
Too much fun at X Day.

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,560
You guys had the overload where you're like,

69
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,140
I'm not sure I can have any more fun or I might die.

70
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,220
It's a psychedelic endurance test.

71
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,840
Yes.

72
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,900
Oh, my God.

73
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,340
Endurance is not the word.

74
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,940
Ken Kesey has nothing on us.

75
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,140
No, not at all.

76
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,120
Part of X Day is hanging around and trying to prove that you can be on more stuff

77
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,260
and act less like you're on any stuff at all than all of your friends can

78
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,960
because you've got to be number one dope fiend.

79
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah, but this is not a required practice.

80
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,000
It actually takes a membership in the church that is at a doctored level.

81
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,860
Once you get $35, once you pay your $35 to Bob,

82
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,760
your tolerance to every chemical-nosed man is increased by 50%.

83
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,360
Triples.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,520
Quadruples.

85
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,020
Your consumption levels are just amazing.

86
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,160
Sugar tastes sweeter.

87
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,940
One thing that our listeners who are stupid and don't come to X Day

88
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,940
might not realize is how clean subgeniuses actually are, apart from the smell.

89
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,340
When I first came to X Day, I thought that by the end of my experience with Steary

90
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,480
it would be just a Mad Max-like wasteland of cigarette butts and beer cans

91
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,360
and Susie's armpit hair.

92
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,600
We do have all of those things.

93
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,220
In far less numbers than one would expect.

94
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,580
Goddamn garden of delight.

95
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,140
Cigarette can... cigarette tree...

96
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,320
The beer trees are growing, but they're just little cans.

97
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,360
They're not full yet.

98
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,780
They're right over there by the spam trees.

99
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,420
Can't pluck them yet.

100
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,480
There's cans of beer right next to the spam trees.

101
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,780
There are many cans of beer here at X Day.

102
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,200
We could... with what... the consumption levels here are amazing.

103
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,460
Most people don't know that three weeks before X Day starts,

104
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,420
we come and we...

105
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,440
We plant two beers.

106
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,780
When X Day starts, you have all the plethora of beer that you see

107
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,360
because it's a quick-yielding fruit.

108
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,380
You can see one growing out of the ground right there.

109
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,200
We didn't get that when we picked it.

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,720
And you'll see them sprouting throughout the camp

111
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,360
and that's all of the hard work of your pre-X Day people

112
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,240
who come out and plant those beers.

113
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,980
Right, look, there's two right now.

114
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
They're like tribbles, actually.

115
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,900
They'll have a safety team come in after the fact

116
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,640
and eradicate the beer plants.

117
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,440
Just little guys.

118
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,360
Couple little guys.

119
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,440
Couple beer guys.

120
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,620
Couple more beer guys.

121
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,640
Just hanging out.

122
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,420
They're not full yet.

123
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,320
They may have been once, but there is a belief at X Day

124
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,800
that if you leave your beer cans sitting on the table at Caffeina's overnight,

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,420
they will refill themselves and be cold in the morning.

126
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,460
This belief is, of course, entirely fictitious,

127
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,920
but it appears that many, many subgeniuses believe it.

128
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,200
I absolutely believe it.

129
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,360
It's absolutely true.

130
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,180
I have engaged in the practice and found...

131
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,460
But, you know, I just can't...

132
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,180
I can't give up trying.

133
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,300
You, sir, are a known deceiver.

134
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,740
The beer fairy is among us.

135
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,760
Man, look at her eat that.

136
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,480
I didn't know you could do Disney voices so well, Danny.

137
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,340
Yeah, I can do all kinds of voices for you.

138
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:05,620
That's crazy.

139
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,480
You ever heard your mom's voice come out of my mouth?

140
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,460
Well, now...

141
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,740
She doesn't like to share those tapes with me,

142
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,960
so I've only seen it once.

143
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,960
The thing is, I don't know if I can properly emulate the way you hear it,

144
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,300
because I hear it in such a different context,

145
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,240
than you do, P's.

146
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,760
I'm muffled by her thighs.

147
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah, your mom sounds like...

148
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,400
I hope you're listening, Mom.

149
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,680
I'm so proud.

150
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,640
This is your son.

151
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,000
This is what you made.

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,260
I finally made the big time.

153
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,040
And this is his friend, talking about him.

154
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,300
I can't hear you, Susie.

155
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,260
I have headphones on.

156
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,500
Don't talk to me.

157
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,280
Top of the world.

158
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,680
Just sorry.

159
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,340
X-Day is like the Titanic.

160
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,040
It has a robot stang.

161
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,120
Now, here's the robot stang moving the table.

162
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,520
Who's ever seen stang move anything before?

163
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,120
Speaking of the Titanic, you know, with how good it looks,

164
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,940
I bet that robot stang was built by Jimmy Cameron.

165
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,080
Little Jimmy Cameron himself.

166
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,360
I wonder if Princess Wee had any insight or input

167
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,100
into the designs of the robot stang.

168
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,000
I heard once that there was an attempt made

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,320
to create a subgenius X-Day documentary in 3D,

170
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,560
and that there were actually...

171
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,660
It was a film crew here with 3D cameras,

172
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,020
and perhaps it was...

173
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,040
That wasn't...

174
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,300
That...

175
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,500
That...

176
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,900
The documentary was a front for...

177
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,420
Bobo's easy.

178
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,300
James Cameron's attempts to create a false stang.

179
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,300
Under the orders, the directives of the notorious,

180
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,140
hyper-genius,

181
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,860
Fid Chooley.

182
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,980
Fid Chooley is the mastermind behind everything that's gone wrong.

183
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,280
If Fid Chooley was the mastermind behind this,

184
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,660
there would be more circus music.

185
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,020
No.

186
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,740
We know that Fid Chooley has spared no expense

187
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,440
to have a complex built in the woods

188
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,980
where he now controls everything that's going wrong with X-Day,

189
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,560
in order to befuddle and bemuse Argus Fox.

190
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,500
This battle of wills between Fid Chooley and Argus Fox

191
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,800
has carried on for many years,

192
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,380
but we're not sure what's going to happen.

193
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,420
He seems to have outspent Argus this year.

194
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,840
I'll tell you one thing about Fid Chooley.

195
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,540
He's a terrible dancer and a terrible singer.

196
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,100
Yes.

197
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,660
But he was so well disguised that no one knew

198
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,120
that it was Fid Chooley in disguise.

199
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,300
One man knew.

200
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,540
One man knew.

201
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,220
One brave soul stood against the rest and said,

202
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,700
No, that person is Fid Chooley in disguise.

203
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,820
And the person who enlightened us and opened our eyes,

204
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,140
that was one Argus Fox.

205
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,740
Sound man and general wizard of the Church of the Subgenius

206
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,360
and proprietor of Hypercube Laboratories and Dobbslayer.

207
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,660
Bob Killer.

208
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,000
That man there.

209
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,960
Bob Killer.

210
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,600
Bob Killer.

211
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,000
And they're in the anals of Bob.

212
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,400
Just like...

213
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,100
But we all have a chance to kill Bob every day.

214
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,440
Every day.

215
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,860
You may see a Bob.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,600
I can't hear you, Argus Fox.

217
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,400
I'm wearing headphones.

218
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,340
Don't talk to me.

219
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,380
Don't talk to me, Susie.

220
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,400
I told you once.

221
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,300
Jesus.

222
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,340
Subgeniuses.

223
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,900
They can't hear you when you're yelling at them

224
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,940
through a PA system.

225
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,000
Eight feet away.

226
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,600
Well, technically, we should have a mic that's pointing towards the audience.

227
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm not going to repeat that on the air because it was self-deprecating

228
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,380
and I wouldn't want to say anything bad about Susie the Flusie on the air

229
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,900
because she has the second best subgenius radio show

230
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,460
right after the Thor's Eater and Podcrest,

231
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,820
but above the hour of slack.

232
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,200
We could point the microphone towards the crowd

233
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,460
to get these important questions asked and yet answered.

234
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,640
Shut up, peace.

235
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,140
It would be something getting some questions answered.

236
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,400
Here comes Robot Sand.

237
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,200
Shut up, peace.

238
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,780
Everybody play.

239
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,260
Isn't it cool?

240
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,480
Shut up, peace.

241
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,540
Hi, Stang.

242
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,120
Yeah.

243
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,640
Is that hot?

244
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,440
Robot Stang.

245
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,320
Robot Stang, yeah.

246
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,520
Yeah, look at him.

247
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,520
He's doing the thing.

248
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,300
He acts like he has human affection.

249
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:00,760
There's nothing wrong.

250
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,300
We're making the numbers.

251
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,120
See, he's a robot.

252
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,820
He wants to know if his machine is making numbers.

253
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,420
All he wants to know is his machine making numbers.

254
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,200
Beep, boop, beep, boop.

255
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,480
Beep the hamburger.

256
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,100
Hell out of there.

257
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,000
Hamburger not found.

258
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,600
That's pretty much all life is.

259
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,760
Counting numbers, right?

260
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,040
Yeah.

261
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520
They teach you to count and you never stop counting.

262
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,780
Robot Stang, he's fooled us all.

263
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,280
Not me.

264
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,740
Robot Stang, Chicago.

265
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,440
Not Argus Fox.

266
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,000
The weird thing about robots is they think they're so smart,

267
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,960
but they really can only count zeros and ones.

268
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,280
Right.

269
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,260
How smart is that?

270
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,060
They only know two numbers, but everybody thinks they're so smart.

271
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,920
It's because they can do it whapping fast.

272
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,580
Shhh.

273
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:41,980
Stupid.

274
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,280
Idiots.

275
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,480
Dumb machines.

276
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Who needs them?

277
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,140
Why are they good for you?

278
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,080
You tell them what to do.

279
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,880
They're not dumb.

280
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,660
It's the humans.

281
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,240
When you're at X Day, you realize how little you need machines in your life

282
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,360
because you sure ain't going to be using your phone if it uses cell towers,

283
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,400
which a funny thing about phones.

284
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,440
You'd be better off.

285
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,760
And Dr. Cosmack, the Hypercube Laboratories lead technician,

286
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,980
can tell you that cell phones use cell towers.

287
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,180
It's an interesting thing.

288
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,760
You learn a lot at X Day.

289
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,940
Do you?

290
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,080
Do you really?

291
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,400
I have actually learned nothing,

292
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,940
and I will continue to do so.

293
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:19,940


294
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:19,940


295
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,640
I have learned so much about nothing

296
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,620
that I don't think I could have any more knowledge of nothing put into my brain.

297
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,800
My learning capabilities have been overtaxed.

298
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,700
That happened 30 years ago, Eggplant.

299
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,000
Don't laugh at that, Pease, unless it's a knowing laugh of,

300
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,200
ah, yes, I also can't remember shit.

301
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,680
I sailed that ship with you too, Captain.

302
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,740
There's dark waters ahead.

303
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,680
See, the trick with father figures I've learned

304
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,620
is you've got to make them feel,

305
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,660
that you're disappointed in them.

306
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,460
You've got to beat them to the punch.

307
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,520
You've got to gaslight your dad, people.

308
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,560
That's what life's all about.

309
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,400
It's about getting that old man

310
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,340
and turning the tables on him.

311
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,580
Step by step, you can say that.

312
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,760
How'd you get that bear?

313
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,200
A bear did just run by,

314
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,200
but we chased it away through our prayers and hopes and dreams.

315
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,080
I clearly saw someone bring you a frosty cold beer.

316
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,300
I need a beer garden.

317
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,460
I'd like a beer garden right here.

318
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,060
Well, we've been,

319
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,000
Subgenius has been attempting to plant a beer garden here

320
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,160
at Wisteria for years.

321
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,080
And this was the first harvest that we had,

322
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,800
so we're very excited.

323
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,540
A bear hasn't sprouted in front of me,

324
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,040
and I'm growing rather sad.

325
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,700
Argus Fox, Bob Killer.

326
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,860
. . .

327
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,000
前 ever speed

328
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:00,080
I'm the king of rock

329
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,340
There's none higher

330
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,780
All the rads on fire

331
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,820
Tough as hell

332
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,540
Ur routes are work,

333
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:10,660


334
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,700
I'm the king of the world

335
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,040
Exhaust the 겁

336
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,100
No more

337
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,140
EBO

338
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,780
This is life

339
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:16,780


340
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,520
Why are you just crying?

341
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,340
I can't smoke

342
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,340


343
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,340


344
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,340


345
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,340


346
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,520
Just here're playing

347
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:18,540
But It's an Therweise

348
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,580
We're a band

349
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:19,940
Thank you with love

350
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,020
Back in 1955

351
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,360
Stay the Big Shanks!

352
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:35,260
Back in 1955

353
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,340
And the beginning

354
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,320
Back in 1955

355
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,720
Man didn't know about a rock and roll show

356
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,560
No, that's right

357
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,800
Black men had the smokes

358
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,440
Black men had the booze

359
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,960
No one knew what they was gonna do

360
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,660
But Tchaikovsky had the blues

361
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,120
Oh, let me be rocked

362
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,300
What do you want?

363
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,140
You just don't know what I want

364
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,060
What do you want?

365
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
I want rock and roll

366
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,740
I love rock and roll

367
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,120
Come here, rock and roll

368
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,420
Put a lot of time in a jukebox, baby

369
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,580
Rockin' ages

370
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,900
Rockin' ages

371
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,540
Spill it out

372
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,580
Keep on rollin'

373
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,920
Keep on rollin'

374
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,840
Rockin' ages

375
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,360
Rockin' ages

376
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,540
Realize you're living in the golden years

377
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,680
You can't beat me, I'm a rock star

378
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,020
I'm riding on the top of a car car

379
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,320
When the revel in my full foam pops far

380
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,500
It's almost over now

381
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,740
It's almost over now

382
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,940
And it came to pass

383
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,360
That rock and roll was born

384
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,320
Rocked Pops and Land, every rock and land

385
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,880
The throwing up the stone

386
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,460
And the guitar man got famous

387
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,640
The guitar man got rich

388
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,420
And everybody was a superstar

389
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,040
Oh, let me be rocked

390
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,140
What do you want?

391
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,800
You just don't know what I want

392
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,640
What do you want?

393
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,940
I want rock and roll

394
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,320
I love rock and roll

395
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,700
Come here, rock and roll

396
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,000
Put a lot of time in a jukebox, baby

397
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,000
Rockin' ages

398
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,300
Rock and roll, yeah!

399
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,360
Rockin' ages

400
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,120
Still rollin'

401
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,500
Keep on rollin'

402
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,500
Rockin' ages

403
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,940
Rockin' ages

404
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,980
Realize you're living in the golden years

405
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,920
We will, we will rock you

406
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,620
No sling tail

407
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,620
We will, we will rock you

408
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,260
No sling tail

409
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,840
Riders on the storm

410
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,580
Riders on the storm

411
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,480
Riders on the storm

412
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,300
Into this house we're born

413
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,200
Into this house we're born

414
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,760
Into this world we're thrown

415
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,140
Into this world we're thrown

416
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,580
Like a dog without a bone

417
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,880
An actor out on loan

418
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,160
Riders on the storm

419
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,860
And the music was good

420
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,080
And the music was loud

421
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,060
So let's rock

422
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,900
Get it back

423
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:18,360
Get it back

424
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,900
To the wall

425
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,860
What is this

426
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,240
Fuck off to the wall

427
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,300
Hiss-hiss

428
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,440
Nothing is the answer

429
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,600
Too late

430
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:36,600


431
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:36,600


432
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,660
Dance

433
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:36,960
Dance

434
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes, yes

435
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,520
Force to the wall

436
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,560
Oh lord, yeah

437
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,460
Rock of Ages

438
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,760
Rock of Ages

439
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,920
Still rolling

440
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,280
Keep on rolling

441
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,700
Rock of Ages

442
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,040
Rock of Ages

443
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,180
Realize you're living in the golden years

444
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,140
Rock of Ages

445
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,420
Rock of Ages

446
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,460
Still rolling

447
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,140
Keep on rolling

448
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,340
Rock of Ages

449
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,680
Rock of Ages

450
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,540
Still rolling

451
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,460
Rock of Ages

452
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,780
Rock of Ages

453
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,140
Rock of Ages

454
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,060
Still rolling

455
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,580
Keep on rolling

456
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,160
Rock of Ages

457
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,480
Rock of Ages

458
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:34,920
Yeah

459
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,500
Oh, yes, dear friends.

460
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,740
Pretty amazing, huh?

461
00:19:51,900 --> 00:20:02,040
That was something by, I think, an entity called Dido or Dedo.

462
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:17,200
It's a mashup of Led Zeppelin versus Rolling Stones versus Run DMC versus Chemical Brothers versus Def Leppard and a whole bunch of other stuff.

463
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,540
Man, move over, girl talk, holy cow.

464
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,900
Yeah, rock of ages.

465
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:30,220
Again, I think the mashup artist is named Dido.

466
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:40,800
Dido, something I pulled off of YouTube as a result of a link suggestion by Reverend Susie the Floozy.

467
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,520
Goodness.

468
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,400
Who had scooped up a whole bunch of those mashup type things.

469
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,140
Amazing.

470
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:48,680
Yeah.

471
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:58,400
Before that, we heard a little bit of some pod crust from X Day 20 a couple of years ago.

472
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,040
Some unheard.

473
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:12,980
But really subgeniously, X Day live radio by Reverend Shawgoth, Reverend Pease, and Reverend Eggplant.

474
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,920
And the song at the beginning was Chameleon by Liberty Tubes.

475
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,680
That's the one that goes, I'm going to Google you.

476
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,580
That's St. Andrew the Impaled.

477
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,280
First time we've heard it.

478
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,160
Studio version.

479
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,040
That was great.

480
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:31,920
I loved it.

481
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:47,380
And as almost always, the titles, PR news, and any collages are by the great Fernanda Nandy Lee Murr.

482
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,240
And yes, yes, yes, friends.

483
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,800
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1744.

484
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:08,840
The way we're numbering these for release to the other stations and the internet.

485
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:16,600
The music in the background, incidentally, I left all my stuff at home.

486
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:26,440
But I found something at the station called Amsterdam Bach Soloists Live in Concert.

487
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,560
And they're doing a sonata.

488
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,460
A D minor by Johann Fosch right now.

489
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,300
Oh, they never do any Bach on this.

490
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,400
They do Locatelli, Haydn, and Mozart, but no Bach.

491
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,380
And yet they're called the Amsterdam Bach Soloists.

492
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:47,940
Humph.

493
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,860
Street band in Amsterdam.

494
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,660
Humph.

495
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,240


496
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,820
Princess, we and I have enjoyed string quartets.

497
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,600
We've been performing on the streets of ancient European cities.

498
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,320
Yes, thanks to Tonya and Bucky.

499
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,380
Reverend Bucky and Reverend Tonya.

500
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,480
We're really, really, really lucky.

501
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,080
The best.

502
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:20,580
Oh, and I was going to say, another thing that makes us lucky is all the other stations that play this show.

503
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:28,520
I don't usually have the list in front of me, although I realize tonight that it's on the internet.

504
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,760
It's on subgenius.com in the radio section.

505
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:39,880
But thank you so much, these other stations that we mail CDs to.

506
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:47,320
Because, well, yeah, we could use MP3s and do it all by downloading, but the quality isn't there.

507
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,400
We insist on full CD quality.

508
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,540
And that would include WLSL in Dade City, Florida.

509
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,620
WCNI in New London, Connecticut.

510
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,820
Of course, WREK in Atlanta, Georgia.

511
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,540
Of course, WORT in Madison.

512
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,740
And WOZO in Knoxville.

513
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:20,600
And there may even be a WMPG in Portland still playing.

514
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,220
I don't know.

515
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,040
But now we have a Dave, I think.

516
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,860
You nearly think staying.

517
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,180
You just reflect openly.

518
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,500
You just reflect openly.

519
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,080
And so be it.

520
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,720
I wished for a Dave, and so it appears.

521
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,940
It's the real Dave.

522
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,640
I can tell.

523
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,900
I can hear it in his voice.

524
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,480
It's Dave.

525
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,640
Can you smell my turban, too?

526
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,560
You have a turban, Dave?

527
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,120
Of course I'm wearing a turban.

528
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,940
Don't I always?

529
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,100
I didn't know.

530
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,080
With kind of like a phallus-shaped forehead and a ring-a-lario.

531
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,860
Hee-haw.

532
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,480
Dave, we don't really actively smell your turban all the way from Ashtabula, D.C.

533
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:06,620
to Cleveland, but the memory of it is so very, very real and vivid.

534
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:13,700
It is as if we smell your turban night and day all the time.

535
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,280
It is a medal.

536
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,300
Thank you so much for saying that.

537
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:23,220
Because if I could give people medals of honor for smelling my turban at a distance

538
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,700
through their memory, I mean, using their memory.

539
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,100
I know what you mean.

540
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
I know what you mean, buddy.

541
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,940
Scent memory is the strongest of all memories.

542
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,740
I'm sorry.

543
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,580
What did you say?

544
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,960
Scent memory is the strongest of all the sensory memories, isn't it?

545
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,880
No wonder that pimple got so fast.

546
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:55,100
Well, it's why whenever I walk by an elementary school and whiff those industrial hamburgers

547
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,040
in the cafeteria.

548
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,380
Oh.

549
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,440
Or I used to.

550
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,920
God, it would take me back.

551
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:06,580
I could remember every math lesson, which I can't possibly remember now.

552
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,180
And all those friends of mine.

553
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,140
Yes.

554
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,100
Diagramming sentences.

555
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,880
Well, I'm mainly thinking about all the girls I had crushes on, which was...

556
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,380
Every one of them.

557
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

558
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,860
Sooner or later.

559
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,560
Every single one.

560
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,600
Then one of them finally agrees to go somewhere with you and you screw it up because you can't

561
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,260
talk and you get real scared and nervous.

562
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,440
Yeah, and that didn't happen until I was 18.

563
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,420
And then I still got married.

564
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,820
That's a high number, but you still qualify.

565
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:54,380
Well, I'm afraid I'm like most other nerd fellas, if they'd really admit it.

566
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,560
Lucky.

567
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,260
Lucky indeed.

568
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,820
Yes, lucky.

569
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,820
As lucky as a pork chop on a spindle, I might say.

570
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:15,040
Oh, a lot luckier than the pork chop or the pig it came from, although we all end up on

571
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,280
the spindle sooner or later in the barrel.

572
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,100
I'm going to race to avoid being coming part pig.

573
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,500
Rotating.

574
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:27,700
Rotating.

575
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:27,960
Rotating.

576
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,420


577
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,420


578
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,420


579
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,420


580
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,420


581
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,420


582
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,420


583
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,420


584
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,420


585
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,420


586
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,420


587
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,420


588
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:28,880
Sometimes.

589
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:38,420
Rotating on the spit in the barrel like one of those logo pigs that's slicing his own

590
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:46,420
meat off of himself and eating a pork wrap with a big smile on his face.

591
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,200
Yeah, wearing it like children, you know, laughing and smiling in the park and listening

592
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,240
to the birds hum.

593
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,080
Pigs don't really...

594
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,560
Can't stand when they do that.

595
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,140
Pigs don't really want us to slice.

596
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,260
They don't want us to slice them up and eat them.

597
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,460
But schmoos do.

598
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:09,720
But of course, you know, the conspiracy outlawed schmoos as soon as they knew what they were,

599
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,780
so nobody knows what they are.

600
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,600
My parents used to call me schmoo when I was like a toddler.

601
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,420
Oh, Dr. Sinister came in here.

602
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,100
Yeah, but you weren't fat, Dr. Sinister.

603
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,680
The original schmoos had a belly on them.

604
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,500
Well, I have a belly on me now.

605
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,820
Schmoos are just like a blob.

606
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,420
They could take on any form that they want.

607
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,640
But they were primarily pear-shaped.

608
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,540
Yes, they were pear-shaped like a ham, kind of.

609
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,040
A ready-to-go ham.

610
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:47,640
And they would happily smile through their big mustache while they sliced off pieces

611
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,280
of their own bellies for you to eat like spam.

612
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,580
Yeah, serving up your own cartilage and stuff like that to your friend.

613
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,120
Yeah.

614
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,500
Right.

615
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,380
But again, that's illegal now.

616
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,360
But never on a first date.

617
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:02,920
Right.

618
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,820
And then...

619
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,420
No, well, in China, I guess they put it on your social credit card if you don't.

620
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,840
You got to put out cartilage on the first date?

621
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,620
You know, we're going to...

622
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,260
You got to put out some cartilage, if not all of it, a small degree of it.

623
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:24,620
The social credit cartilage of China could spread to here.

624
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,780
You know, they grade you now.

625
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:39,540
In China, on how decent and patriotic or not your social media and social activities are.

626
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,280
Goodness.

627
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,080
And you can be...

628
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,460
It's worse than social media now.

629
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:49,940
Denied a job or fined for not being literally PC.

630
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,380
Holy schmoo!

631
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,920
Yeah, well, that's...

632
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,760
There's this huge, huge, huge nation on the planet that takes a lot of money to build a house.

633
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:57,760


634
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,940
Except about three-fifths of the nation's.

635
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,360
It's just entirely screwing large.

636
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,880
And it's...

637
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,200
Half of them are rat finks on their neighbors and stuff.

638
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,920
Oh, the United States?

639
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,420
Yeah.

640
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:08,860
No kidding.

641
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,780
I'm sorry.

642
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,320
Yeah, the USA.

643
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,300
It's like...

644
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:14,840
Yeah.

645
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah.

646
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,220
I guess.

647
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,260
It's a nation of finks nowadays.

648
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,640
Rat finks.

649
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,760
To quote William Burroughs.

650
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,120
How did the word fink become an insult?

651
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,400
Or a term like ratting on someone like...

652
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:30,780
Well...

653
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,440
You ever met somebody named Fink?

654
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,720
Yeah.

655
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,020
Yeah.

656
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,320
There was Santa Claus imitated.

657
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,300
He also did the Elvis Presley routine at the ice cream parlor.

658
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,440
Or at the custard shop, whatever you could call it.

659
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,220
Why would you not change your name if your name were Fink?

660
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,700
Well, because...

661
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,860
Because you're proud, man.

662
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:49,780
Yeah.

663
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:49,840
But respected command.

664
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,540
Well, you know what it means in German?

665
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
It means farm.

666
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,380
There's some Vietnamese names that can't be said on the radio because...

667
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,380


668
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,380


669
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,380


670
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,380


671
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,380


672
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,380


673
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,380


674
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,380


675
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,380


676
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,380


677
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,380


678
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,100
Because the pronunciation sounds like something else.

679
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,340
I mean, how would you like to go through life with the name Smucker?

680
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:05,980
Right.

681
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,640
Like that.

682
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,560
Well, if you live in Orville, then everybody knows what your family does.

683
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,360
I guess.

684
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,620
Orville and Analville, they're all the same, you know, too.

685
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,800
I mean, they were the same at least the last time the census came out.

686
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,040
And believe me, that document was too heavy to transpire in one afternoon.

687
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,120
Well, friends.

688
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,000
The important thing is, this is the last show that Princess Wee and I are going to

689
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,800
be able to do here at WCSB.

690
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,060
I think.

691
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,180
Probably.

692
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,780
I mean, we might be back for funerals.

693
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,000
Princess Wee will be back in town more than me, but...

694
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,180
But I don't engineer radio shows.

695
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,160
And I can always call in to WCSB.

696
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,940
But you always have Dr. Sinister on your side.

697
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,460
Right.

698
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:56,140
And on one side, and African Abstract on the other side.

699
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,580
And I'm...

700
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:08,720
I'm going to miss my old bracketing DJs and this nice microphone and these huge headphones.

701
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,560
Nice couch.

702
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,360
Yeah.

703
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,900
And the air conditioning that's not real loud.

704
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,660
The music that you can choose background music from.

705
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,380
Yeah.

706
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,100
Like I did tonight.

707
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,860
At a moment's notice.

708
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:33,240
We're going to miss all that, but there's a reason, you see, for us to leave lovely

709
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,440
Cleveland Heights.

710
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,180
And it actually is relatively lovely where we are.

711
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:49,380
And going to rural Texas full of Trumpensteins and so forth.

712
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,840
But see, for once, we're going to miss that.

713
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,100
And the one thing, we get to see my little sister again.

714
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,280
That's real important.

715
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,600
And my son and daughter.

716
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,580
And we've got a new grandson.

717
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,800
I have a grandson that a great...

718
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,740
A grandson I have not seen yet.

719
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,400
Yeah, he's already walking, sort of.

720
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,340
My mother has a great-grandson she's not yet seen.

721
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,920
And my brother.

722
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,500
And the nephews and nieces and in-laws.

723
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,340
And the sunsets and all our stuff.

724
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,580
The goats!

725
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,340
All those books I brought.

726
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,680
The thousands of books and the thousands of goats.

727
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:39,180
And the house there is paid for because my parents were smart and I'm lucky.

728
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:51,020
And we were going to leave this next Friday, but we shan't because I broke my neck.

729
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,320
Yeah.

730
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,360
Sort of.

731
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:03,600
Actually, I think it's just a pinched nerve, but I'm doing this show, friends, with a big neck brace or cervical collar on my neck.

732
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,100
Boy, does she look stupid, too.

733
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,760
Looks ridiculous, like a robot movie.

734
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,100
Oh, I couldn't fit it.

735
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,440
From 1957 or something.

736
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,500
I couldn't even find my cervix.

737
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,300
But yet, here is that collar.

738
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:21,320
Once you start trying to locate your cervix, it seems to be almost there.

739
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,200
It's a never-ending task.

740
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:32,220
If you don't succeed in the first few times, now your bohina, as they call it in Norway, is much easier to find, especially if you're looking through a loopage in the back door.

741
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,360
What about your Princess Whee?

742
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,620
Have you had trouble with finding your...

743
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,780
Bohina?

744
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,980
Cervix?

745
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,880
Uh, no.

746
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,220
Never have had any problem with that.

747
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,860
How about your platitudes or your erectile cabbage?

748
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,100
No.

749
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,280
Well, those are right up front.

750
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,400
Yeah, they're in easy sight.

751
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,300
You know, there's no way to get around them.

752
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,460
You just grab them.

753
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,380
You just walk up and grab them.

754
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,140
You know, if you're a celebrity, you can do anything you want.

755
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,320
You just grab them by the country.

756
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,500
Yep.

757
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,360
Mm-hmm.

758
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,040
I think if you speak in platitudes, you should get stung by a platypus.

759
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,440
Or at least sharply bitten.

760
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,200
Yeah.

761
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,080
Because that would be even more egregious.

762
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,040
Yes, a pinchy nip.

763
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,160
Well, that's actually a good thing.

764
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,600
You know, you live in a country where there's a mass shooting every week.

765
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,360
I just think there was another one this week.

766
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,940
And two weeks ago, or three weeks ago, was,

767
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:35,860
Stang thought it was not such a good idea to highlight the most recent slaying of numerous people.

768
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,620
Then that next week, there was more.

769
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,740
Well, that was really too much to even mention.

770
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,000
You know what I mean?

771
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:48,300
Because it would be too seasonal and occupational, like a hazard or something like that.

772
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,440
Mm-hmm.

773
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:57,980
And so I thought it would be just a good idea to do it someday, because now I realize it's never going to stop.

774
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,980
How did The Onion put it?

775
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:08,080
There's no way to stop this, says only country where this happens.

776
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:08,940
Yeah.

777
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,960
Yeah.

778
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,900
Mm-hmm.

779
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,100
Oh, well.

780
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:18,240
Well, we're going back to Texas, and we'll have looser-than-ever laws.

781
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:26,600
And I can be the good guy with the gun if I ever actually get a gun, which I probably should do.

782
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,860
I think you need one of those little New Year's Eve horns.

783
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,700
You know, wah, wah.

784
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,320
Right.

785
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,320
That thing comes out of the air.

786
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,520
Yeah, a noise maker.

787
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,500
And if you were a, yeah, a noise maker.

788
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,320
Yeah.

789
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,540
A little, a little.

790
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:44,140
They wrote various orchestral pieces for that, with the noise makers.

791
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:44,840
Mm-hmm.

792
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:46,240
Yeah.

793
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:47,880


794
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,200
And some of them get 15 feet long, and they tickle the person in front of them's ears.

795
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,960
Is that true, Dave?

796
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,740
Well, I-

797
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,680
Are you joshing me?

798
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:58,820
A little.

799
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,580
Well, just think if you were like-

800
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,860
That's why the ranks are staggered.

801
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,200
Yeah.

802
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:16,040
Like, if you were like in a great hall, and you're with your symphony buddies, you know, and stuff, you're tickling the ears of maybe a viola player going right past the tubas and the other French horns.

803
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,320
You can hear that sexy stuff going on in the background.

804
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,760
Slurp, slurp, slurp.

805
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,080
Mm-hmm.

806
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,080
Well.

807
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:28,960
It's gone.

808
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,160
Princess Wee, this'll be our last Sunday night in the freezing cold studio.

809
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,220
It's a lot colder where she's sitting than it is where I'm sitting.

810
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,020
It's more temperate tonight.

811
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,860
It was able to take my feet off.

812
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:47,860


813
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,820
I'm in front of this giant electronic board that's probably a bit warm.

814
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,280
And soon we'll be doing-

815
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:07,560
Well, nowadays, you know, you said it was a giant headboard, but I believe that over the past few years it has become a thyroid pygmy of boards.

816
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:16,860
Oh, we're gonna have to make room in a U-box for that headboard and all those toys.

817
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:17,840


818
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:24,460
Which I knew I could.

819
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,540
Yeah, I said in the video, you know, I showed Alice fishing a few times, and what happened was, I finally could get 100 hours.

820
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:44,600
Well, I figured I should, too, included a ten minute clip I says, have a ceilings sign, like we should.

821
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,840
I'm saying, we could do 20 or 30 in a day, probably, but I'm like, a little bit overly weird and Europa.

822
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:47,840


823
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,220
younger Hercules types to do everything,

824
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,220
including drive all that junk to Texas, what's left.

825
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,280
Hercules.

826
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:04,040
It's only two U-boxes worth, but that's still...

827
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,400
It's still too much money.

828
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,420
I hate having to pay someone to do a thing

829
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,740
that I could easily do 20 or 30 years ago.

830
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,960
And I hate even worse being reminded

831
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,960
that that's the way it's going to have to be.

832
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,640
God darn it, heck, fire it.

833
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,360
Consarn it?

834
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,500
Consarn it to carnation.

835
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,900
Just think of it as a relief

836
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,680
that you don't have to do that anymore.

837
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,300
Instead of, man, I used to do this in five minutes

838
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,000
and it was fun.

839
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,400
Just think of it as a relief

840
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,820
Well, if you're not going to be able to hang on to it,

841
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,760
you might as well completely kick it right in the poop.

842
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,220
Just soak in involuntary slack.

843
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,260
That's what I'm going to do.

844
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,540
Yeah, I'm going to wallow in involuntary slack.

845
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,720
Unfortunately, there's also involuntary expenses involved

846
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,140
in having someone else function as your backbone,

847
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,340
but I'm just lucky I still...

848
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,420
sort of can.

849
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,700
Well, you still have your Republican Party card?

850
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,480
Oh, I've got...

851
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,920
Actually, instead, what I have is a bumper sticker

852
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,480
that says,

853
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,200
Dobbs Cthulhu 2020.

854
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,640
Well, that's some pretty good eyesight, if you ask me.

855
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:33,880
Yeah.

856
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,860
Well, actually, it says Cthulhu Dobbs.

857
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,700
Next year is officially the year of hindsight.

858
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:40,780
Oh, yeah?

859
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,040
Yep.

860
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,680
Yeah.

861
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,020
So...

862
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,380
2020, don't you get it?

863
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,080
Oh, yeah, I guess so.

864
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,860
Loosen up those sphincter muscles.

865
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,400
I haven't heard that...

866
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,260
Breathe deeply as if you were at a yoga convention.

867
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,120
I haven't heard that...

868
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,720
2020 at an optometrist's office in a long time.

869
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,240
That Cthulhu Dobbs image is great

870
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,540
on that bumper sticker, by the way.

871
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,900
It's just great.

872
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,440
I heard it was real scary.

873
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,440
I haven't seen it, but I heard it was real scary.

874
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,880
Did Bob make calamari out of Cthulhu or what?

875
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,260
Well...

876
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:15,580
Bob needs dinner sometimes,

877
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,060
and there's always some pasta,

878
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,840
and, of course, Cthulhu needs souls.

879
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,880
Bob doesn't have one of his own,

880
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,840
but he's got everybody else's

881
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,720
in the Church of the Subgenius in little canisters

882
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,320
in case President Cthulhu needs to be paid.

883
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,680
Of course, it's really...

884
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,000
Then we've got President Furman Supreme,

885
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,120
who already is...

886
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,360
He is president, but they just...

887
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,500
Nobody knows it yet.

888
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,960
Did he slap his mammy ten times or more than that?

889
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,960
Oh, at least.

890
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,000
At least.

891
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,500
You know, and he's got this whole free energy system

892
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,200
involving zombie power.

893
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,720
Because the living dead are kind of...

894
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,600
They seem to just keep going and going and going.

895
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,000
Whether they eat a brain or not,

896
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,040
they never stop.

897
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,980
They are perpetual motion machines.

898
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,380
So, yeah, they're perpetual motion machines,

899
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,840
and President Furman Supreme has advanced

900
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:24,920
pretty serious technical specs about how to do that.

901
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,520
Oh, we just can't...

902
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,600
You can't have that.

903
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,640
It's just a terminal illness by anybody's degree.

904
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,360
It's just like the American bald eagle

905
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,280
winging its way soaring through the wilderness.

906
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,600
Somebody's going to try and shoot it.

907
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,700
Oh, yeah.

908
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,560
Yeah, if there's a national park,

909
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,280
somebody's going to drill it, frack it,

910
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,280
knock over all the beautiful old rock sculptures

911
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,380
that took a million years to...

912
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,340
Be formed by wind.

913
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,960
Because, you know, it ticks off the libtards.

914
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,620
That's what's important.

915
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,880
It makes me wonder what kind of greasy gray underbags

916
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,100
they smoke every morning.

917
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:11,940
You know?

918
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,480
What kind of underpants they're living in

919
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,800
to have such a soulful rendition,

920
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,820
a dislike for their own atmospheres.

921
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,800
Once again, back again to smelling turbines,

922
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,900
which is kind of silly, really think about it.

923
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,140
Righteous anger is the marijuana of the 2020s.

924
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:32,940
How's that?

925
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,800
That's great.

926
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,320
Well, it's kind of swiped from a thousand different people.

927
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,480
Oh, it sucks, then.

928
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,300
Yeah.

929
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,240
No, it's still great.

930
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,440
Even greater because it's the collective work of the people.

931
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,240
Righteous anger.

932
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,020
Everybody's got it.

933
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:52,760
Everybody's got some.

934
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,540
Where will the slack of the masses come from?

935
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,380
I sure have some...

936
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,640
I have some righteous anger, but not like I used to.

937
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,160
Man, I just don't feel that righteous anymore.

938
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,680
I could be wrong.

939
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,300
That doesn't...

940
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:10,360
You could be wrong.

941
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,100
You know, having that...

942
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,080
That kind of self-doubt,

943
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,640
questioning,

944
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,920
trying to learn more,

945
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,900
those don't really fit in well

946
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,960
in this modern political dialogue, you know?

947
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,420
Yeah.

948
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,600
It's all or nothing.

949
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,020
Kill them all, let Bob sort them out.

950
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,320
Unfortunately, it's the dictum from the, you know,

951
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,900
the leader himself or herself,

952
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,900
whichever it happens to be at the moment.

953
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:40,880
Dictum over.

954
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,000
Yeah.

955
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,280
Yeah.

956
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,460
What a way of feeling it, too.

957
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,560
Trying to talk about bad remorse for things you didn't even do.

958
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,500
I can't even remember all the terrible things I did,

959
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,980
but I know I did something really bad.

960
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,300
So I feel all that remorse.

961
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,420
I only have tiny little remorsals.

962
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,040
Oh, why does that go crazy?

963
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,200
You can eat those with a little chopstick.

964
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:06,480
Oh.

965
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,760
Yeah.

966
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,520
A little tiny bit at a time.

967
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,960
Vietnamese foo-foo.

968
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,060
Yeah, it's like the Dalai Lama eating like a bird.

969
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,100
A Lama.

970
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,460
You don't need many morsels of pain or anger and agony

971
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,520
when you're a holy man.

972
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:22,780
Only a little bit.

973
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,260
And many morsels are even better.

974
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,040
In my former job,

975
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,820
they just did another story on this person from Ashtabula County

976
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,880
who was named for a Nobel Peace Prize,

977
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,080
shaking hands with the Dalai Lama.

978
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,420
This is the third time he's been...

979
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,160
He'll never get it.

980
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:38,820
He's just somebody.

981
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,280
Somebody.

982
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,980
Everybody likes it.

983
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,260
When he likes there, you know,

984
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,060
because he's real, you know, he's the regular Joe.

985
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,720
But there he is, shaking hands with the Dalai Lama,

986
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,780
and you can tell the Dalai Lama's just eating a very spicy Momo,

987
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,540
you know what I mean?

988
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,900
He's got that kind of half-grimace look going.

989
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,500
Dave, did you just say spicy Momo?

990
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:02,900
Uh-huh.

991
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,260
I was wondering about that.

992
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:04,860
I noticed that.

993
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,000
I know he said that.

994
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,480
I heard him say it.

995
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,620
Spicy Momo.

996
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,620
Spicy Momo.

997
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,680
What exactly?

998
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,100
What exactly do you mean by that, Dave?

999
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,860
Tibetan dumplings that are kind of fiery.

1000
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,260
Or, you know, hot pepper.

1001
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,560
It's a spicy Momo.

1002
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:18,700
Really?

1003
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,340
There's a food called Momo?

1004
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:21,680
Yes.

1005
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:22,540
Okay.

1006
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,220
Hmm.

1007
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:28,900
There's also an Avatar character emoji that's killing everybody or something.

1008
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:29,460
I don't know.

1009
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,440
Isn't it?

1010
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,100
Oh, no, that's not Momo.

1011
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,500
I know what you mean.

1012
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,080
That's that scary child scaring...

1013
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,900
Yeah, that's, man, that's old.

1014
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,800
That meme, that meme's long gone.

1015
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,180
That was last year's scary clown.

1016
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,920
Last year's killer clown.

1017
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,780
That's what I heard them described as, scary killer clowns.

1018
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,220
Yeah.

1019
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,260
But they haven't been using that routine since the days of the posse.

1020
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,380
And the Invictus wheels and speaker edges.

1021
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,640
You know, when they say orange is the new orange,

1022
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,580
and the kind of cleavage is not allowed, except for certain times of the year.

1023
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,380
Hmm.

1024
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,020
Emoji Momo?

1025
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:16,920
Emoji Momo.

1026
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,300
Hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya.

1027
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:18,460
Emoji Momo.

1028
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,940
You, you, that's when you were supposed to come in with the bass part.

1029
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:25,780
Ha ha.

1030
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,300
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

1031
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,020
Ba da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

1032
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:32,780
No.

1033
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,120
No.

1034
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:36,560


1035
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:37,520
No.

1036
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:38,020


1037
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:38,920
No.

1038
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,160
No.

1039
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,160
It's a scatological kind of review, to say the very least.

1040
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,660
I remember, again, I had to bring my own box of kitty litter along.

1041
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,320
No.

1042
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,600
Really?

1043
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,060
Then I had to wear old gear, you know, like a World War II Army guy.

1044
00:47:53,240 --> 00:48:00,520
Helmet and everything, and knapsack, and leggings, and football shoes, and ironclad iron.

1045
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,580
You know, all of those were the days that I can barely envision.

1046
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:16,080
There's a lot of days that we Daves can barely remember or delve into.

1047
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,920
The Daves of our lives.

1048
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,300
Yeah.

1049
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,020
I've known quite a few Daves.

1050
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,900
These the Daves I know?

1051
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,100
These the Daves I know.

1052
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,100
None.

1053
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:35,080
Not one was truly what I could call normal, strangely enough.

1054
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,520
I hear you.

1055
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,000
A lot of them are bald, I've noticed.

1056
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:43,300
I don't know that anything really is truly normal, you know?

1057
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,980
That's kind of a statistical fiction.

1058
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,880
That's why my sister-in-law could never say the word normal.

1059
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,840
She only said nor-ball.

1060
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,640
Yeah, because she was abnormal.

1061
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:56,780
Yeah.

1062
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,540
Repent, quit your job, slack off.

1063
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:12,000
Well, there is some very, very ancient dialectal homologies where M's and B's get confused.

1064
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:21,200
No, but seriously, Dave, this is like the last ten minutes of this microphone and these

1065
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,560
headphones for me.

1066
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,180
I'm sorry.

1067
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:29,060
I'm going to be back on my home microphones.

1068
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,120
Tarzan!

1069
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,320
Tarzan!

1070
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,200
The Tarzan's mix board.

1071
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,620
And, you know, it's a little limited.

1072
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:46,020
Philo and Bleepo and I figured out a way that we could get three of us on the phone, on the recording, pretty well at the same time.

1073
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,300
But we all have to have iPhones, you see.

1074
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,320
I think that's going to happen again.

1075
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,880
Oh, there's other ways to do it, but they're not as high quality.

1076
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,200
And, yes, it will happen again.

1077
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,080
And with Dave, too.

1078
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,920
But, you know, the last five minutes.

1079
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,040
Which comes up in four minutes.

1080
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,760
I'm going to play the tearjerker song.

1081
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,300
Or track or recording.

1082
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,140
That's where you're going to play the tearjerker.

1083
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:15,860
Yeah.

1084
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,260
Yeah.

1085
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:21,320
There's a lot of tearjerkoff artists out there.

1086
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,060
There are old listeners that we've never heard from.

1087
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,300
They've heard a thousand episodes of this show.

1088
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,520
They've never donated a penny to any of this.

1089
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:34,520


1090
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:42,060
And we're not the stations that run it, nor the PayPal link on subgenius.com.

1091
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,280
Keep, keep, keep, keep the skates.

1092
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:50,100
And if ever there was a time when we could actually, no, I'm not supposed to do that.

1093
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:50,540
No, of course not.

1094
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,520
If ever there was a time, this would be it.

1095
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,720
And this is the hour of slack.

1096
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:57,940
And that's a big if.

1097
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:02,680
From the Church of the Subgenius, found at subgenius.com.

1098
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:14,380
I am personally the owner of the trademark that is the image of J.R. Bob Dobbs' face.

1099
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,940
So don't you mess with me.

1100
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,440
I don't think anybody was thinking of that.

1101
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,160
Yes.

1102
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,160
And I'm paranoid.

1103
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,680
Well, you certainly told them.

1104
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:33,860
And Dr. Sinister will still be tuning in.

1105
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,240
Even though it's an hour later from Texas than it is here.

1106
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,900
I thought you'd like that better, you know, that it's an hour earlier for you.

1107
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,900
It's got a big...

1108
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,880
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1109
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,560
It is an hour earlier.

1110
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,520
It's a traditional thing.

1111
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,380
It is a little easier.

1112
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,220
You get the early bird special for synesthesia.

1113
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:51,920
Yeah.

1114
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,800
Such is your privilege.

1115
00:51:55,020 --> 00:52:02,160
Oh, everything's all central time and a hundred degrees.

1116
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:02,920
Yes.

1117
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,640
Well, only for half the year.

1118
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:06,820
That's right.

1119
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:12,060
If they had any kind of degrees at all, those are the ones you'd want, too.

1120
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:17,280
You know, it's better than MBA, at least as far as skullduggery and tomfoolishness.

1121
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,200
Friends, Princess, we and I have been walking into this station.

1122
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:29,960
Actually, it was in another building before it was this one for about 20 years.

1123
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:30,840
Mm-hmm.

1124
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,500
People used to fall asleep in the lounge in the early hours.

1125
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:34,580
Yeah.

1126
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,580
And they'd say, where's my beer and stuff like that.

1127
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,700
Oh, you used to be able to smoke in here.

1128
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,160
Yep.

1129
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,880
Oh, and drink beer.

1130
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:42,440
Oh, you could.

1131
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,000
They'd have bottles of whiskey in the student radio station.

1132
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,880
Leave the window open on the 29th floor, you know.

1133
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:50,500
Those days are long gone here and every other station.

1134
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:56,060
But, friends, you're lucky to have a station even remotely like this in your city.

1135
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:03,420
In fact, you have two in this unusual city in Clinton Road, Texas.

1136
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:04,760
Oh, yeah.

1137
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,240
You're lucky to have a station.

1138
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,240


1139
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,240


1140
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,240


1141
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:08,240


1142
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,260
Well, if you have internet, you can always hear the Hour of Slack.

1143
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,660
But friends, we're going to sign off.

1144
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,280
Again, this isn't like the last show or anything.

1145
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,140
It's just...

1146
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,980
I don't know that we're going to be back in this nice...

1147
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:27,220
Are you getting old?

1148
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,700
No, I'm not.

1149
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,520
But this song I'm about to play will make everybody that way.

1150
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,500
Remember that old...

1151
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:43,360
Old show, ESO Swamp Radio, that you and me and Chaz and Psycho Pathfinder and Princess

1152
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:48,960
Wee and Michelle George and them were on for years and years and years and years?

1153
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,580
That's what I'm going to end with.

1154
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,160
It's actually a recording from...

1155
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,280
From years and years ago.

1156
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,040
X Day 99 or something like that.

1157
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,140
One of those things.

1158
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,720
I'll leave you potted up, Dave, so that you can hear it.

1159
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,420
How's that?

1160
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,860
Pot me up, man.

1161
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:12,680
Yeah.

1162
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,240
That's what they all said.

1163
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,060
I may jump ship in the middle part if I get too verklempt.

1164
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,420
If I get too...

1165
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:20,760
Oh, you won't.

1166
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,340
You won't...

1167
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,920
It's a little too hard to hear.

1168
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:30,800
But for those of us who remember it, thanks for the memories, dear friends.

1169
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,360
And I...

1170
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,120
I...

1171
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,120


1172
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,120


1173
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,120


1174
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,120


1175
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,120


1176
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,120


1177
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,380
prays bad.

1178
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:59,200
I dream of

1179
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,600
pleasure ships

1180
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,580
from high above

1181
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,900
until I fit

1182
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,360
next year.

1183
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:10,480
Go

1184
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,880
to sleep

1185
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,720
and dream of

1186
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,160
flying high

1187
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,220
on lullabies

1188
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,720
and dreams that Bob

1189
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,780
has now.

1190
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,080
Sex goddesses

1191
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,200
and squid

1192
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,820
shall

1193
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,300
guide

1194
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:34,660
your way.

1195
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,620
The smiling face

1196
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,980
of Bob will keep

1197
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:41,600
you safe till

1198
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,860
your second

1199
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,580
sex goddess

1200
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,960
is gone.

1201
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,760
I missed it.

1202
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,640
Now it's the other part.

1203
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:52,900
By counting

1204
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,120
sheeples

1205
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,400
follow bulls

1206
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,180
to the

1207
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,340
hell they build.

1208
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,080
Follow

1209
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:01,420
blob

1210
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,460
blindfolded.

1211
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,400
Go

1212
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,580
to sleep

1213
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,520
and dream

1214
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:10,920
of times

1215
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,780
when we

1216
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,020
will meet

1217
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:13,780
to sing

1218
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,080
and praise

1219
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,060
the name

1220
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,520
of Bob.

1221
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,460
Sex goddesses

1222
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,540
and squid

1223
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,120
shall

1224
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:25,720
guide

1225
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:27,940
your way.

1226
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,220
The smiling

1227
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:30,860
face

1228
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,180
of Bob

1229
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,180
will keep

1230
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,220
you safe

1231
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:34,820
till

1232
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:35,400
dose

1233
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,260
again.

1234
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,620
Sex goddesses

1235
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,540
and squid

1236
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,060
shall

1237
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:42,760
guide

1238
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:44,960
your way.

1239
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,040
The smiling

1240
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:47,660
face

1241
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:48,980
of Bob

1242
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,080
will keep

1243
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,120
you safe

1244
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:51,720
until

1245
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:52,900
next

1246
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,220
day.

1247
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,380
2001

1248
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,440
2001

1249
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:01,260
David

1250
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,320
talked about

1251
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:03,680
inside he

1252
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,220
had you

1253
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:06,640
know

1254
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,820
Hot

1255
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,160
hot

1256
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:13,540
hot

1257
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,460
these

1258
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,840
think

1259
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:30,840


1260
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:30,840


1261
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:30,840


1262
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:53,780
From PR News in Washington, I'm being held in four states today.

1263
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,280
In Kansas, I'm being treated as one.

1264
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,120
In Michigan, Missouri, and Washington again earlier today.

1265
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:04,680
PR's report the day began as two reports 20 years ago today in Nairobi.

1266
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:11,220
In Nairobi, because the point of the attack was to pull PR News apart.

1267
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:16,080
We have suffered. We are beaten. We will never defeat us.

1268
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:22,140
On Wall Street, 26 to 34, 875, 36, 24, 36.9.

1269
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,960
President Trump says this is PR News.

1270
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,140
In Nairobi.

1271
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,720
And they used a third-party lawyer to make PR News.

1272
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,560
President Trump did not endorse PR News.

1273
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,500
So their names wouldn't be involved.

1274
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,880
The stock soared more than 7%.

1275
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,220
But it will be profitable in the second half of PR News.

1276
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:47,760
Now the largest in California's history as workers continue to search through the PR News from Washington.
