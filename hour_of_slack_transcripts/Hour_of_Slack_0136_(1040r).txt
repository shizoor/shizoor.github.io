Oh why, oh why, did I ever have to love you?
I'd cry, I'd cry
I'm so blue, I'm so blue
If I'm not asking for too much
I keep the memories of your touch
Right now I want you to know
That I will always love you so
Oh yeah
Oh dear friend
Let's go to the Gigolo Club over in Yancey
They got a
So genius
Power of Slack
I say this calls for action and now
Nip it in the bud
Ah shut up
Okay
Friends this is Hour of Slack number 1040
But it's not really
Because it's really Hour of Slack number 136
This is a rerun from
From
From









I guess it would be either
Late 1987
Or more likely
Very early 1988
I think we were working on the book
Three-Fisted Tales of Bob
At that time
And the reason I'm running reruns
Again now is because we're working
On another book
It's called
The Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack
The Bobliagraphon
From Thunder's Mouth Press
It won't be out until
August
But it has to be in
By May 15th
So yours truly Reverend Ivan Stang
Is going to be very very very busy
On this
Third Testament
And not on the Hour of Slack
Although we will keep pumping them out
Somehow
Praise Bob
Oh yes yeah
Three minutes and we're going to be up up and away
Off this dirt ball we call
The Earthquake!
We're

There'sä¿º
On my WAY
I
Think
Everybody's
Some
Has
Our
Wind
Out

Or
So
This didn't look much like a movie to me.
This isn't what I wanted to start this show off with.
Oh, God, the show is ruined.
And so it was.
The show never returned to Earth.
Shot into the air by the antenna.
That you teach you for publishing lies about me in your technical journal.
Now I have my own name.
Jack!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I shall also prove that in space no one can hear you squeak.
No, must get show back from hell.
Not let hell keep...
Who came to understand these things as part of the season?
The great change of the earth.
I don't mind telling you I'm...
Must keep oxygen going for one more hour for an hour of slack.
It is.
It is.
The hour of slack.
The hour of slack.
The hour of slack.
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
A real nice guy.
With a little bit of nice inside.
In trouble.
He tried to hide from himself.
God said men couldn't face up to the end of the age
Everybody, all of us got a shadow
Who knows what lies in the hearts of men
We'll show you
We'll become what we do
Not what we pretend
Between the intention
And the expression
Between the emotion
And the response
Of the show
Sometimes I fail to follow through
On things that I want to do
Sometimes I fail to follow through
And other times
I find myself
Doing the very things I hate
Reverend Jimmy
And Tamey Bell
Big time pumpers with a story to sell
Wait a minute
Who's their fingers better than you?
Their attention
Listen up
Don't try to deny it
They're covering
The truth
Listen up
Everybody
All of us got a shadow
Yes, welcome dear friends
To the subgenius
Radio Mania
The voice of the church
Of the subgenius
And the specific voice
You're hearing right now
Is me, Reverend Ivan Stang
Here with Willa Dobbs
Who will take your calls
If you dare
At
And we've had a lot of
You know, since there's a new show before us
And so we got new listeners
And they're kind of asking questions
They ask, you know,
Just what is this so-called church
Of the subgenius?
Well, my friends
I want you to know
That the traitors
The cowards
The betrayers
Of the subgenius
Won't say so
But today
Two worlds are struggling for existence
The ideals of the subgenius national people
And the ideals of the intangible international
As exemplified by the
Conspiracy
It began at the moment
When the Peaks obtained citizenship
In American states
The political emancipation of the Peaks
Was the beginning of a madness
A people who are not part of our race
And blood
But for our race and blood
Unto themselves
They took root among the nations
And that blood called out to itself
And in time
The whole world became their nation
The nation of the subgenius
The Pink Boys
Little by little
The stock exchange
Began to run our national economy
This alien institution
Is almost entirely controlled
One way or the other
By the Pink Boys
In England and France, for instance
The Pink was able to hide himself
So well he was taken for an ordinary citizen
And for this reason
Anti-subgenius in these countries
Has no elemental force
And this is what has allowed
Slack to fall
Apart there
Only there
Only there
Could a form of government be set up
What genius
And individual energy
Could be dominated by a dead mass
And so it was child's play
For the Pink Boys to use this
To the interest of this invisible group
How long can this process
Of race betrayal go on?
It will not cease
Until from out of this chaotic mass
One man
One Bob
Suddenly rises up
And ceases leaving
The leadership
Joys with the other comrades
And fans the rage of the people
Into an all-consuming flame
Of hate
Hate
Against these exploiters
And criminals
Who have never founded a culture of their own
But have dragged hundreds of cultures
Down with them
The Pink spreads his conspiracy
Like a disease
The Pink controls the food traffic
And so brings about starvation
Why?
Why?
So the ferment
The suffering
The need for
Revolution
Will never end
Because in the world chaos
This talentless
Abominable race
Maintains its strange power over the world
The Pink Boy wants war
And causes war
He needs ignorance
And promotes ignorance
We shall fight them across the face of the entire world
We shall gather our strength
And strike them down
Subgenius
And mutants of every nation
Must join in the struggle against
The human rights
Of exploiters and oppressors of all peoples
I hope that that answers any questions about
What is the church of the subgenius
Oh yeah, but it's a nice church, you know
Wow!
The other shows get in the way though
And we can't tell the full truth
Not in this reality
Shall we look around and see
What's happening down in our control room today?
Sure
Here comes the collar simulation
Here comes the collar simulation
Now we can substitute equations of motion
Collar dynamics, moments of inertia
And brain simulation
And autopilot and stability control proposed
And brain simulation autopilot and stability control proposed
The color of the effects on the ground effects area.
Look, it's talking to us.
The caller sits up and talks.
Yes, just like real life.
Yes, doctor?
Just like a little bunny.
Now, this is supposedly a real question.
I've got diarrhea.
Look at his sloppy ears.
Too bad about his other hand.
He waited 18 years to say that on the radio.
Well, well, well, it's all an amazing...
Isn't it exciting?
This show allows the common people to do anything they want.
It's called glossolalia.
You should take out your tampions before you phone the show.
That's bears, doctors, not rabbits.
They're bears.
They'll never really get it together.
It's just a little teeny color.
Babes in the woods, where we're concerned.
My colleague is referring to the fact that the plug that the bear puts in his anus when he hibernates
so that the ants cannot get in, it is called a tampion.
Tampine.
Yes, it's a word not many people know.
Tampion of the people.
Shocking.
True.
But other news.
Back to normal.
Data bears model boys for the show.
A large slimy object proved to be Cary Grant's Rolodex,
which had been...
Previously stored by...
A warm, squishy place by Nancy Reagan.
...in the interior of a large bivalve.
Now we're doing a close-up on the dome structures.
...the scariest sovereign of the seas.
And here's the image processing of the HAL module.
Oh, hi.
Am I on TV?
Yes, of course.
Well, uh...
I'll show you his mission scenario now.
Oh, I know that.
You're not supposed to be looking at that.
Oh, sorry.
I'm putting the camera up to head level now.
We'll be queuing that night of shooting tape in just a moment.
Ah, yes.
Uh...
You'll be seeing that tape just in a moment now.
And now, using our computer interfaces...
It's coming up.
Uh, and...
We go into signal conversion mode.
Yes, our camera's...
AED, BD back to A.
We seem to have lost contact with our...
Using sound simulation to approximate tapes and records.
Uh, of course, we can also play the historic music that was present on this occasion.
Yes, we're all hoping to hear the music of the spheres here.
Good luck, HAL.
848.
That's different.
425.
That's 848.
Well, I don't know if I see anything.
That was...
Oh...
Unbuzzling evidence...
On the KPFA show in Berkeley.
Oh...
Mike...
Mike...
That's another subgenius show.
This is this subgenius show.
And they all kind of mix up together.
How much...
Is that dog hair...
In the window?
Oh, yes, dear friends.
And you see, it's all media.
It's a big mess of media.
And see, then there was a five-minute religious radio program, uh, without recourse to nuclear weapons.
And then a sitcom in which a white couple, Dan and Joni Clifton, are annoyed by Mr. and Mrs. Waugh.
The Pakistani couple have moved in next door, whose overwhelming curry cooking smells and, and, uh, gives rise to a number of sardonic reports.
And then a public service commercial informing the public that Soviet spies are rife in the technical centers.
Best not speak to anyone you haven't known.
You see, friends, it's all just radio, media.
It saturates the public.
It's the grid.
It's the grid, according to Jon Shirley here in, uh, Eclipse, Penumbra.
It's a worldwide grid with information in wave after wave.
Each wave hitting all the local receiving centers, the cities more or less simultaneously.
There's more of the grid's information as superficial as each unit of information is, coming faster than ever before.
And it doesn't matter if it's a local radio station or a local radio station.







It doesn't matter if it's a lie or not, because it's all information.
And people receive the information simultaneously, and they soak it up passively.
Go ahead, listener.
Soak up.
Soak up, Bob.
Because if the government claims there's a new strain of AIDS that you can only get from talking to commies,
then 80% of the people hooked into the grid will believe the communist AIDS story implicitly, instantly.
And everyone they run into has heard the same thing.
So they all got it at once.
And it seems to confirm itself by its very instantaneous prevalence.
Much like the hour of slack.
And since little real substance exists in this hypothetical broadcast we're doing right now,
there's nothing much to stimulate questioning.
There's simply the basic bull-dada storyline and testimony from a few experts the government keeps on tap
for when it needs their tailor-made quotes to give the appearance of credibility.
Or maybe a flash of a chart to give us an impression that some serious study's been done.
And bang!
Nobody believes it!
You do, pal!
And it becomes true for the public as kind of a consensus reality develops from the instantaneousness and ubiquity of the story.
And that sort of thing makes the grid, our little grid here at K-N-O-N, a powerful tool for shaping society.
...travel into bloody pulp with sickly powers of darkness.
So remember, as we wander through this charnel house,
this abattoir we call life,
that even though the future promises nothing,
destruction looms ahead,
and the end of all joys, old age, raffles...
My little brother claimed the devil rode on his back,
and this is why he was always up to no good.
I command you to throw dirt bombs at cars!
Yes, master.
His main activities were playing with matches...
...and running down the alley with no pants on.
Tarzan, Tarzan in the air, Tarzan lost his underwear, Tarzan say, me no care.
Pretty soon he was considered a bad element,
and you were automatically grounded if your mother caught you playing with him.
If we play with you, mom said she'd cream us!
Yeah!
Like I care! Big deal, you sissies!
Throughout the days of his childhood, he remained fearless and a born hell raiser.
The only thing he was scared of was looking at Alfred E. Newman's face.
Gah!
Eventually, like anyone else, he turned sick.
In 1916, this shed a whole new light on things.
Like a car, which he took off in.
Come back with my car, you lousy kid!
I remember one time I told my brother that the music of Jimi Hendrix was ungentle.
At that time, he was high on grass.
Shut up! And get out of my room!
He was a real hit with girls, but not with their mothers.
Often, he was making out.
Since I was older, I warned him of unwanted pregnancy.
Bye!
You're gonna get in trouble!
Shut up and get out of my room!
He went through what you might call a rebellious period,
which included criminal acts, the world of drugs,
music of the electric guitar, and a 1965 Mustang convertible.
Outwardly, he seemed happy, but I knew better.
The night of his high school graduation,
he took LSD and wandered naked through a fountain expressing himself.
I'm alive! I'm alive!
On the way to the police station,
I was trying to explain to our mom the concept of doing your own thing,
to provide understanding toward my brother's actions.
However, she was not in the right space at the time.
You sacrifice your whole life for them,
and this is what you get in return.
Ingrate! Bum!
I encouraged my brother to expand his intellectual horizons.
He, however, had his own ideas and went to work in a tire store.
Eventually, he got a red Corvette.
He is so materialistic, and it worries me.
I mean, haven't you ever asked yourself,
who am I?
What are my goals in life?
Move in, will ya?
I'm trying to watch Gomer.

Oh, you say we're getting there.
Oh, fine.

Please, be patient.
I mean, that's very difficult to contact outer space.
Oh, now they're coming through.

many, many women here on Earth,
they're beautiful, actually.
They're different from men.
In fact, women are extremely important to us here on Earth.
I hope that that answers your question.
But is there anything else that you'd like to know?
Well, I told you about the women.
I mean, you know, you're repeating the same question.
Maybe you don't have anything like that where you are.
By the way, how are things where you are?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry I brought that up.
Is there anything else that you'd like to know?
Oh, well, temperature here is very, very nice right now, actually.
Before the time of year.
We like our weather.
We're very pleased with it.
It's been one of the warmest winters we've ever had.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.



It's been one of the warmest winters we've ever had.
I can hear that it's been so hot where you are.
Well, that's the way things are, you know.
Oh, by the way, I'm interested in knowing
if you have hydrogen bombs where you are.
Oh, I can tell by the way you said that.
Is there anything that you'd like to give to us?
As a message from outer space that would mean something.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that you're so frightened of us.
There's no reason.
These are little attempts of science.
We have absolutely no intention to do anything.
We're just going to be a little bit more careful.




Ken Nourdain, dear friends.
Good old Ken Nourdain.
Ken, we want that story from you.
The following is another helpful tip brought to you by the voice of the people.
This tip is from the United States Department of Transportation.
On the proper way to wear your safety belts.
The correct position is over the shoulder,
across the chest,
low on the lats,
up under the abdomen.
To get rid of slack, pull the belt out at least five inches and let go.
Slack is automatically removed and the belt will fully retract
when the buckle is unlatched.
Periodically check the amount of slack in your belt and adjust if necessary.
Check your owner's manual for more information.
So buckle up, America.
When you start your engine, drive carefully.
This helpful tip has been brought to you by the voice of the people.
Where slack is taken up when you buckle that thing down tight.
The
first target was this planet Earth.
We will rejoin here to blend our frequencies.
But I have no experience with time and space.
I have lost my way.
I've been separated.
From the others.
We cannot find the other shows.
We must take me to them.
Help us find the other shows.
You must.
They are useless without me.
You must.
You must.
I have to find our own planet.
Mine is the lowest frequency in complex vibration.
The annihilating vibration.
Yes, the annihilating vibration.
The first of all, love the Earth and then the entire universe.
We wouldn't do it.
But you will, won't you?
Oh, friend.
You're a good friend.
I know that you will.
I know that you'll do it.
You'll help us find our respective vibrations.
We'll make you an offer you can't refuse.
Listen to that lovely, lovely music in the background.
More Zug's Rift.
Our beloved friend and comrade Zug's Rift.
Here to play a little bit of...
This is Zug's Rift.
A concerto.
Number seven in eight G.
Do you have any furniture you'd like to get rid of?
Clothes you don't wear?
Toys and clothes your children have outgrown?
The Calvary Arms Project can take it off your hands for you and distribute it to people
who can use it.
You may personally take it to Calvary Arms.
4900 East Bonney View.
Behind Holy Cross Church.
Or you may call them at...
To arrange for it to be picked up.
That's Calvary Arms at 371...
And they'll do it.
They'll take the furniture, toys, and clothes that you don't need and give them to those
who does need them.
So be kind and get with it.
Be like a religious person and...
And be nice.

Well, that's what we think.
How about you?
Give us a call here.
No, you're on the air.
Well, where was that beast you attacked us at?
I was talking about the beast with a million eyes.
The beast that lurks in the dark outside of the angles of our mundane geometry.
Which hints at terrifying cracks and crevices in other anti-human universes which lead off
concatenating along the corridors of infinities of terror.
Wow, where'd it come from?
Well, right here.
It came from Woolworths.
It's 99 cents.
It's made of one piece polyestrene plastic.
One must perform the experiment itself to find out what happens.
But now the subgenius show is going to give away a little secret that's not going to
be discovered by anybody else for about 200 years, and that is that solar systems such
as our own create gravity wells in which Einsteinian forces are indeed dominant.
But outside these wells, all sorts of hyper-evangations of art, temporal simulacrum, may be encountered,
and in fact, frequently exist, in the eternal byways between the receding stars.
And what about the crab-like beings that fly on members wings from the outer planet
and our souls have to land in the New England hills and capture unwary souls to be eternal
travelers, captive in gleaming steel cylinders?
Only their brains travel between the stars.
And the stars clutched in the coiling tentacles of the beings known as the me-go.
It's terrifying.
That's true, but that's on the other side of the country from us.
We don't have to worry about that.
We don't have to worry about the cult of the yink, the evil serpent god, and the mysterious
anti-human bathshogi serpent men.
Hello, you're on the air.
Is it true what they're saying about the modern day broadcaster?
I don't know.
I don't know.

And how they are
baked into the earth.
I don't see the thing.
No.
Harmonic? What have they done to this? My daughter's herself the elf tape.
It's a starboard with a very special song just for you.
No, that's okay. Now, friends, see, we don't mind that you hear us having all sorts of little minor technical whip-arounds here on the Hour of Slack
because it's within our slack, baby.
Like that one Bobby said that one time.
Hey, man, I hate you, but I love you because it's like within your slack.
Let's see what happens on number two.
That's weird.
Well, okay, okay.
All right, fine, fine.
We won't play anything if that's the way this...
Man, the only professional tape I have in here that doesn't even work.
Ridiculous.
We'll clean all those...
Okay, but there is a show.
We're really in confusion down here, but there is a show.
Eve.
One of the code words.
You'll need to get back out of the show.
Just say, ew, and listen for this special signal,
which you'll hear later on in our program.
Dial us then and you'll win the free refrigerator and the expensive imported Cadillac converter kit,
which makes your car into a beautiful simulacrum of Oscar Mayer's original classic 1950s cultural weenie mobile.
Uh-oh, two-shot.
Hypo phony.
This is a fill-in shot we'll use at around 5.30.
Hey, don't give it all.
You know, sometimes the magician likes to keep the mechanics of his craft to himself.
Well, I guess so.
People are often interested in just how they do the show.
Why, you cynic, you exploit the marvelous mystical make-believe of the show,
exposing its secrets as the cheap stagecraft they are.
I join the audience in make-believing this is a show.
And yet, maybe there's some slight thing worthwhile.
Even so, even though you may reveal it to be...
That was the clue earlier.
See, I gave the time for...
All sham and gallifly...
The one moment of worthwhileness...
A simple thing.
But a good one.
A good thing.
Yes.
And you might say a right thing.
Easy to repair show.
Like a shaft of sunlight.
Uh, you know...
Screaming through the window.
And landing right on this little fella.
Right here on his posterior.
It's sunburning the little lad.
Look at that, uh...
Humiliating his pain.
Oh, no!
No!
It burned him to a cinder.
Too much solar radiation can do that.
Well, you know, mostly I think it's the, uh...
The sailors.
They're late, but they're supposed to show up now.
They're wheeling baby number two under the big lens now.
And the dogs are just so happy to tear it apart.
As well as the sawing competition in Woodwork, Connecticut.
Watch this.
Oh!
Oh!
Whoa!
I'll never tell.
I'll never tell.
Oh!
Whoa!
I won't tell.
I won't tell.
It's a show ball.
Uh...
Time.
For the change.
How do we?
Easy.
Easy.
You can tell.
By...

The...
Beached Pigs.
When is it time for the change, friends?
Well, you can tell by the Beached Pigs from Diffuser.
Yes.
A toast to the booty.
Heel down to that.
Or how else can you capture a boogie if you don't attack from the back?
To the rear.
March.
To the rear.




















We're five.

Jump.
Dun.
Dun.
Dun.
Dun.
Dun.
the boogie
here's a toast to the boogie
we'll fight for that
bottoms up
here's a toast to the boogie
we'll fight for that
bottoms up
and there's just a one
some people call me the fun
here's a toast to the boogie
and my name is the one
some people call me the fun
some people call me the fun
and then I find a break and beat it
a move that gives it all to one
I'm like a camera
double up in the bleed
I'm up to my hopes and my fears
I've got jam in my knees
and I'm ready to spread it
all the way to the left
and the front
and the back
I am sir no
Steve Boyd of Florida
please
and I will never thank
prepare to meet your end
sorry sir
for a tale
is nothing but a long
story
And this is the tale that I went in the end.
And I have pinned the tale on a donkey.
And you just went in the face of the mule forever, Star Child.
Oh, mule mow.
Oh, donkey pull, Star Child.
I come from Twinkly Down, Star Child.
And I have made a say in the world.
Oh, mule mow.
Oh, donkey pull.
I've learned no deportable.
Just never dance.
You'll have yourself, Star Child.
Where's your black cloth?
Where's your black cloth?
Where's my black cloth, Star Child?
Where's your black cloth?
Where's your black cloth?
Oh, mule mow.
Oh, donkey pull.
Oh, show.
It'd be show.
It'd be P-Funk.
And it'd be Rainmaker.
Yeah.
Boy, this
accent's so crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The white people and the Anglos forgive the Romans and the Greeks forgive the Romans.
And the monsters forgive their creators.
Because that's where the subgeniuses come from, friends.
The other side of the world.
So watch out for them.
Georgia Street.
The other side of the world.
So around and around and around we go.
We are here, that's the law I know.
We might as well like it, that's the gospel, oh.
The other side of the world.
The other side of the world.
There's a young people falling in love.
There's a young people falling in love.
There's young people falling in love.
There's young people falling in love.
They love temperance.
I got a letter today from Tokyo, a little Japanese girl that I'll never know.
She's eating pizza and singing, let my people go on the other side of the world.
So around and around and around we go.
So friends, that's where it all comes, all this subgenius stuff comes from.
It doesn't come from Dallas, it comes from all over the world.
Because the church is indeed the ultimate flattener of cultural differences,
and yet it's that which exaggerates cultural differences and will die to protect them.
The church of the subgenius is a weird clubhouse, friends, where the door says weirdos only,
and that means it's all nice folks.
Despite their galactic differences, because the most unusual thing these days is to be nice to your neighbors
and let them get away with murder as long as it doesn't hurt you or anybody else,
and that's a lot to ask of a religion.
I mean, all the great religions suggest that same dumb thing, be nice,
but that is the very first message to get lost as soon as that religion gets some good PR,
and that's a sick thing, friends.
That's what we stand against.
Bob Dobbs, that mighty man Bob Dobbs, set up a religion that you can believe in only as long as it works,
and when it does burn out, hell, you can go on to something else.
For the subgenius is a creature upon whom culture does not depend.
Culture is the last thing we care about, style, all that mess, up to you.
As far as we're concerned, we only want you to know
that you're not the only one who's going to be a part of this.
You're the only one who feels he or she must be the only one,
because yes, you are, and so are we, and we dig it, baby.
We're digging it, you know?
The only one.
See, we don't want a one-world government.
No, nay, nay.
We want as many governments as possible.
We want five billion independent governments.
Every man and woman with their own law.
Every yard of kingdom.
Every temple of king and queen.
Every child and dog a serf.
Each with its own territorial imperative, unimpeded by the assholism or censorship or crap
from others except when they cause a lack of slack to others.
Where has the idealism of insanity gone, my friend?
What's the problem?
What has Nicky wrought?
Why can't you people just simply get back to Bob?
Are ye so blind in your incomes and entertainment?

Must material slack mean spiritual blindness?
No, no, we think not.
That is only a condition of the conspiracy under which you all now live.
That is not a condition under Bob.
Bob is the answer, friends.
Bob is the answer.
Just give up your critical capacity.
Just thank Bob.
Because what else is there, huh?
What else makes more sense?
Does your stupid human existence make any more sense than Bobby?
Does your stupid human existence make any more sense than Bobby?

Oh, yes.
It appeals to not only kids, but also adults,
because we all think about,
gee, if I knew then what I know now,
I went back to high school.
What have they got to say, son?
What will be the next evil dispensation from the Church of the Subgenius
following the sponsored virus of the Macintosh computer across these United States?
The plague of boils on the buttocks of raining toads falling from the skies
like the torments of ancient Egypt.
What?
What are you talking about?
Hello, you on the air.
Yes, I know, all the way home.
Yes, yes, all the way home.
These bibulous boo-boos.
These bouffant, toad-like croakers.
Hello, you're on the air.
Hello.
I'm having trouble staying three-dimensional.
Boy, you weren't the only one.
I'm the only one.
What do you suppose to do?
What do you suppose to do?
How can the Church of the Subgenius help me?
Me?
Well, it started 50 hundred million years or so ago
when chemicals were mixing in the sea.
They kept mixing and kept mingling until they fell to little dingling
and that dingling was the start of eurony.
Now that stuff called protoplasm in the early oceans chasm
was the first stuff on our planet that could feel and, if what it felt like,
cause any kind of change.
If it was lonely, it's because it was the only stuff around that could continue.
Causality.
And the other exemplary, multi-dimensional anarchism of our professional prolapse.
Space is actually a fairly benign environment once one removes the interfering bodies
which traveling and velocities peculiar to them may inflict damage on the purely sessile object.
However, if one only cruises along in the galactic plane
the remaining speed derived from the averages of all nearby bodies
and some of them can be very remote indeed,
there's nothing more peaceful than to coast eternally betwixt the black holes of space.
Now you say you're hungry, you might want something to eat.
Oh, I ain't got no breath.
I'm hungry.
I can give you some meat.
Yes, friends, you can get you some meat.
Now when the rooster and the hen go to the bar to play
All the hen have chicken. How do they do it that way?
Well, friends, you can find out how they do it that way from the Church of the Subgenius P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.
Yeah, as you callers, those of you who've heard this show for the first time tonight,
I pity you, oh, I pity you, but you can clarify things by, oh, calling up.

Or writing for information to that box we just gave you.
Or hang around your local bookstore and just keep your eyes open for that mighty word, subgenius.
That's right.
You'll see there's far, far more in your heaven and earth
than you ever dreamt in your philosophies.
Humiliation is a sin.
You're in high school, for God's sake.
No smoking on the school grounds.
Are you supposed to be in this office?
Let me see your pen.
I don't have one.
I'm new here.
When my character first came out,
when my character gets to high school, he's faced with a little bit of a problem.
He has to register.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Who's he gonna register as? He can't register as himself.

Come on man



Come he he he
It's about time
To say goodbye to you
I'm not the kind of person who can hear the sound that you like.
I got a plate in front of me, but nothing is on it.
Because all of us sitting at the same table are all of us diners.
I'm not a diner until you let me dine.
Then I become a diner.
I was in a house last night that was by my own.
It isn't something that made me lose confidence in what I'm doing.
Brothers and sisters, friends, and I see some enemies.
And here, Phil, for you, is a Mothers of World War II, Inc.
membership.
A membership certificate made out to Mrs. Hazel Yoder.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
The pledge to the flag is on the other side.
Do you know that unmarried women could be made mothers of the Second World War?
Around 1942, I think, when we were in our most serious danger.
And it looked like, indeed, we wouldn't be able to win the war for at least another year or two.
Our great low point.
Women were marshaled in by a member of Field Marshal Marshall, Marshall Plan, or Marshall Plain, actually.
Because they were rolled down into these large buildings where these...
Here comes one now.
Women like this, indeed.
Just put it right over there.
Yeah.
Just put it over there.
She's wearing a turtle can, you'll notice, which keeps her moist-proof.
And women, particularly unmarried women, were made official mothers of the American Revolution,
which was what they were told the Second World War was.
Was this the same time that Bob Jones and Lloyd Nolan were chosen by computers?
To be first president and vice president of the U.S. Inc.
That's right.
That's right.
Bob Jones, you've seen his cutout.
He's on the, what, one groat, and Lloyd Nolan's on the five.
The five groat, yeah.
Yeah.
A computer just in 1969.
1969.
Have you got that new money system down now, Peter?
No.
Because I know the change happened while I was away.
And I am so confused.
It happened at the same time as the earthquake, which made it difficult for a lot of people to get with it.
I'll bet it did.
But, uh...
I mean, barrels of Grossman's now replacing those who were folding the green stuff.
The Secret Service is taking the, uh, is confiscating all of the smoking papers made to look like $100 bills.
But they won't tell anybody because it's a secret.
Oh, sorry.
No, you can.
They won't.
And he will not be killed by...
By rampaging Yakutism in 1991 and end up with his head dangling from the Yakutism equivalent of a rearview mirror in one of their vehicles.
Nothing.
Nothing, friends.
Well, stay tuned for, uh...
Coming up, that was a little bit of Fireside Theater's old radio show.
We would like to play more of that.
Couldn't.
Had to get from one deck to the other.
Robert, get his blanket.
I got the poker bowl.
Malcolm X was that, uh...
Wonderful.
Wonderful piece.
Before Fireside Theater.
The music was by D.K. Jones.
Music and cut-up by D.K. Jones and huge voodoo.
So, we'll let the Swingin' Love Corpses take us out with this lovely rendition of Handjob from the Swingin' Love Corpses.
And the local hallway.
See that boy, he's only eight.
He's all there out of mind to play.
See that girl on the 15th.
She's the one who made my fingers stay.
Handjob.
Handjob.
Handjob.
We'll be crazy.
Handjob.
See that girl with a rubble leg.
I'm gonna fertilize her egg.
See that girl, she all is to me.
Sexy woman.
See some of the music I write here, too.
