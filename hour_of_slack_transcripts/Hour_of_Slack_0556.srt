1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
This is Joe Offrecht of the Order of Dionysus Sabazios.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,140
You're listening to the Hour of Slack and the Reverend Ivan Stang.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,520
Ejaculate in your moon pants.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,760
You know, pants like the astronauts wore to the moon.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,040
Oh, do we need to do that again?

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,840
Okay, but it would be wrong.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,880
Uh, that's the, uh, clapper loader, uh, the best boy in the dolly grip,

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,500
who's just, uh, there on strike.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,040
I'm sorry to tell you that, Mr. Stang,

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,940
but, uh, they say that this production can't move on

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,380
until their demands are satisfied.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,540
Well, uh, let's go on with the press conference, uh...

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,040
He said in verse 21,

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,240
And you that were sometime alienated

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,900
and enemies in your mind by wicked works

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,360
yet now have dereconciled

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,180
and we were all alienated in our minds by wicked works.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,640
That's our past. That was no past.

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,280
And that's our past tonight. That's a past.

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,100
But the second thing we see,

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,540
is the present.

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,920
We must endeavor to permeate every facet of American society.

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,020
The subgenius hour of swag.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,260
and never leave.

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,580
Oh, isn't it wonderful?

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,980
Be a success.

27
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,800
And that's all he thinks about. That's all he thinks about.

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,000
You know, I longed, so, for success.

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,920
Kinda hard to believe that it's brought me all these problems.

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,940
You don't accept that.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,580
You want to be famous, have sex with lots of different people.

32
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,740
And you're thinking that if you just get the right breaks,

33
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,740
you'll get there one day.

34
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,240
And if you burn out along the way,

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,220
hey, at least you were doing what you wanted to do, right?

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,900
Sure, so you dream. If only!

37
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,060
But only, only happens on TV.

38
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,060
And you're tired, and you're tired of being tired,

39
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,740
tired of the hours rolling by,

40
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,100
the days accumulating in the chasm

41
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,900
between them and you getting bigger.

42
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,320
So you scream, nothing makes sense,

43
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,740
and it just isn't fair, no.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,240
It isn't fair, but the haves don't care

45
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,200
if it's fair or not.

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,360
They're too busy out getting more.

47
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,500
So genius people, why, they're the salt of the earth.

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,740
You'd like to rub elbows with them.

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,460
Sound impossible?

50
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,980
Yes, you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb.

51
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,640
You take the pinch of salt,

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,560
you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb,

53
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,140
walk with the shrooms around,

54
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,200
turning the decapitated child's head,

55
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,180
and then jump into the grave and say,

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,180
hop on my thumb, hop on my thumb,

57
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,440
this is a problem I must overcome.

58
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,860
Throw in a dead cat,

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,440
or a live cat that's not feeling well,

60
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,140
then cover with the sod,

61
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,540
and when the birds chirp on the third Saturday

62
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,620
after Micklemas,

63
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,600
take a large dill pickle and insert it in...

64
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,140
Shove it up here.

65
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,160
I must start all over again.

66
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,600
I've got to start this damn show all over again.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,820
I believe...

68
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,780
...

69
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:20,780


70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,560
...

71
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:23,640
...

72
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,500
...

73
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,880
...

74
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,720
...

75
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,320
...

76
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,620
...

77
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,900
...

78
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,200
...

79
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,220
...

80
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,460
...

81
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:45,480
...

82
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:45,520
...

83
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
...

84
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,540
...

85
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:07,420
Well, I was out in the barn that morning implicating some disciplinary imperatives on my old dog, Blue.

86
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,140
It seems that Blue had exercised the incoherently bad judgment to appear at the back porch in front of my wife

87
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,720
with blood and feathers around his mouth,

88
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:24,900
a sure sign that the miscreant canine had dispatched and masticated one of our prized bantam hens.

89
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,340
Well, she, my spousal liability that is,

90
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,160
kicked up such a fuss about that killed chicken that I knew something was going to have to discombobulate that dog.

91
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,260
Truth was, I was kind of getting over old Blue myself,

92
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:47,360
what with me having stepped barefoot into a gargantuan pile of steaming dog by-product just the day before.

93
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,800
The memory of that warm, stinking goo squishing up between my toes

94
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,880
added to the fresh murderous smell of the dog.

95
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:02,960
The smell of that beloved chicken added up in my mind to a cold calculus of clear-cut crime and punishment.

96
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Yes, old Blue would have to pay for his misapprehension,

97
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,620
and so that was why I was in the barn that morning,

98
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,440
slowly skinning him alive with my trusty fish knife.

99
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,640
His howls and unearthly ululations filled the crisp bucolic air

100
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,860
with the sweet music of agonizing inquiry.

101
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,600
The dog dann was neck-to-neck with heavy

102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,520
andMRRIOO- fuels trying its most sweetest death again and I started to de-ha-

103
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,740
from his twitching, bleeding body.

104
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,300
I was about three-quarters done skinning Blue

105
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,580
when I heard my wife calling to me

106
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,240
between that egg-sucking animal's howls for mercy.

107
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,500
It was a good time to give Blue a break

108
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,380
since he was getting tired from struggling

109
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,960
and his screaming had become less hysterical.

110
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,440
Well, I put aside my knife and left Blue in the barn,

111
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,020
all nailed to the floor and mostly skinned and all,

112
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,100
and ejaculated down the path to the house.

113
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,780
Turns out my wife wanted me to meet this preacher

114
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,240
who had stopped in on us,

115
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,720
a missionary from this new religion

116
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,080
that had just come to town.

117
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,260
The missus served Jimson weed tea and sugar cookies

118
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,380
while we got acquainted.

119
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,540
He said they were the universal church of the subgenius

120
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,920
and that he wanted some guy named Bob

121
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,000
to come into our minds and give us this slack,

122
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,940
as they call it.

123
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,820
He seemed like a nice, clean-cut lad

124
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,840
with a tattoo of a coiled snake

125
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,080
on his face.

126
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,340
He had a little head on top of his shaved head

127
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,540
and a tiny screwdriver stuck in his left nostril,

128
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,260
probably from a nice little rural area

129
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,500
just like around here.

130
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,320
I always like to listen to preachers

131
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,120
and ask them lots of questions.

132
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm fascinated by metaphysical speculations

133
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,940
and it was real different to hear somebody

134
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,800
talk about somebody besides Jesus for a change.

135
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,860
We've had them all come by here,

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,200
the Baptists and the Presbyterians

137
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,620
and the Methodists, lots of Methodists,

138
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,420
and the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Moonies.

139
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,780
Not so many of those anymore as there used to be.

140
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,740
And once we even had a pair of Hare Krishnas.

141
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,460
The little woman and I don't watch the TV,

142
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,440
so we have lots of time to listen to them

143
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,560
explain everything about their religions,

144
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,040
manifestos, and prophetic prognostications

145
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,840
down to the last little detail.

146
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,280
We can get into that sort of stuff for hours,

147
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,900
sometimes days.

148
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,400
Well, while this series,

149
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,200
Semi-Yeti as he called himself,

150
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,080
explained to me about how these UFOs were gonna come

151
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,140
and save all the abnormal people

152
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,660
from the imminent apocalypse and so forth,

153
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,280
my wife made like she was gonna get more

154
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,440
Jimson weed tea.

155
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,000
When she laid that five-pound mallet

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,360
upside his preaching head,

157
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,440
he didn't even see it coming.

158
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,740
While he was stunned and twitching

159
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,300
like he had ants in his pants,

160
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,220
we drug him up to the barn

161
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,860
so I could stabilize him

162
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,140
to my special rack I built for guests.

163
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,560
When he'd come around to his sensibilities again,

164
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,820
the helpmeet and I just pulled up a pair of chairs

165
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,060
close to him and Blue

166
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,380
so as we could burn him with these red-hot metal rods

167
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,960
from a little charcoal hibachi we had set between us.

168
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,200
Well, old Blue was moaning real low

169
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,440
and sort of continuous,

170
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,860
while this sub-genius preacher

171
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,320
shrieked real high and staccato.

172
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,680
And, you know,

173
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,840
it was some of the most important thing I ever did.

174
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,100
It was some of the best duet singing

175
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,440
the little woman and I had ever heard.

176
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,480
He answered all our questions at length for hours

177
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,840
about the fall of Mutantis in Antiquitum

178
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,140
and the malevolent Jehovah One

179
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,460
and about Reverend Ivan Stang

180
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,520
and the evil conspiracy of normal folks

181
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,400
who regress freedom while their religions

182
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,000
force them to disequilibriate the ecology.

183
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,580
He had a lot to say,

184
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,640
and when he slowed down talking,

185
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
we would encourage him to say,

186
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:01,800


187
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:01,800


188
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:01,800


189
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:01,800


190
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:01,800


191
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:01,820
we would encourage him to say,

192
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,280
we would encourage him with another jab

193
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,620
from a smoking poker.

194
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,120
He told us all about the conspiracy

195
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,220
and this fellow Bob

196
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,060
who had worked for the conspiracy

197
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,200
but turned against them

198
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,920
to set abnormal people free

199
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,820
and save them from religion

200
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,940
and all this other stuff.

201
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,360
The missus and I really liked the parts about UFOs.

202
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,340
We like UFO stories,

203
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,280
and he had lots of them.

204
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,580
When he told about X-Day

205
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,800
and everything getting blown up,

206
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:31,800


207
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:31,800


208
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:31,800


209
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,100
and all the bad folks dying slowly in agony

210
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,860
or living in an unending earthly hell,

211
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,180
I really got into it

212
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,020
and jabbed old Blue with my poker a few times

213
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,080
to get him going again real good

214
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,760
to accompany all this good preaching we were hearing.

215
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
But all good things must end,

216
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,420
and that bad old dog finally did just up and die

217
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,560
right about when our preacher guest

218
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,260
was running out of things to say.

219
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,800
I figured it was worth it.

220
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:01,800


221
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,280
I was working up to around supper time,

222
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,420
and I still had work to do.

223
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,700
So I went ahead and rammed a pitchfork

224
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,740
through the boy's head

225
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,060
and started gutting his carcass

226
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,880
while the wife went down to the house

227
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,720
to start dinner.

228
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,220
After I cleaned up the mess in the barn,

229
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,280
I took the preacher's head out

230
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,900
to the secret root cellar

231
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,560
in the brushy part of my land.

232
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,180
Then I put his head on the shelf

233
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,260
at the end of the row

234
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,040
of other missionaries' skulls

235
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,740
who had entertained us over the years

236
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,640
with their tales,

237
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,360
of gods and miracles and revelations.

238
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,780
I locked the door,

239
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,080
replaced the camouflage cover,

240
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,760
and went down to dinner.

241
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,840
Amazingly enough,

242
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,940
the day was already spent,

243
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,800
dusk was gloaming,

244
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,320
and the nocturnal babbling

245
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,300
of the common Indiana howler monkey

246
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,520
would soon begin.

247
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,040
When I got to the house,

248
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,420
I cleaned up and sat down

249
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,700
to a hearty dinner with my housefrog.

250
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,300
We talked about the strange

251
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,480
and wonderful things

252
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,300
our preacher friend had told us.

253
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,980
But we decided that the Universal Church

254
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,000
of the Subgenius wasn't for us,

255
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,820
because we were definitely very normal.

256
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,160
And we didn't think those exists

257
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,380
would probably like us.

258
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,900
We still occasionally read

259
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,360
that pamphlet number one

260
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,840
he left on the coffee table.

261
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,040
It's a real hoot,

262
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,960
especially after a few shots

263
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,140
of jimson weed tea.

264
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,200
Anyway, I was getting ready to go to bed,

265
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,120
all tired,

266
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,700
and fatigued from the day's

267
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,100
unanticipatory excitement,

268
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,360
when I suddenly remembered

269
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,380
I completely forgot to clean up

270
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,080
old, mostly skinned,

271
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,440
nailed to the floor,

272
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,700
and dead blue.

273
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,940
I cursed my absent-mindedness

274
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,300
as I grabbed a flashlight

275
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,220
and a shovel.

276
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,280
If you'd like to order

277
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
the complete set of Bob's

278
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,540
extremely bad stories to tell children,

279
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,580
just write your congressman

280
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,940
and demand public funding

281
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,500
for me to produce the tapes.

282
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,660
Tell your senator or representative

283
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,900
that Bob wants him or her

284
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,900
to give tax money to Reverend Dr. Nolan Void

285
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,300
of the Universal Church of the Subgenius.

286
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,500
Mooreanslag tortoise

287
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,040
Ja results

288
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,340
jawit

289
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,180
Hubert

290
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,880
c

291
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,860
computernet

292
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:42,960
lotus

293
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,660
slowly replacing them until there's nothing left but the virus.

294
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,180
And you won't be able to wake up from the nightmare about the show.

295
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,420
This is Joe Offrecht of the Order of Dionysus Sabazios,

296
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,940
and whenever I want to get horny with a chick,

297
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,060
I listen to the Hour of Slack and the Reverend Ivan Stang.

298
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,760
Remulation has a thousand songs that one by one pursue.

299
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,440
Running, falling, vomiting forth,

300
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,600
cobras enamored of fire escapes.

301
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,520
Void, oh, oh, so inspiring.

302
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
That's based on a true story, by the way.

303
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,820
I'm sure you can just hear the ring, the very ring, the smoke ring of truth in that.

304
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,380
And we'll have more of those fine things coming up.

305
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,860
I think we also heard a little bit of thought alchemy,

306
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:06,660
and certainly KPFA, the endless show that must never die.

307
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,200
We may go back into that self-same show

308
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,860
at some point, although...

309
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,240
Although, I'm thinking, you know,

310
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,840
we've had some side word-a-bob.

311
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,460
I mean, we've had word-a-bob on the side,

312
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,900
but we haven't really gotten into the biblical word-a-bob.

313
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,520
Friends, before I get on into the satanic rock and roll music we'll be playing and so forth,

314
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,700
I did want to read to you this...

315
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,300
some scripture.

316
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,500
I mean, when was the last time we read any scripture on the dang show?

317
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,680
Now, for all I know,

318
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,620
I might have read this very one on the dang show to you three, four weeks ago,

319
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,860
but I don't think so.

320
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,700
I think I thought about it and then didn't,

321
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,100
but as it says in...

322
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,420
Where did it say this?

323
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,720
Oh, Saint Seminole, the Stagirite, in the dubious Apocrypha of the Indolent,

324
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,060
bespoke...

325
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,900
Actually, this is from a vision, I believe.

326
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,180
Let's get this balanced just right.

327
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,720
And lo, on the seventh day,

328
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,780
when the Lord was resting and not looking,

329
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,560
the first bob created he him,

330
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,140
superfluous beasts of the field.

331
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,660
And among these were the jackalopes,

332
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,160
and the griffons, and bunyips,

333
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,720
and manticores, and hydras, and lake serpents,

334
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,060
and bigfoots, and pushmipulius,

335
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,860
and snipebirds, and geetra, and gamora.

336
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,720
And he looked him upon his handiwork and said,

337
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,400
Lo, it is good.

338
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,740
And on the eighth day,

339
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,540
when the Lord awoke and saw what the first bob had done,

340
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,960
he waxed wroth and spake unto bob,

341
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:16,200
Lo, these beasts of the field are unclean in mine eyes,

342
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,020
and of foul odor to mine nostrils.

343
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,520
And so I shall give unto my children, Adam and Eve,

344
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,920
brains that they might disobey.

345
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,260
And after a certain time,

346
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:39,020
they shall slay all thine animals which are ludicrous before mine eyes.

347
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,580
And on the ninth day,

348
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:49,600
the first bob in his sadness created him certain plants of the field,

349
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,020
these being habifropsipulops, and hops, and grains,

350
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,500
and strange yeasts, and molds, and fungi,

351
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,420
that God's children might eat of them,

352
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,280
and fall down, and pass out, and have visions.

353
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,220
And when the Lord had seen what bob had done,

354
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,400
he put his arm over bob's shoulder,

355
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,000
and they the both of them laughed with a great heartiness

356
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,500
that shook the earth and rent it.

357
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,600
For the Lord was glad from bob's jokes,

358
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,580
and said,

359
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Bob, thou hast shown unto me slack,

360
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,420
so thou art surely my son,

361
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,060
or surely at least my adopted son,

362
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,220
for thou art dearer to me than my shiftless real son,

363
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,080
Satan,

364
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,500
that old serpent.

365
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,700
And from that day both the Lord and Bob

366
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,760
made merry and enjoyed great mirth,

367
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,160
as they made more jokes upon creation,

368
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,780
and man,

369
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,120
and woman,

370
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,840
forevermore.

371
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,740
Ah, yes, dear friends,

372
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,780
you know the word bob is so beautiful when it comes to you like that,

373
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,800
with background music.

374
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,300
Because personal cosmologies are always helpful,

375
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,720
but they are not the important thing.

376
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,680
The answer is always,

377
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,160
it is ineffable.

378
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,360
I knew it all along.

379
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,040
Now I get the joke.

380
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,740
The problem is to remember where you stand,

381
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,340
leave the labyrinth of symbols behind,

382
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,840
and rise to the occasion of that it.

383
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,360
Because yes, dear friends,

384
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,760
yes, after all these centuries of organized belief,

385
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,800
a religion that finally comes out and admits that it can't be said,

386
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,060
because it is what is being said and doing the science,

387
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,780
and saying at the same time.

388
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,460
What is mind?

389
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,300
No matter.

390
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
What is matter?

391
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,500
Never mind.

392
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,960
For let them mount up upon themselves

393
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,140
if they do not see

394
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,260
the humour

395
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,800
in it.

396
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:38,060


397
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,920
I apologize for that.

398
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,980
That was a little excerpt from the Hour of Slack.

399
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,000
That was of course the Reverend Ivan Stang you heard.

400
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,560
Yeah, that was the Reverend Ivan Stang running at about 80% speed.

401
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,420
I like it better that way.

402
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,740
Keep going along.

403
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:37,560
Okay, we're trying this yesterday.

404
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:37,620


405
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:37,620


406
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:37,620


407
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:37,620


408
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:37,620


409
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:37,620


410
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:37,640


411
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:37,640

Austin, Texas, 787-65-4542

477

And, uh, yes, yes, yes

478
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,140
This is Joe Offric of the Order of Dionysus Abasios

479
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,760
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack with Reverend Ivan Stang

480
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,020
I want you to suffer from

481
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,980
Up against the underwear syndrome

482
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,380
People in jail for stealing Preparation H

483
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,620
While murderers go free to write million-dollar books

484
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,380
There's no justice in the world

485
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,720
The haves live the good life and buy their justice

486
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,860
While you receive your sentence

487
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,900
Hypocrites and liars everywhere

488
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,680
How can you trust anyone if everyone is out to get theirs first?

489
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,940
A small few

490
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,700
You control everything

491
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,140
Sure, your only response is to take the safe route

492
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,460
College right out of high school

493
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,420
Get that career that everyone admires

494
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,500
Do the right things everyone says you should

495
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,800
Well, years will pass and you'll have stayed where you're at

496
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,960
Put up with the abuse in order to climb the ladder

497
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,880
But eventually you'll melt down

498
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,060
I tell you, yes, yes, you can and must self-deprogram now

499
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,800
So disconnect is of the utmost importance

500
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,260
Bob is now doing it for you by making you now do it

501
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:14,680
Go ahead, caller

502
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,280
Dear?

503
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,960
Is it a mind killer?

504
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,020
So if you know any high school students, they should be listening right now

505
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,660
They make excellent converts

506
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,120
Well, recruiting converts to fly down to Dobstown

507
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,060
So anytime you want to and explore the undiscovered mood modes and juggle them

508
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,120
Come on over and listen to the studio

509
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,600
Provoke your mental-life eco-twins with an act of poltergeist

510
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,140
And by feeding messages and thoughts

511
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,320
Communicate with the welding shaft of suppression

512
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
It's ornicationalism

513
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,340
And with consenting subgenie-tiloids and non-consenting pigs

514
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:39,580
Hello?

515
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,700
Hey, I say nuke on, you know?

516
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,160
Well, we were trying to find out exactly what the mutants looked like

517
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,080
I'd be real interested

518
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,680
I think this film is about the clearest version we have

519
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,460
You can see that he has no shoulder

520
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,320
His head in the pipe there on the

521
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,060
You can kind of see the shadow of the pipe

522
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,840
It's hard to see the pipe

523
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,940
There's a scope on the pipe

524
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,280
And that may have been airbrushed in

525
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,720
There's a, see there's a

526
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,200
Now we're showing you the grassy knoll

527
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,060
I've never seen the dots up this close, Doug

528
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,080
Yeah, this is an amazing, never-seen-before footage

529
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,020
On Channel B.O.B. if you're watching right now on cable vision

530
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,140
And you can see

531
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,320
You can see the bob here before us

532
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,540
You can see there was a bob on the grassy knoll right here

533
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,140
You can see the, there's the dobshell

534
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,320
There's the dobshadow

535
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,620
Now there's another dobshadow over here

536
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,360
I'll tell you what the mutants are

537
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,020
It's those goddamn ashtrays in Harrah's Lake tunnel

538
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,640
That's exactly what I mean

539
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,500
They're all over the place

540
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,720
Then I have talked to them

541
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,040
Everywhere

542
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,700
People take them to their suitcases

543
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,060
Their coffee tables

544
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,640
I mean, you know, every grandma in the world's got one of them

545
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,240
Yeah, I know, I have talked to them

546
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,300
Bye-bye

547
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,940
Well, in this amazing footage you can see the acupuncture centers

548
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,920
Now open in Dallas, Fort Worth, San Francisco, Honolulu, Anchorage, Guam

549
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,820
Again, Yaguam

550
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,660
And parts of Tennessee

551
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:53,120
Not available in Louisiana, Utah, Missouri, Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island

552
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,540
Some of these stupid science fiction techniques actually are effective medical principles

553
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,260
When applied correctly can produce great amounts of slack

554
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,960
See, see what this guy's, now see the guy in the bottom there

555
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,360
There we go, now he can see the eight sacred interfaces of his personality

556
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,760
Yes, Larry Moe Curley

557
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:13,940
Groucho

558
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,000
Oh, Dr. Gabrofram, call for Dr. Gabrofram

559
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,600
We know who calls before they do here

560
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,600
Call for Dr. Gabrofram

561
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,380
Where's Dr. Gabrofram?

562
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:26,000
Do you think that the subgenius started with those ashtrays?

563
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,540
We are relatively new to this research

564
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,800
Evolution of ashtrays or?

565
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,800
No, Lee

566
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,960
It has nothing to do with the ashtrays

567
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,580
That's a religion

568
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,000
It's a pamphlet that it started with

569
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,740
There was a pamphlet on the ground and it grew into a religion that scared everybody

570
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,340
And the ashtrays were left alone

571
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,800
But they, those are the mutants that you were talking about before

572
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,420
And they may be part of the alien conspiracy

573
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,560
I'm not sure of the Jesuit conspiracy inside the Satanist conspiracy

574
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,660
But the problem is that we

575
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,740
Well, I'm going to send you my wallet

576
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,200
Okay, good, we've all talked to those

577
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,540
We've all had a lot of fun

578
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,240
I think that you should continue talking to the mutants and the ashtrays

579
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,960
Because at this point, sometimes the ashtray is going to talk back to you

580
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,400
And you know at that point you've made contact

581
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,020
That's always the most important part, them talking back to you

582
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:04,820
Otherwise, send a dollar to P.O. Box 140306

583
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,380
The subgenius is, was, and ever shall be

584
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,820
The subgenius is Kama Sutra, the id, the light, the glow, and the heart and mind of every free-thinking subgenius

585
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,080
That's right

586
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,060
And subgenius is a man

587
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:12,620
Yes

588
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,560
Well, the uber-brow is not with us

589
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,580
We have lost all form of leadership here in the studio

590
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,940
Ah, the little subgenius children, they're so cute

591
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,020
Hold one of them up so we can see it there

592
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,100
Yeah, that's better

593
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,740
Hey, no, no

594
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,520
I didn't say to lock me out of the studio, come on

595
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,940
You can't breastfeed that baby brofram

596
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,380
Ah!

597
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,420
At the first sign of violence

598
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:40,940
Hello

599
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,320
I'm totally convinced

600
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,920
I'm going to give you all my assets

601
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,220
I can't believe it

602
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,280
But it must be true

603
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,800
You're back, yeah, I know you

604
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,260
No, no, I have never even heard your program before

605
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:56,980
Are you kidding?

606
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,800
Yes, well, we've never heard it before either

607
00:34:59,420 --> 00:34:59,560
Really?

608
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,600
I don't give us any monitors

609
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,420
I'm going to

610
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,800
Ah, just wait a minute, hold it

611
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,680
Okay

612
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,400
No

613
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,720
Hold that chronon

614
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,180
Ah, here it is

615
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,880
Here, put this on the mic

616
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,720
Oh, okay, there we go

617
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,020
That's much better, thanks

618
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,040
I'm going to liquidate everything, all my assets

619
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,740
You can have them, I want to be a subgenius

620
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,800
Okay, what would you do?

621
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:19,980
You are

622
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,760
I want to be ignorant, I want to be stupid

623
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,820
Send your wallet to the church so they can let us out of here, would you?

624
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,420
Well

625
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,100
One question

626
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,240
Ask the question

627
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,140
All right, this is it

628
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:35,200
I want to know what that crazy rabbit has to do with all of it

629
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,460
Yeah, yeah, we know about it, but that's not what we're here to talk about, no dumb rabbit

630
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,620
We're here to talk about the great God Jehovah One

631
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,200
And his prophet, Bob Dobbs

632
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,860
You know, for Lyndon Johnson

633
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,460
You can't take your rabbit to subgenius heaven, but it takes extra slack

634
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,080
Huh?

635
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,920
Extra slack?

636
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,740
Yes, much extra slack

637
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,200
Extra dollars

638
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I see

639
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,800
We'll be on next week, don't worry

640
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,880
I don't know exactly what people are doing at this hour of the morning, but

641
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,040
It's time now, once again, to fly high above Berkeley and over

642
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,500
Good night, and I'm moving with you

643
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,820
All right, you understand?

644
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,000
Yes

645
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,480
Well, it's once again time to communicate with a Desmond, shall we?

646
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,500
Oh, no, can we get Berkeley from up here?

647
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,560
Sure, let's try

648
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,840
Ah, hello, Berkeley

649
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:29,440
What is the meaning of plat-pill, bar-rata, nit-pill?

650
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,540
Oh, that's, that's a

651
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,600
Wait a minute, I have that here

652
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:38,200
Those are the words that stop Gort, the robot of the day the earth stood still

653
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,780
Oh, that's okay, Bob, she's okay

654
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,860
I just checked her stanchion

655
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,260
She can take more than just the conspiracy explanation

656
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,460
Good, I want it all

657
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,300
Yeah, I can see that here

658
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,700
We can't have it all on this radio station because we already have it all

659
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,080
There's not even enough for us here

660
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,940
There's not even any lights here

661
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,680
Too much is always better

662
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,800
Listen to that Reaganomics

663
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,640
I know that, I know, you know, the answer to your question

664
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,200
The answer to your question includes slavery, human sacrifice, polygamy, morality, carnal religions, and debt-free economics

665
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,940
I mean, are you ready for all of that?

666
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
I'm ready for more

667
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
The idea that America...

668
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,560
Are you ready for the subgenital gut blowout?

669
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:13,660
No

670
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,140
Yeah, I hate that

671
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:20,600
No, that's a special right that you can apply for at the church in Dobstown

672
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,040
It's probably one of the more fun rides there

673
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,700
You do the whole thing backwards

674
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,280
I don't throw up though, do I?

675
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,200
No, no, you don't

676
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,620
No, no, no

677
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,700
That's later, that's the next ride, but you don't have to take, that one's optional

678
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,400
Good

679
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,280
That's a subgenius boat ride

680
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,200
That's a subgenius bioenergenics

681
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,980
Yeah

682
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,580
Yes

683
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,660
Too deep for us

684
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,840
That's what Bob was

685
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,080
Yes, or there's us, which is worse

686
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,300
The machines are actually a little more tender and meaningful

687
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,300
We have generic Bob Glangela sex tracks on them

688
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,960
I love those machines

689
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:04,260
Yes, friends, that was an old, old subgenius tape, back from, obviously from the Berkley Show, KPFA

690
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,540
And that must have been from like 1982 or 83?

691
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:14,380
Yes, the show was in 1983 when that show first started, because they still loved Bob out there then

692
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,500
And people were so simple and so sweet in those days

693
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,440
The old days, you know, the old days were always the best

694
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,460
Oh yes

695
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:30,080
I suspect that here will be a special place in hell for such beings

696
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,880
David the Psalmist said in Psalms 15, 1 and 3

697
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,420
Lord, who may abide in thy tabernacle, who may dwell on thy holy mountain,

698
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:45,700
the man of blameless life, who does that which is right and speaks the truth from his heart,

699
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:53,640
who has no malice on his tongue, who never wrongs a friend and tells no tale against his neighbor,

700
00:38:53,780 --> 00:39:01,460
at the judgment there will be those who with their malicious tongue have destroyed the lives and reputation of others.

701
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:08,740
These gossipers will be cast into the lowest, darkest pit of eternity

702
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,040
Call the next defendant

703
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,580
K. Bridges to the bar

704
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,200
Silence, K.

705
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:41,400
Yes, your hands are covered with the blood of the thousands of souls that you have murdered

706
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,700
Murdered? But I never murdered anyone

707
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,820
Not with a sword, but you have sentenced a thousand souls to hell with your malicious tongue

708
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,820
It would have been a thousand times better had you murdered them with a sword

709
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:00,200
Oh no, but I never said anything about anyone except what was true

710
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,440
I only said

711
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,020
You spoke the truth

712
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,040
No, K. You spoke that which you wanted to be true

713
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:12,880
But granting that you did only speak the truth, who gave you license to defame and destroy the character of others?

714
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:19,160
The serpent with his venom and his ire, with his slimy, slithery foes and his noiseless crawl,

715
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:28,400
with his deadly call and fatal fang is the only fit emblem of the man or woman who stabs and kills the character of another

716
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,040
Let your own words condemn you

717
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,440
Oh no

718
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,520
May 10th, 1973

719
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,840
Linda's been such a good friend in spiritual health

720
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,380
Well, when you've known her as long as I have, you'll really get to know her

721
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,820
What do you mean?

722
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,640
She's not as concerned about your spiritual life as you think

723
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,360
But I'm not one to say anything

724
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,680
You just call me when you need advice

725
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,120
Well, I've got a lot to do, I have to go

726
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,280
Goodbye

727
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:04,940
Goodbye

728
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,960
Oh no

729
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,160
Well, I didn't think being a Christian was going to be like that

730
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,780
I don't believe I want any part of it

731
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,060
Oh no

732
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,320
Oh my God, my God have mercy on me

733
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,940
I never realized, have mercy on me

734
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:31,100
You, K., with your gossipy tongue, have driven the babes away from my house

735
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:31,260
You have destroyed my church

736
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,720
You have in your lifetime destroyed the weak among my flock

737
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,400
You never knew what it meant to show mercy

738
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,700
Would you dare ask this court of mercy?

739
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,840
There is no mercy for you

740
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:48,780
You are sentenced to hell where you will be haunted forever by the souls you sent there

741
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,100
Oh no, I don't want to go to hell

742
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,480
You can't send me to hell for something I didn't know

743
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,500
I didn't know, I only repeated what I heard

744
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,520
You didn't know that the most fearful of all crimes...

745
00:41:59,520 --> 00:41:59,920
Oh no, I didn't know...

746
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,160
...is the crime of gossip, your record will speak for itself

747
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,680
Oh no

748
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,220
April 7, 1970

749
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:16,420
The Word of God declares the greatest abomination in the eyes of God is the tailbearer

750
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,780
Hear what the Scripture says

751
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,920
These six things doth the Lord hate, yea, seven are an abomination unto him

752
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,420
A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed...

753
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,700
Hands that shed...

754
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,480
...frop

755
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,880
Ah, friends, well that was, that's, you know it's a shame

756
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,460
That's all we have left of the judgment on tape

757
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,480
The judgment tape ended

758
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,880
And I guess if you did any sins after that tape ran out

759
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,880
The recording angels aren't going to be able to rewind it for God like they were doing on their birthday

760
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,160
And call the next witness

761
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:59,900
Reverend Ivan Stang, did you not mock my radio production of the judgment tape?

762
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,840
Oh, even though it was done by my people up in Oklahoma

763
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,140
Why...

764
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,040
...under the earth

765
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,660
Ye...

766
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,480
Like it or not...

767
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,620
Is his name in the Book of Life?

768
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,900
...your enemy must acknowledge defeat...

769
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:12,500


770
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,200
...when you speak the faith command...

771
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,240
Then cast him in...

772
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,120
...in the name of Jesus...

773
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,600
...to the lake of fire

774
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,000
...declare your freedom boldly

775
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,400
The name of Jesus is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow

776
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,880
And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father and the Son

777
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:29,880


778
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,160
Amen! Absolutely! Praise the Lord!

779
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,420
Step number three

780
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,380
Destroy it

781
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,340
Don't sell it

782
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,220
Don't give it away

783
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,600
Destroy the drugs completely as a sacrifice to God

784
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,060
This third step is very, very important

785
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:58,920
Jesus on several occasions told people to do something as an act of faith after he had healed them

786
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,360
He told the blind man near the pool of Siloam

787
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,640
Now, you only have two years till X-day

788
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,160
Don't delay

789
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,240
Order today

790
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,200
Now, if anyone has any questions

791
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,000
See you next time

792
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,000


793
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,360
He is able to carry a addchair

794
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,660
Turn yourこy

795
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,960
Turn your put

796
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,440
Turn to again

797
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,680
Naughty

798
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,740
Naughty

799
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,620
Naughty

800
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,020
Naughty

801
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,020


802
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,020


803
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,540
...

804
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:55,600
Naughty

805
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,420
Naughty

806
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,620
I don't know.

807
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:52,560
I don't know.

808
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,500
I don't know.

809
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,780
I don't know.

810
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,120
I don't know.

811
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,460
I don't know.

812
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,620
She's dead true.

813
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,580
And it will enslave you.

814
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,840
Sexual life, individual life,

815
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,820
the torture inside, the spitting of pride,

816
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,640
the narrowing of the mind.

817
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,440
And now you're halfway blind.

818
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,340
I can come and prepare for warfare.

819
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,980
Fight the lies, the lies, the lies,

820
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,520
the lies, come on, come on,

821
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,760
come on, come on, come on!

822
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,580
Don't be a puppet, fuck you!

823
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,600
John culturally

824
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,520
crystallized

825
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:20,520


826
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:20,520


827
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:20,520


828
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:22,600
regenerated

829
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:22,660
from motherhood

830
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:22,660


831
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:22,660


832
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,340
fference

833
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:27,920
civilization

834
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,400
evangelization

835
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,860
Ahimsa, dear friends, Ahimsa.

836
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:47,920
That was our friend Steve Slack with his band, which used to be called Slack Attack.

837
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:57,060
I would have played a more newer song by him from his Drool tape, but it didn't work.

838
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,140
It got all stuck up.

839
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,100
Anyway, you can write for information on Slack Attack and Steve Slack.

840
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,660
I'm sorry, that's the name.

841
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,720
Got that pencil ready?

842
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:14,960
125, that's 125 South Cherry Street.

843
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:21,460
Cherry, as in the cherry tree that George Washington chopped down.

844
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,900
And, yeah, that's 125 South Cherry Street.

845
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,760
Number two.

846
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,360
Richmond, Virginia.

847
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,200
Richmond, Virginia.

848
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,220
23220.

849
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,140
Sacred numbers hidden in there.

850
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,180
Ah, yes.

851
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:50,780
Oh, and while I'm at it, I might as well give the subgenius P.O. box number so you can find out what happened.

852
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:56,860
You know, if you have trouble finding our books in the stores or something like that, we can send you free information if you'll just write to...

853
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:04,360
Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

854
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,060
What? That's 140306?

855
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,340
That's P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

856
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,840
Dallas, Texas.

857
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,360
Oh, yeah, 75214.

858
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,600
That's right, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

859
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:25,480
Bob at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

860
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,320
We ought to have a chat.

861
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,760
We ought to hear of that with cheerleaders.

862
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:35,340
And we have those cheerleaders, but they won't let us show them on the street without their iron mask.

863
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:41,060
Supposedly, that's to protect the others.

864
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,300
That's what Janer said, anyway.

865
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:49,000
Well, friends, I want to finish this show and get back to fiddling with my computer.

866
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:57,120
Yes, I want to get away from this world, this hard, harsh task.

867
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,580
Master of a world.

868
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:06,060
And go into where it's logical and clean and smooth and anti-aliased.

869
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,160
Yes, deep back into my little box.

870
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:21,600
And at the same time, the net at large, where we have more control over our presentation.

871
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,100
Not as much as we would always like.

872
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,760
Because, you know, if we had the amount of control...

873
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,540
That we would like...

874
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,560
There would be no more slack for any...

875
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,420
Oh, wait, no, no.

876
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,880
There would be endless slack.

877
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:38,300
Yes, juicy, rolling, roiling waves of slack.

878
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,660
Washing up to your ankles and then up to your waist, as high as your waist.

879
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,120
To where you had to slosh through the slack to do any kind of work at all.

880
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,060
And finally, it would be up to your neck.

881
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,340
Yes, you'd be up to your neck in slack and you'd have to quit working entirely.

882
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:56,720
And finally, the slack would start washing down your throat.

883
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,120
And you wouldn't be able to get your head high enough to keep it out of the slack long enough to even breathe.

884
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:17,100
And pretty soon you'd have so much slack that you'd be breathing nothing but pure, unadulterated slack.

885
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:56,700
And you'd be able to get your head high enough to keep it out of the slack long enough to even breathe.

886
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,900
So can I take my gun up to heaven?

887
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,760
I'll check with St. Peter out the gate.

888
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:19,040
And if I had a woman that was faithful.

889
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,680
Or even kind to summertime.

890
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,920
I'd drag her on up to the gates of heaven.

891
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,560
Or follow her right down to the gates of hell.

892
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:49,340
So can I take my gun up to heaven?

893
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,220
You know she's all within my reach.

894
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:56,700
I'll drag her on up to the gates of heaven.

895
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,360
I'll drag her on up to the gates of heaven.

896
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,000
So can I take my gun up to heaven?

897
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,100
Consider the days of the field, how they grow.

898
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,680
They toil not, neither do they spin.

899
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:15,400
And yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

900
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:25,220
Wherefore, if God so clothed the grass of the field, which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven,

901
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:30,600
shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

902
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:35,620
Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?

903
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,320
What shall we drink?

904
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,400
Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

905
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:46,360
But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,

906
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,080
and all these things shall be added unto you.

907
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,160
Take therefore no thought for the moral flesh,

908
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,340
for the moral shall take thought for the things of itself.

909
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,440
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

910
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,720
Stay there until you fall asleep.

911
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,500
When you fall asleep, that means we're off the air.

912
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,420
When you quit listening to us, we'll no longer be there.

913
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,460
You have to make the primordial matter of nature stand up and salute.

914
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,840
You think this was our idea?

915
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,180
I just don't know what to say. How can we ever thank you?

916
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:30,880
Oh, they were broken up. See, they'll get together, and that's why they'll cease to exist in April.

917
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,940
Ah, okay. We're talking about literally cease to exist.

918
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,020
Yeah, we're talking about flame out, you know?

919
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,400
Ionization of most of the molecules involved.

920
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,320
No dirty vreedies.

921
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,420
Ball of fire in the studio.

922
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,320
So did I win the figurine or what?

923
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:43,920
Yes.

924
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,700
You're going to get a figurine that lights up, revolves, and dispenses free chowder.

925
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:52,340
Our miniature craftsmen have designed, cast, struck, etched, forged, and finished these authentic replications

926
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,820
not available in any store, even on the market.

927
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,200
They're all on this radio station before their commission, literally without regard for any quality.

928
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,900
They come with their own adoption papers, and you can bring them into their own home.

929
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,700
You're just kind of crazy.

930
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:04,640
Ah, but now by special arrangement from the Postmaster General of Guam,

931
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,680
this 72-piece commemorative plant honoring you and the footprints of the great jewel thieves

932
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,640
of the French Riviera mentioned earlier, each encased in its own watery silk caddy

933
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,900
that revolves 360 degrees on genuine Swedish ball bearings, has been canceled. Sorry.

934
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,660
Yes, indeed.

935
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,400
Oh, there it goes. Oh, it hurts, but we can carry it, caller. Okay, hold on.

936
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,060
All right. All right.

937
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:29,760
The resulting confusion of all seismic signals will cause the simultaneous detonation of American warheads...

938
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,320
Do you have a quick call for the Court of Miracles?

939
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,500
Hey, Doug. Hey, Doug.

940
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,280
Let's come on in here. I've got three microphones in my own show.

941
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,560
We don't even have to listen to Bob Nelson. No problem.

942
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,740
So, what are you guys going to do at this revival meeting?

943
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,500
You're going to make fun of religion stuff, right?

944
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,960
We never make fun of religion.

945
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,140
Never make fun. Make money.

946
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:49,820
You must understand we're making money off religion, but not fun off religion.

947
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,100
No. No. No fun. No fun.

948
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,460
We hope to erase the slack area in this part of the country.

949
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:58,200
We are missionaries. This is hard work. It's brutal and gruesome work.

950
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:58,920
And hopefully...

951
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,860
I assume the position lies.

952
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:00,320
Yes, sir.

953
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,100
These are called cribbage crotch figurines, and they're wanted in every home across America.

954
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,620
Cribbage crotch figurines?

955
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,300
That's right, young man, and you've won one.

956
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,540
Oh, when do I get it?

957
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,440
Well, as soon as you sign out the, uh, the jewel form for the lettuce leaf kids.

958
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,200
At Jewel Co.

959
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,520
At where?

960
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:14,800
Who?

961
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:15,800
Bobby.

962
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,340
We have to put up with these guys because they know the right people.

963
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,120
Bobby.

964
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:20,680
Bobby.

965
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,240
But you can trust me, Ivan Stang.

966
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,920
Yes, you can trust me.

967
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,840
I'm Dr. Ivan Stang.

968
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,400
Yes, well, you see, we have to attack these songs with the full vim and vigor of all of those who are with us all the time.

969
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:37,260
There is some truth to the fact that the major hierarchy will be in one room at one time.

970
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,900
So you can believe in me. I'm Ivan Stang. I never lie and I'm always right.

971
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:45,240
It extends throughout the rules and has to do with doing your oblivion.

972
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,100
It has to do with glass madness.

973
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,460
And see the guy?

974
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,840
No, no, no.

975
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,300
It has to do with Gilligan's Island.

976
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,840
It has to do with the triple AR bar.

977
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,300
It has to do with the Tim and the Luck plane.

978
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:03,100
So Doug Wilman passes over to the main forward desk at the time control theater.

979
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,420
And gets his own church out.

980
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,080
Stop it, Bobby! Stop it!

981
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,140
And that's right. Just let the disinfectant roll over you.

982
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,940
It's going to clean out all those other viruses.

983
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:19,820
It will replace your previous viruses with a new one.

984
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:25,460
A special new telepathic brain eater type virus.

985
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:31,960
And actually, what it does is it creates tool pick hallucinations.

986
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:36,180
In other words, if you concentrate closely enough.

987
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,000
Focus.

988
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,760
Focus on the music.

989
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:39,720
Focus.

990
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,820
That Chaz is playing there.

991
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,120
Bring it, get it here.

992
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,460
Focus on the music.

993
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,360
Now, Chaz.

994
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,560
Focus on that.

995
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,720
Let the wet wear of your very size.

996
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,600
Your finances be rewritten.

997
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,320
Just follow the bouncing ball.

998
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,220
The bouncing pipe.

999
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,780
And concentrate. Concentrate, friends.

1000
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,180
Alright, now reboot the deity.

1001
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,480
We...

1002
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,120
He just lit up. The deity just lit up.

1003
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,380
He's rebooted.

1004
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,220
Okay.

1005
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:19,140
Now, what was it we were going to talk about?

1006
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,640
We were reconard.

1007
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:25,700
We created a new form of a combination of a new form of a recombinant DNA you had developed.

1008
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,540
And also a stally, a polyphone which you had developed.

1009
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:32,820
And we are going to go deep, deep, deep, deep into the oracle.

1010
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,880
Deep into the oracle.

1011
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,900
Just sink into the foam.

1012
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,060
Just sink into the foam.

1013
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,700
Ah, you're floating in a sea of pills, friends.

1014
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,340
You're just too blind, deaf, and dumb to taste them and see them and hear them.
