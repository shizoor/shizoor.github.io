The Hour of Slack!
The Hour of Slack!
The Hour of Slack!
This is Operation Experiment, a secret base far north of the Arctic Circle.
Experiment was the code...
...code name for this top priority scientific expedition.
These men arrived here on X-Day minus 60.
It has taken them the full two months to get ready.
Today is X-Day.
It is now H-Hour minus 59 minutes.
There is less than an hour left.
You guys ready for a song?
Yeah!
All right.
Give it up for Alan.
It's the Last of Us.
As an intellectual, it is my duty to perform.
There is a responsibility to which I must enforce.

All the people of the world wake up, you're asleep
European land is slaughtered like mindless sheep
Aliens did 9-11, FEMA is taking our guns
There's no go inside the pyramid, the earth does not read
All around the sun
Yes sir
A flag attack, yes sir
A flag attack, yes sir
A flag attack, yes sir
A flag attack
Ha ha ha
Cause you see, the police are really lizards
The moon is owned by Jews
The Freemasons will run Monsanto
And there's fluoride in our booze
We got chemtrails in
We got chemtrails in

We got GPS in our shoes
But trust me cause you know I care
And what have you got to lose?
Yes sir
Yes sir
A flag attack, yes sir
A flag attack, yes sir
A flag attack, yes sir
A flag attack
Yeah sir
I know it's said that it couldn't decide

We're learning about history
We didn't learn at all
It's what we do





Thats right

don't take my children away from me
well dear friends that was dr argus fox and the right angles
from a cd and uh
and doctor hall is here
hello
Start İ사랑
there's no point and needs just stating the obvious
what
friends are holding single thing that's that
all of their words changes and escort fashion
those somber really disturbing revelations the
that were revealed during the course of actually,
we're going to play a recording of the event shortly.
But first, since we have Dr. Howell in the studio,
and since he has at least three new songs that we haven't heard,
which, by the way, we will also be following up this show
with Dr. Sinister's show for the next three hours.
But, so what is this new one that you guys have?
Well, it's a traditional tune called I Am a Subgenius.
I can't wait.
G-E-R Bob Dobbs
I am your man who calls your name
G-E-R Bob Dobbs
And through this world I'm bound to ramble
To spread your word and slackful fame
To spread your word and slackful fame
I am a subgenius
Of yeti stock and ancient blood
I seek for slack where I can find it
Through storm and calm
And fire and flood
He seeks through storm
And fire and flood
You must hear his story
And let his words and work be known
Don't let the conspiracy prevent you
From finding slack that's all your own
Go find the slack
That's all your own
Go find the slack
That's all your own
Go find the slack

Go find the slack

Wow.
Was that song in Oh Brother Where Art Thou?
No, not in the version that most people see.
That was wonderful.
It is similar to The Man of Constant Sorrow,
but it's not the same tune,
but it is in the same voice, certainly.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Well, I'm glad to get a nice clean recording of that.
Thank you.
We should have a couple more songs coming up.
I do have to play this revelation tape, as it were.
It was, what night was it?
Tuesday night?
No, Wednesday.
No, Sunday night at X Day.
An event occurred.
Yes, Sunday night at X Day,
and the professional film crew was there.
To shoot it, I don't have their footage.
And there are, well, there's this artifact
that you just have to see a picture of.
We'll try to describe it when the time comes.
Oh, it looks like that might be Lonesome Cowboy Dave, is it?
It is. I'm aboard.
Oh, good. Okay.
Well, friends.
Well, I'm not a piece of wood, but I mean, I'm part of the, yeah.
We're all together waiting.
And we're waiting once again to depict your glandular dysfunction, right?
Yeah.
Well, unavoidably, yeah, not going out of our way to do so.
What I'm going to do is play this recording.
It goes for 23 minutes.
Moves pretty fast, actually.
I may fade in at a couple of points to explain,
give a blow-by-blow description.
And I'm going to fade all of our microphones,
all of our microphones out for the most part
so that we, like the listeners, can only hear but not speak
during this possibly very troubling moment.
Well, we have to accept it.
Okay, I'm going to bring Dave down.
I'm going to bring you guys down.
You're going to bring me down, Daddy Owen.
And here, we'll see what happens.
On January 1st, 2016,
the Subgenius Foundation received an envelope in the mail,
an overdue bill for a storage locker in Washington State.
By coincidence, I happen to live in Washington State,
having moved there recently,
and Reverend Stang sent me the address of the storage locker,
and it was registered to, you know,
it was registered to J.R. Bob Dobbs.
There were certain items that were in the storage locker that were retrieved.
I'm a little freaked out by what's about to happen here,
and it takes a lot to freak me out, but...
You freaked the out of me.
Let me tell you, just, would he explain to me what they found in that storage locker?
The first thing I found was a plan,
a blueprint, a diagram.
It was of vital, valuable importance to the church.
Here it is.
And it has the blueprint for a radio for contacting the exists.
As I attempted to follow these instructions in this blueprint,
I, uh, I just got more and more disturbed at some of the things that I had to do.
And I found out some information that was sort of disturbing.
On July 5th, 1998, everybody assumes nothing happened.
But in fact, something did happen.
What?
The saucers.
The saucer did arrive.
They sent one saucer from the subgeniuses.
People have joked about this before.
And, uh, it was real funny when it was a joke.
You kind of hinted at the idea that perhaps the exists just sent a very tiny flying saucer and nobody saw it.
Ha ha ha ha.
As it turns out, that was the truth.
But only one person was affected on X-Day.
The exists, having arrived in their tiny little saucer,
realized that there was no way they were going to make it back to Planet X.
And there certainly was no way they were going to be able to take their payload.
And without the subgenius souls to power the ship, there's no way it could make it back.
The saucer...
There's no really delicate way of putting this.
The saucer flew up into the reproductive organs of a female subgenius that we're not going to name.
The saucer chose this particular female subgenius because she had the most concentrated Dobbs DNA in her bloodstream.
Ha ha ha.
She just had a higher level than anybody else there.
And so the saucer began to harvest that Dobbs DNA
and attempted to meld it with alien technology
to create a storage device, as it were,
to store access codes to contact the exists.
Now...
You're probably asking, how does he know all this?
How do you know all this?
Well...
Dr. Le Guim, at this point, produces a beat up old box.
It all sounds very scientific, but it was messy.
It looks like something from the 50s.
You know, they say that any sufficiently advanced technology will appear to be magic to people who don't understand it.
Well, that's us.
Ha ha ha.
The female subgenius who was afflicted by this died from it.
Before the Dobbs clone alien technology storage device baby could be completely formed.
They could find nothing in the autopsy.
Nothing showed up on the x-rays.
So they buried her.
And...
The saucer, as long as it had power, continued to attempt to build this device.
A hybrid.
This hybrid.
A living machine.
How we got to know this?
I dug her up.
You fiend.
That was another thing we used to joke about.
There were two items that I extricated from her corpse.
One of them is the actual X-est flying saucer itself.
Now depowered from having been stuck in the ground for so long.
It still smells pretty bad.
The other...
Legume slowly opens the box to reveal the...
The...
The...
The...

The...
The...

Rotting machine baby thing.
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
There are pictures on the members-only.
The actual Dobbs robot fetus clone.
Depowered!
Also extracted from the corpse of that dead subgenius.
It's too much!
I can't look!
Jesus.
Oh, God.
Oh.
Oh.
It's got to be...
Oh, God.





You can hear me vomiting in the background at this point.
You can't imagine how ugly this thing was.
It's that toilet paper.
I didn't sign up for this.
This is going to require a little bit of rocket Scientology here.
There were certain items that were very hard to procure.
In order to use this device, Reverend Stang has to wear these protective goggles that
belong to Jim Jones.
I would wear them if I were willing to...
If I were interested in keeping my sight, just in case.
I have no idea what's going to happen when we activate this.
I don't know if this thing's going to come to life and start talking.
Don't do it.
I...
Don't do it.
I'm...
Well, now, friends, remember...
I'm really reluctant to do this.
I'm really reluctant to do this.
Let's brush up on your prescriptions, okay?
Your church history.
Look at this altar.
If you recall correctly...
That's right.
When J.R. Bob Dobbs, in the year of 1953, underwent his divine immaculation at the fist
of Jehovah One, the eminent space god, he happened, by chance, to have been tinkering
with a build-it-yourself early television kit.
He was always, you know, had to be ahead of the wave.
Always buying the latest gizmos and stuff.
And he was in his basement working on this thing.
Stepped in a puddle.
Some sort of circuit got completed.
He fell down and...
But...
And, in fact, this is little known.
Connie, for the first time, was unable to remove the pipe from Dobbs' mouth when that
happened.
After that...
That was when Dobbs received his first immaculation.
The vision of July 5th, 1998.
Oh, my God.
7 a.m.
The details about the end of the world when he scrawled all this stuff on a napkin.
Little known is the fact that Bob had a second immaculation.
But this is also described in Book of the Subgenius.
Following a hernia operation, something about the painkillers or the medicine they gave
him caused him to have yet another vision that was somewhat more detailed and complete
and involved...
Is the material you read?

No!
No!
No!

Now...
I'm no Bob.
But Bob's not here.
Bob was working towards, obviously, from...
We can tell from these detailed notes here that he was working towards a third immaculation.
Now, we have the choice of just putting this thing in a museum and guessing what it was
for.
Or thinking, oh, if only Bob were here...
Well, isn't that kind of like saying, oh, if only the X's were here, they could give
us a whole new life or everything.
Well, the X's haven't showed up for 20 years and some of us made a whole new life anyway.
We did build our own ship, some of us, and we at least cleaned up the one we were on
a little bit.
So, but, are we gonna just sit and wait?
Well, I don't blame you or Dr. Legume for not wanting to get up here and do this.

We do what Bob was obviously planning to do, which is activate this machine, whatever
the hell it is.
We don't know if it's a telephone, a television, a radio, some kind of weird 50's alien internet,
or if it's supernatural, or it's the spiritual possession or some such.
We don't know, but I'm willing to try!
And the reason I'm willing is because I have already achieved SLAP.
Yes, I have.
I'm a SLACK-FUL SON OF A BITCH.
After decades of anti-SLACK, my study of Bob's word has caused me to believe that I'm feeling
lucky.
That's all there is to it.
I'm feeling lucky.
And if Bob takes me home tonight, well, then I had a great rhyme.
If I enter a tunnel of light and see my loved ones, you won't hear me complain.
And if I'm just dead, you won't hear me complain.
But what if, what if we're able to complete some sort of ancient circuit, some bizarre
Lovecraftian-Dobbsian hybrid interface that could possibly reveal what it is we're missing?
July 5th, according to our calendar, our pathetic calendars of some year, is a couple of days
from now.
I can tell you what.
I don't want to go through the same thing.
I don't want to go through the same thing we have, and I'm willing to try a change.
I'm willing to take a risk.
Because I'm tired, frankly, I'm tired of getting up at 6 in the morning one day a year.
It is a lot to ask from Bob.
It's a lot to ask from me.
It's true.
Now, one of the things, as you said, we are missing some things.
One of the things we're missing is, I think, page three of these blueprints.
But we're going to try to...
I've never...
I don't know what's going to happen.

It's just...
What is it?
How does it refer to this wand antenna thing?
What is it called?
The quantum antenna.
Where do you stick it?
Where do you put it?
That's real funny.
Actually...
It's located to its third...
Well, it's an antenna.
There's a little...
Yeah, there's a little note that's showing a crotch.
There's a little note on the crotch that says, no.
Right.
So it doesn't...
It's not what you think.
No.
It's obviously not that.
So don't even suggest it.
I'm feeling triggered.
This is the time of light.
I believe it's the time of light.



I believe it's some kind of a broadcast machine that converts time into light or light into
time.
I have no idea how this works.
Every time I move the light here, it converts it into a weird sound feedback.
And I'm a little worried about step four.
It just says magic .
I'm up for it.
I'm up for any program to quote the great Coochie Cootie.
And according to this, 75980...
What?

0700 is actually some kind of phone number.
And not an actual prophecy date.
I guess let's see if we can...
A phone number.
Yeah, phone numbers are shorter now.
Let's see if we can fire this up.
I don't know about the three red candles.
I think it's covered under step four, magic .
Always need candles and jumper cables when performing forbidden signs.
I don't know.

I'll go get a new one.

And friends, speaking of forbidden signs, I keep wanting to talk into this thing.
Maybe that's what it is.
Anyway...
This year, all science is forbidden.
They're outlawing all science.
So that means if you're any kind of a scientist, you're doing forbidden signs.
Praise Bob.
Welcome to the church of the subgenius, Mr. Egghead Smartypants.
This is nerve wracking.
Don't have to do it.










We don't have to do this.
But we're going to.
All right.
Okay.
Let me see if I can center myself.
You don't get used to it.
Or spread my...
Whatever.
All right.
Now...
I can't unsee this.
Do you have the protective goggles?
Yes.
I have the goggles.
All right.
Now, the instructions...
So what are we doing again here?
You have to point the quantum antenna toward the sky.
All right.
I understand.
Wait.
I'm supposed to sit here?







I'm supposed to speak into the box?
Yes.
All right.
Any time you're ready to start sending the X's a message, we're powered up.
Go.
In the name of J.R.
Bob Dobbs, I mentally and verbally beseech you.
Reveal yourselves.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
What's happened?
What's happening?
Stop biting his tongue.
Put the...
I was on the ground and then died.
All right.
See you okay?
What's going on?
I'm sorry.

He's not breathing.
That's where I was cussing.
Reverend Pang.
ocquést wrap
What!
It's not light.
It's the...
I'm sorry.
My bad.
Oh, hold on.
You'll take your time.
Let me close this thing for real.
I've got to do this one quickly.

You remember.
We'll do it.
It wasn't, it wasn't.
It's right.
It's a phone number.
It's a phone number.
The 1998 is a phone number.
What?
July 5th.
Seven, five.
There it is.
He didn't mean the seven and the five.
But the reverse.
It's five, seven.
What?
It's five, seven.
That's me.
I don't know what.
May.
May 7th.
And it's not.
What?
It's not 7 a.m.
It's 7 p.m.
Yeah.
7 p.m.
What?
May 7th.
That's crazy.
That's crazy.
Come on.
The year.
What year?
Dammit, you brought me back to life before I could find out when we all died.
What year?
I don't know when the year was.
Jesus.
What was the year?
This is not happening.
The little icon in the corner, the one that we couldn't decipher.
It's a no smoking sign.
What?
It is.
You blew it.
It is.
It's a pipe with a.
Well, it's kind of messy.
No, it can't.
That can't be it.
Wait a minute.
This is ridiculous.
I know.
I know it sounds contrived, but I.
I can't.
I can't.
I just can't.
I can't.
This is not adding up.
I can't unsee this.
I can't unthink this.
Five.
Seven.
Not seven.
Five.
That was the main message.
I wasn't getting it in numbers.
I was getting it in.
I want to say images, but it was more like sound feeling colors.
But it was clear.
It was clear.
Not 7 a.m.
7 p.m.
It was a P.
It was important.
Not the a.
The P.
The P was important.
The P.
The P.
May.
You.
That's it.
The world ends tomorrow.
You may die.
Why didn't they capitalize the May?
May.
Seven.
Five.
Seven.
Not seven.
Five.
July.
July.
Gobs.
Did you die gobs?
Yes.
It's.
It's possible.
He leaves us guessing again.
Damn him.
damn him again.
We're left to kiss and hope.
And dare.
I say, pray.
I had to dig through a cord finger.
Oh, Jesus.
This changes everything changes, everything KarenaNothing.
This means you really came.
And stay up late the day before X day, because it's at 7pm.
He can stay up all night partying.
But we missed it.
Unless it's, well, no, it never said what year.
Damn him!
Damn you dogs!
Damn you to hell!
Look away.
That's just what he wants.
That's exactly what he wants.
He's got us trapped.
We're boxed in.
What else can we do?
We have to believe.
Do we really have a choice?
As with all religions.
Rowling.
The one other message that came, that seemed to come through,
again, not like words, not like even a burning bush,
it's just a knowledge, a feeling, a surety,
of the one true law.
F*** them if they can't take a joke!
That is what rings true through the whole vision.
And by the way, it's very clear that it was not meant sexually,
but as a sort of a blow them off, forget them kind of thing.
But still, that's, I guess, the one saving grace,
the one grace we have.
The one...
Amazing.
...final excuse.
In the midst of this muddy mystery, this blurring of reality.
You know, this could be like a schism in the church.
It could lead to a complete disruption.
There's going to be the Julyists and the May-diasts, or whatever.
Something like that.
They're all going to hate each other.
They're all going to hate each other.
They're all going to hate each other.

And they're all going to hate me the most,
because that's always how it works, isn't it?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, see.
Bob's got rounds.
Let's throw rocks at Reverend Stang.
Oh, Bob's got rounds.
Let's just...
Boy, Philo was so smart not to show up this time.
He seems to know.
Well, he knows when...
He's like the dog.
Friends, I just don't know what to say.
I don't know how to feel.
I quit trying to foretell the future in 1998 conspiracy here.
But I don't give up.
I shan't give up.
I retain my faith in something in Bob, whether he will deliver us good or evil or slack or
anti-slack.
In the end, I'm going to be a slave.





But that, I think, is a fact, that we can only wait and see.
Maintain our faith.
And the important thing, I guess, I guess the main lesson once...
God, I end up getting a little tired of saying this, friends.
Because I say it every year.
But think about it.
The only thing any of us really has to do is stay alive until next day.
No matter how bad things get, there is that one hope dangled in front of us.
And that hope is to keep on going.



And now it's dangling from two, shall we call them, nutsacks of Bob, two questions.
Shall it be July? Shall it be May?
Is this year 1998? Will the year after be 1998?
I leave it to you, my friends.
You must find the answers in your own hearts.
Because Bob is not the answer.
But neither is anything else.
Question authority.
Why?
Because you bet.
What have you done to me?
I wish I didn't know.
So where do we go for our refunds?
What's the weather like in Maine?
Was that someone who couldn't take a joke we just heard?
Because I think I know what to do next.
Yes, friends.
That was it.
Dave, are you still there?
I'm still there.
I was totally and completely evacuated.
I felt power ripped.
I could sense your unusualness in every step of your breath.
It was just an incredible performance.
And it's scary enough to make me think that perhaps you were demaculated right there on stage as you were trying to do something else.
Well, he received many megafolts of enlightenment.
There, right?
Right on the stage.
You could see his hair lift and the blue sparks around him.
It was alarming.
I was terrified.
I thought he had had another heart attack.
I did.
I did have another heart attack.
I was dead for a little while.
For very, just a few seconds.
I know I was.
That's when the...
I'm not sure if it was that or when that loud noise went off.
It was the loud noise because in that slight...
In that slant between the beats of your heart, in that arrhythmia between the pockets of success and failure that you translate as slack as long as your heart beats.
It's a very simple story they teach us in business college.
And I'm really certainly happy that you learned how under such negative circumstances.
I mean, you didn't really have to do that to yourself.
Well, that electric fan was kind of loud.
The funny thing is, you know...
That noise.
But see, there's another layer of mystery.
There was a much more specific but equally maddening part that was buried in that loud hum that happened when they gave him through the switch.
And it wasn't 24 hours before a Reverend Sinfaltimus Ex Mortis, who works as a computer whiz kid.
That noise.
Had developed an algorithm that he was able to use to extract a message from that burst of noise.
And it's a real spooky message.
But I kind of feel like maybe I'll wait and close the show with that because...
Well, don't forget.
It's just such a...
Don't let the time run over and forget because it's vitally important that all subgeniuses...
here this evidence for themselves.
Right. It must be
for posterity's sake.
Everything must be maintained
and intact, even if it's
really kind of stupid sometimes.
I think it's broken.
Let them be the judges.
As Bob said, the stupider
it looks, the more important it probably
is.
Yep. Which makes
most of us subgeniuses fairly
important. Yeah, it's nice the way
it works.
Yeah, and if there are
certain proclaimers of religion
called Jesuits, why can't we be
the offbeat colors of the half-witch?
But why is Bob
doing this to us? Why
is he parceling out these
hints and clues?
Could it be that he's impatient with our
long failure to
understand the facts?
Could it be that
Bob has waited for the last three hours
at the parking lot of the bowling alley?
Well,
when you hear
this
computer voice
message that
Sinfaltimus
decoded out of that noise,
it only
makes things
worse. You'll see what
I mean. After this
happened, a lot of people
assumed, oh, well, they're
going to change the dates of X-Day
and they'll probably start doing it in
Texas. No,
we don't know that much.
Call it Tex-Day. Well, there was a
Tex-Day. It was
poorly attended. It was in a
much
inferior facility
to Wisteria's, and
I don't think
it's available anymore. I think it was
wiped off the face of the earth after
the under
attendance. Actually,
this X-Day was probably one of
the smallest
attendance numbers
we've had.
And yet,
it was perhaps the
most slackful.
Well, you see, only the elect are to be saved
in any case, so it's symbolically
appropriate that only a few
seeds of the future
subgenius universe were
physically present
this time. It's like the
shreds of the Daironis
or what do you want to call them, the druids, when their
testicles shrink and everything? Everything
is imploding back to a central focus
and that makes it more powerful.
Just like the god or dam wrong of the
Feast of 19, or 1623,
I don't know if that was Gus Davis
or whatever his name was, or
Martin Luther, yeah.
And it's very similar, just as you said,
there would probably be Mace Embers and there'd be
Decembers that want to shoot them.
Well, one thing
that we know from this X-Day,
the audience elimination
experiment is proceeding
handsomely.
There's almost no
one in the audience.
Everyone
is on the stage.
That's right. It's like Burning
Man. Everybody's
a participant. No spectators.
Everybody get up
there on the stage and do your
thing. And everybody is a
star. There are a lot of titers
as well as spectators, and most of them have
specs. Yes, that's true.
Put that polyethylene to go right where it belongs.
Yeah, that's where to put it.
This will,
although it was the
most sparsely attended X-Day,
it will probably be the most
widely seen one because
the subgenius movie
crew was there. That's right.
And this time, it's not one of those
amateur movie crews. No, subgenius
has really gone Hollywood now.
Oh, big time. Big time.
I can't wait to see the special effects
where they fill in the
crowds. I thought those
PR butts were so beautiful. I mean,
if I didn't know you, I'd want
to kiss it right now.
Man, this is really going to sell
Stang and his stupid idea.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob. This is really
going to kick off the bells
in Hollywood where they belong for so
many years. I mean, just think of Charlie and the
Angels and Otis Kurtz.
You know, all those,
you know. Well, it's funny.
Something that occurred to me just
yesterday was that
okay,
we're now looking at two
possible dates.
July 5th.
But it seems like
someone's trying to discount
that. Then there's the
May 7th thing.
It occurred to me, why not both?
Couldn't, could
one of the
drills or whatever,
the saucer of waitings,
take place
indoors? Don't you
know that we'd get ten times
as many of the
city-fied, sissified,
softies that would
never, and poor people, who could
never make it to the
extremely remote obstacle course
that we put people through
for most X days.
Yeah, and they could just be voyeurs and don't
have to worry about being voyeuristic
and stuff like that. They don't have to
march around sky-clad or anything. They just
get the old screen going
and a hypothetical.
But are you saying we'll have
two X days? No, not
necessarily, but we have that option.
We have the option of having,
you know how many people have begged,
have said, well, if it wasn't at a campground
in the middle of summer, if it was at a comic book
con where I could sit around and drink
all day in air conditioning because
I'm so morbidly obese, I'd much
prefer that. I'd go to every one of those.
And we could have subgenius cosplay.
Oh, yeah. In other words,
the bobbies could have their X
day and the hardy,
true, true
subgeniuses, the
masochistic ones,
like ourselves, we could
continue to sweat in the
summer heat. It's easy for
me to say because actually, Princess
Wee and Dr. Howell and I
and Wee Ma Ma and Dammit
spend all of the X day profits
staying in an air-conditioned bed
and breakfast. But
I'm still...
I'm not going to be idiotic right now.
The amount of waves going into your brain,
the central focus here, just would have
made you imbecilic by now. You'd be
babbling and doodling.
Over the place. You know how I fend that off?
I do all the physical
labor myself. I do all the
packing, the unpacking,
the engineering.
I, at one point, was
running two video cameras
and performing,
and a recorder, all at the same time.
That's
what, that's why
even though I stay in the
B&B, I'm still tougher than the rest of them
punks. But
let's not get lost in
a dogma. Perhaps it's
time to play that other
recording
from less than 24
hours later. As I said, Reverend
St. Faltimus X. Mortis
of the Poconos
Fortress
Clench
had decrypted
that buzz into this
bizarre message. Now,
interestingly,
he was showing me
this on the main stage.
Late at night.
That wasn't the only thing happening on the
main stage. There happened to
have been
lovely young
ladies, townies,
or wisterians who
work at the place.
Bombed out of their mind.
And caterwauling
in the background.
They were expressing themselves freely.
Some people, some
geniuses hated that
because it seemed so much like
kind of a takeoff on
corny millennials. Others
of us were just so happy to see
suntanned,
barely dressed young
bodies populated the X-Day
stage. And then
Reverend Fox
wandered on stage
and stood there.
Was she?
Reverend Fox. No, Reverend Fox
is the
confusingly spelled name of
a male doctor.
Yes.
He was seized in a trance
that night. And in fact,
even though we had just burned
a Bob Icon that
Fox himself had built for burning,
he was seized
up in the spirit. And not only
did he stare balefully
at that young crooning beatnik
girl for about half an hour,
as if shooting laser beams through her,
he went and grabbed
the 25-year-old Bob
dummy that we'd been hauling around
for all these years.
Took it upon himself
to drag it by the
hangman's noose that's always on its neck
over to the fire,
carefully remove its
jacket, which we still
have. And it had
the little pipe in the pocket.
And then he held it over
his head and tossed it upon the
fire where it landed in a very dramatic
pose. I'll see.
I'd probably be
angry at Reverend Fox for
doing this, but for the fact that
Dr. Onan can't abide
a deftly videotape
the whole thing, which is all we wanted
out of the death of that dummy anyway.
Praise Onan.
So it was a strange...
...for so many years now.
I hate to just see it at the Bibles
or something like that, and when nobody's looking
at it, punch the damn thing right in the face.
It happened all the time.
Oh, the thing, it was ravaged.
But I once found
it covered with condom.
But we had planned
to possibly burn the thing
the next night. We just expected
to have more cameras. Anyway,
that was one of the mysteries.
Only
that's a mystery that's over with. It's solved.
We don't have to worry about that Bob dummy anymore.
We'll make a different, more
realistic robot.
But shall I play?
The spectacle seems
rather eccentric to me.
Especially the part where you fall
down on your hands and knees and you
just angel Gabriel
or March, March, um,
you know, the Archangel Gabriel
is, you know, what you should do
and he tells you to read and write.
And while you're slathering like a peacenik,
the whole rest of the world falls
apart. And there's like Bob Dob
looking like Hitler standing like,
I'm talking into your
subconscious right now.
You know, something like that. And then you get
real scared and fall asleep again.
Yeah, I almost
did. So,
we will go now
to that strange recording.
Now again, you get to hear
the crooning
young, lovely hipster
girl in the background.
But pay her no
never mind. It makes an interesting
contrast with the computer voice.
Extraordinary message.
All of this has been shortened.
Space. This has all been
shortened a great deal.
You can hear the uncut versions
of both of these with all the cussing.
And a lot more stuff.
On both of
the
members only places that you would
think of. Sorry, members only.
Right. And, uh,
but you non-believers
are lucky to be able to hear any
of this. Okay, so I'm gonna
pull out the John Carpenter music. I'm gonna
play this
shortened
version of this thing.
It's four minutes long.
By the Archangel
Carmichael.
Carmichael.
Carmichael.
Tell me again how you
arrived at this?
How did you crack the code?
I had to go back to the
1980s technology
to decipher a message from the
1990s in the year 2017.
And this was the message.
That part makes sense.
The message. I don't understand
the message, though.

affectionately broken ile análise mon currently baseless as 앉o usable as a haberdasher feed corroASH 움직 Isso é que da vez que vião até 재�】 .á caros sofres ab sigilo, now subgenius is i'm not such a busy power address you know this one so what do we do we're once now subgeniuses i know you're not playing for a role in rock music bisouacicação para en te mudar.
Where do we go from here?
Make it up is what I say because it seems to me like you've made an omelet out of four different eggs.
You've got your old school.
You've got your new school.
You've got your, you know, revelation of the last revelation.
And then you've got this final and ultimate revelation.
If I were you, I'd feel like the prophet Mohammed or Jesus or somebody important right now.
You've got like a whole doctrine of work behind you now.
Yeah, but the question is how do we deal with the faithful with this new and definitely unwelcome information?
What do we say to the heaving masses of disaffected subgeniuses?
Now, of course, a lot of people have been advising me to just keep it quiet.
Sit on it.
Bottle it up.
Pretend it didn't happen.
Make it an unhappening.
But I just, it seems to me like we should just, transparency.
That's what we need.
Let all of the subgeniuses.
Look at all of the evidence.
Only maybe one of us will come up with something that makes sense from it all.
Not that we're famous for that.
Here's how I see it.
This is the way you want to brand yourself.
You want to get out and do like it's a press conference right after an important loss or victory, whichever way you want to play it.
And you just candidate for the mayor of Cleveland, perhaps.
Or Cleveland.
Any of those airwaves at Cleveland Road or someplace like that.
And you just come out and you do some hand gestures and everybody's cheering and stuff and you're smiling.
Hand gestures?
Yeah.
You know, like screw off and bumpkin and some of the other ones they do nowadays and stuff like some of them have five different parts.
That can get you killed.
Oh, of course.
That's the meaning of it all to begin with.
It's like it's a murder weapon.
But he can pretend like it's not.
It's something to save a little children or something like that.
And he can have.
have a graph behind him and bullet point things and stuff.
But mainly, you know, he comes out and storms out onto the stage
and he's smiling just like he's getting ready to get one of those
steak and beans type of, you know, campaign things.
Well, friends, we'll have pictures.
There are pictures in those members-only places like the 20X Day page.
Now, I guess we could call it the 22nd X Day drill.
And, of course, subgenius.com will eventually have the complete documentation.
My YouTube channel, RevStang, will probably have the visuals of the device,
the thing that Legume exhumed.
You said it looked like it came from the 1950s.
Well, the box that he had it in looked old.
And the doodads attached to the baby robot circuit thing that smelled dead,
that stuff was all antique.
It was all tube technology.
Anyway, friends, we have to move on.
We're approaching the end of this groundbreaking hour of Slack.
Again, I can only...



suggest that each subgenius study and try to draw its own conclusions.
I'm gonna close with a piece of music here.
Prior to Dr. Sinister's show for which we shall hang around.
Dave, you should probably hang up and then call back in in about 15 minutes.
Friends, I'm gonna play an instrumental by the Rudy Schwartz Project.
You know, you've never heard of them.
I'm gonna play a little bit of them on this show.
I love the title of this song.
Vengeance of First.
Thank you, Dr. Hell.
Thank you, Princess Wee.
The name of this song is Vengeance Thy Name is Shemp.
