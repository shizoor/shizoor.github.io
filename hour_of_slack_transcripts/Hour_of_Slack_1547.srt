1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
That thing was created to live in a poisoned world.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,900
The rain came and it was pure.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,880
Man created it, but God destroyed it.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,720
He brought the rain and fresh air.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,580
If he couldn't live, then neither could the others of his kind.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,220
There was a voice on the radio while you were gone.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,900
There are others out there.

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,460
We got a little behind, although some would call it big.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:41,460
So this Hour of Slack number 1,547 is actually a rerun of Hour of Slack number 825,

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,900
which had the title Good All-Around Show from the year of 2002.

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,880
It's got some great bits from the late Chaz Smith's ESO radio on WCN.

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,180
And from our old tape album, Media Barrage 5,

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,820
plus ranting and collages that were current back then,

14
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,820
and yet still hold true today.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,580
So now, let us return to 2002.

16
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,420
Our advanced analyzer software helps you quickly sort through expensive diapers

17
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,880
and our streaming data platforms.

18
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,920
page enables you to size up body parts.

19
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,520
It lives on contaminated flesh.

20
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,480
It thrives on contaminated air.

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,880
Things that kill men nourish it.

22
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,180
The things that kill men nourish it.

23
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,380
Oh, no.

24
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:08,840
Wait.

25
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,740
Oh, shut the...

26
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,020
Dave.

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,680
Dave.

28
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,120
Dave, I'm not kidding.

29
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,740
Shut the door.

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,020
Dave.

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,240
Oh, shit.

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,880
It's too late.

33
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,780
I'm getting out of here.

34
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,540
Are they all in here now?

35
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,820
Sorry, I'm putting my suit on.

36
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,920
Everybody, get in your suit.

37
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,380
Get in your bio suit now.

38
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,520
Don't panic.

39
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:22,980
Don't panic.

40
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,820
Suit up, boys.

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,300
All hatches are closing.

42
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,100
All hatches are closing.

43
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,580
The audience is puking.

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,080
Well, welcome to another journey to Endless Vista.

45
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,700
Our favorite destination here for the pre-meet people.

46
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,900
Those of you human-trips.

47
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,700
That's out there.

48
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,660
I want to give it a shout.

49
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,440
And that's the Hour of Slug.

50
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,060
Time again for the Hour of Slug.

51
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,860
The Hour of Slug.

52
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:19,080
Man, this is like the best, best show I've ever seen in the lounge, man.

53
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,140
And making time go by so fast.

54
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,320
You're on drugs, dude.

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:22,680
Yeah.

56
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:22,820
Yeah.

57
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:22,960
Yeah.

58
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:22,960


59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:22,960


60
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:22,960


61
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,800
On all of them tonight.

62
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,400
Did you try the Sumerian tablets again?

63
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,060
No, no.

64
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,960
I don't think I'll do that again.

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,200
Oh, man.

66
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,580
I had a thing with a knife like a toff in the middle of my forebrain last night.

67
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:32,860
Yeah.

68
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,600
And you can be with Bob and be listening to the teachings that come through.

69
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,700
And I tell you, friends, if you can just get that, if you can just pull out that wallet,

70
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,800
pull it out of your pocket, pull it out of your purse.

71
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,300
Lay your hands on the radio.

72
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,660
Lay your hands on the radio there in the home.

73
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,740
Hold it.

74
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,200
Hold it.

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,700
Hold it now.

76
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,880
Now, this is government.

77
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,220
This is government business.

78
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,320
And if you stay, you're interfering with government property.

79
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,300
So you better just go on home.

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,980
Oh, friends, I just, I can, the miracle of the Bob world is unfolding in front of me now.

81
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:17,560
I can see in the spirit through my windshield, I see superimposed over this mix master across

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
which I drive.

83
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,960
I can see an ocean of self-realized subjection.

84
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,280
I can see the geniuses all in one place.

85
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,960
They're waiting up to their knees in blood, but it's the blood of the baptism of the mighty

86
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,380
fist face of Bob.

87
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:42,120
The face that can pile through eight foot thick titanium steel conspiracy Fort Knox

88
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,540
doors.

89
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,040
The face that can burn through metal with that mighty pipe.

90
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,840
Cobb had promised to show them where he buried the bodies.

91
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,620
They brought in a dog.

92
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,280
He daverted to help locate the bodies.

93
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,540
They scoured the two victims.

94
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,720
I was done for that.

95
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,980
That the two to eventually the searchers discovered easy squeeze, vacant, priceless.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,620
The world never had a true account of that test.

97
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,060
What are you trying to tell me?

98
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,160
Coyote, lots of game in here now contaminated game fighting for life.

99
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,060

151
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,360
A little bit deeper.

152
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
A little bit deeper.

153
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,640
And you open the door and you step inside.

154
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,780
We're inside our hearts.

155
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,300
Now imagine your pain is a white ball of healing light.

156
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,520
That's right.

157
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,340
Your pain, the pain itself, is a white ball of healing light.

158
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,840
I don't think so.

159
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,660
Yeah.

160
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:54,660


161
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,360
This is your life.

162
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,100
Good to the last drop.

163
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,940
It doesn't get any better than this.

164
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,960
This is your life.

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,020
And it's ending one minute at a time.

166
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,780
This isn't a seminar.

167
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,300
This isn't a weekend retreat.

168
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,560
Where you are now, you can't even imagine what the bottom will be like.

169
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,520
Only after disaster can we be resurrected.

170
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,340
It's only after you die, you will be able to experience the last drop that all it takes

171
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,340


172
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,340


173
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,340
You've lost everything, then you're free to do anything

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,780
Nothing is static, everything is appalling

175
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,820
Everything is falling apart

176
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,500
This is your life, this is your life, this is your life, this is your life

177
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,540
Doesn't get any better than this

178
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,520
This is your life, this is your life, this is your life, this is your life

179
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,680
And it's bending one minute at a time

180
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,140
You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake

181
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,720
You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else

182
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,920
We are all part of the same compoosie

183
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,520
We are the all singing, all dancing crap of the world

184
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,800
You are not your bank account

185
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,840
You are not the clothes you wear

186
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,140
You are not the contents of your wallet

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,940
You are not your bowel cancer

188
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,340
You are not your grande latte

189
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,240
You are not the car you drive

190
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,900
You are not your fucking techies

191
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,360
You have to give up

192
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,740
You have to give up

193
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,900
You have to realize that someday you will die

194
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,340
Until you know that you are useless

195
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,880
I say let me never be complete

196
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,380
I say may I never be content

197
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,960
I say deliver me from Swedish furniture

198
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,340
I say deliver me from clever art

199
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,320
I say deliver me from clear skin and perfect teeth

200
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,700
I say you have to give up

201
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,620
I say evolve

202
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,060
And let the chips fall where they may

203
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,840
This is your life

204
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,580
This is your life

205
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,360
This is your life

206
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,100
This is your life

207
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,160
Doesn't get any better than this

208
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,880
This is your life

209
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,640
This is your life

210
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,420
This is your life

211
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,120
This is your life

212
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,280
And it's bending one minute at a time

213
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,740
You have to give up

214
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,220
You have to give up

215
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,640
I want you to hit me as hard as you can

216
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,740
I want you to hit me as hard as you can

217
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,860
Welcome to Fight Club

218
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,700
If this is your first night

219
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,060
You have to fight

220
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,420
And friends that was

221
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,460
Yes from the Fight Club

222
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,460
Dust Brothers

223
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,600
This is your life

224
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,640
The name of that

225
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,100
Scientologists call me a bigot

226
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,460
I'm here with the court facts

227
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,560
It's a music picket

228
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,760
It's for all the critics and the lurkers who dig it

229
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,360
Cause we know we give some rickets when we kick it like this

230
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,400
Pill popping up so we know

231
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,160
We're a life beating friend

232
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,780
Cheating, check bouncing, ass balling

233
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,940
Race hating, gold bombing

234
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,180
Humble balling, coke sniffing

235
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,260
Chain smoking, salad poisoning

236
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:23,980
War and dodging

237
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,060
No good at con man

238
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,840
L. Ron Hubbard was a man of his word

239
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,880
But his words were lies

240
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,280
And turds fat like his thighs

241
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,140
And were so oversized

242
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,660
It devised my capacity

243
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,820
To measure his insanity

244
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,620
I wonder if he planned to be the fraud

245
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,040
Like he turned out all burned out

246
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,300
With no will then two wills

247
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,140
And then with an ass full of vitriol

248
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,400
Music that mocks Scientology

249
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,220
Pill popping up so we know

250
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,260
A life beating friend cheating

251
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,540
Cheating, check bouncing, ass balling

252
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,740
Race hating, gold bombing

253
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,900
Humble balling, coke sniffing

254
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,100
Chain smoking, salad poisoning

255
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,780
War and dodging

256
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,880
No good at con man

257
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,420
He lied for a living

258
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,600
Always taking, never giving

259
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,880
Anything but orders

260
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,260
A hoarder of money and guns and drugs

261
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,540
And thugs and intelligence

262
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,120
It's a good thing that his lackeys were incompetent

263
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,140
Operation Snow White showed right through

264
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,580
The disguise of propriety

265
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,780
The mask of legality

266
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,960
The near was stripped away

267
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,080
To show us the true face

268
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,380
Of the Church of Scientology

269
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,460
Their actual philosophy

270
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,300
Make money, make more money

271
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:15,920
You're starving

272
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,240
Make money, make more money

273
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,240


274
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,240


275
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,240


276
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,240


277
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,240


278
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,240


279
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,240


280
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,960
Make money, make more money

281
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,480
Make money, make more money

282
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,300
Mary Sue Hubbard and 10 other clans

283
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,100
Revenge, we jailed for a sinister plan

284
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,120
To infiltrate and wiretap the world's governments

285
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,380
Find info that can harm them

286
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,480
Steal files and documents

287
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,880
And try to sneak away with them

288
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,820
But guess who got caught

289
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,980
In a paranoid plot

290
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,300
What?

291
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,180
It was Mary Sue

292
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,380
What's Hubbard gonna do?

293
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,500
You think he stepped in to save the day?

294
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,460
No fucking way

295
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,260
That coward hid until his dying day

296
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,060
Make money, make more money

297
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,460
Make money, make more money

298
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:46,740
She'll take money

299
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,180
Take money battle

300
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,240
Scientology what can be said?

301
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
Shiptorn from the head of a mad man that stead and gone

302
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,620
There's something very wrong with Ron

303
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,860
His Dong dont work

304
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,060
The guy's a jerk

305
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,800
His wall of shit ain't real

306
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,760
You fake Charlie

307
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,060
Take tricks from Poppa'sthem

308
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,200
Spitch for followers who take the fence

309
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,920
Dale K so all stars will

310
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,580
You digits

311
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,260
Lil poppin' stommた

312
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:12,800
Swiggin wine

313
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Beats by chain

314
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,460
She ain't got nice

315
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,020
Whalarm

316
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,440
Make money, make more money.

317
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,760
Make money, make more money.

318
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,500
Make money, make more money.

319
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:06,340
Oh, make money, make more money mix, friends.

320
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,420
That was the El Queso All Stars.

321
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,800
And that is a band song.

322
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:19,100
Apparently the Church of Scientology insisted that they remove that and various other things from mp3.com.

323
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,640
But I'm going to tell you where to get more El Queso All Stars.

324
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,420
And that is mp3.com slash El Queso All Stars.

325
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,700
And I trust you know how to spell El Queso.

326
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,820
They also have an mp3.com called Interbulator.

327
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,460
So check out Interbulator.

328
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,660
The El Queso All Stars, friends.

329
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,800
I'm the world's biggest fan of the El Queso All Stars.

330
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,080
Yeah.

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,740
Sign up today.

333
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,420
You could be leaving on that jet plane.

334
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,760
Jumping from 10,000 feet.

335
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,260
Yeah, baby.

336
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,020
What did I have queued up here?

337
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,560
Oh, hang on.

338
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,260
Here, listen to this.

339
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,100
I did not, my friends.

340
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,880
7.30.

341
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,660
God has given pastor a message of faith for you.

342
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,320
A message of faith for you.

343
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,700
The devil have gone far enough.

344
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,960
The devil have gone far enough.

345
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,060
Prayer warriors, meet me on my knees.

346
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,620
On your knees Friday night at 7.30.

347
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,420
And listen now, my friends.

348
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,740
The prayer tower is open.

349
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,220
Prayer warriors, the prayer tower is open right now.

350
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,440
You that need prayer.

351
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,540
My God.

352
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,280
Prayer warriors.

353
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,720
The prayer team are sitting by the telephones.

354
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,140
Right now to pray the prayer of faith for you.

355
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,200
Prayer warriors.

356
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,220
His name is Jesus.

357
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,760
Oh, make your heart sing.

358
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,220
The point is, ladies and gentlemen.

359
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,400
What?

360
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,700
That greed, for lack of a better word, is good.

361
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,760
Greed is right.

362
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,800
Greed works.

363
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,900
Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of an evolutionary spirit.

364
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,440
Greed in all of its forms.

365
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:38,240
Greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind and

366
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,680
greed.

367
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,740
You must.

368
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,220
And Yale first.

369
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:42,840
Quite frankly.

370
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,220
And by that, I keeps coming up with an unfortunateので energetic subtitle.

371
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
The culture thwarted the

372
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,320
and кнопk.

373
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,480
and Stre丨 y n guards.

374
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,480
ate ritual and brakes on.

375
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:01,480


376
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:10,720
fell a ton of time off building a building up G most likelyfun.

377
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,780
I'm so lonesome I could die

378
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,460
So kiss me and smile for me

379
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,020
Tell me that you'll wait for me

380
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,920
Hold me like you'll never let me go

381
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,940
Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane

382
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,580
Don't know when I'll be back again

383
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,460
Oh babe, I hate to go

384
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,300
So many times I let you down

385
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,780
There's so many times I fucked around

386
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,500
I tell you now, they don't mean nothing

387
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,480
Cause every place I go I'll think of you

388
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,000
Every song I sing I'll sing for you

389
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,040
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring

390
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,700
So kiss me and smile for me

391
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,300
Tell me that you'll wait for me

392
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,280
Hold me like you'll never let me go

393
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,340
Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane

394
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,040
Don't know when I'll be back again

395
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,880
Oh babe, I hate to go

396
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,100
Now the time has come to leave you

397
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,600
One more time and let me kiss you

398
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,460
Close your eyes and I'll be on my own way

399
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,340
Dream about the day

400
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,500
So come, but I won't have to leave alone

401
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,600
About the times that I won't have to say

402
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,380
Oh kiss me and smile for me

403
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,060
Tell me that you'll wait for me

404
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,560
Hold me like you'll never let me, never let me go

405
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,180
Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane

406
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,860
Don't know when I'll be back again

407
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,800
Oh babe, I hate to go

408
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,880
Yeah

409
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,200
Gubba, gubba, hey!

410
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,160
Gubba, gubba, hey!

411
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,420
We do not accept any of you

412
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,160
They don't make music like they used to back in the day

413
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,120
Remember the old days of the caravans

414
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,080
When the minstrels would carry their own doodads over their shoulders

415
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,000
And stop in many a squalid town

416
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,660
We got up early in the morning back in them days

417
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,320
We do not accept any of you

418
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,460
We do not accept any of you

419
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:34,460


420
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,420
With a cobalt lantern

421
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,020
And wait for those trumpeters to appear

422
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,760
On the horizon area

423
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,520
And then everybody in town would show up

424
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,460
And pay us their 14, 15 cents, whatever we charged

425
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,220
Those were the days

426
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,220
Remember that, you guys?

427
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,160
Just a rambling band

428
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,500
Oh, you were unconscious

429
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,740
Yeah, they killed us

430
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,360
Yeah, they killed you

431
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,100
Well, they didn't really kill you

432
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,700
They knocked you into a coma

433
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,620
And we had to take care of you

434
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,380
But you were the most wonderful thing on the sideshow

435
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,140
I've heard those were great times

436
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,480
Oh, we used to put ice cream cones on your shoulders and have little kids pee on you.

437
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,300
We'd just spoof and goof on you any way we could.

438
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,880
Chaz, do you remember those days?

439
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,180
Those were the days.

440
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,780
They're gone, though.

441
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,460
Back in the day, Chaz would forget how to play the piano once in a while,

442
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,620
and we'd just stick you up there like as the stiff

443
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,060
and pretend like your fingers, your little digits, passed the wordle.

444
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,520
I wish I could remember.

445
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,540
Oh, I wish.

446
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,300
Oh, man.

447
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,560
I think we were a tribe of wandering Hindus, perhaps.

448
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,740
Oh, that was another reincarnation tale.

449
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,080
Wandering bohemians.

450
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,500
Gypsies on the road of life.

451
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,320
Zingar.

452
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,500
And Chiton.

453
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,900
Or living death, as the case may be.

454
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,140
Oui, nous sommes Chiton.

455
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,580
We are gypsies.

456
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,940
We travel here, we travel there.

457
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,980
Leaving our little sperm banks everywhere.

458
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,120
That's the story of Coco Paley, is to impregnate each individual town.

459
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,900
That's what Kerouac said we should do.

460
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,500
That's what Bob did.

461
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,700
Bob did do it.

462
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,020
And that's...

463
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,460
That's much to his credit and also his discredit

464
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,840
because of the miscreant mutant monsters that have sprung up in his backyard.

465
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,960
Those cute little bastards.

466
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:18,220
Cute, perhaps, for those with strange binocular-shaped eyeglasses.

467
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,260
Brad Williams!

468
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,080
Who's knocking on the wall?

469
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,460
Uh, Chet.

470
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,780
Uh, Chet.

471
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,400
Chet.

472
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,520
Hello, faithful listeners.

473
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:38,940
This is the Colonel, the overseer of the slaves known as Four Letter Words, also known as the manager.

474
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:48,940
This album is laden with subliminal messages, here to teach you about the subgenius, the cult of the subgenius, and J.R. Bob Dobbs.

475
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,120
And, by the way, can I get a jalapeno?

476
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,520
Jalapeno!

477
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,440
Jalapeno.

478
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:54,660
Jalapeno.

479
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:02,420
I also want to tell you, by the way, this is protected by the B, the O, and the B, with the D.

480
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,000
Pinkies!

481
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,840
Pinkies!

482
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,480
Bob Dog! He came from outer space!

483
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,300
Extend, Don Troy, all you pinks, stay away!

484
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,300
Extend, Don Troy, all you pinks, stay away!

485
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,340
Extend, Don Troy, all you pinks, stay away!

486
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,380
Extend, Don Troy, all you pinks, stay away!

487
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,400
Oh my Bob?

488
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,620
He's a master of slack!

489
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,640
Bob Dog! Don't think he'll stab you in the back!

490
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,260
Bob Dog! He's got a zoom pipe!

491
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,240
Bob Dog! Have a look into the hack!

492
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,340
Bob Dog! He can say all that he thinks!

493
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,980
Bob Dog! Nourish me your names!

494
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,920
Bob Dog! Extend, Don Troy!

495
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,080
Bob Dog! 57 Wow, he really is voilà!

496
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,640
Bob Dog! All the chicks dig!

497
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,840
Bob Dog! He ain't even fucking pig!

498
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,760
Bob Dog! He's gotta briefcase!

499
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,680
Bob Dog! He came from outer space!

500
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,560
Extend, Don Troy, all you pinks, stay away!

501
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,600
Extend, Don Troy, all you pinks, stay away!

502
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,600
Extend, Don Troy, all you pinks, stay away!

503
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,700
Extend, Don Troy, all you pinks, stay away!

504
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,320
He's a master of slack

505
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,160
Bob Dogg

506
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,360
Pigs stab you in the back

507
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,120
Bob Dogg

508
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,020
He's got us in pipe

509
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,060
Bob Dogg

510
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,040
Never listens to the hype

511
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,080
Bob Dogg

512
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,040
Pops stay at Don's Way

513
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,900
Bob Dogg

514
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,800
His pop's gonna stay

515
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,940
Bob Dogg

516
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,600
He can sell anything

517
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,860
Bob Dogg

518
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,760
Probably doesn't underrate

519
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,720
Bob Dogg

520
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,520
All the chicks dig

521
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,740
Bob Dogg

522
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,680
He ain't even fucking big

523
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,580
Bob Dogg

524
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,620
He's got a briefcase

525
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,620
Bob Dogg

526
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,660
He can't get better straight

527
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,360
X-Men's on its way

528
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,320
All you pigs stay away

529
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,480
X-Men's on its way

530
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,320
All you pigs stay away

531
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,460
X-Men's on its way

532
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,360
All you pigs stay away

533
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,480
X-Men's on its way

534
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,420
All you pigs stay away

535
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,360
Yes, dear friends.

536
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:31,700
Amazing.

537
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,840
A new song by a mystery band

538
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,360
called The Four Letter Words.

539
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,620
I'm not sure how I got that.

540
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,640
I'm confused.

541
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,060
It was in my computer

542
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,420
under the directory labeled

543
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,020
Two Beans

544
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,420
as if it were that

545
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,340
that young worthy Two Beans

546
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,100
who had submitted it.

547
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,380
But it just doesn't sound like him

548
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,200
because it's

549
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,140
a bit slicker.

550
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,080
Friends, we've also heard

551
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,640
and will continue to hear

552
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,660
a great bit of

553
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,380
the old subgenius

554
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,100
Media Barrage No. 5

555
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,940
which is being remixed

556
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,160
for the CD world.

557
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,460
It was composed back in

558
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,240
that time

559
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
known as the day.

560
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,080
Yes, the day

561
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,900
when Bob walked the earth,

562
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,460
my friends.

563
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,860
When the hour of slack

564
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,640
was about

565
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,800
nothing but

566
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,880
that man

567
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,840
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

568
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,660
that one

569
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,920
pipe-smoking salesman

570
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,320
who has brought us

571
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,020
this church of the subgenius.

572
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,280
And what is the church

573
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,560
of the subgenius, my friend?

574
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,920
It is the voice

575
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,960
of the people

576
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,500
who have simply had enough

577
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,880
and will no longer tolerate

578
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,740
the normal's assault

579
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,700
against decency

580
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,440
or indecency as the case may be

581
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,420
with an exciting new attitude.

582
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,020
And a positive solution-oriented approach.

583
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,980
The tide can and will

584
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,820
be turned, my friend.

585
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,020
Through faith and prayer

586
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,080
followed by action

587
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,940
we shall overcome.

588
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,840
Ah, yes.

589
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,440
Yes, my friends.

590
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,300
The church of the subgenius

591
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,360
is an educational missionary effort

592
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,600
to offer a tried, proven,

593
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,620
and tested subjection

594
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,660
to the

595
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,620
most vulnerable.

596
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,120
Ah, yes.

597
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,160
I've used more water

598
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,440
in the last two months

599
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,360
than I have in 64 years.

600
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Maybe that's why

601
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,740
you're still alive, Pete.

602
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,500
Hmm.

603
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,160
Oh, that is all right.

604
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,840
But many of you

605
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,640
may have forgotten

606
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:14,640


607
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:14,700
when I was a girl.

608
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:14,700


609
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,320
Not true!

610
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,700
parting with the limp,

611
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,120
amidst a frenzied spirit

612
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,160
requests for enhanced

613
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,460
and бал parentheses.

614
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:23,460


615
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:23,460


616
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:23,460


617
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:23,460


618
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,400
I am Dr. Dooley.

619
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,140
Hi, M Zepp.

620
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,120
Dudie, did you know

621
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,120


622
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,120


623
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,540
is actually a must-have

624
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:31,540


625
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:31,620
to all car field cover.

626
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:31,620


627
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:31,620


628
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:42,380
cows into one body. A fifth leg right out of a rear end. Come now and see them here. Here

629
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:52,640
they are. Strange mistakes of Mother Nature. One look at them will tell you more than a

630
00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:00,340
thousand words of mine. Oh, Tony, you and me belong together. We're poured out of the

631
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:06,140
same mold. I wouldn't make a book on that baby. I hope this clears up any confusion

632
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,900
and that you will continue doing business with us, even though we are a cadre of goat-raping

633
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:16,080
mountain hens with only spotty regard for dental hygiene. You know, I see some real

634
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,380
gold in the church of the subgenius and odd ways from unexpected corners and satisfyingly

635
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,100
regular intervals. Once you turn on the wipers and clear the windshield of bullshit, bouts

636
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,400
of clumsiness, vertiginous logistics, moth-ridden wallets, slips of the tongue that make you

637
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,320
skid all the way into the kitchen, you'll be in a state of shock.

638
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:40,100
I just like the Harlem Buster works here. As such, aotional procession of fireimpression

639

640
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,260
bodies, so I'd list them all here.

641
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:59,300
Kill me. You, hah. I haven't had a good laugh all day.

642
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,220
We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is pointless.

643
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,160
Tarantulation is irrelevant.

644
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:29,720
A squid eating dough in a polyethylene bag is fast and bulbous, got me?

645
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm afraid he's going out of his mind. He seems to live in a world all of his own.

646
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,480
He's a mutation, Rick. Freak of this new atomic world of ours.

647
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,320
What's his name? Bob. Bob. Ain't that a bitch?

648
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,760
Is he alive or dead? I see thoughts within his head.

649
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:57,460
Running as fast as they can, Iron Man lives again.

650
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,580
Done with Mr. Giant but his time understands.

651
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,120
Was it just the

652
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,920
technology thing that reallyraineTake my arm off my neckj varryators 누가

We're going to be playing the farfisa

655
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,140
It's a wonderful instrument

656
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,620
Look over here with Uncle Cherry

657
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:44,520
Oh, you were magnificent last night

658
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,960
That's right

659
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,220
I love your wearing all four legs and that strange hat

660
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,920
It's actually a beacon to another cosmos

661
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,480
A parallel dimension

662
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,540
I loved it

663
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,740
This show hurts my head

664
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,180
Oh, God, my head is hurting

665
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,900
This show is an anthem to Christians

666
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,080
And other like-minded American products

667
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,840
Eat your cheese

Think your raggy tag thoughts

Go to the mall

671
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,720
Go to the mall

672
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,360
Go to the mall

673
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,880
Chaz was just having sex with the volume knob

674
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,580
With Britney

675
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,700
Some people scratch and actually, you know, take care of each

676
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,820
I wouldn't even know

677
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,320
I wouldn't know a damn Britney Spears song

678
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,480
I'm so out of it

679
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,440
I've become just like Batman living in a bat

680
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:56,560
I like Christina and they call her the bad girl of the duo

681
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,980
And they also call her the loser

682
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,700
Zip it up!

683
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:58,700

00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:58,700


689
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
I like her actually in some sport contests

690
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,000
I like Mariah Carey since she's become a dumpy has-been

691
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,720
I like Moses in a big red dress

692
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,760
Slatternly

693

Overgun look

695
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,680
I like the Buddha in a miniskirt

696
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,740
Used up young

I like the Dobbs, man

699
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,520
I just made her five years younger

700
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,060
I'm a Dobbs whacker

701
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,880
Yeah

702
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,940
Pictures of Bob Dobbs in my sex room

703
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,320
My purple and pink pillows covered with pictures of Bob

704
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,960
Yeah, man, it's my love den

705
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,700
And all you young ladies are invited in

706
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,060
Check it out

707
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,320
Here's a glow-in-the-dark Bob skull

708
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,720
Complete with a pipe that gets you high

709
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,440
Check out some of these fake Bob organs on the wall

710
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,640
All these were made by Bob

711
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,700
He defies all the laws of Bob's life

712
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:58,700


713
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,360
Man and God

714
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,900
There may be an entirely new set of laws, Jim

715
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,300
That we know nothing about

716
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,040
Come out and say what you mean

717
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,660
I'm only guessing

718
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,600
The mockery of everything that's decent and wholesome

719
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,040
And I challenge you to point out national talk shows

720
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,300
That do not belittle sexual fidelity, purity

721
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,660
That they do not belittle the marriage union and the family lifestyle

722
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,500
That they don't literally flaunt illicit lifestyle

723
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,660
I mean, I challenge you to show me a talk show that doesn't make light of God

724
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,640
The Subgenius Foundation

725
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
The Reverend Ivan Stang

726
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,540
And Dr. Philo Drummond

727
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,480
I'm glad that we have warning messages on everything now

728
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:42,940
Yeah

729
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,880
So that there's product liability

730
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,740
There is no product liability anymore

731
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,980
I mean, people can't be

732
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,860
It's a good thing we stamp it on everything now

733
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,060
Because, you know, for a while there

734
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,700
Lawyers were just getting rich

735
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,380
From people that, you know, they walk up

736
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,480
They hit themselves up and say, you know, you're a bad guy

737
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,480


738
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,480


739
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,480


740
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,480


741
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,480


742
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,360
You're a bad guy

743
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,360


744
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,360


745
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,360


746
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,560
Because they couldn't aim it

747
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,180
And then they would sue the hammer company and win, you know

748
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,480
And it's like, so now they put a label on a hammer

749
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,100
That says, do not hit yourself in the head with this

750
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,520
And think you can get some money

751
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:13,960
Yeah

752
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,260
It all depends who wins the argument

753
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,540
Oh, definitely, certainly

754
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,260
No, people that lose arguments generally don't win

755
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,020
Generally

756
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,880
What happens?

757
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,200
If you find something offensive on a major label

758
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:28,480
It's a good thing you don't do it

759
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,520
Unless, of course, the object was to lose

760
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:32,740
Yeah

761
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,680
Maybe

762
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,280
Yeah, if it doesn't have, like, a parental advisory label

763
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,580
And you find something offensive on it

764
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,760
Like, and then you let a kid listen to it

765
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,540
Can you then sue the major label?

766
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,240
A good lawyer can win the argument

767
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:45,980
Probably could

768
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,180
But, you know, it all depends how good the listener is

769
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,340
I think if a kid listens to a record

770
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,520
That's got the parental warning on it

771
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
And then he still goes out and kills

772
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,480
They can sue the label

773
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,280
Sue the parents for not heeding the warning

774
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,540
Sue negatively

775
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,360
Yeah, that's what I would do

776
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,440
You can always sue the parents for not being good parents

777
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,200
No matter what

778
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,860
They're sort of like the last resort

779
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,520
I mean, even if you were suing a major company

780
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,320
And they weren't getting what you wanted

781
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,040
You could always sue the president of the company's parents

782
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,400
For raising him wrong

783
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,120
And then you could shake them down for a few bucks, you know

784
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,900
Hey, it's the 20th century

785
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,460
Whatever you can do about it

786
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:28,460


787
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:28,460


788
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:28,460


789
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:28,460


790
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:28,460


791
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,400
We're here to have a good time

792
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,440
Let's get on with it

793
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,140
So long as it doesn't cause a murder

794
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,980
There he is, standing there

795
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,100
In his fleshy flesh here

796
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,720
100% flesh

797
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,620
Yeah, man, what you got there playing right now?

798
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,540
We're talking

799
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,020
And we were playing the sexual organ

800
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,740
We're talking about how dumb Chaz's students are

801
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,820
And we were making fun of his feces for crying out loud

802
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,620
The guy still doesn't believe it's a democratic oligarchy

803
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,180
We're not playing any music

804
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,820
We're living in today

805
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,140
I'll tell you what, man

806
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,780
That stuff is really bumming me and the fellas out

807
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,840
Oh, man

808
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,180
You want me to play Britney again?

809
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,260
No, man

810
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,900
I don't want you to play some Britney

811
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,960
I want some real, man

812
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,640
You're bumming me and my fellas out

813
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,160
Oh, you tickled our cockles

814
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,540
I'm sipping on some steel reserves

815
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,680
That sounds like the reverend

816
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,080
There's something for you

817
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,160
Just for you, brother

818
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,240
This song is going out just to you and your brothers

819
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,580
Right up

820
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,900
Now the time

821
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,760
Here

822
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,740
Up, right, up, right, up, right up

823
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,280
Sign up today, kids

824
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,320
If you're sitting on your ass at home right now

825
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,980
Wondering what the hell you're gonna do tomorrow

826
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,320
Hell, there's a recruitment officer

827
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,620
Sitting downtown waiting to talk to you

828
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,540
You'll never have to make another choice

829
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,620
Low pay

830
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,160
Three meals a day

831
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,160
Ill-fitting uniforms and crabby hair

832
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,960
No more fox of your own

833
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,780
Just fine

834
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,440
You'll be happy

835
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,940
You'll learn cool songs

836
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,120
And you'll be happy

837
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,600
You'll get to sing all day long

838
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,420
Come home in a cool body bag

839
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,700
You'll be all you can be

840
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,260
You are an army of one

841
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,620
Be all you can be interred as

842
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,900
With your head blowed off

843
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,480
No, you get to blow the other people's heads off

844
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,100
This is my church

845
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,840
There are other churches like it

846
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,140
But this one is mine

847
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,500
I just want my enforcing

848
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,340
If I die in combat

849
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,500
Remember, soldier

850
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,080
American forces are impregnable

851
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,900
I intend to make of you

852
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,260
A steel pillar

853
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,800
A horse of iron

854
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,720
Capable of creating enemies

855
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,520
As well as destroying enemies

856
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,680
The world is your enemy, soldier

857
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,900
Get that smile off your face

858
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,160
And get it in the dirt where it belongs

859
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,060
Yeah, you'll have fun

860
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,380
Yeah

861
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,620
You'll get to meet that guy

862
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,840
What CD am I playing with?

863
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Let me go to my car

864
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,740
Hey, man, who was that guy?

865
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,960
This is the one I like, babe

866
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,880
Hey, Stan, who was that guy?

867
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,700
Man

868
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,280
Now, Chaz, you're not being sarcastic, are you?

869
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,800
Because if it weren't for our armed forces, you know

870
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,540
We wouldn't enjoy the freedom to

871
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,500
Mock our freedom like we do

872
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,560
No, no, I'm not being facetious

873
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,860
I think they should sign up

874
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,780
Stan, you are not allowed to mock our freedom

875
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,080
I think 20-year-olds should goddamn sign up

876
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,560
Well, you were right

877
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,940
Put in a couple of fucking years

878
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,360
And learn what it's like to be in the real world

879
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,660
These kids 20 years old in college

880
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,680
Have no freaking idea what the real world's anything about

881
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,320
Chaz wants to put two X's on Generation X

882
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,680
He wants to put an X on each eye, if you know what I mean

883
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,580
Sign up, kids

884
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,860
You'll get to learn these cool songs

885
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,560
And that's more employment for us kids

886
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,120
Because when you come home in a beautiful, dull, plastic body bag

887
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,580
That means we get more

888
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,520
I had a girl down in New Orleans

889
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,400
I had a girl down in New Orleans

890
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,420
14 youngins and a can of beans

891
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,260
14 youngins and a can of beans

892
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,660
She was motivated

893
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,120
She was motivated

894
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,040
She was motivated

895
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,540
She was dedicated

896
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,880
She was dedicated

897
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,400
She was motivated

898
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,680
She was motivated

899
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,100
She was dedicated

900
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,620
She was dedicated

901
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,520
Llori Hadallaya

902
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,860
Llori Hadallaya

903
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,240
I love to draw the time

904
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,760
I love to draw the time

905
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,120
Listen to the rhythm

906
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,720
Run with Marines

907
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,280
Run with Marines, man

908
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,460
Run with Marines

909
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,540
Run with the Marines

910
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,700
I'm about to be run with the Wolfs

911
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,920
Or any other services there

912
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,000
The merchant marine chan

913
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,960
Merchant Marines, yeah.

914
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,720
Carol Wack was in the Merchant Marines show.

915
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,660
How about there's real good drugs in the Navy, I've heard.

916
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,380
The Coast Guard guys get laid all the time.

917
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:40,340
Can't I just sign them for a few marine biology courses in college and won't that deal with it?

918
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,480
But you must wear the special uniform, Jazz.

919
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,180
Oh, the marine biologist uniform is very beautiful.

920
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,180
There's a whale on each shoulder.

921
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:47,680
I was going to major in marine biology.

922
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,120
Isn't that the same as two years in the USMC?

923
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,480
It's the same as two years in Leavenworth, man.

924
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,940
Give up that idea.

925
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,860
That's a false school in Dobbs Town.

926
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,220
I was going to go study iceberg flows.

927
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,180
Hmm.

928
00:39:59,420 --> 00:39:59,760
Yeah.

929
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,200
Better you should study dental flows and the mountain flows.

930
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,760
Well, you know what, did you hear about the latest high that's out there?

931
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,380
No.

932
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,700
It turns out that iceberg flows, which is water that's about 15,000 years old from the last ice age,

933
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:21,600
is covered in a coating of bird shit that is equally as old.

934
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,840
And in that time period, when you scrape the bird crap,

935
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,660
off of the iceberg, dry it up.

936
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,980
50,000 year old bird crap.

937
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,600
Dry it up.

938
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,300
You scrape it off.

939
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,300
You drop it on like a mirror or something.

940
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,020
Take a hair dryer and dry it all up.

941
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,440
Ecstasy viruses.

942
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:41,540
And then scrape it up with a razor blade and stuff that dry remnant up in a pipe and smoke it.

943
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,500
50,000 year old bird crap.

944
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,000
American ingenuity.

945
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,840
From icebergs.

946
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,160
Yeah.

947
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,680
Iceberg crap.

948
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,360
Ancient.

949
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:47,860
Yeah.

950
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,660
Our ancestors actually probably dinosaurs' frooms are on there also.

951
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,540
Just think of all the different things we can do with this.

952
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,460
Besides snort it.

953
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,460
We could probably process it down.

954
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,040
What about modern day?

955
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,880
What's the difference between 50,000 year old bird crap and modern day?

956
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,780
I have no idea.

957
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,120
It may be the compression after, you know, all that time.

958
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,240
Is the air better than with the birds?

959
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,160
Yeah, maybe.

960
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,960
Actually, eat the hemp seeds.

961
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,440
The atmosphere of the Pleistocene age was composed of 15% frop smoke.

962
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,620
Well, 15,000 years ago, you know, every couple of thousand years,

963
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,020
all the water on Earth is recycled, meaning it's all, you know, urine.

964
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,880
You know, all the water on Earth has been recycled.

965
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,740
It's been in somebody's bladder before it was in yours.

966
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,040
And that's a condition we're in right now.

967
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,620
But at that time period, there was a lot less of that.

968
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,720
Now, here's an idea for you.

969
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,800
Let's put it in the Pleistocene era.

970
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,060
You know how some people spend a lot of money on water, really pure water?

971
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,660
Yeah.

972
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,340
They harvest icebergs.

973
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:45,960
That is something.

974
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:55,380
Think about moon water, Joe, or asteroid water, or comet water that has never been in a dinosaur.

975
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:55,520
That's a big deal.

976
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,120
Or a bladder.

977
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,260
There is water out there that has never been inside a life form.

978
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:07,380
It has been pretty much in pure water form since the beginning of creation.

979
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,100
H-2-O and nothing more.

980
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,880
Now, is George W. Bush and H. Ross Perot sitting at their special country club at the Bohemian Grove

981
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:24,860
sipping on some moon water while you have to drink out of a public fountain?

982
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,520
Oh, that's a good idea.

983
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,140
Hooked up to a public restroom, hooked up to a tube station in London somewhere where

984
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:37,580
the worst smelling urine in the universe is coursing through your veins right now while

985
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,960
a rich man smokes his stogie.

986
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,120
What you gonna do about it, boy?

987
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,840
You gonna sit there and take it?

988
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,040
Or are you gonna get up, run to the window, throw an open tank?

989
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,640
I'm married to hell and I'm not gonna...

990
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,820
Hit him, baby, one more time.

991
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,620
Well, I think I'm just gonna have a beer instead.

992
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:55,500
I can't even kick it.

993
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:55,500


994
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:55,500


995
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:55,500


996
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:55,500


997
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:55,500


998
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:55,500


999
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:55,500


1000
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:55,500


1001
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:55,500


1002
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,560
I guess I will take it.

1003
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,240
I guess I will take it one more time.

1004
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,180
I'll just go have a beer and calm down.

1005
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,720
Bend over, take it one more time.

1006
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,160
I'll just take it one more time.

1007
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:04,940
What the hell?

1008
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:05,960
Might as well.

1009
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,800
At least I'm not the one being hauled off to that concentration camp.

1010
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:11,720
That's right.

1011
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,820
It ain't me.

1012
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,460
I'm not one of those peoples.

1013
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,640
I don't have to worry about it.

1014
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,860
They're not gonna come for us stamp collectors.

1015
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,620
That's right.

1016
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,960
I saw them come for the comic book collectors.

1017
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,060
And I didn't do anything because I'm not a comic book collector.

1018
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,380
I saw them come for the Trekkies.

1019
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,960
And I didn't do anything because I'm not a Trekkie.

1020
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,440
Then they came for the science fiction literature readers.

1021
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:36,220
And I started getting worried because actually I'm one of those and I had to hide my sci-fi.

1022
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:36,780
Here's from Cody.

1023
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,880
Check this out.

1024
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,580
Good afternoon.

1025
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:47,740
On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against our staunch friend, Great Britain.

1026
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,240
Australia, Germany, and France.

1027
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,420
Canada.

1028
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,860
More than 40 countries in the Middle East.

1029
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,480
Africa, Europe, and across Asia.

1030
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:55,480


1031
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,960
This military action is a part of our campaign against intelligence.

1032
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,020
America can do it!

1033
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,300
A new Reich rises from the old.

1034
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,600
Like a phoenix from the ashes.

1035
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,920
With the Kills!

1036
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,280
The Reichsman has burned and burned.

1037
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:25,480
With the Kills!

1038
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:25,480


1039
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,840
We can destroy the world!

1040
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,000
Let loose the Kraken!

1041
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,640
Let loose the dog!

1042
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,420
Upward! Upward!

1043
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,160
In the name of the Lord!

1044
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,240
Beefcake!

1045
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:46,840
Caesar!

1046
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:48,840
Caesar!

1047
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,920
Kill! Kill!

1048
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,980
No tears, baby.

1049
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,340
That's mine.

1050
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,380
I mean, playing with your genetics is my infamous game.

1051
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,240
I'm reaching down deep with my technology,

1052
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,880
and I'm going to kill your children like I want to.

1053
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,720
Well, Connie.

1054
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,040
Here's another one you shouldn't have.

1055
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,660
That totally kicked my...

1056
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,660
I know that over the years, many of you have seen the pictures

1057
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,540
and news clips of the concrete and mortar,

1058
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,360
the guard posts and machine gun towers,

1059
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:33,080
the dog runs, and the barbed wire that is American.

1060
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:40,020
We will, we will rock you.

1061
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,900
Sign up today, kids.

1062
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,280
Become part of the machine.

1063
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,740
Sign up today so they don't come and get me.

1064
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,700
If they ain't first, you're a getter.

1065
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,460
Remember that when you show them your arms.

1066
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,640
The more of you that sign up,

1067
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,320
the less chance they're going to come looking for me.

1068
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,300
Bow the brain, butt bow the rub, bow the rub.

1069
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,840
The wonder's, but of all sarcasm.

1070
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,580
Fashion double butt.

1071
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,620
Lard ass butt.

1072
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,700
Get your butt on my face.

1073
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,800
Your butt.

1074
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,800
The buttocks of the city.

1075
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,080
Sit on the buttocks of God.

1076
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,900
The biggest butt of all.

1077
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,500
Everybody has a butt.

1078
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,040
Everybody has a brain.

1079
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,120
Nobody's a super butt.

1080
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,660
But all butts are super.

1081
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,840
Stick it up, stick it up the butt.

1082
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,560
Keep it going.

1083
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,520
Stick it to the butt until it falls.

1084
00:46:53,660 --> 00:47:06,400
at you mouth. Butt mania, I love it, give it to me, up a butt. Oranges, drip out the butt, poetry uses in the mouth of a butt. Funny butt, sad butt, I'm a happy butt.

1085
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:17,480
Suck butt, gnawed butt, butt flood, butt strangler, butt stimulator, butt man, butt woman, butt babies, butt ninnies, butt brains, brain butts.

1086
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:33,400
How many butts does it take to change an insurance policy? How many butts does it take to crack a brain? How many butts does it take to get published?

1087
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:42,300
How many butts does it take to stick it up the biggest butt? Who is the biggest butt? Who has the biggest butt of all?

1088
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,640
Is a big butt best, or a tight little butt?

1089
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:47,460
The littlest butt is the biggest butt.

1090
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,920
Butt on Christmas, Ma told us of the littlest butt.

1091
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,060
Clean butt, stanky butt, sweet butt, sour butt, sour puss dictator.

1092
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,220
Butt, butt, butt, butt, butt, butt, butt.

1093
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,280
You guys are alike, beyond the butt.

1094
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:12,800
When all the other organs of the body argued and bitched and carried on, about who was the most vital, the most necessary, the most important of all,

1095
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,540
until it was obvious that all the bullshit was gonna back up on him.

1096
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:21,120
If they didn't pay their own issues, the butt, the butt, the butt, the butt, the butt, the butt, the butt, the butt.

1097
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,100
The butt out!

1098
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,580
The butt head.

1099
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,560
May I butt in you, butt body?

1100
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,540
Can a busy body be as busy as a butt?

1101
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,460
Are you a butt?

1102
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,240
Do you even have a butt?

1103
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,520
Keep those buttocks.

1104
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,340
Butt, butt, butt, butt, butt, butt, split.

1105
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,800
The butt song by Walls of Genius, dear friends.

1106
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,340
Walls of Genius, the genius of little Theodore.

1107
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,760
Heard in that song, baby.

1108
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,060
A little baby fist. Are you giving ready to be one?

1109
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,060
Or are they coming out anyway?

1110
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,560
That's something that's kind of hard to...

1111
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,320
I think what we need to do is...

1112
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,400
What we've got here is a brand new incantation.

1113
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,240
We've got three heads with us.

1114
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:14,860
There should be two.

1115
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:18,360
And you are ready to join a special class.

1116
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,100
A very special class of motantos and erectoids.

1117
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:22,960
Well, that's it.

1118
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,260
Until next week, keep your hat on tight.

1119
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,760
You're back to the wind. You're sacking the saddle.

1120
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,460
Well...

1121
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:30,640
Chasmodelia!

1122
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,200
Listen to this.

1123
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:38,120
Do you know what's going to happen at 8.02 p.m. on my birthday, February 20th?

1124
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,320
I think that the...

1125
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:39,320


1126
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,980
The gronk will come to try to eat your foot.

1127
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,180
Time itself...

1128
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,280
As we know it.

1129
00:49:45,280 --> 00:50:00,220
As we know it, will be more symmetrical looking on a digital readout than it's ever been since 10.01, August 10th, the year 1001.

1130
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:01,420
1001.

1131
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,600
Yes, that's the last time that time has been this symmetrical.

1132
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:09,320
Because at 8.02 p.m. in military time, it will be 20.01.

1133
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:09,620
20.02.

1134
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,920
22.02.

1135
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,040
On the 20th day of the 02 month.

1136
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:15,900
Wow.

1137
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,620
The year 2002.

1138
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:27,160
Now, when we like to talk about synchronistic events in human development, we notice some of the less developed humans have a...

1139
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,300
Well, it looks like some sort of cranial draining device there.

1140
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:36,120
And that's sure to keep all of the bad thoughts flowing out instead of backing.

1141
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,520
That is just too true.

1142
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,260
I move you by a little bit.

1143
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:46,480
And we notice one of the mutants dancing here actually has three pork chops hanging from her navel.

1144
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,420
See, Einstein's secret orchestra.

1145
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,120
This is the part of the...

1146
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,260
Impersonate Britney Spears live on stage.

1147
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,420
...freaks and freaks and I'm saying...

1148
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,500
We're doing it. We're doing it. Oops, I did it again.

1149
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:01,060
The groups on the outside are the real...

1150
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,820
I'm gonna be bringing up videos like, man, all kinds of new subgenius video the likes of which nobody has ever seen.

1151
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,300
Dave and I and the whole ESO, we all have our steps down.

1152
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,720
For baby, baby...

1153
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:10,720


1154
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,500
Oops, you think I'm in love, that I came from above.

1155
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,520
Wow, are you gonna do the main singing or Dave?

1156
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,000
Yeah, we're gonna do it all.

1157
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,820
Who's gonna be the main vamp?

1158
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,440
I'm sure Dave will be following.

1159
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,460
I follow no one but my own leadership.

1160
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,500
Chaz is gonna be wearing the thing in his belly button.

1161
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,220
So this is Britney Spears. I've never heard of Britney Spears before.

1162
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,080
And it's a USO show.

1163
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,800
This is pretty good.

1164
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,340
I could dance to this. It's gonna be...

1165
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:45,580
Well, she's not bad for a 12-year-old girl with those hirsutism pills and the glandular development kind of thing.

1166
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:53,680
Oh, I saw pictures of her in my favorite newspaper, the National Enquirer. Without makeup, she's just a...you wouldn't look twice at her.

1167
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,300
It's showbiz, baby.

1168
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:55,720
No, I know.

1169
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,400
You know, showbiz is a beautiful thing.

1170
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,420
I know, without makeup, Britney's like a pig.

1171
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:07,040
Just plain ordinary...well, no, she's just a very ordinary looking young woman. Nothing especially sexy about her.

1172
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,060
Without the makeup.

1173
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,120
I like it sped up more.

1174
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,480
I like it sped up more.

1175
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,720
I like it sped up more.

1176
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,960
I like it sped up more.

1177
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:13,300
I like it sped up more.

1178
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,980
You know what you want.

1179
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,600
You know what you want.

1180
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:15,640
You know what you want.

1181
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,700
Put it at plus 12.7, man.

1182
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,160
You gots to have it.

1183
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,080
You know, so you know, say that beep beep beep.

1184
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:33,140
So despite my having to accept that our geographical distances have left me sometimes feeling isolated to a greater degree than I choose, I can also say that I'm damn pleased to be tangentially involved with a group that has never really let me down, and boy, is that a rare impression.

1185
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,020
It's been like a 55-gallon dome of astroglide in a reality show.

1186
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,020


1187
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,020


1188
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,900
I'm not the otherwise often devoted to carefully pouring grit into my rubbers.

1189
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:49,440
Now can you say any of that good stuff about any job you've held or even your own damn family after a 19-year span like my own intermittent affiliation with the Bob world?

1190
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,060
Bet you can't.

1191
00:52:51,940 --> 00:53:05,680
Yeah, sure, I'd love to have flying saucers come down here at Bushwood and kill off the multiple weasels, smirklers, yuppies, drunks, food tubes, glorbititious, and other upright crap sacks of pinkdom crapping on this otherwise rather nice planet as they haul my popish ass off to sub-Nirvana.

1192
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,000
But there's no way I can do that.

1193
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:12,920
So if you're into that kind of thing, even though I can always use some more of them kind of pills, I figure I'm getting a pretty damn good deal.

1194
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,660
My love goes with you. Praise Bob.

1195
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,600
Hooray!

1196
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,760
Ladies and gentlemen, help up Huey!

1197
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:35,300
When they write their first check to the Subgenius Foundation, that's when their luck begins to change, their finances improve, and that kind of thing.

1198
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:40,420
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere.

1199
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,060
Where are you leading us, Bob?

1200
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,060
Is he?

1201
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,560
And where is Bob leading them?

1202
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,520
Right now it acts like it's gonna make me rich.

1203
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,320
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere.

1204
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,380
Kelly Lane, Channel 4 News, Dallas.

1205
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,900
As the song says, different strokes for different folks.

1206
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,620
Doug's been standing out in the sun too long, I think.

1207
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:12,960
Throughout his long, 50-week-long career,

1208
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:20,680
Lord Greystomp performed many operations and experiments on the children he was given through the chutes shown here and here.

1209
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:25,980
These are now national monuments to those who have gone before and came after.

1210
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,240
As we look skyward, the planes are flying.

1211
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,380
Almost in such close formation, there is no sky left.

1212
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,700
The world is truly a barbed wire paradise.

1213
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,420
For you and I are one with the machine.

1214
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,460
Chaz, what's the historical significance of that music you were just playing?

1215
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:01,180
It's Nazi-era marching music.

1216
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,060
It had that...

1217
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,920
...kind of ring to it.

1218
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,440
Maybe we want to have a beer and just go hang out with the guys, most of them...

1219
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,560
...of most of the late and hard searches.

1220
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,720
We're putting our spurs on. We gotta be riding off.

1221
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,500
Turn them on the inside out, you know, so we can see ourselves around.

1222
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,460
I noticed you changed the sign-off music, Chaz.

1223
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,160
Uh, well, because things are not good, I guess, you know.

1224
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,300
The wounded are coming in finally, Stan. Didn't you know?

1225
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,360
Do you mean if it's life-death, it doesn't...to be or not to be, what the hell's the difference?

1226
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,900
Yeah, well, why ask me, man?

1227
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:31,560
Hey.

1228
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,700
Why ask, why ask, why ask, why ask, why?

1229
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,580
Well, Stang, the Stompers are coming in, man.

1230
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,900
Losing card, I'll someday lay.

1231
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,440
The body bags are landing in Virginia, you know.

1232
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,360
By themselves now, we got the new ones.

1233
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,360
They fly on their own power.

1234
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,240
You just put the postmark on there and the address and...

1235
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,500
...they're back in your own hometown graveyard.

1236
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,700
How do you think they get the 50,000-year-old guano smuggled in and the moon water, man?

1237
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,300
Yep.

1238
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:53,960
Comes in on the body bags.

1239
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,760
The company's always on the job.

1240
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:58,060
Yep.

1241
00:55:59,480 --> 00:55:59,920
Well.

1242
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,760
I hope, uh...

1243
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,000
I don't hope anything.

1244
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,600
Yeah, we're hopeless, man.

1245
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,740
Well, I thought you said you hope they all sign up and join the military and ship out and...

1246
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,240
...so we can get the good-paying web jobs.

1247
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,160
That's like having sex with three women at a time, though.

1248
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,160
They keep giving to these snot-nosed kids.

1249
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,860
It's just a fantasy, you know.

1250
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,260
We know they'll want to go away.

1251
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:20,860
And their girlfriends.

1252
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,360
Yeah.

1253
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,280
I mean, there's practical parts of this, too.

1254
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:24,900
Yeah, right.

1255
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,600
There's gonna be a lot of young ladies left behind when those boys all sign up.

1256
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:29,600


1257
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,060
Lots of women for Coco Pelo to inseminate.

1258
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:33,380
Go off to fight the evil doers.

1259
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,300
Evil, uh...

1260
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,220
What is it?

1261
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,840
The triad of evil?

1262
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,080
Those who are charged too much for gas.

1263
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,040
The new axis of evil, yeah.

1264
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,480
Axis of evil doers.

1265
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,080
Whose doers are always in a chill class.

1266
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:46,380
There you go.

1267
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,500
Is it to be or not to be?

1268
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,020
And I reply, why the fuck ask me, man?

1269
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,080
Get out of my face.

1270
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,580
And it's time for all of our last questions.

1271
00:56:59,580 --> 00:56:59,580


1272
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,360
All faces to go back to whence it came from.

1273
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,480
That's right.

1274
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,420
The dump behind Grandma's house.

1275
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,920
The place we all sprang out of.

1276
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,480
Let's spring all the way back.

1277
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,080
Back.

1278
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:14,220
Yeah.

1279
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,200
Yeah.

1280
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,880
You can do the same thing, if you please.

1281
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,620
Till next week.

1282
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,880
Keep your hat on tight.

1283
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,100
You're back to the wind.

1284
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,840
And you're sacking a saddle.

1285
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,420
March 15th.

1286
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,780
Go on and get an over with, then.

1287
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,400
Divivaled.

1288
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,180
March 15th.

1289
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,920
Peachland Ballroom.

1290
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,560
And up the hill.

1291
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,500
We'll go on and get it over with, then.

1292
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:32,920
Sign up.

1293
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,000
Oh, yes.

1294
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:48,060
And you can also write for free information from the Church of the Subgenius about anything

1295
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:48,840
you've heard tonight.

1296
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:55,980
Actually, the easiest thing to do is simply email yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang at

1297
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:59,560
Stang at Subgenius.com.

1298
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1299
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1300
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1301
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1302
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1303
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1304
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1305
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1306
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1307
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1308
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1309
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1310
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1311
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1312
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1313
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1314
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1315
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1316
00:57:59,560 --> 00:57:59,560


1317
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:07,700
And it's so calm at www.subgenius.com.

1318
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:14,420
It's also calm at our sacred post office box in Cleveland Heights, once you can get free

1319
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,120
information printed-wise.

1320
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:27,740
And that box number, of course, is at post office box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio,

1321
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,540
417.

1322
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:29,540


1323
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:29,540


1324
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:29,540


1325
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:29,540


1326
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:29,540


1327
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:40,980
Again, that Cleveland address to send me tapes and CDs for this syndicated show would be

1328
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,820
Reverend Stang or Hour of Slack.

1329
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,060
Just Stang.

1330
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:56,880
Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1331
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,520
Oh, my God.

1332
00:58:59,520 --> 00:58:59,520


1333
00:58:59,520 --> 00:58:59,520


1334
00:58:59,520 --> 00:58:59,520


1335
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,240
And now this.

1336
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,920
Give me the box.

1337
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:07,920
Give me the box.

1338
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:08,940
Give me the box.

1339
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:09,900
Give me the box.

1340
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,300
Prowlios!

1341
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:12,740
Prowlios!

1342
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:13,520
Prowlios!

1343
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:21,860
One look at them will tell you more than a thousand words of mine.

1344
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,760
Sire, there is no more money.

1345
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,240
We gotta get some money.

1346
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:29,420
That dirty Purgish archipelago!

1347
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:29,500
Oh, no!

1348
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,800
That black and rotten, filibuster-burton, perkaluma-burton, dirty, wuss-knight!

1349
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,440
Oh, no!

1350
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:41,380
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners

1351
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:45,300
have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1352
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:50,400
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1353
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:58,340
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should

1354
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:04,920
go to subgenius.com, front page or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

1355
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,220
and help out financially as best you can.

1356
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:14,600
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses

1357
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,240
to make their own situations worse.

1358
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,220
But some of you still have jobs.

1359
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,860
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month, from enough of

1360
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,080
you.

1361
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,500
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1362
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:36,620
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay

1363
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,300
Dobbs.

1364
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:44,460
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation, P.O.

1365
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:54,080
Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1366
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,060
Subgenius.com.

1367
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:00,480
A thanks for anything you can do to help Let There Be Slack.

1368
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,380
M requesting direct themselves

1369
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:04,380


1370
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,600
Man 4

1371
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,760
Hands

1372
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:10,760


1373
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,920
led by

1374
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:11,920


1375
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:11,920


1376
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,380
over

1377
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,760
Free pills!

1378
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,560
Yes, bloody far!

1379
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,640
Free pills!

1380
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,960
Kill me!
