1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
What is God good for?

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,300
Call now and I'll rush you a free tape.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,520
That's what we can count on God for.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,680
A free tape.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,900
No. No.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,120
Yes. He did it.

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,460
He did it.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,020
God is a content

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:36,020
By which we measure

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,620
Our pain

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,060
I'll say it again

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,920
God is a content

13
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,100
By which we measure

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,420
Our pain

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,180
Yeah. Pain. Yeah.

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,200
I don't believe in magic

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,140
I don't believe in I Ching

18
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:32,120
I don't believe in Bible

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,480
I don't believe in talent

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,440
I don't believe in and I'll say it again

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:43,440


22
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:50,700
I don't believe in Hitler I don't believe in Jesus

23
00:01:50,700 --> 00:02:03,240
I don't believe in Kennedy I don't believe in Putin

24
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,940
I don't believe in

25
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,480
I don't believe in Maitreya I don't believe in Gita

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,740
I don't believe in Yoga

27
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:27,820
I don't believe in Kings

28
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,220
I don't believe in ideas

29
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,220


30
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,220


31
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,220


32
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,220


33
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,220


34
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,220


35
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,220


36
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,220


37
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,040
I don't believe in Elvis

38
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,540
I don't believe in Zimmerman

39
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,560
I don't believe in Beatles

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,780
I just believe in me

41
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,600
Local me

42
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,220
That's reality

43
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,320
The dream is over

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,700
What can I say?

45
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,360
The dream is over

46
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,460
Yesterday

47
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,020
Yesterday

48
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:35,900
I was the dream we found

49
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,660
But now I'm not born

50
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:48,280
I was the walrus

51
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,280
But now I'm John

52
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,600
And so dear friends

53
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,960
We'll just have to carry on

54
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,020
The dream is over

55
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,460
But dear friends, somebody else is just starting up

56
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,440
Look!

57
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,400
I know who it is!

58
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,060
I know who it is that doesn't belong among us!

59
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,060
I swear I know who it is!

60
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,860
It's...

61
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,720
It's...

62
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,980
The Self Genius Hour of Swag

63
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,300
Well that's not true!

64
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,600
S is for the suckers that live all around

65
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,000
U is for us, they're always putting us down

66
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,260
B is for Bob, he gives us our bread

67
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,020
G is for the guns they put to your head

68
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,040
E is for the eunuchs they want you to become

69
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,560
N is for the nuts they wish they had some

70
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,440
I is for that eye in the back of my head

71
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,880
U is for you, they wanna see you dead

72
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,480
S is for the shit that's all around

73
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,320
I'm a subtenuous motherfucker!

74
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,200
And I ain't no fucking clown!

75
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,320
In order to rule the world

76
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,980
You must first conquer it

77
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,740
Only on those bold terms

78
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,860
Can this total war

79
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,940
Result in total victory

80
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,260
Well don't you think it's a little late?

81
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,740
No

82
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,320
Well I do

83
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,680
I don't give a damn

84
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:01,960
Dead center

85
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,540
Yes, liberty reigns

86
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,560
I can't stand things that frighten me

87
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,700
That don't make any sense

88
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,080
Come on, let's get out of my brain

89
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,060
Yes, that's the right brain that was actually originated for people who were tired of pointing swords

90
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,300
The healing after Jesus was originated for your right brain

91
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:17,660
That's true

92
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,760
He's in a little can and we open him every 45 minutes

93
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,920
Now he's just squeaking

94
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,400
Be scary, call him

95
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,580
Stand back, stand back, okay

96
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,800
I was steering the ship toward the left

97
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,760
And you won't be able to

98
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,900
Now look out the window

99
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,580
See little people there?

100
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:27,920
See them?

101
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,980
No, stop

102
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,980
They're actually not people

103
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,100
They're a bad genius

104
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,300
They're there to scare you

105
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,000
They're in the human scrapyard

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,540
Please, if you're coughing all over your speakers

107
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,380
You're saying we've gotta clean it up here at the station

108
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,960
It is true there is a thing here I do not understand

109
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,180
There is a pain between my ears

110
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,800
For those who don't understand

111
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,040
Perhaps they're always on the short poopy end of the stick

112
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,740
Yes, the short poopy end of the stick

113
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,280
There's a lot of short doggy poop around to put on the stick

114
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,140
But if you want to live like a real man or woman

115
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,760
You must, you must

116
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:15,900
It is later than you think

117
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,860
It's later than you think

118
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,880
It is later than you think

119
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,740
It is too hard

120
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,060
Than you

121
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,160
As chimpanzees are to humans

122
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,580
Humans are to us

123
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,260
Oh, hello

124
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,780
You're improving, Jack

125
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,980
You just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty in you

126
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,260
The one that ruined you was that damned Indian old Titi

127
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,240
You mean Olaskin

128
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,560
He gave you a vision of moral honor

129
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,880
And a vision of the order in the universe

130
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,760
And there isn't any

131
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,360
Those stars twinkle in a void, dear boy

132
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,600
And the two-legged creature schemes and dreams beneath them

133
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,060
All in vain

134
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,080
All in vain, Jack

135
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,680
Did you hear anything?

136
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,820
Listen to me

137
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,040
Two-legged creature won't believe anything

138
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,740
And the more preposterous the better

139
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,740
Whales speak French at the bottom of the sea

140
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,740
The horses of Arabia have silver wings

141
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,580
Pygmies mate with elephants in darkest Africa

142
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,180
I have sold all those propositions

143
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,820
And they were all fools and none of it matters

144
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,280
I slowly

145
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,400
Take theтоes

146
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,400


147
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:07,040
Now I've made the поверь

148
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,740
All my Andrea

149
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,640
Know내

150
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,580
Don'tNeack

151
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,680
I watched the world from an alien place

152
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,120
From a desert plain so far away

153
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,960
I hear the sound of the starlit night

154
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,760
Of an angel's song in a billion lights

155
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,620
Your world of people has no place for me

156
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,120
I've read the plea from an insane king

157
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,940
Your world of people suffocates me

158
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,980
It prisons me, it drowns me in ice

159
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,300
I watched the world from an alien place

160
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,040
From the tides of time and the shores of space

161
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,600
I stumble onward in a fever dream

162
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,500
In a landscape of lies, shaking a silent scream

163
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,440
Your world of people has no place for me

164
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,940
I've read the plea from an insane king

165
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,620
Awaken world, a little man

166
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,900
Of hatred, deeds, and evil

167
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,740
I watch the world from an alien place

168
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:11,500
Your world of people has no place for me

169
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,760
I watched the world from an alien place

170
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,400
From a desert plain so far away

171
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,280
I hear the sound of the starlit night

172
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,740
Of an angel's song in a billion lights

173
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:49,740


174
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,040
Your world of people has no place for me

175
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,840
I've read the plea from an insane king

176
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,320
Awaken world, a little man

177
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,920
Of hatred, deeds, and evil

178
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:19,740
I've read the world from an insane king

179
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,740
Awaken world, a little man

180
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:19,720
Of hatred, deeds, and evil

181
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,980
We're transforming this life

182
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,200
Asки and Sa

183
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,540
mosu

184
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,980
women, and these so-called culture.

185
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,760
But barbaric sinners think nothing of having their little bundles from God

186
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,940
hacked to pieces and flushed.

187
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,460
Never mind that God says thou shalt not kill, Exodus 20, 13.

188
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,780
Sinners have taken the matter into their own hands.

189
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,980
But remember, God holds the final trump card.

190
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,260
The judgment.

191
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,500
Revelation 20, verses 11 and 15.

192
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,560
10.

193
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,300
Mercy killers are also on the ascendancy in America.

194
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,100
They are progressive abortionists who have become hard to killing

195
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,420
and now wish to include the mommies and daddies along with their babies.

196
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,660
The honor of my father and mother getting God's command in Exodus 20, 12

197
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,700
interferes with it.

198
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,320
Their responsibility is so great.

199
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,560
The world does not know.

200
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,380
These six words must be related to Hitler.

201
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,380
My proclaiming fairy tales are both such thinking and planning exerts.

202
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,240
You be the judge.

203
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,940
You be the judge.

204
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,280
You be the judge.

205
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
You be the judge.

206
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,700
So.

207
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,640
There you go.

208
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,160
That's like.

209
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,900
Doctors watching.

210
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,800
Right now.

211
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,580
What does this mean?

212
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,100
Here, wait.

213
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,020
You got to put your headphones on, Dave.

214
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,640
That one.

215
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,480
No, Warden, it's not in my booty.

216
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,220
You be the judge.

217
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:12,580
No.

218
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,520
You be the judge.

219
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,100
But.

220
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,040
You be the judge.

221
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,860
You be the judge.

222
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,620
You be the judge.

223
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,860
You be the judge.

224
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,180
You be the judge today.

225
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:22,920
But.

226
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,920
Judge tomorrow.

227
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,260
Compulsory death for all.

228
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,920
Compulsory death for all.

229
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,640
That's why the kids.

230
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,320
Oh, no.

231
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,280
Oh, God.

232
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,580
The problem with them TV preachers.

233
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,820
That's the problem with using your teeth for the needle on the turntable, man.

234
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,180
What makes people think they can flunk God's rules and end up in eternal bliss?

235
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,160
Flunk God's rules?

236
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:48,700
Yes.

237
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,500
What makes people think they can do that, Dave?

238
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,460
I don't know.

239
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,880
Flunking is easy, but flapping is harder.

240
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,040
Who do we think we are?

241
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,980
Who do we think we are?

242
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,300
I got away with it so far.

243
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,180
I got away with it because Bob gave me something to get me off.

244
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,400
I got away with it.

245
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,180
Bob got me off.

246
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,640
And I got away with it.

247
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,460
I got away with dogs.

248
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,800
I got away with old ladies.

249
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,920
You got away with the bitches.

250
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,060
I got away with barbers with one eye.

251
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,060
I got away with three people's hands.

252
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,460
I got away with men who think they're Jesus Christ.

253
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,740
Then our brazen disregard of God's laws will be judged.

254
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,720
Revelation 22.15 declares,

255
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,360
Outside of heaven are dogs, sorcerers, whoremongers, murderers, idolaters, and whosoever loveth.

256
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,960
These are all the people from the lodge.

257
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,800
The dogmongers and the whores and stuff.

258
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,240
The day of the Lord is at hand.

259
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,880
And he shall come like a thief in the night.

260
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,340
Or he shall come somewhere or another.

261
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,820
The Lord cometh and the Lord goeth.

262
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,820
Come unto me, Bud.

263
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,560
This is your sugar daddy.

264
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,460
From his cat.

265
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,300
In the ever-loving great beyond.

266
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,100
So prick your ears up.

267
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,360
And be quick like to respond.

268
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,280
Cause daddy ain't too happy.

269
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,080
None too happy.

270
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,280
What did I ever create you for?

271
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,660
You ain't done nothing.

272
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,640
But make your daddy so.

273
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,260
It looks like evolution's no solution.

274
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,220
You just keep falling ever further behind.

275
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,300
You may be tanned and clean-shaven.

276
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,900
But ain't with little bit of hair in time.

277
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,200
Big hairy situation.

278
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,920
Every nation.

279
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,700
About to bring your daddy to his knees.

280
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,440
I just keep crying.

281
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,500
These people please.

282
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,080
You damn dirty apes.

283
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,140
What the hell are you doing?

284
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,080
You damn dirty apes.

285
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,840
Look at what.

286
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,660
You have done.

287
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,760
You damn dirty apes.

288
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,000
Who do you think you have been for days?

289
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,700
Cause I'm gonna catch you.

290
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,980
Gonna catch you.

291
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,100
Every one of you.

292
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,680
You damn dirty apes.

293
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:18,680


294
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:18,680


295
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:18,680


296
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:18,680


297
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,020
Gonna catch you now.

298
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,440
At the end of the mor.

299
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:38,600
Ready separately.

300
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:38,600


301
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:38,600


302
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,760
Based on palette and char,

303
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:39,760


304
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,160
for being you.

305
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,180
I thank you.

306
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:40,960
All thanks and a hundred Columbia.

307
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:40,960


308
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,240
Or.

309
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,240
guitar solo

310
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,820
Earthquakes, floods, and lightning

311
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,420
Very frightening

312
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:18,180
Oh, but that's just a little nervous twitch

313
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,740
But I'll be getting medieval

314
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,440
If you keep treating me like your bitch

315
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,960
So get yourself together

316
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,900
Now or never

317
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,620
Oh

318
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:38,800
Oh

319
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,460
All you need's a little self-esteem

320
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,500
To turn this nightmare

321
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,080
Into a sweet, sweet dream

322
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,860
You damn dirty ape

323
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,040
What the hell

324
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,400
Are you doing?

325
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,180
You damn dirty ape

326
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,160
Look at what

327
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,580
You have done

328
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,320
You damn dirty ape

329
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,240
Who do you think you have been

330
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,000
To win?

331
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,740
Cause I'm gonna get you

332
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,980
Gonna get you

333
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,980
Every one

334
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,940
I'm gonna get you

335
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,060
Get you every one

336
00:21:51,420 --> 00:22:07,560
I'm gonna get you every one

337
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:14,760
And they are at this website, www.drexelent.com.

338
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,700
Drexelent.com.

339
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,100
That's D-R-E-X-E-L-L-E-N-T.

340
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,640
And now back to, well, some Lemur-ish cut-up collages,

341
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:35,160
puzzling evidences, howling over men, lonesome cowboys, and Chaz right here.

342
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,420
This is the night of the Holy Land.

343
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,000
So there's been all this talk in science.

344
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,580
Let's talk science for a minute.

345
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,620
Well, can I ask you one question, kind of a scientific question?

346
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,220
What?

347
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,520
Is it true that you've heard that there is a dangerous sorcerer or a demon,

348
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,940
perhaps it speaks from Dick Cheney's navel?

349
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,020
Really?

350
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,640
I don't think that's scientific.

351
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,480
Well, I don't think it is either.

352
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,180
I think it sounds like superstition.

353
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,240
It couldn't possibly be true.

354
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,280
It has nothing to do with it.

355
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,500
It sounds like an urban legend.

356
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,200
Oh, yeah, that's not science.

357
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,120
That's pseudoscience.

358
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,860
That's false science.

359
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,360
Okay.

360
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,460
But now scientists are pretty convinced that,

361
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,820
we're talking all about this lately.

362
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,160
The day of the Lord is at hand.

363
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:24,960
They're pretty convinced that we need to deprovincialize ourselves one step further.

364
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,100
And we thought that this universe was the only one,

365
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:34,560
and it turns out that they're pretty convinced that there's just multitudes of varied universes all existing.

366
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,520
They're real convinced of that, huh?

367
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,360
Well, if dogs.

368
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,880
If dogs can have multiple orgasms,

369
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,760
why can't we have multiple universes?

370
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,220
Mathematically.

371
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,220


372
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,820
So have you ever done the math with your slide rule and your calculator?

373
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,880
No, but I'm open to whatever.

374
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,380
You know, people come up with just as valid as anything I come across anywhere else.

375
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,280
That might as well be.

376
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,600
Well, yeah, and you know as well as I do that for all you know,

377
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,800
all that math that they keep talking about.

378
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,720
It's not real math.

379
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,400
It might as well be the same as the totem pole that some medicine man tells everybody to worship.

380
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Maybe, but it's the best bet we got.

381
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,720
Well, it's an invasion.

382
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,340
I mean, it's a lettuce.

383
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:07,520
It's a lettuce.

384
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,320
It's farther than any of those other things have.

385
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:09,760
It's more like a money.

386
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,420
It took us to the moon.

387
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,720
We have probes going all over the universe.

388
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,400
What telephone poles have taken us to the moon, Larry?

389
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,280
I've been to the moon.

390
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,440
Not on a telephone pole.

391
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,420
Not the way you're talking about.

392
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,020
Yeah.

393
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:25,500
And I don't see no weird like eagles or thunderbirds on top of any ladder of numbers.

394
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,560
We're building a space station that got, you know, science.

395
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,440
You know, we understand a lot about a lot of things, DNA.

396
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:36,060
Well, Hitler almost built a science station with the world of fire and ice.

397
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,260
It's a lot farther than all the other.

398
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,800
You know.

399
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,520
Religions.

400
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,580
But Hitler built, almost built a science with fire and ice.

401
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,260
You've actually gotten things out of it.

402
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,280
Science is the most exacting religion.

403
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,840
They don't know what I'm talking about.

404
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,500
No.

405
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,680
The theory of fire and ice.

406
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,720
Hitler's theory of science was totally whacked out, and yet he produced all this weird.

407
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,820
Well, he didn't produce anything.

408
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,800
Well, they had the best Nazi flying saucers in the whole hollow earth.

409
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,940
Well, they believed in all this anti-grav stuff, but, you know, it didn't have any.

410
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,080
And they came out with that movie, Ilsa, She-Wolf of the SS.

411
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,000
Well, that was pure science right there.

412
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,000
For the CIA.

413
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,540
Now.

414
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,500
Who does?

415
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,260
Spelso?

416
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,980
Where are all those Nazi sonnets, dude?

417
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,660
No, they're on their 90s now.

418
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,400
I think they're too old unless they're taking Islan.

419
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,040
Amazing.

420
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,460
Islan?

421
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,280
Islan.

422
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:17,920
Islan.

423
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:18,980
Islan.

424
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,340
Islan.

425
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:19,580
Islan.

426
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:19,800
Islan.

427
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:19,800


428
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:19,800


429
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:19,800


430
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,580
Your island paradise on the moon.

431
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,600
Attended to your every wish by a Nazi scientist from the year Zip.

432
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:33,080
Here's Klaus Friedrich, an early inventor of the U2, preparing to offer you a jelly donut.

433
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:33,780
Ah.

434
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,740
And here's you.

435
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,220
What?

436
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:41,340
Spending over a log in the hot sun as Ilsa, the She-Wolf of the SS, hands you her slide

437
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:41,640
roll.

438
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,660
God will make you his jelly donut.

439
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,100
And he has to.

440
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,180
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution, anything is

441
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,020
likely to develop.

442
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,400
Enter the Church of the Subgenius, filling itself as the weirdest cult on earth.

443
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,200
Like the one that's in the middle of the world.

444
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,200


445
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,200


446
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,760
What do they believe in?

447
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,880
Everything.

448
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,440
Who do they believe in?

449
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,020
A mysterious character named Bob.

450
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:17,980
Bob.

451
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,800
Bob.

452
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,340
Bob.

453
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,460
Bob.

454
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:26,740
Bob.

455
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,040
Bob.

456
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,580
Bob.

457
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:27,820
Bob.

458
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,680
Bob.

459
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:28,680


460
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:28,980
Bob.

461
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,100
Bob.

462
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,140
Bob.

463
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,140


464
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,140


465
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,460
Bob.

466
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:29,520
Bob.

467
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,880
Bob.

468
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:31,880


469
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,620
Bob.

470
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:35,720
Bob.

471
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:35,720


472
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:35,720


473
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:35,720


474
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:35,720


475
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:35,720


476
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:35,720


477
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:35,720


478
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,620
Bob is what will bring to, that's the plan of Earth.

479
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,580
And to you young man.

480
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,820
And to you if you will send a dollar.

481
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,360
If you send a dollar.

482
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,420
Another more.

483
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,520
Whether ocasional.

484
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,260
This is a church that does not play games.

485
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,360
And join the Church of the subgenious.

486
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,060
Genetic engineers working in secret laboratories.

487
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,360
You are going to relax.

488
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,120
Bob does not have body like Steel.

489
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,580
No, he doesn't even have a body.

490
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,200
He's still a head.

491
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,920
Yea, verily, for Bob should be praised.

492
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,400
He is being praised.

493
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,740
This is how we praise Bob.

494
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,560
This is how we polish Bob's mind.

495
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,340
This is the way we worship our Bob.

496
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,880
We take care of Bob like no one else.

497
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,340
Repeat after me.

498
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,520
No, you repeat after me.

499
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,380
Bob is ice.

500
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,700
Bob appears and Bob is light.

501
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,660
Bob is nice.

502
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,200
You know, just saying it doesn't make it so.

503
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,300
Bob is not nice.

504
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,440
Yea, verily.

505
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,140
Yea, verily.

506
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,780
I know, if Bob's looking in the window, are you the servant that opens it so he can piss in?

507
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,480
Weep no more.

508
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,280
Onions will no longer provoke tears.

509
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,740
I only know about it because I had to seek out the magic towel that night.

510
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,260
For Bob has arisen.

511
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Well, you shouldn't have.

512
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,740
You should have been able to contain yourself.

513
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,560
Again and again and again.

514
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,580
It makes me want to go to Grandview Camping Center and watch.

515
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:04,780
Bob has arisen.

516
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,040
Bob never was.

517
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,720
He never goes down.

518
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,360
Sitting there by...

519
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,580
Really?

520
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,820
Bob is always up.

521
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,720
He's always up.

522
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,020
Always up, dude.

523
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,700
He never has to seek out the adult catalogs that other subgeniuses do.

524
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,820
And you must receive slack in Bob.

525
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,380
Those subgeniuses, too cheap to get on their own computer, must seek out...

526
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,640
Hey, now, you be nice to your little phone people.

527
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,900
Tiny little catalog.

528
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,600
At 848-4425-4520.

529
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,860
520.

530
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,280
520 man is mounted and moving.

531
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,980
No, let's not get dirty here.

532
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,740
Bob is...

533
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,360
Massively large, huge, erect collections.

534
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,660
Yes, indeed.

535
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,640
Moving toward bridge.

536
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,100
Oh, he's away from the bridge.

537
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,640
Don't worry about it.

538
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,980
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it, Puzz-lean.

539
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:54,480
For the Puzzling Evidence Show, friends, and plus clips from the subgenius album Bad Doctors,

540
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:03,320
such as the song Mysterious Character named Bob by the great DK Jones, and now Half Man,

541
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,280
Half Biscuit.

542
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:14,480
Seriously, the following is a song by Half Man, Half Biscuit called 99% of Gargoyles Look Like Bob.

543
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,880
.

544
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,180
.

545
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,700
Jesus Christ, come on down.

546
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:33,700
.

547
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,220
.

548
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,260
.

549
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,360
.

550
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:43,380
.

551
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:43,400
.

552
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:43,420
.

553
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:43,440
.

554
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:43,460
.

555
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:43,460


556
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:43,460


557
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,180
.

558
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:01,740
.

559
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,500
Equilateral chainsaw

560
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,340
In debt I owe someone a fiver

561
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,680
Maybe I should try my hand at slag

562
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,260
James Dean was just a careless driver

563
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:32,580
And Marilyn Monroe was just a drag

564
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,620
99% of gargoyles look like bobtards

565
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,260
99% of gargoyles look like bobtards

566
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,260
99% of gargoyles look like bobtards

567
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:02,340
99% of gargoyles look like bobtards

568
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,520
Mary had a little lamb

569
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,860
The doctors were astounded

570
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,060
Everywhere she went

571
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,620
Gynaecologists surrounded

572
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,900
They've been cooking on Blue Peter now

573
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,100
They're sampling the dishes

574
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,320
I don't normally like tomatoes, John

575
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,300
But this is delicious

576
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:54,060
99% of gargoyles look like bobtards

577
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:59,400
99% of gargoyles look like bobtards

578
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,660
99% of gargoyles look like bobtards

579
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,800
99% of gargoyles look like bobtards

580
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:09,980
99% of gargoyles look like bobtards

581
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,560
Take me home

582
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:24,040
The son of Jimmy Clithero is showing off his skills

583
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040


584
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040


585
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,880
He's shouting out

586
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,080
Where's my fur in chain?

587
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,020
The son of Jimmy Clithero is showing off his skills

588
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,020


589
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,020


590
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,020


591
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,020


592
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,560
He's shouting out

593
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,500
Where's my fur in chain?

594
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,940
Richard Li είe

595
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,260
I'm running guys

596
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:10,600
And my hand is just not enough

597
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:17,620
Richard Li shooter

598
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,940
Where's my fur on me?

599
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,020


600
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,000
Put it on

601
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


602
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


603
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


604
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


605
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


606
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


607
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


608
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


609
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000


610
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,140
Thank you.

611
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,660
Don't tell me you're the future.

612
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,460
You'll be lucky to catch on at the phone company.

613
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,340
Your parents up there, you know what I'm talking about.

614
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,320
20, 25 years ago, they were telling us, you are the future.

615
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,440
You kids want to see the future?

616
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,320
Look at your folks.

617
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,300
Fat butts, saggy tits, beer, television, that's the future.

618
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,740
Look at me, I'm supposed to be a big success.

619
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,680
I built taco stands for a living.

620
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,220
What kind of bullshit future is that?

621
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,580
You got any sense?

622
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,980
Give them back their damn diplomas.

623
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,220
Give them back their silly fucking hats and stay 18 for the rest of your life.

624
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,340
You don't want to be the future.

625
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,420
No, no.

626
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,500
Forget the future.

627
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,300
The future sucks.

628
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,500
There he was.

629
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,960
Big as life.

630
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,400
Right there at the foot of my bed.

631
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,420
Jesus.

632
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,200
And he looked me straight in the eye and he said,

633
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,140
Want a drink?

634
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,340
There's more to love than just fornicating.

635
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,100
Sure, that's like eyes in the back of your head.

636
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,620
These mud-gobbling giant worms, which live on the edge of volcanic vents,

637
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,340
gorging themselves on massive huge piles of mud.

638
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,980
Just like those terrariums.

639
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,400
Just like the bacteria.

640
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,840
Just like the ones in Dune.

641
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,760
Only this mud is wet.

642
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,480
Biologists frequently say tiny worm.

643
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,760
This is truly wet mud.

644
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,800
Not like the kind of mud we used to have back when we were kids.

645
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,780
It was dry mud.

646
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,740
We used to have to make mud pies and to make them stick together we had to spit on them.

647
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,740
We'd like have dirt in one hand and a big pile of spit in the other hand and we'd like

648
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,940
roll them together until we had us a good mud pie.

649
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,580
Yeah.

650
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,820
And that was the only thing we had for moisture.

651
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:53,980
Yeah.

652
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,000
We had to take a bag of sugar back in those days.

653
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,640
Just spit.

654
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,660
Injecting worms with lab-made...

655
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,540
We didn't have candy back then either.

656
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:07,340
We had to just take a bag of sugar and carry it around a big old five pound bag of sugar

657
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,280
in our back pocket.

658
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,320
A big old tablespoon.

659
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,060
And when we needed some candy, we just stuck it into the bag and just took about four or

660
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:20,560
five big tablespoons, shoveled it down and that was all we had for candy back in those days.

661
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,540
Each one genetically engineered to make a different...

662
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:23,620
The show.

663
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,500
R.N.A.

664
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:24,980
All music.

665
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,520
Now when a worm dines on one of these babies...

666
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,200
You gotta have...

667
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,820
Those worms have to have lads to see underground when they're eating through the dirt like

668
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,040
that.

669
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:42,000
They carry little miner's helmets that let them mine through the dirt.

670
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,700
They're chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing.

671
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,660
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.

672
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,880
They chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away,

673
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:48,880


674
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,520
Oh, I can't see where I'm going, said Mr. Worm.

675
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,960
And he looked ahead and he had his little pointed knife.

676
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:53,960


677
00:36:53,980 --> 00:37:01,920
He had his little yellow helmet on shining the way into the back of the goose, as it

678
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,160
were.

679
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,760
The pterodactyl...

680
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
The end of the goose.

681
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,500
...was a Cretaceous flying reptile.

682
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,480
Flying...

683
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,000
They thought it was a reptile, but actually it was a bird.

684
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,580
Although its wings spread and it shaved more than 27 feet.

685
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:13,720
It was a bird.

686
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,500
They found that it was only a simple bird.

687
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,840
It was a bird-like reptile.

688
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,820
Its body was only the size of a goose.

689
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,460
And yet its wings were 900 feet wide.

690
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:23,960
It was a bird.

691
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


692
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


693
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


694
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


695
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


696
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


697
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


698
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,960


699
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,320
It was a bird, yeah.

700
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,880
I mean, it was a bird.

701
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,760
We're talking about an entire century.

702
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,660
I'm not sure that it's a bird, but I'm not sure that it is a bird.

703
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:32,660


704
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:32,660


705
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:32,660


706
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:32,660


707
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:32,660


708
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:32,660


709
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:32,660


710
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:32,660


711
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:32,660


712
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:32,660


713
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:32,660


714
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,680
It's the Twinkie Bike.

715
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,500
Oh, well, it's a.

716
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,460
It's the widest proportion.

717
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,860
27 feet.

718
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,740
Or 30, actually.

719
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,240
Where's Bozo?

720
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,760
They asked me about Twinkies on my show, and they asked what the ingredients were.

721
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:55,240
Of course, all I could tell them was golden sponge cake and creamy fillings.

722
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,120
That's all you need to know.

723
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,020
You don't need to know anything more.

724
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,000
That is all on Earth you know and all you need.

725
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,760
We'll enter that in the computer.

726
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,080
Golden life.

727
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,340
That's good enough for Thor.

728
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,140
That's good enough for me.

729
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,500
The United States of Sponge.

730
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,340
Creamy, soft, whipped.

731
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,660
Yes, little caller, you have won the United States of Sponge.

732
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,260
Throwing everywhere in the valley.

733
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:23,940
As we continue to look for your requested songs, squeezing the commercial songs of the United States of Sponge.

734
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:28,060
Within the confines of its donut-like home.

735
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,100
Is it a bird?

736
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,560
No!

737
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,860
Is it a plane?

738
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,220
No!

739
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,780
Oh my gosh, it's my name, I'm Brian.

740
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,780
The way I hide.

741
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,140
The way I hide.

742
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,000
The way I wait all the way.

743
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,780
The way I hide.

744
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,320
Oh!

745
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,320
Is it a bird?

746
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,560
No!

747
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,840
Is it a plane?

748
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,220
No!

749
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,780
Oh my gosh, it's my name, I'm Brian.

750
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,720
The way I hide.

751
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,120
The way I hide.

752
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,900
The way I hide.

753
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,800
The way I wait all the way.

754
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,200
The way I hide.

755
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,140
The way I wait all the way.

756
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,000
The Way I play.

757
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,020
The Flat Dog Singers and now Limur.

758
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,000
Now you listen to this!

759
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,180
Can I still have my dog?

760
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:30,460
No!

761
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,920
Oh no! Please!

762
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,420
Oh my gosh!

763
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,380
Hey, Boggs!

764
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,140
I have a special report on the camps to make to the Ministry of Education.

765
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,040
For the children.

766
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,760
Tally-tally!

767
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,000
You get 152 hits.

768
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,720
It may sound silly to you, but...

769
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,260
Something bothering you, boy?

770
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,660
Nuclear death.

771
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,820
Oh, God!

772
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,140
Oh!

773
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:35,820
Oh!

774
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,640
Okay.

775
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:44,100
And I take it this place, this Mabel Street, is not unique by no means.

776
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,620
While we were in Italy, this woman walked up to my friend and threw my friend a baby.

777
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,660
And when my friend caught the woman's baby,

778
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,700
her other kids ran up and took what was in my friend's...

779
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,040
pocket.

780
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,500
So, um...

781
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,180
Let that be a tip for you, you know, if you're ever in Italy and, uh...

782
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,640
Someone throws you a baby,

783
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,220
swat it to the ground.

784
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,820
Swat it to the ground and scream,

785
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,920
I don't think so!

786
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,340
I'm just trying to take a bite out of crime.

787
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,200
The Lord took...

788
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,400
took the child.

789
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,980
He died a horrible death.

790
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,460
The awfulness...

791
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:35,700
The awfulness...

792
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:35,700


793
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,000
of it...

794
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,760
staggers the imagination.

795
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,420
We're going to be using this corpse for a demonstration of placement.

796
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,700
And she looked at me and said...

797
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,820
She's dead.

798
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,160
I said, what do you mean?

799
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,820
She said...

800
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,240
She...

801
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,200
She...

802
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,340
No, Sid.

803
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,060
I said, I went out of my mind.

804
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,080
And she looked at me and said...

805
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,680
I went...

806
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,560
to see...

807
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,200
the others.

808
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,320
And she said...

809
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,300
You don't have to be afraid of him.

810
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,240
That's all there is to it.

811
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,620
Rew, rew.

812
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,040
Rew, rew.

813
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,280
Ah!

814
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,300
Now I can't take it anymore!

815
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,200
Friends, are you going to let this happen?

816
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,280
Are you just going to sit by and watch this corpse rot?

817
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,220
Are you going to scrub its buttocks with a dog?

818
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,860
And apply mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to this rotting corpse in his WCSV?

819
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,680
Which do you want?

820
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,040
Prefer?

821
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:50,040
Don't you want to get down there and apply the kiss of life?

822
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,760
You guys are worthless.

823
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,440
I know we are.

824
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:52,840
Get out of here.

825
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,980
Don't you want to...

826
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,400
Get out of my radio station.

827
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,400
Let's go.

828
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:57,920
I'm going home.

829
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,160
Man, we cannot get one lousy carnivution.

830
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,860
My friends, I was in the spirit.

831
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,200
And Bob said to me, Sid, I'm going to have to call you home right now.

832
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,800
I'm Reverend Stangen.

833
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,740
I don't think he meant home to Texas.

834
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:07,920
How about?

835
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,660
I think he meant home to heaven.

836
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,220
A beautiful home away from heaven.

837
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,540
If he says because it's the only way to send a signal to these people because they don't

838
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,160
seem to believe.

839
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:16,360
Look it.

840
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:16,660
There's the gate.

841
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,680
You can travel there on a signal.

842
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,700
I'm being called home, friends.

843
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,480
A beam of light.

844
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,580
Bob's calling me up.

845
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:28,660
Now I see the rocking chair of eternal slack up there on that beautiful cloud.

846
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,220
Oh, yes.

847
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:29,560
Why, look.

848
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:30,900
There's...

849
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,840
Oh, yes, brother.

850
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,580
Look at how beautiful it is.

851
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,940
There's beautiful creatures of the desired sex.

852
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,180
Oh, yes.

853
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:35,180


854
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:35,180


855
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,000
And the sky is gyrating around the heavenly excremeditation throne.

856
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,520
And then just when you're in the gate, you thought you were in the gate in the heaven.

857
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:51,880
You made the ultimate mistake.

858
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,560
You didn't call 68769.

859
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,440
Oh, you could have.

860
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,580
That's the funny thing about it.

861
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,360
You could have at any minute.

862
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,500
Your family's thinking about it now.

863
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,380
Even after the ship is gone.

864
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,560
Oh, if you only would have sent his contribution.

865
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,120
You could have.

866
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,320
You could have had a coffee mug.

867
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,000
A beautiful logo shirt on.

868
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,580
Maybe for a new Twitter account.

869
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,460
But you blew it.

870
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,460
You fool.

871
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,280
Man, you totally blew it.

872
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,160
God, I can't believe what a geek.

873
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:26,120
How could anybody totally, totally, totally, utterly, utterly...

874
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,840
Well, all I remember was he had a chance to get one of those warm sweatshirts on.

875
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,640
And you were warned.

876
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,000
You were told, don't blow it.

877
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,920
Don't mess up.

878
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,160
And you messed up.

879
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,160


880
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,160


881
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:42,480
Because you didn't call 6900 in the 216 area code.

882
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,560
Oh, man.

883
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,720
Did you blow it, dude?

884
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:46,860
So that sweatshirt.

885
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,240
No, no, you didn't get that either.

886
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,820
And so he told...

887
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:55,300
Well, you know, and the 6900, the number itself you will get if you're not having sex and

888
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,940
you don't have anybody loving you lately.

889
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,720
If you just call that number 6900, 6900, because it's like, that's it.

890
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,160
It's synergy.

891
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,220
No, no.

892
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,100
Because 69ing is like...

893
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:05,140
It means belly button.

894
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:05,140


895
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,300
Yeah, 69, we each get something out of it.

896
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:08,960
You know what I mean?

897
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,100
Like it's an old...

898
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,020
Oh, there it is again.

899
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:12,360
Here they come.

900
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,380
Here they come again.

901
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,060
Oh, bleeding straight in the ass.

902
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,780
Oh, they drove us out.

903
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,500
There they go.

904
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,120
They never come around for long.

905
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:19,940
We don't want to touch you.

906
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,400
We want to rub your little round belly, listener.

907
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,180
We want to reach out with our fingers over these hair waifus.

908
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:30,100
We want to reach out with our fist and bust you in the face if you don't call.

909
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,760
We want to fist you, my dear friend.

910
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,940
We're going to fist you right in the face.

911
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:35,120
I tell you what, I don't want to do that.

912
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,120


913
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,120


914
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,120


915
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,400
You smell your feet from all the way across the escheleta.

916
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,720
Vino, vi-vi-vino.

917
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:46,400
Yes, I believe that Jesus Christ is a succulent, delicious, flavorful, juicy, tender son of

918
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,060
God the Messiah.

919
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,580
And I'll tell you what, because I was that desperate.

920
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,440
And this other male, he's being stimulated by the mating activity and he wants to have

921
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:55,820
a go too.

922
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,380
Oh, that's so sweet.

923
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,580
Oh, that's so sweet.

924
00:45:59,580 --> 00:45:59,580


925
00:45:59,580 --> 00:45:59,580


926
00:45:59,580 --> 00:45:59,940
Oh, that's so sweet.

927
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,540
Oh, that's so sweet.

928
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:01,800
Oh, that's so sweet.

929
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,960
Oh, that's so sweet.

930
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,900
Oh, that's so sweet.

931
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,340
And everybody knows that.

932
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:08,880
Varusia Control speaking.

933
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:09,800
Go ahead.

934
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,180
We have a rhino.

935
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,520
Anything else?

936
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,180
He's bleeding pretty badly.

937
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,300
Anything else?

938
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,360
No, that's all.

939
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,320
I saw these guys.

940
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,980
A roller rink.

941
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,320
I saw the, um...

942
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,280
Who is this now, the Flat Yorn Angels?

943
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,980
It's, um...

944
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,300
Andy in the Walls.

945
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:33,780
Dick Clark, Dick Clark.

946
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:34,840
Yeah, Andy in the Walls.

947
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,100
Andy, it's Andy.

948
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,100


949
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,100


950
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,100


951
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,100


952
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,100


953
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,100


954
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,100


955
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,100


956
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,100


957
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:42,160
I saw the plastic exploding bananas at a roller rink in Columbus, Ohio, when I was a sparse lad of nearly 58 years old.

958
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,720
I was wearing chicken shoes at the time, and Nico noticed me in the front row.

959
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,040
She waved and threw some barbiturates to me.

960
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:55,060
She also rubbed that hefty groin of hers with a large red Italian scarf.

961
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,540
I wonder what that meant.

962
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,200
You think that could mean anything?

963
00:46:59,500 --> 00:46:59,900
No, right.

964
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:03,280
Stop trying to see, you know, deep, hidden meanings in everything.

965
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,420
In what she does and everything, I guess.

966
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:05,820
Anything.

967
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,160
I guess I should stop.

968
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,680
Reality.

969
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,040
There is no reality.

970
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,060
No, I guess there is no.

971
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,860
I thought you were going to say all reality is interpretive, but you said there is no reality.

972
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:17,980
No, everything's relative.

973
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:18,360
Right.

974
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,480
We're not talking about Homeland Security or the black holes that could envelop us in a hundred billion years.

975
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,720
Who even knows which universe we're in at any given moment?

976
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:24,820
Right, right.

977
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,020
I mean, you know, right.

978
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,700
You know, you're here, you're there, you know.

979
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,420
Speak for yourself, man.

980
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,140
I am.

981
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,260
I'm stuck in the sand.

982
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,900
I've been in the same one this whole time.

983
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,880
Yeah, talk about strange.

984
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,580
I'm pretty sure of it.

985
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:42,660
Except for that one time when alternate universe man did his trick just to prove he could do it.

986
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:47,560
Attention!

987
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,640
Our next witness is Paul.

988
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,100
Oh.

989
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,040
R-O-T-S.

990
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:58,760
Thank you.

991
00:47:59,140 --> 00:47:59,560
Clueless.

992
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,360
And we look forward to your testimony, Mr. Miller.

993
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,080
Today's hearing is important.

994
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,340
To the office furniture industry for four reasons.

995
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:13,000
Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by saying thank you.

996
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,740
You took a leave of absence with three children and a wife and a girlfriend on the side.

997
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,820
Bless his little heart.

998
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,520
How did you afford a leave of absence?

999
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,020
Pretty drunk.

1000
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,620
Thank you, Mr. Donald DeRossi, who was established in 1927.

1001
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,100
Thank you.

1002
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,340
Thank you.

1003
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,320
I'm back at home.

1004
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,260
And so there they are.

1005
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,260
Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by saying Teletubby.

1006
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,840
Oh no, please.

1007
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,100
Eyes burning like coals.

1008
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,600
The bloodsucker affects me more.

1009
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,600
Holy catfish.

1010
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,300
That's awful.

1011
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:02,500
Hey.

1012
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,440
Where would my dad get rid of a body?

1013
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,320
There's just one little thing you're forgetting, college boy.

1014
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,300
You buried him too.

1015
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,420
That was funny.

1016
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,460
How you doing on time?

1017
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:33,960
That was funny.

1018
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:33,960


1019
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,100
I'm going to need a little more time.

1020
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,180
I will wrap up very quickly.

1021
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:35,580
Thank you.

1022
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,860
The purple dinosaur who has been called everything from refreshingly sweet to nauseatingly nerdy.

1023
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,680
Well once again, rule toddler TV.

1024
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,100
Menacing the Teletubbies.

1025
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,600
I believe that the Teletubbies are, their time is on this, they are definitely.

1026
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,040
Never seen them actually.

1027
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,300
Their days are numbered.

1028
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:01,320
They may as well put a fork in the Teletubbies once Barney hits the scene again.

1029
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:01,760
Did you see this subgenius?

1030
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,320
Hooded robe?

1031
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,860
Subgenius hooded robe?

1032
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,760
Clearly made to intimidate and impress and I'm guessing it dates 1980.

1033
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,420
What's its origin?

1034
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,460
The best item of its kind I've ever encountered.

1035
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,420
Unfortunately, we have no information identifying the subgenius.

1036
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,780
Robe is of excellent quality and thin black wool, 58 inches long from the neck, nine button

1037
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,740
front, buttons are silver colored.

1038
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,700
Permanently affixed to the neck is a 14 inch tall hood which comes to a point at the top

1039
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,740
rear and then goes 10 inches forward to its front.

1040
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:31,740


1041
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,860
Which falls the face mask with one size fits all.

1042
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,640
Wow.

1043
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,680
For the men that want something extra.

1044
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,380
At the top, the center of the hood, which would be at the top of the forehead is a white

1045
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:45,100
two and a half inch by two and three quarter inch embroidered Dobbs face.

1046
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,720
This is not amazingly boring stuff.

1047
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,860
This is the real thing.

1048
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,220
The bezel is amazing.

1049
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,640
Has wavy white embroidered edge.

1050
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,740
Yeah, this thing is on the back is a 12 inch high red inverted pipe.

1051
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,700
Does it have the flap in the back?

1052
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:57,920
With a white yarn flame.

1053
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,100
How much does it cost?

1054
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,580
That's the important thing.

1055
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,520
How much are they charging?

1056
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:01,740
It's $477.

1057
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:01,740


1058
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:01,740


1059
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:01,740


1060
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:01,740


1061
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:01,740


1062
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:01,740


1063
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:01,740


1064
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:06,040
Does it have the pyroflatulation flap in the back?

1065
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,080
But it may be so ancient that it would fall apart.

1066
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,100
It sounds like it's actually real.

1067
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,760
Because if you didn't have that flap and it cost $475, you could risk actually igniting

1068
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,060
it if you weren't careful.

1069
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,400
Yeah, from some secret society or order.

1070
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:21,900
Look at it.

1071
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,860
This piece of hood.

1072
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,720
With a skull and crossbones.

1073
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:30,380
He thinks they like him, but when the UFOs come, the ladies are going to kill everybody

1074
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,160
but me.

1075
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,380
Well, you know, of course they'll spare the righteous.

1076
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,060
That's what all subgeniuses think.

1077
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,880
I'm helping channel the thoughts of all subgeniuses onto the show.

1078
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,300
That means no one will be spared.

1079
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,240
And no one will call.

1080
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,620
They don't need to go to Brushwood.

1081
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,640
The saucers will come and pick them up wherever they are.

1082
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,500
They'll be instantly materialized.

1083
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,540
It'll be like a rapture of subgenia.

1084
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,840
Yes, thank you.

1085
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,120
This is right now.

1086
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,440
We're looking at a picture of all the subgeni sitting in their pretend first class seats

1087
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,240
on the space shuttles, ready to leave.

1088
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,720
Mysterious and threatening secret clan or society hooded rogue.

1089
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,980
I was just telling you, it's a subgenius rogue from the early 70s.

1090
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,840
Well, it certainly looks like a terrifying, intimidating.

1091
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:19,880
It does, it does.

1092
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,080
That's back when they used to paddle the pledges and all that stuff.

1093
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,500
Yeah, we used to make them run the gauntlet.

1094
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,360
The famous naked woman gauntlet.

1095
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,320
We used to run them through.

1096
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,000
They hated that.

1097
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,840
Those bobbies.

1098
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,020
They always hate stuff because they're nerds.

1099
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:35,480
They're nerds.

1100
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,260
And they're so competitive among themselves.

1101
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,960
That's what's so pathetic about it.

1102
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,000
They fight for the little place in the subgenius organization.

1103
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,180
Just because the average weight of each of those women was well beyond 300 pounds, that

1104
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,420
shouldn't have any effect on it if they were, you know.

1105
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,760
Or where Philo has worked for a million years.

1106
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,200
Thinkers.

1107
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,480
Thinkers.

1108
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,080
Thinkers from beyond the sun.

1109
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:54,380
The competitive world.

1110
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,280
On the backside of reality.

1111
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:57,980
Conspiracy biz.

1112
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:01,060
Forbidden fantasies that boil up in a...

1113
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:01,060


1114
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:01,060


1115
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:01,100
I don't know.

1116
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,100


1117
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,100


1118
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,100


1119
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,100


1120
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,100


1121
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,000
Drenched sunburst of fun and relaxation.

1122
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,060
Rest and relaxation at last.

1123
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,920
I don't feel relaxed.

1124
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,680
This show makes me all tense and itchy.

1125
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,800
From rest and sleep.

1126
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,180
Which...

1127
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:28,500
Yeah, you can earn money even while you sleep with our custom, sensual cyber brain pan turnkey

1128
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,100
operation website.

1129
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,080
And sooner or later.

1130
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,860
We'll hire our best men with thee to go.

1131
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:40,340
You will be on the cutting edge when you process those credit cards with 60% fulfillment.

1132
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:45,520
We need to start one of those websites with just our own DCDs on them.

1133
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,480
You must be 210 years...

1134
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,940
I would slave to kidnaps, wars, and desperate men.

1135
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,360
What do these spacemen want from us?

1136
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,940
I mean, what are we negotiating for?

1137
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,900
I mean, is it a good deal?

1138
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,620
Is that what you want to know?

1139
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,920
Yeah, I want to know.

1140
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,160
What, are you trying to second guess the negotiating team, Bob?

1141
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:04,600
Is that it?

1142
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,320
I just want to know if it's worth the trouble I'm going through.

1143
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,160
I don't want to waste my time if all we're going to get out of it is a few pictures of

1144
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,040
space or something.

1145
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,300
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.

1146
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,160
Here, write this down.

1147
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,140
All right.

1148
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,800
All life on earth is going to be dead in five years.

1149
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,900
Now, skip over to the other side and write this down.

1150
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:20,580
What's this?

1151
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,980
This is what they want.

1152
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:22,640
Just write it down.

1153
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:28,000
All the flowers, all the trees, all the little birdies.

1154
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,260
Oh, and all the children.

1155
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:30,600
That's it?

1156
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:30,600


1157
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:30,600


1158
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:30,600


1159
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:30,600


1160
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,000
Yep.

1161
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,740
Yeah, they're not as dedicated as we are, Bob.

1162
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,880
You know, they have no incentives, no motivation.

1163
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,840
What's this?

1164
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,200
It's a vinyl map to show us where we're going to pick them up.

1165
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,740
Well, we better not lose this.

1166
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,340
I'd say, Bob.

1167
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,580
I'll turn this story into a hurry if you don't mind.

1168
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:50,060
Stargate.

1169
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,140
One million forgotten BC.

1170
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:53,620
Monsters.

1171
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,320
Captain's Lord.

1172
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,940
Monsters have taken over the interface once again.

1173
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,580
And I and Mr. Stargate are going to be the first ones to get out of this.

1174
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:00,580


1175
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,900
Mr. Spook are helpless to do anything about it.

1176
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,500
Visitors are requested not to throw coffee into the basin.

1177
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,220
Irritating, Captain.

1178
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,960
The censors have eliminated all the blue passages from my sex novel.

1179
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,220
Still poking that big nose of yours and the things that concern you.

1180
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:16,620
Okay, caller.

1181
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,860
You fly Lieutenant Uhuru.

1182
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,280
That nose is quite large.

1183
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,600
I fail to see what the size of my nose has to do with the problem that we are facing

1184
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:23,740
now.

1185
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,800
You can be like the queen on Sex Planet.

1186
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,020
What is it about my nose that makes you constantly comment on its prodigious size?

1187
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:29,840
Do it.

1188
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,020
I'm going to do it.

1189
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,140
I'm going to do it.

1190
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:30,140


1191
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:30,140


1192
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:30,140


1193
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:30,200
I'm going to do it.

1194
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:30,860
I'm going to do it.

1195
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:30,860


1196
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,280
I never did watch Star Trek, so I don't know all the different characters.

1197
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,960
What is it about my nose that constantly brings great attention?

1198
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,380
Darth Vader was on it.

1199
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,200
Darth Vader was on Star Trek?

1200
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,080
Blast you, Spook.

1201
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:40,340
Cool, man.

1202
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:43,500
You know that your nose is in front to all decent Earth men?

1203
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:43,960
Weird.

1204
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:44,760
I'm picking up like...

1205
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,480
That's what you keep telling me.

1206
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,380
Are you out of your Vulcan mind, Spook?

1207
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,400
Oh, I get it.

1208
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,300
He doesn't have a mind, right?

1209
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:52,880
Is that the joke?

1210
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,420
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

1211
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,560
When the baby is done drinking, it must be unscrewed and laid in the basin.

1212
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:00,560


1213
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:00,560


1214
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:00,560


1215
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:00,560


1216
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,020
I'm going to put the baby in a cool place under a tap.

1217
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:02,880
If the baby does not thrive, I'll push Spook into the...

1218
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,100
This cheesy nut butter is the cause of the alien's antagonism.

1219
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:06,100


1220
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:06,460
You know, I'm sorry.

1221
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:06,900
I just...

1222
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,580
I think I just sat on the racist peanut butter cups.

1223
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,160
Boiled.

1224
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:10,200
Boiled.

1225
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,160
You did that on purpose.

1226
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,040
I saw you.

1227
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:12,500
Boiled.

1228
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,380
Just so I could have them all.

1229
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:14,840
I think you filled the racist peanut butter cups.

1230
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,980
Oh, he figured out my point.

1231
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,120
All right, all right.

1232
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:20,520
Yeah, yeah.

1233
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,360
Look at that.

1234
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,740
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na.

1235
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:24,560
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na.

1236
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:30,520
Da-na-na-na-na-na-na.

1237
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,440
I want to thấy the theme of my old movie, A Special

1238
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,280
Voyage to see what's on the bottom.

1239
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:32,540
Space.

1240
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,360
The final frontier.

1241
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,340
A bunch of old crafty stars pretending to go out in the ice

1242
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,280
of the Starship KPFA.

1243
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:47,440
It's continuing mission to boldly explore to smash-up the entire

1244
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:47,660
starогдаove.

1245
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:55,020
That's the monster that comes out and attacks the whole,

1246
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:55,680
ship.

1247
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,300
ật

1248
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,640
Gott

1249
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,460
what?

1250
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,280
What kind of ship is that?

1251
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,760
Every week there's a curtain out on the ship.

1252
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,960
It pitches and rolls.

1253
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,160
Everyone falls out of your seat.

1254
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,040
Here's a harder one.

1255
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:05,540
Oh!

1256
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,220
Oh!

1257
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1258
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,200
Hey, hey, hey.

1259
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,520
Hard is right.

1260
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,760
Oh, my seat.

1261
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:17,880
Well, friends, Dr. Howell and the show there on KPFA.

1262
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:21,760
Before that, a clip sent by the bishop.

1263
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:25,580
And tons of Lemurian collage.

1264
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:34,680
And remember, friends, you can always check out www.subgenius.com.

1265
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:42,440
Or you can write to me at post office box 181417.

1266
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,500
That's 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1267
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,680
44118.

1268
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,120
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.

1269
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:55,480
And now Christopher Hyatt with the late occult scholar.

1270
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,720
Israel Regardie.

1271
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,940
The guru hymn.

1272
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:05,960
This is a hymn dedicated to the grinning, giggling monkey guru.

1273
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,420
Now, this is bliss consciousness.

1274
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,600
Now, we have the roots of the tree.

1275
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,680
This is the trunk of the tree.

1276
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,300
These are the branches of the tree with the pretty leaves.

1277
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,680
Now, in order to get bliss consciousness,

1278
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,500
we must walk.

1279
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,980
This is the root of the tree.

1280
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:34,740
When the roots are watered, the bliss rises up the trunk of the tree into the branches

1281
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,020
of the tree into the leaves.

1282
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,840
When this happens, we have bliss consciousness.

1283
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,460
Now, bliss consciousness is something that your mother will approve of.

1284
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:51,280
Unlike sex and other sad things, this fits right on in with her.

1285
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,520
She loves bliss consciousness.

1286
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,560
Bliss consciousness.

1287
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:55,560


1288
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,740
Uh, pig.

1289
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:57,200
Pig.

1290
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,980
There is a happy land far, far away

1291
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:06,580
