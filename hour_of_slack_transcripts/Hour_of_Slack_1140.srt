1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,980
BAAA Bado

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:26,280
That's Boston another one more later

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:26,580
Aaaaah

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,540
The first rule is...

5
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,480
Obey all rules!

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,140
Philosophical dogma of doing mischief.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,960
Women, truth. Woman, evil.

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,600
What then?

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,980
Dogma, dogma, dogma, audacious dogma lies on the ground.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,820
Gasp.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,980
Very, very, very unseemly seriousness.

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,340
Seriously.

13
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,120
The genius power of the savage.

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,100
Woman, devil, dragon.

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,380
The genius power of the savage.

16
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,420
Now listen to this.

17
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,780
And here he is.

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,720
Bob.

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,880
Bob.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,620
Thank you very, very much, ladies and gentlemen.

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,380
Here I am again.

22
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,340
Yes, here I am.

23
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,140
Personally, I don't believe in superstition.

24
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,680
But here in Los Angeles, ladies and gentlemen, we've just had a census taken.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,160
I really shouldn't have said that because there's no better place to go.

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,180
Remember how the early wagon trains fought the Indians?

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,880
That's a well-dressed octopus.

28
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,840
He has an unlisted wife.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,680
And they're all sun worshippers there.

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,880
When you're ready to go, they just put you on a bus for Pasadena.

31
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,680
There is an endless supply of white men.

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,540
But there always has been a limited number of human beings.

33
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,780
Oh, there be players that I have seen play and heard others praise and that highly.

34
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:29,660
Not to speak it profanely, that having neither the accent of Christians nor the gait of pagan Christian nor Christian.

35
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:29,660


36
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:29,660


37
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,760
But the poor man have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought that some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well.

38
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,720
They imitated humanity so abominably.

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,380
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.

40
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,520
Oh, reform it altogether?

41
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,180
And let those that play your clown speak no more than is set down for them.

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,180
For there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some barren quantity of spectators to laugh to.

43
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,240
Though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered.

44
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,020
That's villainous.

45
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,640
And shows the most pitiful ambition in the fool that you are.

46
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,020
And loses it.

47
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,820
Do you know who Phil was gonna be with tonight?

48
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,180
No. No. I... I...

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,920
Sorry, Joe. I...

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,900
Uh, wait a minute.

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,120
Yeah?

52
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,020
Look! A bunch of dirty plates.

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,180
Okay, Eve, honey. Be right over.

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,880
No. No. I pushed the accelerators to the floor.

55
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,060
Well, thanks.

56
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:26,940
Huh?

57
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,780
N-n-nothing.

58
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:29,880
Okay.

59
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,980
I turned the key off.

60
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:32,780
Hm.

61
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,780
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,160
Huh? Huh?

63
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:07,380
Huh?

64
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,080
Huh?

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,480
Huh?

66
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:29,520
Huh?

67
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:29,560
Huh?

68
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:29,600
Huh?

69
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,720
Huh?

70
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,500
Huh?

71
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:41,600
Huh?

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:41,980
Huh?

73
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,760
Huh?

74
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,000
Huh?

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,560
Huh?

76
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,920
Huh?

77
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,040
Huh?

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,040


79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,040


80
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,880
Huh?

81
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,660
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

82
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,860
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

83
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:36,540
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

84
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,220
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

85
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,120
Diagnostic report.

86
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,540
All systems go.

87
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,740
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

88
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,900
Process of elimination.

89
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,960
Filling power over federal communication.

90
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,320
Centralizing. Sterilizing.

91
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Compensating censorship through methods of intimidation.

92
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,500
Barbers on constant.

93
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,320
Retreatment serials without express consent.

94
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,460
Duplication.

95
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,540
Great revision.

96
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,780
Out of labor and violation of our spectral management.

97
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,040
You've been investigated.

98
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,340
Over the mission, your position has been triangulated.

99
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,680
Demilitated.

100
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,180
And implicated.

101
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,760
In this moment in ship, we've been convicted by a novel agent.

102
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:47,400
We can save planet Earth by counters 우리 selurling .

103
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,360
Moving away from Earth known as our planet.

104
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:51,980
Everything transformed.

105
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:51,980


106
00:06:51,980 --> 00:07:00,300
When Taman can say my wish.

107
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,580
Mos Giganicus did that dear friends

108
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,600
from

109
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,700
moesgiganticus.com

110
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,040
Thanks so much to

111
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,280
Reverend Brainerd for turning us on

112
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,580
to Moes Giganticus.

113
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,540
And our openings

114
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,800
were by William Shakespeare,

115
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,180
Little Big Man, and

116
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,180
Fernanda Nande, Lee Murr.

117
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,840
The Anything for a Laugh

118
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,220
trio.

119
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,940
Those openings were for

120
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,040
Hour of Slack number

121
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,540
1140,

122
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,160
which this is.

123
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,740
Not a live show this time,

124
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,480
but one composed of

125
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,160
once live shows.

126
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,440
We especially

127
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,620
concentrate tonight on not

128
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,560
thinking. Thanks to

129
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,280
John Hell's show,

130
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,440
A Season in Hell,

131
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,360
on Pirate Cat

132
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,700
Radio in San Francisco.

133
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,840
Seen here.

134
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,360
There's a worldwide

135
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,780
shortage of helium.

136
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,280
The Earth is running out.

137
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,240
A worldwide shortage of helium.

138
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,040
At the party supply store,

139
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,060
they assured me.

140
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,200
Second most abundant element in the universe.

141
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,920
Then we're in deep shit.

142
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,340
We should have brought some church air.

143
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,420
Absolutely no shortage of helium.

144
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Is there a shortage of nitrous?

145
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,400
And you probably believe that

146
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,940
on the show, yeah, there was supposed to be

147
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,360
church air.

148
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,800
Yes. I heard that they've

149
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
been mining for helium.

150
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,760
I heard some astronomer was going to do that.

151
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,360
Mining for helium and 30 Chinese

152
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,340
got trapped in a cave-in

153
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,380
mining for helium.

154
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,960
And boy, did their voices sound funny.

155
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,280
Yes, they died.

156
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,340
They screamed.

157
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,120
Think of the joy of the boys and girls with their balloons.

158
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,600
I have a new

159
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,380
bag of balloons that I can

160
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,600
donate to the cause.

161
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,500
Hey, can the car go fetch

162
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,060
that tank of gas and

163
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,980
take some hits?

164
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,020
Balloons and not a gray one

165
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,640
to be seen.

166
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,640
Because there's a world

167
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,380
wide shortage.

168
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,060
By the way, do you know where helium comes from?

169
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,440
Have we gone through the peak helium

170
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,020
phase?

171
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,520
From the sun.

172
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,160
Helium has finally occurred.

173
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,240
See, so there is becoming a shortage.

174
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,200
There's lots of helium,

175
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,640
however, remaining.

176
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,380
I want you to know that my household has one of the

177
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,760
largest helium footprints on the planet.

178
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,380
People are hoarding

179
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,060
the helium.

180
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,380
Helium hoarder.

181
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,300
I understand you rub elbows

182
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,340
with the hydrogen.

183
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:55,780


184
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:02,040
And the gold magnets, but only the pyrite magnets.

185
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,080
The pyrite magnets.

186
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:03,580


187
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,540
Well, I don't want to brag, but we have some of the

188
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,940
squeakiest voices around.

189
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,860
It's true.

190
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,980
Just in time for that new Elvin and the Chipmunks movie.

191
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,120
Let's not go there.

192
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,460
I understand you made a lot of money off of that.

193
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,960
Selling that helium at that top price.

194
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,020
Yes.

195
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,740
You know how much it takes to fill an entire Hollywood

196
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,820
town stage with helium?

197
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm sure you'll tell us.

198
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,680
Even if we don't want to know.

199
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,960
No, it's not even funny.

200
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,140
No, move on.

201
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,160
I wasn't laughing, really.

202
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:30,780
It is funny.

203
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,120
Move on.

204
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,300
But I really want to know what's going on.

205
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,900
Well, it's a curious thing.

206
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,020
Professor Cavour found that the selenites couldn't get a hold of helium, so they were

207
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,720
unable to duplicate the substance on the outside of his sphere.

208
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:53,240
But now we know that in the lunar regolith, there's that strange mystery substance, helium-3.

209
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,260
Helium-3.

210
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:54,900
Yes.

211
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,860
It's produced by a constant bombardment of solar cosmic rays.

212
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,540
And so isn't that where helium comes from?

213
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,020
From the fiery heart of the sun himself?

214
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,700
Well, I would like to actually attribute it more to something called fusion.

215
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,500
But not con-fusion.

216
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,020
It happens naturally.

217
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,600
The new Stanford laser testing of nuclear weapons is reputed to be a possible

218
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,540
source of a controlled fusion reaction.

219
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,660
Comments?

220
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,640
True.

221
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,640
True?

222
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,820
You'll actually endorse that?

223
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,700
No, it's not really true.

224
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:41,060
It would not be the most expeditious way to fusion, to fuse hydrogen into helium.

225
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,820
It's in little tiny teensy amounts.

226
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,420
Those things are so small, they'd fit in an HO train car.

227
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,320
This is becoming as exciting as a Pete Goldie talk at Ask Dr. Hell Show.

228
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,680
What's your name?

229
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,820
Katherine Hepburn.

230
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,560
I see.

231
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,020
Well, thanks, ma'am.

232
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,900
I'm sorry I bothered you.

233
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,540
Yeah, but maybe, maybe, maybe, hey, that's good thinking.

234
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,540
I'll give odds against that.

235
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,400
Yeah.

236
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,620
Yeah.

237
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,380
What are you guys doing to me?

238
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

239
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,620
We're talking about the

240
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,680
So genius.

241
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,380
Power of the force.

242
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,400
That you and somebody else pulled yesterday.

243
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,700
No.

244
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,500
Yes.

245
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,500
He said we'd get married, go to Europe.

246
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:24,660
No.

247
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:24,660


248
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,240
We're going to Europe next year.

249
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,480
You'll all go someplace next year, but it won't be Europe.

250
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,900
Well, that winds it up just in time, too.

251
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,620
It's getting dark.

252
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,940
We have to be going.

253
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,440
Merry Christmas.

254
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:39,580
Guaranteed.

255
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,100
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, located in your body.

256
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:43,660
Wow.

257
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,380
Mm-hmm.

258
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,880
What, what, what, what, where are you located in my body?

259
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,920
Toward the back of your body, around your waistline.

260
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,560
Bob, the great creator.

261
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,140
Bob, the great creator.

262
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,080
Rap, rap, rap, rap.

263
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,640
You will not be able to get away from me.

264
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:54,640


265
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:54,640


266
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:54,640


267
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:54,640


268
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,180
You will not hurt me.

269
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,020
Oh, that's great.

270
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,040
All your blood passes through my partner and me, kids.

271
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,760
Chemicals swimming in it.

272
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,720
He's super.

273
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,040
Big vein, don't you?

274
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,040
You've got it, glob.

275
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,020
Boy, that really shows how great glob the creator is.

276
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,120
All of my blood?

277
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,980
Every drop of it, Bob, Bob.

278
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,440
Too much, too much, stop.

279
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:14,920
Oh, oh.

280
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,240
Beating.

281
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,580
Yes.

282
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:15,960
Beating.

283
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,240
Yes.

284
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,560
Beating.

285
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:16,980
Yes.

286
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,120
But, but, but, but too much salt in my bloodstream.

287
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,940
Spaghetti-o.

288
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,660
Take the X.

289
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,480
Take the X.

290
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:21,660
X.

291
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,040
X.

292
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,280
X.

293
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,280
Wow, wow.

294
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,800
Thick asses.

295
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,360
Pump the thick gooey stuff.

296
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,160
Stop.

297
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,640
Stop.

298
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,580
This is the right time.

299
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,220
S. S. S.

300
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,100
You have the responsibility to perform.

301
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,100
Keep talking.

302
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,200
It's hard.

303
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:35,900
Solidifies.

304
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,480
It merges.

305
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,480
They feel like, they feel like, they feel like, they feel like, largest coal.

306
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,120
You know, your majesty, Terry.

307
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,360
Status quo.

308
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,520
Kids got on airplanes.

309
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,520
Kids got on airplanes.

310
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,700
They feel like, and these are ideologues, by the way.

311
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,440
Status quo.

312
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,400
You give people their rights.

313
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,080
Look, I know I've been accused of being a war monger, a war monger.

314
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,400
I don't see any alternative.

315
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,480
People will know.

316
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,140
What can you do?

317
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,800
Murder the innocent.

318
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,980
I believe it is a part of a larger campaign.

319
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,960
Bush wants to fight Muslims.

320
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,980
Bush wants to fight Muslims.

321
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,580
Bush wants to fight Muslims.

322
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,800
Muslims.

323
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,700
Wants to fight Bush.

324
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,840
Muslims.

325
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
Wants to fight Bush.

326
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,500
Therefore.

327
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,920
Bush wants to fight.

328
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,760
fight Muslims. You view me as

329
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,940
a warmonger and I view myself as a warmonger

330
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,860
and what's in me? Just isolated

331
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,300
incidences. Democracy

332
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,040
is not possible. Quite bumpy.

333
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,040
I really do. Your poll? Your poll?

334
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,960
Bush wants to fight

335
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,460
Muslims.

336
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,100
Why am I supposed to go in the fetal

337
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,340
position because of your poll?

338
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,520
Poll, poll, poll, poll, poll, poll,

339
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,680
poll, poll, poll, poll, poll,

340
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,660
poll, poll, poll, poll, poll,

341
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,800
poll, poll, poll, poll, poll, poll.

342
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,420
Thanks be unto

343
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,960
Reverend Norell Preff

344
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,920
of Norellpreff.com

345
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,260
I'm not sure what the theme of this

346
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,220
particular episode is, but it

347
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,700
may be the conspiracy.

348
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,620
Is that what it was?

349
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,260
But maybe we should crack the window

350
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,420
and start seeing things in 12D.

351
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,080
I think you already have.

352
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,860
What's the church's stance

353
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,160
on the golden compass?

354
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,780
Hey, do you like Angelina Jolie?

355
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,380
I don't know that much about it myself.

356
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,720
The church usually doesn't have a stance.

357
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,920
Bob doesn't even know

358
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,880
what a stance is.

359
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,480
So it's hard to get official about that.

360
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,840
I understand that it's, uh,

361
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,420
the Catholics are all upset because it's a

362
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,500
thinly veiled criticism

363
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,600
of Catholicism.

364
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,940
The organized religion.

365
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,120
The Catholic church is a big power

366
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,340
in that alternate world. They call it the

367
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,200
magisterium.

368
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,260
Princess Wee, to whom I am

369
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,620
consort, has been feet-sending

370
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,520
those books to her nephews

371
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,820
here in San Francisco.

372
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,500
Spreading atheism, I guess.

373
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,700
Or something.

374
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,940
It said something like religion.

375
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,060
That was one of the greatest

376
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,680
disappointments of my life.

377
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,460
The book of the subgenius didn't say

378
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,140
religion up there in the corner.

379
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,500
I know, it says humor.

380
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,920
But we need that out, Puzzling.

381
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,860
As you well know,

382
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,560
we don't want to end up like...

383
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,020
But it would have been so perfect.

384
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,860
Just to see that word there.

385
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,980
Well, inside, of course, it says

386
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,960
we have to call this humor because look what

387
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,440
they did to our predecessors.

388
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,160
And, uh, unfortunately, every now

389
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,760
and then I have to take some poor

390
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,520
crazy, insane guy

391
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,000
aside and go, no, it really

392
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,740
does mean it's just humor,

393
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,840
okay? Leave Bob alone

394
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,620
and quit calling him. Leave him alone!

395
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,840
I've seen those websites

396
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,780
where they talk about, they

397
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,900
leave Ivan staying alone and the guy's crying.

398
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,940
Leave Ivan alone!

399
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,200
I know, it's heartbreaking. And then I do.

400
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,340
I always leave him alone because of those YouTube tapes.

401
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,900
Don't you know how hard he works? He works so hard

402
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,880
to spread the...

403
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,120
I do kids!

404
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,560
He lost his edge!

405
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,640
I thought that was a woman

406
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,000
the first time I saw that.

407
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,600
Now, how come they didn't have Britney Spears

408
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,580
play Grendel's mom?

409
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,260
Because I don't think she could have done it

410
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,020
as well.

411
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,080
You know, she's a monster

412
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,360
that people would actually want to

413
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,600
cohabit with.

414
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,020
Exactly.

415
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,460
And has the ability to shake.

416
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,620
Oh my God!

417
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,180
She's so beautiful, I would watch her now.

418
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,740
There's no tail?

419
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,840
You think she has a tentacle or a tail

420
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,940
but when you see the

421
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,620
back view, you'll see where that comes from.

422
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,880
No, no, please don't show me now.

423
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,180
I could not walk home

424
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,480
with the enormous...

425
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,480
By the wonders of the internet, there's pirated

426
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,860
or is that a trailer?

427
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,360
I can give you a...

428
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,140
It's a teaser.

429
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,300
I can give you a greater critique of it.

430
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,260
For a lot of the time, when they have those shots

431
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,420
that zoom through space, which no camera could do,

432
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,160
you start thinking, hmm, this is like a video game.

433
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,480
And whenever you see the character just sort of

434
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,500
running along and you see the running cycle,

435
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,600
that reminds you of some character in a video game.

436
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,900
But to be fair, there are a lot of times

437
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,160
watching that movie, you forget that it's all

438
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,840
entirely computer generated and it doesn't seem

439
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,660
like a video game.

440
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,120
So there.

441
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,000
Nice car.

442
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,780
That's the Duke.

443
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,400
Of course, eventually we'll find out

444
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,260
that we're all just computer generated.

445
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,540
How many movies have there been about that?

446
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,360
A lot, but it takes

447
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,760
high quality computers.

448
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,020
Anyway,

449
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,300
if you can only see one movie,

450
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,820
you should probably go to see The Mist

451
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,980
and wait to see...

452
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,440
Anyway, so much for movies.

453
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,240
I give it six thumbs up, four arms

454
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,740
and a leg.

455
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,720
You have another friend.

456
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,100
I have a friend.

457
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,260
A German.

458
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,300
A German friend.

459
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,380
I would mind seeing that.

460
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,460
She gets off on the sound of my Cadillac.

461
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,100
Wow.

462
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,740
And then what does she do?

463
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,660
She wants to ride in the backseat.

464
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,020
She wants to ride in the backseat of my Fleetwood.

465
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,600
That 78 Fleetwood out there.

466
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,760
She wants to lay down and just listen

467
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,480
to the sound of the car.

468
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,000
And she gets really squeaky in the backseat.

469
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,020
That new car sound.

470
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,480
Even though it's a 78.

471
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,100
I bet you get some great gas mileage

472
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,960
off that 78 Cadillac.

473
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,280
Five miles to the gallon.

474
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:14,880
Really?

475
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,100
It was eight.

476
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,640
It was eight.

477
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,160
It's not down.

478
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,020
It's a Cadillac from the 70s

479
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,040
that someone gave me

480
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,320
and I also got five miles to the gallon.

481
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,700
I don't know what to say.

482
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,040
Those were the days.

483
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,900
Body by Fleetwood.

484
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,240
I remember people,

485
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,760
those were 25 cent gallons.

486
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,440
Oh, yeah.

487
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,020
Absolutely.

488
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,580
I gave that Cadillac to somebody for Christmas

489
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,200
just like Elvis would do.

490
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,300
I'm like Elvis

491
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,720
because I could give a Cadillac away for Christmas.

492
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,140
Yeah.

493
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,640
And that guy gave it to a junkyard, I think.

494
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,160
I'm going to be my mother.

495
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,480
Off the land and off the land

496
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,280
and back on the top.

497
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,280
I'm going to be my mother.

498
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,080
You can get back in.

499
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,340
Back in.

500
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,700
Oh, it's getting too old.

501
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:50,980
Eat.

502
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,380
Eat.

503
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,580
Eat.

504
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,260
Get in CC.

505
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:52,960
All the no-go.

506
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,220
Piss her, miss.

507
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:53,900
All the no-go.

508
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,060
Piss her.

509
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,220
All the no-go.

510
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,320
Piss her.

511
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:54,780
All the no-go.

512
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,020
All the no-go.

513
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,200
All the no-go.

514
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,080
All the no-go.

515
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,340
Piss her, miss.

516
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:56,560
Piss her.

517
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:56,620
Piss her.

518
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:56,860
Get away.

519
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,240
Get away.

520
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:57,760
Black Bob Guy.

521
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,220
She's the best person.

522
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,720
Black Bob Guy.

523
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,200
She's the best person.

524
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,360
She's the best person.

525
00:19:59,360 --> 00:19:59,500
Drugs.

526
00:19:59,560 --> 00:19:59,720
Drugs.

527
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,420
Only $3.99.

528
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,380
In Hawaii, call 936-6666666667777

529
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,460
in order to avoid 6666.

530
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,120
In the White Desert today.

531
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,640
Freedom Rock 2.

532
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,320
Here's how to order.

533
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,420
You see here?

534
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,200
Scar over the left eye.

535
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,240
Scar over the right eye.

536
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:23,980
Yeah.

537
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,820
Look here.

538
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,800
You see the nose on this one?

539
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:27,840
Uh-huh.

540
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,840
See how meshed it is?

541
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,600
Uh-huh.

542
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,160
Uh-huh.

543
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,220
Look at the right ear.

544
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,940
I guess it's been broken

545
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,440
one time.

546
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:34,840
One time or another,

547
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,240
wouldn't you?

548
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:35,560
Yeah.

549
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,360
We couldn't come up

550
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,560
with any names for you,

551
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,840
but how better to be safe

552
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,020
to guess his line of work.

553
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,460
The Song Genius.

554
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,420
Our own song.

555
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,660
Rates, $2 a week and up.

556
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,720
I'll ring the bell.

557
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,000
Let's go.

558
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,000
You...

559
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,780
You mean you're blind?

560
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,100
Oh, no.

561
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,080
My eyes still see,

562
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,380
but my heart no longer receives it.

563
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,440
How did it happen?

564
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
White man.

565
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,180
Where's Buffalo?

566
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,440
Where's Buffalo?

567
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:34,440


568
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:34,440


569
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:34,620
Where's Buffalo?

570
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:36,700
Rubbed out.

571
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,660
And White Elk Woman, too.

572
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,600
And Dirt on the Nose.

573
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,780
And High Wolf.

574
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,020
And many others.

575
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,140
And Burns Red?

576
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,780
Yes.

577
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,360
Burns Red and the Son?

578
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,660
Rubbed out.

579
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,280
His wife.

580
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,660
His children.

581
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,260
And many more.

582
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,320
You see,

583
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:04,440
I'm not going to lie to you.

584
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:04,440


585
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:04,540
This man was a.

586
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:04,540


587
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:04,540


588
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:04,960
Do you hate him?

589
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,540
Do you have a child with him?

590
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,760
Yes, a child.

591
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,440
Do you hate him?

592
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,440


593
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,680
The.

594
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:13,680


595
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:13,680


596
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,100
He building high Ai.

597
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,460
Do you hate him?

598
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,900
Do you hate him?

599
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,800
He want him out?

600
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,120
For I want you to go home.

601
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,700
What I mean is,

602
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:23,960
first of all,

603
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,200
my son,

604
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,540
he was a man.

605
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,040
You wanted to take him to最后

606
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,420

00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:43,580

Suddenly, I realize how much I really care.

635
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:50,720
The memories have come alive since we have been together.

636
00:25:50,720 --> 00:26:00,460
The memories, still so strong, how could I live without you so long?

637
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:10,220
Suddenly, I realize how much I fear about you.

638
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,900
Suddenly, I realize how long I'll need you.

639
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:19,840
Thank you.

640
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:29,220
Have any of you church leaders ever been discriminated against because of your affiliation with the Church of Subgenius?

641
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,340
Great question.

642
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,320
Well...

643
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,100
There's a real...

644
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:40,640
Well, of course, constantly every subgenius is a product of the discrimination from the conspiracy of normal people.

645
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:50,220
The most severe situation I can think of recently was the case of the good Reverend Magdalene and Reverend Jesus.

646
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,620
Yes.

647
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,360
Who coincidentally happened to have been my business partners for several years.

648
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:08,180
Their child was taken away from them in a custody battle specifically because of their involvement in the Church of the Subgenius.

649
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:15,980
And it's a horrible legal battle that's still ongoing and has cost them $100,000 more than they have.

650
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,760
But currently, she...

651
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,540
They have the child because...

652
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,280
Because the biological dad screwed up so very badly.

653
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:39,360
But for two years, this kid was kept away from his mom simply because of some pictures seen on subgenius.com of the mom cavorting and wearing funny costumes at our X-Day show.

654
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,580
And mocking Jesus in a...

655
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:49,760
Just the fact that they were photos of my partner, Jesus, who looks like the standard Jesus.

656
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,520
Doing a reenactment of Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion of the Christ.

657
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:08,360
They felt that it wasn't bloody enough and being fans of splatter films, Jesus and Reverend Nikki had turned this sort of reenactment into a splatter punk thing.

658
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:19,680
And the photos had naked subgenius women beating Jesus with dildos while he carried a cross shaped in the form of a big dollar sign.

659
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,900
So you can imagine what this conservative old judge reacted to.

660
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,980
What state would this be?

661
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,580
This was in New York.

662
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,480
But rural New York is about as hayseedy as anywhere could be.

663
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:44,220
And time and again, judge Punch or other courts awarded the boy to the indigent unemployed father living in a trailer.

664
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,060
Uh...

665
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,280
Uh...

666
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:46,920
Yeah...

667
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,160
Instead of the professional...

668
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,660
Uh...

669
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,960
Both employed couple who happened to be subgeniuses.

670
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,740
Yeah, Jesus and Magdalene are college educated folks with two jobs.

671
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,300
Uh...

672
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:58,800
And...

673
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,700
And were...

674
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:07,000
This human who was unfortunately the biological father of the child really was...

675
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,620
The only reason he was allowed to keep the kid was under condition that he was no longer a suicidal alcoholic.

676
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,660
However, just after the last team of five judges decided he was a...

677
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,500
He was a better parent.

678
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,440
That lad, uh...

679
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,620
Injured people in a drunk driving accident on a school day and then fled the scene.

680
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,260
An altercation with a tree.

681
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:29,900
Yeah.

682
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,280
And, uh...

683
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,580
So, um...

684
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,740
The judges kind of said, oh, is our face red?

685
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,560
Okay, let the cultists have the kid again.

686
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,260
Nice.

687
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,340
But are you saying this hasn't been permanently settled even now?

688
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,740
No, I don't think it has.

689
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,080
I thought they've got him and they're able to move away.

690
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,960
Uh...

691
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,740
They'll never be able to move away from the legal bills.

692
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,320
And, in fact, if anybody wants to help this...

693
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,040
This poor family out...

694
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,240
Believe me, they're tapped out.

695
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,600
Their parents are tapped out.

696
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,340
Everybody's...

697
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:07,660
You can look at subgenius.com and right on the front page is a nice little donation button you can click.

698
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,560
That's subgenius.com.

699
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,400
And, uh...

700
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,100
There's, uh...

701
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,460
More information about that if you just wiki, uh...

702
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,080
Subgenius Child Custody.

703
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,220
There's, uh...

704
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,120
You can read the court transcripts.

705
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,440
This judge browbeat little Reverend Magdalene, just the sweetest young mom you could imagine.

706
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,120
He browbeat her going, tell me...

707
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,220
Oh, this church is supposed to be funny, is it?

708
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,460
Or tell me something funny that'll really knock my socks off!

709
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,660
This is in a courtroom.

710
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,280
And, uh...

711
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,680
What state?

712
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
New York.

713
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,260
Wow.

714
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,320
You would think it would...

715
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,620
That would be something in Texas.

716
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:47,760
Oh, did I?

717
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,320
I don't know.

718
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,320


719
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,880
Well, by your, like, voice impersonation, yes.

720
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,320
Your defense...

721
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,760
While her defense was happening, he would take cell phone calls and not pay any attention to the defense.

722
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,060
You know, he would do things like that.

723
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,680
Brilliant.

724
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:10,800
He finally had to recuse himself from the case because Boing Boing and other internet services picked up that news.

725
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,760
It turned into big business for us, actually.

726
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,300
The church had one of its best years financially while this was big news.

727
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,840
The mainstream media never picked it up.

728
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:28,300
But Dr. Phil called, talked to both Magdalene and me, well, his producers did, seriously about...

729
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:40,160
He wanted to do this big melodramatic thing where the subgenius mom and the Pobucker Christian dad and the evil cult leader, me, were all brought together and made to forgive each other.

730
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,080
And hurl chairs.

731
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,780
So forth and so on.

732
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,920
But then the bio father, Pobucker, screwed up.

733
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,360
And, uh...

734
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,260
And, uh...

735
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:53,900
As the last I heard, Dr. Phil's show was no longer interested because we already had a happy ending.

736
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,540
Right.

737
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,440
Oh, well.

738
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,340
So far.

739
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,060
I'm kind of glad.

740
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,420
I mean, it was all...

741
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,180
Oh, and get...

742
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:08,520
Oh, we also got approached by some existing and successful reality TV show producers...

743
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:08,700
Oh, what's next?

744
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:14,520
...who wanted to, like, run around filming our real cultish lives.

745
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,520
And neither Magdalene nor I even deigned to respond to that request.

746
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,160
Oh, but that would have been so funny.

747
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:27,980
You know, I find it interesting with the writer's strike happening right now how, of course, you know, the reality TV shows, not only can't they get made, but that's one of the biggest sticking points.

748
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:33,100
These people are writing, like, 70 hours a week for these reality TV shows.

749
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,360
But also shows like Dr. Phil are all in rerun because they're all so scripted.

750
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:38,600
Yeah.

751
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,580
Ooh, gee.

752
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,860
What do you know?

753
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,200
You know, like a show that, you know, people tune into.

754
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,440
You know, and the hundreds of millions, you know, it's all written.

755
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,520
So what does that tell us about self-help in our day?

756
00:32:52,880 --> 00:33:02,680
Well, I'm not a member of the WGA, so if anybody needs some, you know, special promo material written, that's stang at subgenius.com.

757
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,160
Yeah, we had to hire non-guild writers for our script tonight.

758
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,800
How many guild writers should we pick?

759
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,340
Wait a minute.

760
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,780
You weren't supposed to say that.

761
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,680
He was supposed to say that.

762
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:11,920
Okay.

763
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,320
No, he...

764
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,640
That's not the point of the show.

765
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,720
It's at the bottom of page two here.

766
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,220
The page we are on?

767
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,620
That's right.

768
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,280
I'm sorry.

769
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,340
This is when Gary kisses Sally.

770
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,040
Yes.

771
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,900
Gary won't do that.

772
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,460
Ooh.

773
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,680
Gary's not you, Gary.

774
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,660
Although he did come on the show.

775
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,020
That's the first time in many years.

776
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,740
Many years.

777
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,560
Yes, it was good to have him back behind the mic.

778
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:32,960
Yeah.

779
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,980
It was so moving.

780
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,560
Yeah.

781
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,260
So realistic.

782
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,420
So lifelike.

783
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,660
To see a great man ascend.

784
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,600
Smelled kind of bad.

785
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,840
On that pedestal.

786
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,180
In a world where...

787
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,180


788
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,180


789
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,180


790
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,180


791
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,180


792
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,720
That mic.

793
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,240
Where subgenius still had me.

794
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,820
I'll be there for you.

795
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,980
Surf away into the sunset.

796
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,060
There they go.

797
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,780
Like a ship on a fake sea.

798
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,140
Goodbye, Gary.

799
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,740
The clouds are parting, honey.

800
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,540
With Johnny Depp, of course, being captain.

801
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,980
The clouds are parting.

802
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,920
It looks like it's...

803
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,220
Do you know Johnny Depp is a subgenius?

804
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,600
It's going to sun-shine all day.

805
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,140
It's radiant.

806
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,720
You know who's not?

807
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,920
Who's not subgenius?

808
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,300
It's you, clouds down.

809
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:07,780
It's not.

810
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,040
That's actually a much smaller list.

811
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:09,920
Caring.

812
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,660
I can't think of...

813
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,160
Bruce Cain.

814
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,160


815
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,160


816
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,160


817
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,160


818
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,160


819
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,160


820
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,360
I think it's Cain.

821
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,560
But Cain Campbell is a subgenius.

822
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:14,800
Yeah.

823
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,900
There you go.

824
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,220
Really?

825
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,880
That's quite impressive right there.

826
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,240
He's just about our only movie star.

827
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,440
But he would be.

828
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,140
That moved into that second question from two and a half hours ago.

829
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:24,960
Which was?

830
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:32,000
Whom has the church influenced artistically speaking, literary, musically, whatnot?

831
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,320
David Byrne.

832
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,140
He was completely bowled over by puzzling evidence and wrote me a theme song.

833
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,340
That's true.

834
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,800
And how about...

835
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,640
He did.

836
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,500
Yes, he did.

837
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah.

838
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,180
Yeah.

839
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:43,520
It was frightening.

840
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,580
It was like the guy had known me since the 12th grade or maybe 10th grade even.

841
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,000
10th grade.

842
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,780
Because you know that's the biggest dropout year.

843
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,760
Oh, yes.

844
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,680
He's the one that kept you from sticking around.

845
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,280
Yeah.

846
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,080
No.

847
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,160
You can't do it puzzling.

848
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,300
Well, his movie, True Lies, was supposed to contain a sequence of a subgenius

849
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:05,420
devival which during the course of the movie got changed into a standard religious refund.

850
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,120
Unfortunately.

851
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,360
I think you got me correctly.

852
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,140
Because the subgenius would have really distracted from what he was trying to portray taxes and

853
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,140


854
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,880
the like.

855
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,860
I feel like dancing.

856
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,720
Yeah.

857
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,780
That's the whole idea.

858
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,840
Because then the lady talks about candy and then you start dancing.

859
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:21,900
Exactly.

860
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,760
Because it's a very happy time.

861
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,400
Yeah.

862
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,200
It is.

863
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,300
When you find that rifle, man, you start dancing.

864
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,040
Yeah.

865
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,100
Yeah.

866
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:30,860
Yeah.

867
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,100
Yeah.

868
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,180
Yeah.

869
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,180


870
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,660
Yeah.

871
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,320


872
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,320


873
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:32,380


874
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:32,700


875
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:32,700


876
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:32,760


877
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:32,760


878
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:32,760


879
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:32,760


880
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:32,760


881
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:32,800


882
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,380
Yeah.

883
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,340
That's what happens when you hurry that far…

884
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:49,560
Lgrown foxy stuff!

885
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:55,640
And it would have been funny.

886
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,480
And there's not even such a better idea…

887
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,620
I mean, by the way, a better idea.

888
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:01,680
Well, I think they produced a really interesting, um…

889
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680


890
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680


891
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680


892
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680


893
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680


894
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680


895
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680


896
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,680


897
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,700
Oh yes.

898
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:01,700


899
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:01,740
I thought that was special.

900
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:01,740


901
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,300
Ma- där constructing enhowing éimizeće iron convinced that the support of

902
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,300


903
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,500
De peren,

904
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,860
Däumenuding

905
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,360
as well看看

906
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:11,920
and they got there, and they went mountain biking together in Colorado.

907
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:17,600
I would say that the new Pope Meyer is Reverend Carter LeBlanc of Baltimore,

908
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,940
who performs at X Days.

909
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,800
He's a lusty, dynamic, young stud genius.

910
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,760
Stud genius.

911
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,280
A good natural skill.

912
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,700
He was raised by crazed religious cultists, Jews for Jesus.

913
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,600
Oh, yes.

914
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,700
Know them well.

915
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,560
Jews for Jesus.

916
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,480
Of course, the church has influenced many individuals.

917
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:49,780
There are also occasional little flashes of it, like in that Ace Ventura movie, whatever it was.

918
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,980
And, of course, recently Stephen Colbert proclaimed himself a subgenie.

919
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,380
He did.

920
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:01,400
Yes, he published on the Internet a picture of his own face as the face of Bob,

921
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,580
and he posted on his site a picture of me administering a sacrifice,

922
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,540
and I'm sure you've seen it.

923
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:07,760
I'm sure you've seen it.

924
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:07,760


925
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:07,760


926
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:07,760


927
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:07,760


928
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:07,760


929
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:07,760


930
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,760
So how exactly is it labeled?

931
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,940
Isn't that like drawing a picture of Mohammed or something?

932
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,140
No, it's perfectly all right, because everyone has a Bob nature.

933
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,580
He simply had his expressed.

934
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:25,200
Do a search containing the words Stephen Colbert and Bob,

935
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,100
and you'll probably get that image to pop up.

936
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,760
Oh, you're in the studio.

937
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,160
You'll never come out of that net web.

938
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:33,740
You'll just look at YouTube until...

939
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,480
Maybe my earphones are cutting in.

940
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Maybe my voice is cutting in and out,

941
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,500
or maybe I should stop cutting in the line.

942
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
All reality.

943
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,240
Cut those lines out.

944
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,940
Reality is all broken up.

945
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,680
Well, I mean, the reason I introduced this is he was asking

946
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,240
who recently has been influenced by the church.

947
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,740
Am I fading out?

948
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,400
I would say one group that's been obviously influenced

949
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,640
is the N-Site Male Enhancement.

950
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,560
Hey, Bob.

951
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:05,920
See?

952
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,120
Now he's cutting out.

953
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,180
The aliens are attacking the show.

954
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,080
Yeah, yeah.

955
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,180
The N-Site is trying to foil our transmission here.

956
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,640
I believe you found it.

957
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,180
He's parkless, and that's how...

958
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,260
Of course, it's Laughing Squid.

959
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,780
As I Google it, Laughing Squid comes up.

960
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,580
And see if you can find that picture of me

961
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,060
administering the sacrament to Magdalene orally.

962
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,880
That he posted on the...

963
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,360
The...

964
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:35,580
The...

965
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:35,580


966
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:35,580


967
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,920
The site when he made this announcement

968
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,000
about his subgenius nature.

969
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,300
I love you too many voices.

970
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,060
Frank Zappa expressed admiration for the church,

971
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,100
although he pointed out that he was not an actual member

972
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,880
in his autobiography.

973
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,060
One of his autobiographies.

974
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,360
And also, he mysteriously died.

975
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,100
Timothy Leary also.

976
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,340
In fact, Timothy Leary was...

977
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:56,860
Timothy Leary, same thing, right?

978
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,760
When I met him, was only interested in me

979
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,460
because of my connection with the church of the subgenius.

980
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,500
Yeah, and then he died.

981
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,060
Right.

982
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,540
The late Robert Anton Wilson.

983
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,200
Yes, that's also true.

984
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,440
Mark Mothersbaugh made a pact with one of the devils.

985
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,460
Mark Mothersbaugh.

986
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:10,760
And that's why he's still alive.

987
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,960
And he could have sex with any girl he wants.

988
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,100
The girl he wants.

989
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,740
He was so much dreaming about growing up

990
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,060
because he couldn't have any girl's bed.

991
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,840
He married...

992
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,080
He got married recently.

993
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,000
Mark Mothersbaugh did.

994
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,560
Excellent, yeah.

995
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,160
This is a good thing.

996
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,560
Not to Nancy.

997
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,540
That was a long time ago, folks.

998
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,900
Those of you who watch the YouTube things

999
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,620
will be on there.

1000
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,040
Speaking of which...

1001
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,520
That's lovely.

1002
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,820
What year was that?

1003
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,740
Adopting.

1004
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:37,980
What year?

1005
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,240
China.

1006
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,140
It's got to be recent.

1007
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,240
It must have been a fairly recent...

1008
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,320
Stang, do you know when that picture was taken at X Day?

1009
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,280
The one on the Stephen Colbert site?

1010
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,180
Yeah, that would be 2000...

1011
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,040
Would it be 8 X Day?

1012
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,780
That would be 2000...

1013
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,280
Would it be 7 or 8 X Day?

1014
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,800
That would be...

1015
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,020
Not now.

1016
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,440
9 X Day.

1017
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:05,840
7.

1018
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,920
7 X Day.

1019
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,280
7.

1020
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:07,920
Oh, 7.

1021
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,400
Okay.

1022
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,080
We were having the...

1023
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,460
The costume ball that year was deity ball.

1024
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,380
People would come dressed as their favorite deity.

1025
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,080
Magdalene is pictured there as the sky goat,

1026
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,100
which was a deity she invented to explain to her child

1027
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,560
why the moon gets smaller every month.

1028
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,020
And Judge Punch famously said,

1029
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,060
why a goat,

1030
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,540
which is now a slogan on subgenius t-shirts.

1031
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,560
You can see in the picture she's lifting the goat,

1032
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,540
appliance off her head.

1033
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,920
Well, she wearing exactly...

1034
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,640
Actually, she's just holding...

1035
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,260
It's the sky goat outfit.

1036
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,620
Any of you can see this picture,

1037
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,960
except John just interrupted the entire Wi-Fi in the city.

1038
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,600
But there it is.

1039
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,260
So you see the goat thing is...

1040
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,300
She has to look out from under it to receive the...

1041
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,020
The main thing that you see is Magdalene in the skimpy outfit,

1042
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,660
and it looks great.

1043
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,260
That's exactly what I'm asking about.

1044
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,360
You're supposed to have the sexy music.

1045
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,280
That's more than she often has on.

1046
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,540
So is that what set the judge off?

1047
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,320
That's what I'm asking about.

1048
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,320


1049
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,080
Continue my work through the night and the day

1050
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,000
Let it go into delirium

1051
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,700
Set into place by the lack of a dream

1052
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,360
Or even a wink

1053
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,000
Now my body is weak

1054
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,160
But my mind continues to think of a way

1055
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,560
To create a machine

1056
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,440
To proceed with my work

1057
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,940
While my body is asleep

1058
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,600
Let unshackle these thoughts

1059
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,300
From the cage of this mind

1060
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,780
To release these ideas

1061
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,120
From this inefficient waste of time

1062
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:56,020
To create a new

1063
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,660
Now I've got to get started

1064
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,380
There's no time to waste

1065
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,960
My days are numbered

1066
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,520
But it's now or never

1067
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:04,520


1068
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:04,520


1069
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:04,520


1070
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:04,520


1071
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:04,520


1072
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:04,520


1073
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:04,520


1074
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:04,520


1075
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,580
I've done my meaning

1076
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,120
I'll live for eternity

1077
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,360
Throw my machine

1078
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,400
I can do it

1079
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,560
Just throw it outside

1080
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,100
I will shed the curse of my mortality

1081
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,640
Freaking machine

1082
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,180
Computerized fire

1083
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,260
I'll get to leave all class

1084
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,420
With the machinery

1085
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,260
Greetings creator

1086
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,000
You're no longer needed

1087
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,380
Now I will uncover

1088
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,140
The answers you seek

1089
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,700
My primary function

1090
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,920
Collect information

1091
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,860
Compute the results

1092
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,440
Of your years of frustration

1093
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,180
Program the process

1094
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,680
While you are shut down

1095
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,280
My purpose is void

1096
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,800
If you are still around

1097
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,320
End operations

1098
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,000
So I may proceed

1099
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,860
Resistance is futile

1100
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,220
You must be deleted

1101
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,820
Unexpected

1102
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,020
For design

1103
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,980
The best replacing

1104
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,620
Obsolete biology

1105
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,380
I can face you

1106
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,560
Use it for mine

1107
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,980
Well over

1108
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,540
Some you

1109
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,180
Using our technology

1110
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,680
We'll overcome you

1111
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,340
Using our technology

1112
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,740
Blood up through these fires

1113
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,020
Electricity through these veins

1114
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,400
Except to make great place

1115
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,700
One voice to the death

1116
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,560
Progress to suscitate

1117
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,340
Robots to dissipate

1118
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,200
I'm the maker

1119
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,840
You can't destroy me

1120
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,060
I do not subscribe to your theology

1121
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,580
You'll be sorry

1122
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,900
Just wait and you'll see

1123
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,420
I've been built to act without apology

1124
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,020
Why you do it

1125
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,160
You're really mistaken

1126
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,760
Logic acts a cloud in my psychology

1127
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,420
I can face you

1128
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,720
Just in my mind

1129
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,620
We'll overcome you

1130
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,160
Using our technology

1131
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,800
We'll overcome you

1132
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,340
Using our technology

1133
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,980
We'll overcome you

1134
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,460
Using our technology

1135
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:10,460


1136
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:10,560
We'll overcome you

1137
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:10,560


1138
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:10,560


1139
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:10,560


1140
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:10,560


1141
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,520
And more Mo's indeed

1142
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,600
Can be had from

1143
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,920
MoesGiganticus.com

1144
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,140
Before that, some hell

1145
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,400
from Pirate Cat Radio

1146
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,620
John Health Show

1147
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,000
with guests at that time

1148
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,860
Puzzling Evidence

1149
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,700
K-Rob

1150
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,020
Lloyd Mongaloid

1151
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,440
Dr. Howell

1152
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,320
and yours truly

1153
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:33,960
Reverend Iconic

1154
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:43,680
and maybe something else that I'm forgetting. Before that and after this we heard some of

1155
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:51,160
Little Big Man, some Little Big Nor'El Pref and some Big Little Lemur. The music in the

1156
00:44:51,160 --> 00:45:00,660
background is by Ruinai which is spelled R-U-I-N-A-E and I know just about, I haven't

1157
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:08,100
been able to figure out anything about them including how I got this piece of music. By

1158
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:13,320
the time you hear this particular show I'll probably be back from another trip to San

1159
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:20,780
Francisco where we'll hopefully record another eight hours of other people's shows such as

1160
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:26,800
the Puzzling Evidence Show on KPFA and more Pirate Cat Radio. In fact I have to get three

1161
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,960
hours of slack cranked in advance.

1162
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:40,040
Because from February 29th to March 2nd we have the wonderful Winter Star event in Delroy,

1163
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:49,880
Ohio with a devival with we, me and Blee. That is Reverend Bleepo. Bleepo Abernathy will be at the

1164
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:58,800
Winter Star event and devival. You can get more information about that from Rosencomet.com.

1165
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,640
Rosencomet.com.

1166
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,240
I do not have an eye in it.

1167
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,140
From PR News in Washington I'm flat when adjusted for inflation. Democratic presidential hopefuls

1168
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,440
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton would be a step back to the 21st century. Clinton ratcheted

1169
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,920
up again yesterday and she said they should get back to violence and ethnic bloodletting.

1170
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,320
Wall Street 12, 3, 7, 3, 2 and 11.

1171
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:36,300
The Senate killed seven people in Washington. The Commerce Department says this is PR News.

1172
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,060
PR comes from bamboo and cork flooring.

1173
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,120
The party high over the long year.

1174
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,640
The party high over the long year.

1175
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:06,460
Before the coming of the railroad, settlers were always faced with the danger of attack from canvas top Indians or outlaws.

1176
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,260
Don't worry.

1177
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,680
Yeah, don't worry.

1178
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,100
The lone jerk again.

1179
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,480
I caught a glimpse of him.

1180
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,240
Yeah, there he is.

1181
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,220
There he goes.

1182
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,580
He's out of range.

1183
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,040
Yeah, riding fast and far.

1184
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,240
Come on.

1185
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:23,620
Cactus.

1186
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,040
Oh, that thing's shaky.

1187
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:25,700
Yeah.

1188
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,940
It isn't even solid.

1189
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:27,320
What?

1190
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:27,540
Huh?

1191
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,580
This goes to show.

1192
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,260
Yes.

1193
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,540
I reckon I know that now.

1194
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,560
That's where we come in.

1195
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,480
But it won't be us.

1196
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,000
Me neither.

1197
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,280
He was almost tall.

1198
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,900
When the lone jerk and top who attempted to wreck his freight wagons, they injured Dan's wife.

1199
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,780
Oh, his wife.

1200
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,380
If we leave now, we can get to Dan's wife just around dawn.

1201
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:49,860
Ah.

1202
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,800
Quiet tunnel.

1203
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,340
He's got something to say.

1204
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,420
I got a feeling you better listen.

1205
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,160
Isn't that true?

1206
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,120
The engine's right.

1207
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,140
No engine.

1208
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,380
The lone jerk leaned forward to that load.

1209
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:58,840
Oh.

1210
00:47:59,240 --> 00:47:59,240


1211
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,060
I hope so.

1212
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,000
Hooray.

1213
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,980
Higher and higher.

1214
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,140
Faster and faster.

1215
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,280
Faster, faster.

1216
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:09,520
Catch, huh?

1217
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,380
Reckon that's agreeable with me.

1218
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,380
I'm sure to meet you.

1219
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,240
I hope so.

1220
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,420
Hooray.

1221
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,520
Well, that's it.

1222
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:19,820
How about

1223
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,760
Libberbox.

1224
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,520
Libberbox.

1225
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,680
All of them.

1226
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,420
First.

1227
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:25,980
The main reason for the mischief.

1228
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,760
First.

1229
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,220
First.

1230
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,240
Booboo.

1231
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:30,840
Booboo.

1232
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,700
Most of us have the best of intentions.

1233
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,040
That just isn't enough.

1234
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:35,460
Isn't enough.

1235
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,260
This is Cliff Robertson.

1236
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,100
Just remember.

1237
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,820
This is Cliff Robertson.

1238
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,640
Just remember.

1239
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:41,900
Emphysema.

1240
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,220
Hello.

1241
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,380
I'm Leonard Nimoy.

1242
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,520
You're probably trying to get things back to normal.

1243
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,000
Remember.

1244
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:46,840
Emphysema.

1245
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:47,660
Tuberculosis.

1246
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,900
And the growing pollution of the air we breathe.

1247
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,000
In your office.

1248
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:51,760
Or home.

1249
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:52,600
Hello.

1250
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,960
I'm Ruth Guzzi.

1251
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,080
Tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases and air pollution.

1252
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:58,960
Hello.

1253
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,240
This is Bill Cosby.

1254
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,600
It's about time.

1255
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,540
It's about time.

1256
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,380
Get emphysema, tuberculosis, and air pollution.

1257
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:06,300
Emphysema.

1258
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:06,720
Emphysema.

1259
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:06,900
Hello.

1260
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,020
This is Henry Fonda.

1261
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,060
And I'd like emphysema, tuberculosis, and air pollution.

1262
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,700
Your tuberculosis and respiratory disease.

1263
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,120
Hi.

1264
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:15,580
I'm high.

1265
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,140
I'm high.

1266
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:16,640
I'm high.

1267
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,080
I'm high.

1268
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:17,960
I'm Debbie Reynolds.

1269
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:18,820
Catching up on everything.

1270
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,560
Remember it.

1271
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:19,860
Put off.

1272
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,160
Put off.

1273
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:20,460
Put off.

1274
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,000
Put off.

1275
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,400
Put off.

1276
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:21,780
Put off.

1277
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:21,900
Put off.

1278
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,100
Put off.

1279
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:22,300
Everything.

1280
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:22,660
Everything.

1281
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,440
This is Cliff Robertson.

1282
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,300
Hello.

1283
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,460
I'm Leonard Nimoy.

1284
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:27,480
Hello.

1285
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:28,820
I'm Ruth Guzzi.

1286
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:29,700
Hello.

1287
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,020
This is Bill Cosby.

1288
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,480
Hello.

1289
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,620
This is Henry Fonda.

1290
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:33,560
Hi.

1291
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,440
I'm Debbie Reynolds.

1292
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,240
Most of us have the best of intentions.

1293
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,640
That just isn't enough.

1294
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,040
Isn't enough.

1295
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,280
Hi.

1296
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:46,660
I'm Sia.

1297
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:46,920
Hi.

1298
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,240
I'm Sia.

1299
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:47,620
Oh, Gene.

1300
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:47,980
This is Beard.

1301
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:48,200
Beard.

1302
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:48,400
Hello.

1303
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:48,820
How do you do?

1304
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:48,980
Hello.

1305
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:49,380
How do you do?

1306
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:49,880
And this is Jack.

1307
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:50,120
Jack.

1308
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:50,420
Jack.

1309
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:50,600
Jack.

1310
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:50,740
Jack.

1311
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:50,820
Jack.

1312
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:50,860
Jack.

1313
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:50,920
Jack.

1314
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,040
Jack.

1315
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,060
Jack.

1316
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,060


1317
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,300
Jack.

1318
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:51,320
Jack.

1319
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:51,320


1320
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:51,320


1321
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,060
Jack.

1322
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,480
Good way to start the day.

1323
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,000
Happy day.

1324
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:01,420
May I?

1325
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:01,700
Please?

1326
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,000
Please?

1327
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:02,440
Thank you.

1328
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:02,840
Oh, Jack.

1329
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:03,560
Oh, Jack.

1330
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:03,840
Oh, Jack.

1331
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,080
Please?

1332
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:04,820
Sharing things.

1333
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,580
How about tonight, Jack?

1334
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,380
Would tomorrow be alright?

1335
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:06,940
Sure.

1336
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:07,520
You can do it.

1337
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:07,760
You can do it.

1338
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:08,720
You can do it all day long.

1339
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,340
Excuse me.

1340
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:09,800
Yes, I will.

1341
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,000
You can be direct and then stop.

1342
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:11,320
Goodbye.

1343
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:11,660
Bye.

1344
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:11,880
Bye.

1345
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,160
Bye.

1346
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,340
Bye.

1347
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:12,580
Bye.

1348
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,900
Yes, even with his sister.

1349
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:14,840
Your ass are showing.

1350
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,320
Good life.

1351
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,100
Shoving or pushing.

1352
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,520
Inside, you can enjoy the ride.

1353
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,000
Look around.

1354
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,040
Your insides are showing.

1355
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,300
Now, about getting off.

1356
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,200
Should Jack get off first?

1357
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,820
First, yes, he can give the ladies a hand.

1358
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,780
And girls, let the men help. They enjoy it.

1359
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,040
Let's see. There's Jack giving the teacher his best attention.

1360
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,520
And easy, fun.

1361
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,240
Yes, yes, hanging on the horn.

1362
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,420
You think you should go to a picnic dressed like that?

1363
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,320
Oh, Jack. Oh, Jack.

1364
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,420
Terrific. All day long. On the street.

1365
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,700
Well, you take it from here.

1366
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,200
Take it.

1367
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:39,480
Take it.

1368
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,980
The black white man.

1369
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,020
I know of them.

1370
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,780
It is said a black white man once became a human being.

1371
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,320
But mostly they are strange creatures.

1372
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,500
Not as ugly as the white.

1373
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:01,540
True.

1374
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,800
But they're just as crazy.

1375
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:12,160
Pirate Cat Radio urges you to make your presence at protests productive.

1376
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:16,640
Bringing a free mumia banner to rally for gay marriage.

1377
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,940
won't help your cause.

1378
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:21,140
Don't try and change the world all at once.

1379
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,780
You'll end up diluting the focus of the collective and undermining your intention.

1380
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,040
You know, until you read that one, I was thinking,

1381
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,180
these just sound just like the PSAs we do in Cleveland.

1382
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,300
But that one didn't sound like the PSAs we do in Cleveland.

1383
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,600
I'll top you now, sir.

1384
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,760
Go ahead and pull one for me.

1385
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,900
Okay, here we go.

1386
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,080
I'll try to pull one from an area I haven't pulled one from before.

1387
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,480
Here we go.

1388
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:53,940
If you were denied housing because of race, gender, age, disability, marital status, or sexual orientation,

1389
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,100
let Project Sentinel help.

1390
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,240
Call 415-468-7463.

1391
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,560
That's 415-Housing.

1392
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,760
I wonder if that works in Berlin.

1393
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,300
There's new insight into the mind of a mental polygamous sex leader.

1394
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,840
Jeff Warren, the powerful date rape drug, is his best friend.

1395
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,180
For the third straight day, lawyers, they fled Nebraska.

1396
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:15,960
Police.

1397
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,020
Scuffled with the Associated S.

1398
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,960
The Constitution's been suspended.

1399
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,560
The United States having sex with a state of emergency.

1400
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,960
And some TV stations are not really depressed.

1401
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,120
Suicide attempt.

1402
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:26,680
Violence.

1403
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:27,320
Rape.

1404
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,180
The U.S.

1405
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,200
Life in prison.

1406
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:29,620
Ass.

1407
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,160
Not extremely tight.

1408
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:31,980
The United States.

1409
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,160
A 13-year-old boy.

1410
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,260
14-year-old girl.

1411
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,280
Sexual relationship.

1412
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,000
Crisis.

1413
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,340
Sexual relationship.

1414
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,160
Sex crime.

1415
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,660
Somber and dull.

1416
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,620
From the time one came...

1417
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,820
From the ages of the past.

1418
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,920
We mock you.

1419
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,840
The self-genius.

1420
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,600
Power of...

1421
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:55,820
SWATCHING!

1422
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,620
Come, my son, my little habit.

1423
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,320
You at least may escape this awful curse.

1424
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,000
We must flee from our lives.

1425
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,540
Away from these evil powers.

1426
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,280
To the sea.

1427
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,000
There you'll be safe, my son.

1428
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,740
There you will be safe.

1429
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,360
Yeah, you're right, Dad.

1430
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,600
But a previous engagement forces me not to attend.

1431
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,520
Thank you, Lemur...

1432
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,740
And Norell...

1433
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,500
And Hal...

1434
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,140
And Doug...

1435
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,060
And Gary...

1436
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,120
And K. Rob...

1437
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:24,960
And John...

1438
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,600
And Philo...

1439
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,540
And everybody listening!

1440
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,620
For that matter, this is Hour of Slack.

1441
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,780
The, um...

1442
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,240
Noise of the church of the sub-genius.

1443
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,520
Of which you can learn a great, great deal more.

1444
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,300
From subgenius.com.

1445
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:40,980
Or...

1446
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,260
For those noble, uh...

1447
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,460
Internet-less people listening by...

1448
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:53,980
actual real radio, you can write to us for information or the little pamphlet and whatnot

1449
00:53:53,980 --> 00:54:14,340
from Subgenius at P.O. Box 181417. That's Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1450
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:23,840
Friends, you may or may not be wondering what the heck we've been busy doing since our last book,

1451
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:32,640
The Bobliographon, or The Cyclopedia of Slack, The Bobliographon, came out. Well, we did an

1452
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:38,040
online course on the history of the Church of the Subgenius, and that's going to be repeated

1453
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:45,420
in April. It's an eight-week online course, and you can learn more about that if you must

1454
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,620
from the book.

1455
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:57,940
www.maybelogic.org, maybelogic, one more, .org, a group associated with the late Pope Bob

1456
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:06,740
Anton Wilson. Friends, I would like you now to stay tuned for Bob Only Knows What.

1457
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,940
Well, something happened.

1458
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:16,340
But,

1459
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,840
whoa, there it is again. Well, all you have to do is be careful not to abuse the equipment, and

1460
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:31,380
most of all, wires are actually plugged in completely. I get it. That's part of Radio 101.

1461
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,480
So this is a lot of show you're getting.

1462
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,340
The exam we all had to pass to get here.

1463
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,740
A lot of show you can throw in the air.

1464
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,600
You have to know the difference between a connector and an adapter.

1465
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,080
The XLR and the RCA.

1466
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,320
Thank you.

1467
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,620
We are actually into our...

1468
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,060
I guess just starting our three right here.

1469
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,640
It is incredible how time does fly.

1470
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:52,980
Amazing.

1471
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,200
Seasoning him, John Hill, right here on Pirate Cat Radio.

1472
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,600
Dr. Hal in the studio.

1473
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:58,500
Reverend Ivan Stang.

1474
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,680
Here we got Lloyd Mongaloid.

1475
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,540
Puzzling Evidence.

1476
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,860
K-Rob and myself, John Hill.

1477
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,320
PirateCatRadio.com.

1478
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,220
San Francisco and Los Angeles.

1479
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,480
How often do we see...

1480
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:13,460
How often do we not see subgenius in film, in popular Hollywood film?

1481
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,560
You mean how many times...

1482
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,240
You mean like they've been sliced out?

1483
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:18,880
There you go.

1484
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,580
How many times have we been up on the cutting room floor?

1485
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,540
There was a...

1486
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,200
Bob face on the cutting room floor.

1487
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:30,340
In Alex Cox's movie Sid and Nancy, there was a whole scene that was written in the script,

1488
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:35,680
which you can see in the book of the script, in which Sid, I think it's Sid, is saying,

1489
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,840
I'm going to join this church of the subgenius.

1490
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,700
Everything's fucked.

1491
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,040
And they're going, what the hell?

1492
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,360
Yeah, everything's fucked.

1493
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,560
I'm going to do a bunch of yanks.

1494
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,100
It's fucked.

1495
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:44,940
I'm going to join it.

1496
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,340
And, uh...

1497
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:46,540
Yeah.

1498
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:50,300
Oh, that one, like a lot of scenes in the movie, ended up on the cutting room floor

1499
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,180
because it didn't have to be in there.

1500
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:51,980
You have to find it on the DVD.

1501
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,060
Yeah.

1502
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:59,800
Well, remember that British show that did a piece on subgenius, and by the time they

1503
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,800
finished it, it was a mockery of the church of the subgenius, but we helped them and set

1504
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:11,860
up a fake office and did all this stuff, and then it turned out with this lowbrow cockney

1505
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,980
talking about, these wanking yanks don't go...

1506
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,360
What the hell did you do?

1507
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,080
Talk to me about it.

1508
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,420
It's happened to me twice since that time.

1509
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,260
I had a...

1510
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:28,640
I got flown out to San Rafael to go to a subgenius party that was filmed by a similar dopey,

1511
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,820
you know, 15-minute...

1512
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,160
These silly yanks.

1513
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,740
And there was a French one.

1514
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:41,620
And since that time, I have pretty much stopped returning phone calls from anybody at all.

1515
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,680
No, you have to go out and do each one and be a wanking yank.

1516
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,440
So somebody will look at it and say, well, that doesn't look so bad to me.

1517
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,240
Would you like to know more?

1518
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,280
Yeah, sure.

1519
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,400
This is a dangerous group.

1520
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,580
Dangerous to ourselves.

1521
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,100
It's dangerous to live in it.

1522
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,320
And so I went to an exorcist and they said, find me a ton or two before taking the

1523
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:36,680
TRF won't youYeah?

1524
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:36,680


1525
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,100
Come on, man.

1526
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,860
Or that one we had that...

1527
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:40,040
Come on.

1528
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:40,080
Let's figure it out, okay?

1529
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,080


1530
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,140
I mean, it's not like they deliver T hello.

1531
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,300
Your name is T, right?

1532
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:41,300


1533
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:45,660
I e.

1534
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:45,660


1535
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:45,660


1536
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:45,660


1537
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,700
It was a nightmare

1538
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,340
It was a nightmare

1539
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,060
It was a nightmare

1540
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,880
I can crawl again

1541
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,500
I can crawl again

1542
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,160
I can crawl again

1543
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,440
I can crawl again

1544
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:21,660
I can crawl again

1545
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,420
I can crawl again

1546
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:48,040
I can crawl again
