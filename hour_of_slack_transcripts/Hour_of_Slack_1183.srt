1
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:41,000
I love you.

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,900
Genuine.

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,240
Beautiful.

4
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:01,960
Giant.

5
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:02,680
Perfect.

6
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,380
Cool.

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:03,940
Special.

8
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,500
Cheered.

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,180
Labyrinth.

10
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,440
Easy.

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:05,940
Ultimate.

12
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,400
Best.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,780
Natural.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,300
Growing.

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,820
Special.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,540
Nice.

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:08,880
Proud.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,360
Quicker.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,460
And much more.

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:20,560
Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:28,280
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,720
No, I'm going to compress it.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,620
All into just this one intensive total rerun show.

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,820
Except that actually it's not.

25
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:47,400
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,780
and holy days and the hole in head days, as it is for some people.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,180
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of selling.

28
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,140
Selling.

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,480
Yes.

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:01:59,820
Oh.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,620
You wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,440
But anyway, happy whatever you do.

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

34
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,440
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmas, a guitar axmas.

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,560
It's cool, man.

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:27,880
Cool.

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,340
Cool.

38
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,480
And.

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,620
And.

40
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:28,860
And.

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,460
And.

42
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:29,860
And.

43
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,420
And.

44
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,620
And.

45
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:30,780
And.

46
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,220
And.

47
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,420


48
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,840
And.

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:31,840


50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:31,840


51
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,720
Oh.

52
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,280
Oh.

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,060
Oh.

54
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,580
Oh.

55
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,100
Oh.

56
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,340
Oh.

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:35,540
Oh.

58
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:35,820
Oh.

59
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,300
Oh.

60
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,660
Oh.

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,640
Oh.

62
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:37,960
Oh.

63
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,380
Oh.

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,320
Oh.

65
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:39,640
Oh.

66
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:39,820
Oh.

67
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:39,860


68
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,080
Oh.

69
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,080


70
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,080


71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,680
Oh.

72
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,820
Oh.

73
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:58,640
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree.

74
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,980
Stuck the wood where I poop-she-poop-she-poop-poop with the stick of my hip-de-dip-de-dip.

75
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,680
Who was that man?

76
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:31,740
He shoved it up my can and left me stranded on this Christmas tree.

77
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,120
Yeah.

78
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,080
Will you stop it?

79
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,960
When this angel heard, chop-a-pop-a-pop, chop-a-pop-a-pop,

80
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,800
a dreadful fear went right into me.

81
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,160
My heart, those pine tree needles sting me.

82
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,400
Ram-a-jam-a-ram-a-jam-a-nam-a-ding-dong.

83
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,700
You'll never know how much that smarts.

84
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,820
So who put the stomp in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp?

85
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,520
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?

86
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,380
Who stood the wood where I poop-she-poop-she-poop?

87
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,200
Who put the stick up my hip-de-dip-de-dip?

88
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,560
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tooth?

89
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,720
Who made this angel beg for mercy, please?

90
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,060
I might squeeze him too tight.

91
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,680
It's that psychedelic time of the year.

92
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,580
Do you know where your brain cells are?

93
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,640
It's already 9 p.m.

94
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,680
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-ate him.

95
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,680
Don't go walking down to the bar because old Frankie died last night in the backyard.

96
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,340
I mean, I'm in the apartment store.

97
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,080
I'm in the apartment store.

98
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm in the apartment store.

99
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,620
I'm in the apartment store.

100
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:48,620


101
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:48,620


102
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:48,620


103
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,700
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

104
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,340
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw.

105
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,340
Yeah, and I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells

106
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,960
till I get the damn chainsaw fixed and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday.

107
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,500
Now, you boys be good, and I'll give you some of this here.

108
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,640
It ain't no good of a child.

109
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,580
That dog's running off with them brain cells.

110
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,100
Can you do something about that, boy?

111
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,880
I'm gonna have to.

112
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,560
I'm gonna have to.

113
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,940
I'm gonna have to.

114
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,060
I'm gonna have to.

115
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,840
I'm gonna have to.

116
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,660
I'm gonna have to.

117
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:54,580
I'm gonna have to.

118
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,460
I'm gonna have to.

119
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:55,460


120
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,740
What we as manufacturers sell you is fun.

121
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,800
The faith of a child.

122
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,820
Spend all the money you've got.

123
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,960
Spend all the money you've got.

124
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,680
The Christmas trough.

125
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,780
I've lost my freaking mind.

126
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,160
Oh, look.

127
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,620
Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

128
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,900
He's like a cowboy Santa.

129
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,540
Hajali.

130
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,660
Oh, Jazz is giving,

131
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,280
gives Dave the show pills.

132
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,180
Boy, I really need one of those.

133
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,180
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit, though?

134
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,420
I need the show bath.

135
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,780
Bath.

136
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,600
The show de-lousing.

137
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,980
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.

138
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,120
That's enough of that.

139
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,160
Oh, he's got headphones now.

140
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,020
I also have the part of my pancreas

141
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,400
that I'd like to show you now.

142
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
It's been increased in size to...

143
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,440
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.

144
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,520
Look, it's swelling.

145
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,600
I have the capability of a man of 190 IQs brain.

146
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,060
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

147
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,140
Oh, those pills.

148
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,300
They make my...

149
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,800
mouth feel like it's on fire.

150
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,980
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied crystals.

151
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,500
I'm shocked by the...

152
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,340
The red pills are really good.

153
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,820
I like to take the red one and the blue one

154
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,600
at the same time.

155
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,720
That way you go in and out.

156
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,660
The warp mix is easy.

157
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,900
It's so high, you can't go over it.

158
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,180
Angels, we have heard on high.

159
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,080
Singing about mountains too.

160
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,620
And those mountains in reply.

161
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,480
Saying we wish we had some too.

162
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,660
Oh-oh-oh-ohh-oh-oh Whoa-oh-ohh-ohh-oh

163
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,100
Oh-oh-oh-ohh-ohh Oh-oh-ohh-ohh-ohh

164
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,240
Oh, Wario

165
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,060
ItISHK is say-o

166
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,580
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-ohh Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh

167
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,340
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh Oh-oh-ohh-ohh-oh

168
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,340


169
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,240
Wario

170
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,240
It excels these days

171
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,700
Barbie Dolls

172
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,360
Women rape and memorialize their lives

173
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
by role-playing with bars

174
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,440
Barbie Dolls

175
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,460
We have devised a marketing scheme

176
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,140
for children's toys

177
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,440
It will empower us to resist

178
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,380
You will use your church

179
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,080
as a vehicle to bring these toys

180
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,800
before the public

181
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,780
It will be all

182
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,560
the fun

183
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,100
of the day

184
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
for kids

185
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,960
But how will the battle

186
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,060
of good against evil

187
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,540
be represented

188
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,820
in your marketing schemes

189
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,800

Good

192
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,540
The primitive earth societies

193
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,740
should accept

194
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,440
this value judgment

195
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,300
Good will have

196
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,580
great physical attributes

197
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,100

We must buy our toys!

211
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,720
Yes.

212
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,060
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme.

213
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,000
Recorded there at Dockstock 1984.

214
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,040
And me and Palmer Veedies.

215
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,800
Angels We Have Heard on High was by The Philistines.

216
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,000
The collage called All the Money You've Got

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,260
is from the great Obtuse Christmas collage album,

218
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,640
which you can get for free.

219
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,620

That's Obtuse.

223
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,520
Excuse me.

224
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,720
Ah, yes.

225
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,440
And next up, The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,460
Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus.

227
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,940
And he had two eyes made out of coal.

228
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,160
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.

229
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,820
And he wanted his two front teeth.

230
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,920
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

231
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,440
And he had a dog named Santa's Little Helper.

232
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,860
And he took all the presents from Whoville.

233
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,480
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came.

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,660
With the three wise guys.

235
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,380
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.

236
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,540
But he couldn't.

237
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,620
He wanted 10s and 20s.

238
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,080
10s and 20s.

239
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,560
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

240
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,300
And he got Zuzu's pedals.

241
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,880
And that's The Real Story of Christmas.

242
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,460
Take the house.

243
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,780
And he gave McDonald's gifts to

244
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,360
the children.

245
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,680
Take the house.

246
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,420
And he gave McDonald's gifts to

247
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,700
The Real Story of Christmas gift certificates.

248
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:27,980
And he gave McDonald's gifts to

249
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,080
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.

250
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,260
He wanted an electric train.

251
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,400
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where he was going to set it up.

252
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,620
He could picture the whole thing, and he would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes.

253
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,600
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.

254
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,760
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy-looking train set,

255
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:27,960
which he would never be able to get rid of.

256
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,420
He had a locomotive and three cars,

257
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,500
the station and the gateman,

258
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,380
the water tower, and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.

259
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,360
So rad that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist.

260
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:22,420
But he would know the real Lord, but the succeed stoplo religious work, was playing his role as he was trying to unravel the answer on the color of the Sasenta chain.

261
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,420
So Estored is back and puedes spektrying out some more bits of texto.

262
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:23,420


263
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:23,420


264
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:23,480


265
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:23,720
The Wall is in a jar!

266
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,440
I'm going to look at Tocantins now!

267
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,240
The Wall is as free and normal as the M Engilerts of Persia!

268
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,240


269
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,920
Oh, greetings!

270
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:27,960
Stand there,

271
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:27,960


272
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,340
Bob Dobbs comes with Rocket Pipe, Head Launcher, Jainer Device,

273
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,620
All-Yakitism, Fighting Jesus, and other action figures sold separately.

274
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,280
Some assembly required, batteries not included.

275
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,440
This toy falls apart in three days.

276
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,140
He-Bob and the Bastards of the Universe.

277
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,460
Too much is always better than not enough.

278
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,600
From Bob Dobbs.

279
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,720
Gorgeous.

280
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,840
My Connie.

281
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,360
Ken Dowsell separately.

282
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,320
He-Bob and the Bastards of the Universe will be back after this message.

283
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,060
Santa Claus.

284
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,800
It is turnover.

285
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,300
The time of the year when all things sell.

286
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,860
The end of the year sale.

287
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,420
So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.

288
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,260
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

289
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,640
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

290
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,960
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

291
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,760
But the present subgenie tried to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now.

292
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,620
And sell everything to the pigs.

293
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,800
Oh, yes.

294
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,540
Once a pagan holiday, and now a shopping season.

295
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,900
And it was something else in between there.

296
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,700
After it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season, it was something else.

297
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,460
But I think they started a war over it.

298
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:43,880
Yeah.

299
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,080


300
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,220


301
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,560
Yeah.

302
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,400
Yeah.

303
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,780
Yeah.

304
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,020


305
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh, oh, Gloria

306
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,480
Oh, I'm a place of honor

307
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,160
I'm a true wonder

308
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,120
Yeah, it's too much good

309
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,840
Oh, I'm not some god

310
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,460
Oh, oh, Gloria

311
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,320
Oh, Santa had extra sins

312
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,100
adjustment

313
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,700
Thank you.

314
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,560
Thank you.

315
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:27,560


316
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,040
Friends, try to imagine

317
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,060
my God and

318
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,000
Savior somewhere in the snow

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,460
north, the

320
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,500
Santibob trudging

321
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,860
mindlessly through the Himalayan

322
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,700
snows, driven by

323
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,640
strange forces to

324
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,980
complete his nameless errand.

325
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,760
And he may show

326
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,900
up at your house,

327
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,000
my friend, if you've been a bad

328
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,760
subgenius or a halfway

329
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,880
subgenius, or if we keep

330
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,700
getting tangled up in these other

331
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,320
shows and having strange

332
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,560
microphones.

333
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,320
How did that paternity

334
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,100
suit ever turn out between

335
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,260
Dobbs and Santa?

336
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,480
And who? His dad.

337
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,360
Santa dog. I don't know.

338
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,160
I don't think it was...

339
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,220
St. Nicholas, this is fact,

340
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,980
St. Nicholas punched another

341
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,980
bishop in the nose and

342
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,320
bloodied his nose.

343
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,020
Really? The historical St.

344
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,620
Nicholas?

345
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,720
Over the trinity of God.

346
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,000
The original St. Nicholas

347
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,920
in Turkey?

348
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,920
I swear upon Bob's and

349
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,900
who's the hell's God?

350
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,380
Yeah.

351
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,820
I can tell you shit, God.

352
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,460
Who the hell is God?

353
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,160
Who the hell is God?

354
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,200
Ask Dobbs one day.

355
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,880
That's the question we should be asking.

356
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,960
Suddenly, a lightning bolt

357
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,700
struck from nowhere on that

358
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,720
bright, sunny day. Bob

359
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,840
did a backflip, and from that day

360
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,520
on, he too was a believer.

361
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,320
And from the snow

362
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,780
a little child bearing

363
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,640
flowers emerged.

364
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,800
Chip, what else?

365
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,060
Each one a dirty flower.

366
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,020
St. Nicholas.

367
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,900
The historical Santa Claus

368
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,900
is originally

369
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,120
lived, as the caller

370
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
knows, as a bishop

371
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,500
in, was it

372
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,260
Constantinople?

373
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,220
Yeah, like one of those...

374
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,520
It was in ancient Byzantium.

375
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,680
Yeah, Asia Minor

376
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,960
in general, yeah.

377
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,020
And he was

378
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,780
known for

379
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,840
sneaking into the room,

380
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,280
the rooms of young women, and leaving

381
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,680
gifts.

382
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,860
Light-sized lumps of coal, complete with a fake beard

383
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,040
and a CIA Wall Street credit card.

384
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,860
A saint he was,

385
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,440
the girl said.

386
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,160
St. Nicholas invented the CIA.

387
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,780
You got it, brother.

388
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,720
Stuck into people's houses through the chimney.

389
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
You got it, brother.

390
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,160
He knew when they were awake.

391
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,080
You got it, brother.

392
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,680
But like the CIA, he was

393
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,200
protecting them.

394
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,340
St. Nicholas was a creeping, stinking

395
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:23,780
spy.

396
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,760
He knows when you've been sleeping.

397
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,340
He knows what you've been eating.

398
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,140
Hey, man, my kids still believe in St. Nicholas.

399
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,260
And who keeps that belief alive

400
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,220
in their fevered, sick little brain?

401
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,460
Madison Avenue, of course.

402
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,600
No, the surveillance community

403
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,980
under your direction.

404
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,940
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.

405
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,760
Miller Beer, you know.

406
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,640
If you're bad, he punishes you.

407
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,380
If you're good, he rewards you.

408
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,400
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus

409
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,900
walking the earth.

410
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,820
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is.

411
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,740
He rewards those...

412
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,520
Who knows when they are smiling when they're awake.

413
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,400
I think, really, if you want to make a deal,

414
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,460
you have to do it with, you know...

415
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,420
Could Dr. Claus, in fact,

416
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,580
be the wandering, quote,

417
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,700
milkman rumored to have

418
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,140
fathered our savior,

419
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,960
J.R. Bob Dobbs?

420
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,680
Well, we find it a very likely possibility

421
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,620
from the falsified documents

422
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,460
we have here.

423
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,240
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet.

424
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,900
You better watch out.

425
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,500
You better not...

426
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,340
You better not...

427
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,940
You better not tell anyone.

428
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,260
Santa Claus is coming to town.

429
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,200
Santa Claus is coming to town.

430
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,200


431
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,900
He's a brother, man, this.

432
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,660
Checking it twice.

433
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,280
Gonna find out who's nobler in there.

434
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,020
Santa Claus is coming to town.

435
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,120
He's a brother, man, this.

436
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,680
He's a brother, man, this.

437
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,140
He's a brother, man, this.

438
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,080
He knows when you're awake.

439
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,000
He knows when you're in bad or good.

440
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,820
So be goodness to goodness sake.

441
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,640
Oh, you better watch out.

442
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,400
You better not cry.

443
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,240
You better not tell them telling you what.

444
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,260
Santa Claus is coming to town.

445
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,240
Santa Claus is coming to town.

446
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,940
Oh, he's crazy.

447
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,980
logic工fm on rotates

448
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,460
Santa Claus is coming to town.

458
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,700
Santa Claus is coming for me.

459
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:54,700


460
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,180
Thank you heavily.

461
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,420
Hey, accessibility.

462
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,240
Santa Claus is coming to town tonight.

463
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,480
Santa Claus is coming to town tonight.

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,980
That's right, as a..."

Oh, look down thisiane.

467
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,100
You know where he is.

468
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,240
He's back delicious.

469
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,240


470
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,260
Or wrists.

471
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,260
Santa's back again.

472
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,060
Material plants?

473
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,540
Biological agents who only take 15%?

474
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,040
Thank you.

475
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,920
Oh, it's a great day, all right.

476
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,740
A salute to Mr. and Mrs. American.

477
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,800
Shop as usual.

478
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,100
Shop as usual.

479
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,380
Shop as usual.

480
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,680
And avoid panic buying.

481
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,480
All right!

482
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,180
It's two days old Christmas, a million things to do.

483
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,760
Clean the house, put on tea, company is due.

484
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,880
Where are my relatives?

485
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,460
Why haven't they showed up?

486
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,340
I've met her at the airport, I forgot to pick them up.

487
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,260
Christmas, Christmas here.

488
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,680
Christmas, Christmas here.

489
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,940
Christmas, Christmas here.

490
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,560
Christmas, Christmas here.

491
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:40,380
Christmas, Christmas here.

492
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,580
Sometimes I think all that Santa crap's just bull.

493
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,360
Santa Claus is real.

494
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,680
Santa Claus is real.

495
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,000
Santa Claus is real.

496
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,160
Who's the head man?

497
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,560
Santa Claus.

498
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Santa Claus.

499
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,060
He was a huge beastly, bulging man.

500
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,000
You're so real.

501
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,040
How come we didn't get squat last year?

502
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,440
Yes, the birth of the baby.

503
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,840
The birth of our baby Satan on July 4th.

504
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,720
And now you can have it all pure 100% vinyl chloride CID.

505
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:27,760
The birth of our baby Satan as told by various authors and eclectic scholars from around the globular unit.

506
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,440
Including that announcer.

507
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,960
This announcement has not been a perfunctory announcement.

508
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,260
But an announcement of the blessed anointing and birthday of our Lord.

509
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,500
See you.

510
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,040
See you.

511
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,560
See you.

512
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,940
See you.

513
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:49,980
For one bright Christmas morning.

514
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,600
Was born in a cradle to a rich man's family.

515
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,760
Oh, I know the rave Jesus.

516
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,760
I'm parting with the rave Jesus.

517
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,860
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

518
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:15,440
Merry little Christmas

519
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,160
Let your side be light

520
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,460
From the water

521
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,780
Triples with the outer side

522
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,200
Have yourself a

523
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,120
Merry little Christmas

524
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,400
From now on

525
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,500
We're miles away

526
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,720
Once again

527
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,580
As in olden

528
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,060
Say happy golden

529
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,260
Be miles away

530
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,820
Let your heart

531
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:09,420
Be out of sight

532
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,040
Out of sight

533
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,500
The Jackson's

534
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,020
But I wish everybody

535
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,600
A crystal merry Christmas

536
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,740
And a gloomy gloomy day

537
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,760
From Mutated Christmas, friends,

Before that, some year-old ESO

542
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,420

543
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,360

Jethro's!

607
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,180
Now you're blaming Jesus, you're blaming our Lord.

608
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,540
I sort of understand, because...

609
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,840
I understood the way any old fool would understand.

610
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:11,220
There was no Jesus, no flatulent old woman waving her panties on the hill.

611
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,800
It's not that you don't want to, it's that they won't let you.

612
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,940
No, they're ashamed.

613
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,640
Just a cry of wilderness.

614
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,600
They're ashamed.

615
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,080
And the hot pursuit of wolves everywhere in the background.

616
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,600
I'm ashamed of them.

617
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,300
Oh!

618
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:25,880
Oh!

619
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,900
It's cold.

620
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,380
Oh!

621
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm leaving that city life behind and radio people crazy.

622
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,100
I can't get my noodle back in the pan, Jen.

623
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,240
Come on, cowboy.

624
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,720
No, man, I was trying to hear a can against your tree, and it started whispering to me, man.

625
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,200
Oh, you've been drinking.

626
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,340
There's the face of the Madonna right up there.

627
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,800
There's the face of the Virgin Mary.

628
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,880
I swear to God, look at it.

629
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,960
It ate me.

630
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,280
What?

631
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,920
It's your Christmas witch coming.

632
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,320
It ate me.

633
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,500
It was crazy.

634
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:55,840
Wow.

635
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,960
A Christmas witch?

636
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:57,960
I'll be whole.

637
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,060
Oh.

638
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,520
She's beautiful.

639
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,040
Oh, my God, yeah, I guess it does look a little bit more...

640
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,160
Her breasts are so cold.

641
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,380
Witchy than angelic.

642
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,340
I know she must be a true witch.

643
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,560
I guess you could call her that if that's what she's packing out of you for real.

644
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,960
She's surrounded by hovering Christmas ornaments.

645
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,120
It looks like a radar device.

646
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:12,660
What?

647
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:13,840
Yo.

648
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:14,940
Yo?

649
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,320
It's her.

650
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,220
What up?

651
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,100
Nothing.

652
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,100
What's up?

653
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,940
What a deep voice.

654
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,500
What's up?

655
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:21,820
First Christmas.

656
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,640
Witch.

657
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,260
Witch.

658
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,200
Witch.

659
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,420
Witch.

660
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:24,880
Witch.

661
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,500

665
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,620
Witch.

666
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:39,880
Witch.

667
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,440
Witch.

668
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,140
Witch.

669
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,700
Witch.

670
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,240
Witch.

671
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,460
Thank you.

672
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,120
Thank you.

673
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,240

674
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,080
Thank you.

675
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,660
Thank you.

676
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,940
Thank you.

677
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,320
Thank you.

678
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,000
Thank you.

679
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,240
Thank you.

680
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,440
Christmas is now.

681
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,080
It's me.

682
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,320
You've beaten the crap out of Santa Claus.

683
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:36,280
Scott, you made your choice.

684
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,700
You rejected my word, you rejected me.

685
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,340
And to your eternal soul,

686
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,740
you have found that only could you afford

687
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,680
to give to God that which was his.

688
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,560
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

689
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,780
The Senate still stands.

690
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,440
And as the snow melts,

691
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,480
into outer darkness,

692
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,400
where there is wailing and gnashing of feet,

693
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,640
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.

694
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,900
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

695
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,180
Sir, no, no.

696
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,260
I don't want to go to hell.

697
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:14,580
No.

698
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,660
Live as he could be.

699
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,300
And the children say he could laugh and play

700
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,520
just the same old you and me.

701
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,800
The tail bearer will be at the judgment.

715
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,640
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.

716
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,440
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,

717
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,700
and a baby is born with a head

718
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,540
that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

719
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,500
Dare I ask it?

720
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,320
Yes.

721
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,040
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,

722
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,540
but merely one of the countless aliens

723
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,640
that visit the Earth each and every day?

724
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,020
The answer?

725
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,620
Yes, definitely.

726
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,520
Take that and shove it up the tube,

727
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,180
mark certainty,

728
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,340
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

729
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,560
Merry Christmas to all!

730
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,640
Now you're all gonna die!

731
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,020
The night Santa went crazy

732
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,640
The night Saint Nick went insane

733
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,280
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal

734
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,620
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

735
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,680
Well the workshop is gone now

736
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,680
He decided to bomb it

737
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,480
Everywhere you'll find pieces

738
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,620
Of Cupid and Comet

739
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,800
And he tied up his helpers

740
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,520
And he held the elves hostage

741
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,620
And he grounded them

742
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,640
And he turned up for Rudolph

743
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,360
Into reindeer sausage

744
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,580
He got dancer in Prancer

745
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,580
With an old German Luger

746
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,420
And he slashed up Dasher

747
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,620
Just like Freddy Krueger

748
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,700
And he picked up a flamethrower

749
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,320
And he barbecued Blitzen

750
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,180
And he took a big bite

751
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,300
To say it tastes just like chicken

752
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,580
The night Santa went crazy

753
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,260
The night Kris Kringle went nuts

754
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,620
Now you can hardly walk

755
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,600
Around the world

756
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,020
Without stepping in reindeer guts

757
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,820
There's a National Guard

758
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,320
And the FBI

759
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,580
There's a van from the eye

760
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,620
With just news

761
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,860
And helicopters circling

762
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,420
Round in the sky

763
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,400
And the bullets are flying

764
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,660
The bodyguards rising

765
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,320
And everyone's dying

766
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,100
To know who Santa was

767
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:35,480
Who he really was

768
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,880
Santa went toNY

769
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,320
And showed your friends

770
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,820
How就是說

771
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,960
That Santa is

772
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,580
Cause you're Majreally

773
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,800
You better watch out.

774
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,120
You better not cry.

775
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,560
You better not pout.

776
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,660
I'm telling you why.

777
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,120
Santa Claus is coming to town.

778
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,620
Santa Claus is coming to town.

779
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,280
Have yourself an advanced Dogmatic Christmas song thing

780
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:22,580
called Santa is Coming by F. Gillespie and F. J. Coot.

781
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,980
ElectricElf at Loop.com can tell you more about that.

782
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,620
But now...

783
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,260
Who gave the Lord the claptrap?

784
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,740
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?

785
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,680
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?

786
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,480
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.

787
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,960
The time of the Lord, of the fat man of the crowd.

788
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:44,980
How many do you...

789
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,260
How many do you...

790
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,720
Before you reach your limit, how many do you get?

791
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:48,700
Jesuses?

792
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:48,780
Jesuses?

793
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,060
Yeah, how many can you bag?

794
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,920
How many messiahs can you bag?

795
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,100
Hail Jesuses.

796
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,740
If you're doing it in season...

797
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,780
If you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit.

798
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,360
Oh, you never do...

799
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,240
And you can only take one.

800
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,780
Yeah, but I mean...

801
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,900
You never bag the Lord in C.

802
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,660
You bag the Lord in B-flat, so you get that kind of rough sound.

803
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,160
But when they're in season, it's every God for himself.

804
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,380
This is the season for the fighting Jesus.

805
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,460
Obviously.

806
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,360
We are between a rock and a hard place.

807
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,460
Did you know, though,

808
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,240
that the Lord walked through the city of Jerusalem

809
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:15,240


810
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,480
and he walked through Chaldea in the old age

811
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,240
and he got a very, very hard foot

812
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,560
and he got elephantages of the rectum.

813
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,100
You know, it's not something well-known

814
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,740
by many Christian scholars.

815
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,640
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was...

816
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,440
Well, I like the story...

817
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,040
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies

818
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,420
and then comes here to America and settles,

819
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,980
you know, tames the West.

820
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,420
I like when he moves into a trailer park

821
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,560
and cowboys walk with his dog.

822
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,580
Jesus fought for the Confederate army.

823
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,100
The ranger.

824
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,800
I like the...

825
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah!

826
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,700
The Texas ranger.

827
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,240
Jesus, Texas ranger.

828
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,400
Johnny Riva was a Jesus!

829
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,120
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police,

830
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,660
for maybe the Hopi police force.

831
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,100
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.

832
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,680
He was the white brother who came to instruct the Indians

833
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,620
how to be liberal.

834
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,960
Well, what about old peacemaker,

835
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,040
the Jesus of the Iroquois,

836
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,020
who was actually Huron, a Huron.

837
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,460
You didn't know that, did you?

838
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,060
See, I got you!

839
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,420
Thin Ron.

840
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:12,900
Jesus!

841
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,040
El Ron.

842
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:14,640
I got it.

843
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:15,760
Get in the club!

844
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,200
Jesus is like no other Jesus you've ever seen.

845
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,200
Oh, it tastes like butter.

846
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:19,940
A new Jesus.

847
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,100
A different Jesus.

848
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,440
It tastes like crappy pie, children.

849
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:23,800
A future Jesus.

850
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,380
A pipe-smoking Jesus!

851
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,780
Hey, Dave, you know where it is.

852
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,200
Go kick that window open.

853
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,440
I already kicked it.

854
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,520
I'll kick it again, though.

855
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,020
Kick it good this time.

856
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,280
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God.

857
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,100
We hope that...

858
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,020
We thank you for all the nice things

859
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,180
that you've done for us.

860
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,040
This thanks...

861
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,480
Clapping!

862
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,100
We appreciate all that.

863
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,000
And we're just trying to insult your fan club.

864
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:50,540
That's all.

865
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,740
That's why we do this blasphemous stuff.

866
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,380
But we knew that you knew that

867
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,720
because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?

868
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,200
Right.

869
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,460
I could hear him say that.

870
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,080
Praise God and Bob and Jesus.

871
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,000
Next topic.

872
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,180
Next topic.

873
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,400
Terrorist insurance.

874
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,440
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?

875
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,480
And science.

876
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,180
Well, that's the life of Brian, isn't it?

877
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,800
And Greek mythology.

878
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:15,560
Norse mythology.

879
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:16,940
And the sounds of hell.

880
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,640
Jingle, jangle, jingle

881
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,160
We're on a sleigh ride to heck

882
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,960
Santa and his reindeer

883
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,340
Are really wicked

884
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,520
Wrapped in wrapping paper

885
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,120
We're gonna break our necks

886
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,680
Got a rocket in my pocket

887
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,840
On a sleigh ride to heck

888
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,020
Jingle, jangle, jingle

889
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,400
Sleigh ride to heck

890
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,180
Sleigh ride to heck

891
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,860
Sleigh ride to heck

892
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,220
The elves are full of cheer

893
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,980
The kids are tucked in bed

894
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,280
Santa ain't coming

895
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,680
We're on a sleigh ride to heck

896
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,020
Their dreams are filled with toys

897
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,720
But they're out of luck

898
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:25,160
Cause Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to

899
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,060
Sleigh ride to heck

900
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,820
Sleigh ride to heck

901
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,640
Sleigh ride to heck

902
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:44,580
The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends,

903
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:45,000
from his life.

904
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,040
His new album, Don't Trust Whitey,

905
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,320
James Kochalka, Superstar.

906
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,560
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith

907
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,720
that he not only can accept

908
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,620
somebody making fun of Bob,

909
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,280
stomping on a picture of Bob,

910
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,300
he'll do it himself.

911
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,720
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

912
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,440
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

913
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,840
Now, we subgeni,

914
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,480
I hate to get on my soapbox

915
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,080
in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,

916
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,520
but we subgeni may be bad,

917
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,880
but our way of bad is holy,

918
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,320
is holy compared to the evil of so...

919
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,060
Not all, by any means,

920
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,000
but so many American fundamentalists,

921
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,300
charismatics, evangelicals, etc., in general.

922
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,320
Of course, they and their corresponding types

923
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:41,000
in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, etc.,

924
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,980
if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.

925
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,440
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends,

926
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,040
just like Jesus warned about.

927
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,540
I... we're...

928
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,580
Jesus and Bob, like we say,

929
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,700
our old drinking buddies,

930
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,020
got nothing against Jesus.

931
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,940
It's just his fan club.

932
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,200
And now, we aren't saying that Bob

933
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,200
is the ace up God's sleeve.

934
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,780
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief,

935
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,660
just like you or me.

936
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,000
But the uptight rival cults,

937
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,720
they don't think God has a handkerchief.

938
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,860
Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect.

939
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,620
He doesn't even sneeze.

940
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,740
We're made in his image,

941
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,620
except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us,

942
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,880
and we have to go in the secret room,

943
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,280
the bathroom,

944
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,240
to do awful things.

945
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,500
But God, oh, he's clean and pure,

946
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,700
according to them.

947
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,580
Oh, and he's male.

948
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,420
But he doesn't excrete juices and sweat

949
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,260
and smelly stuff out of him like we do.

950
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,700
Because we sinned. Oh, yeah, we all sinned.

951
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,260
We're bad, we're worthless,

952
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,060
we're no good to God

953
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,120
unless we sign a contract with his agent.

954
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,600
God is the best.

955
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:43,600


956
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:43,600


957
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,160
We interrupt this program

958
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,240
for a special promotional announcement.

959
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:47,960
We turn.

960
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,460
E-Bob and the bastards of the universe

961
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,920
will be back after this message.

962
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,400
All right, thank you.

963
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:58,600
This is the end of the show.

Oh, holy night

00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,060
The stars are brightly shining

987
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:35,300
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth

988
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,380
Long lay, long lay the world

989
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,400
In different pining

990
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,880
The pit and the stone mountains red

991
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,200
A thrill of hope

992
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,660
The weary world rejoices

993
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,420
Beyond the grave

994
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,740
A new and glorious dawn

Feeling space.

I have some of my new cocoa pebbles.

Well, friends, what do you think?

1036
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:19,280
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

1037
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,640
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob,

1038
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,300
as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?

1039
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,340
The Jethro's.

1040
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,840
Friends, you need to know where to write to the Jethro's.

1041
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:12,360
They're at, they did that Wreck the Halls and so many other versions we've been playing.

1042
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:18,740
The Jethro's are at 212 and a half Miller.

Otherwise, gosh.

1068
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,420
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

1069
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,120
Our beloved Santa.

1070
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,460
I have wanted to put your bag down for a minute.
