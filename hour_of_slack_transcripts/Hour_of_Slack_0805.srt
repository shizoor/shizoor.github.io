1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
I'm sorry, I'm caught in traffic. It may be a while before anybody can get into the station.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,520
Don't you have an emergency DJ? Somebody with a deep voice hidden in a drawer?

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,280
Just follow the format. You've only got a few more hours.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,960
Well, for a start, I'm going to sit here and get smashed out of my mind.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,640
And I also have it on very good authority that the world is coming to an end.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,620
So I thought I'd go home and watch it on television.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,340
Typical.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,940
Yes, typical.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,720
Come on out, willing slaves. Welcome to radio school.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,600
Don't fight.

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:31,940
Move it.

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,520
Say, where's the student union? Where's the co-ed you promised us?

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,080
Shut up and get inside.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,920
We're not criminals. We just want to learn to talk good on the radio and make big bucks.

15
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,940
You'll all be radio heroes soon. Just climb up, mush mouths, and listen to the boss in the chair.

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:48,900
What boss? Where?

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,600
Oh, you can't see me, can you?

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,700
Well, that's the magic of radio, baby.

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,820
Hey, hello, students. I'm the Lightning Bug.

20
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,320
And welcome to the Lightning Bug School of Pirate Broadcasting.

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,820
Not affiliated with those pirates at the Buggery School of Flycasting.

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:14,460
You whippy noodles will be given new voices and personalities through EST, Electronic Sensuality Transformation.

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,540
I'm going to turn you brown-shoed squares into disc jockeys working for my secret broadcast cave.

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,720
And now, the subgenius, our boss, what?

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,380
Watch me.

26
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,280
They'll dance out of their pants to the sounds you send them.

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,520
And you'll all get French jeans, out-of-sight salaries, and all the coffee and cigarettes you can drink.

28
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,300
You'll be stars, and they won't even know who you are.

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:45,860
J.R. Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs was on the number one list of frauds and phonies for Time Magazine, and I didn't know who he was.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,280
Exactly.

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,240
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is the creator of the Church of the Subgenius.

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,260
This guy, the Reverend Ivan Stang, is one of their...

33
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,760
Disciples.

34
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:55,700
Disciples.

35
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:55,840
Disciples.

36
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,600
Disciples.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,440
Yeah.

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,220
All right.

39
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,900
You know, it's funny.

40
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,560
I don't think Jesus had a disciple named Dopey.

41
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,880
Poor Bob.

42
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,080
You, dipsticks, stars, it makes me laugh.

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,840
Take them to the secret broadcast cave and train them all to talk like me.

44
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,460
Real sexy.

45
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:14,760
Come on.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,640
To help carry on our important work, I want you to join the secret squadron.

47
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,840
I want your blood.

48
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,580
And I want your souls.

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,760
And I want them both right now.

50
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,420
I want you to get up now.

51
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,740
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.

52
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:43,220
I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell,

53
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!

54
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,020
I'm not going to take this anymore!

55
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,340
I'm going to take this anymore!

56
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,120
And I do, too.

57
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,140
Good.

58
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,520
This is Ren Hoak.

59
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,100
And this is Stimpson J. Catt.

60
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,500
Of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

61
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,040
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

62
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,800
Keep listening, you idiots!

63
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

64
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,140
Else I shall kill you!

65
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,420
Nostradamus forecast that Armageddon would come in the 20th century, the days in which we live.

66
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,260
Born in hell, you little green bastard!

67
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,360
Hey, hey look up in the sky!

68
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,660
So what Ozzy, it's just a rainbow.

69
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,080
It's a magic rainbow.

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,660
Hey, what'll it be guys?

71
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,600
I'll have a coffee please.

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,920
Coffee for me too Joey.

73
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,160
Yeah.

74
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,820
Thank you, coffee's great.

75
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,840
I got that war anxiety, my nerves, I'm a bundle of nerves,

76
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,820
it's like it's coming at you from all sides, you try to forget it,

77
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,420
and you turn on the TV, there's a story, all the scuds,

78
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:55,680
Yeah, it's everywhere and stuff.

79
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,300
and Tel Aviv and the blood, and it's gonna get bad.

80
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,760
You look like a bundle of nerves, maybe you could use something to eat.

81
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,500
Look, they got nice Danish over there.

82
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,580
Yeah, I wouldn't touch those Danishes, they're as hard as a rock.

83
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,180
Maybe.

84
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,960
A rock, a rock, a rock, ah there it is, again, a rock.

85
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,000
Hey, wait, wait, wait, it's getting a little late, but a nice, just, just, maybe a nice bowl of cereal, settle your nerves.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,620
A bowl of cereal, well it's a little late in the day for cereal, cereal,

87
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,160
Syria, that's the country that borders the north of Israel,

88
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,720
Hey, hey, hey, calm down, you're going crazy here.

89
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,820
they're gonna get sucked into this war as soon as the Arab coalition goes under, ba-dum!

90
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,960
Change the subject, change the subject, okay?

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,980
Alright, alright, alright, I'm sorry.

92
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,160
You know, your birthday's coming up, right?

93
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,640
My birthday.

94
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,680
That's a happy thing, you know.

95
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,220
That's a happy thing, no more war talking about me.

96
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,140
Maybe you want a nice watch like the one I got here, look at this nice Rolex my wife gave me here.

97
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,900
Hey, yeah, it is a nice watch, is that a fake Rolex or is that real?

98
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,620
No, it's real, real.

99
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,340
It's real, it's real, Israel, Israel again with the Israel,

100
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,480
and Tel Aviv, those poor people, they got the scuds dropped on them,

101
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,120
they don't know, they're gonna snap those people and I'm not gonna blame them when they do.

102
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,360
Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave, let's just talk about our families, okay?

103
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,580
Alright, I'm sorry, I'm all, I'm all, I'm not obsessing on it, it just happens to be that we're in a crisis.

104
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,520
You know, life goes on.

105
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,280
Alright, alright.

106
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,140
How's your kid?

107
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,240
Oh, my big guy, he's great, I get, well, you know, he gets into trouble sometimes,

108
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,180
I had to have a talk with him, you know, I sat him down last night, I sat him down,

109
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,860
Gotta do that sometimes.

110
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,040
And I sat him, sat him, sat him, Hussein, the bloodthirsty butcher of Baghdad.

111
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,220
No, no, no, stop it, stop it.

112
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,460
He's like another hitman.

113
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:17,460


114
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,520
Somebody's gotta stop him, but I don't know how we got, it's over, it's not about making aggression.

115
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,140
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you know, I know what you like, football.

116
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,760
Football, let's talk football.

117
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,480
Now, who's gonna do it, the Giants or the Bills?

118
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, the Giants, you can bet the Giants, I'd put money on that.

119
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,520
Nah, I bet it's gonna be the Bills, cause, you know, it'll be over quick, man, the Bills,

120
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,540
Half hour, I bet, the whole thing.

121
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,400
Half hour, you bet, half hour, half hour, Albertine, half hour, Albertine.

122
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,600
What are you talking about?

123
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,100
Half hour, Albertine, don't you read the papers?

124
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,440
Half hour, Albertine, don't you read the papers?

125
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,300
Half hour, Albertine is a base where they keep missiles there, those Tomahawk cruise missiles,

126
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,840
they're launched from command centers and they're gonna go up against the Scuds, everything reminds me of that.

127
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,320
He's gonna take the order, we can have something nice to eat.

128
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,980
Alright, alright.

129
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,320
You guys ready to order?

130
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,240
Yeah, what are your specials today?

131
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,500
Specials today is barbecued sparabs.

132
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,680
Sparabs, that sounds pretty good, I'll try the sparabs.

133
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,400
Sparabs I like, sparabs, sparabs, Arabs, Arabs, and there we go in the war again, I can't stop this.

134
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,740
No, no, don't do this to yourselves, don't do this to yourself like this.

135
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,960
You can't let this take over your life.

136
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,440
No, no, not the end of the world, it's just this little guy out there.

137
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:38,200
I mean, Scud, see I'm doing it now, I'm doing it, look at my plate, it rhymes with Kuwait, Kuwait, Kuwait.

138
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,060
Why were you Mrs. Grey? I'd get out of here while you still got time.

139
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,700
Few days will put you in Fort Dobbs.

140
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,420
You'll be safe there.

141
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,280
Oh, don't grit.

142
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,780
Okay, grit, don't grit.

143
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,600
Ahhhhhhh!

144
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,680
Apparently, Bob came and did something with all of us.

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,460
You've got to see this guy for what he is.

146
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,960
He's a maniac out to rule the world.

147
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
What can I do to make you understand?

148
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,780
I love you.

149
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,160
Annihilate, kill, kill.

150
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,680
Sure hate to shoot you in the back like this, but it's the law of the west.

151
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,440
You ain't gonna hit me again, are you?

152
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,180
Now let's see you just drop them pants.

153
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,920
Watch that buzzard, mister.

154
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,840
CUT IT OUT!

155
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,060
My equilibrium, destabilized.

156
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:39,860
Now that's a little rough, and that doesn't sound too good to the polished ears of the liberals and the modernists, so they soften it down, you see.

157
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,480
And of course they would read that verse, let God be true in every man.

158
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,340
Uh, be an untruth in a measure to a degree by chance in my opinion, they'd say.

159
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:50,900
Ha ha.

160
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,020
Yeah, let's soften that because somebody might get offended.

161
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,920
Mm-hmm, yeah.

162
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,660
But the Bible says let God be true and let every man be a liar.

163
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,740
But God could blame him if he almost took up the trouble he had, of course.

164
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:33,740


165
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:33,820
Annihilate, kill.

166
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,100
Oh!

167
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,340
Oh!

168
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,460
Talagallus!

169
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:44,460


170
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,200
Go, go, go, go.

171
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,520
Go, go, go, go.

172
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,980
An airplane flight shouldn't be completely safe.

173
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,940
You need a little danger in your life.

174
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,760
Take a fucking chance once in a while, will you?

175
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,620
What are you going to do?

176
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,540
Play with your prick for another 30 years?

177
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,200
What, are you going to read People magazine

178
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,220
and eat at Wendy's till the end of time?

179
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,440
Take a fucking chance.

180
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,680
What do they can decide?

181
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,700
No, we already know

182
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,660
That we are here to go.

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,600
We are here to go.

184
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,320
We are here to go.

185
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,000
We are here to go.

186
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,620
We are here to-

187
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,520
Go, go, go, go, go.

188
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,440
What is real in mind?

189
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,260
What's at the top of the pile?

190
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,000
Where does he draw the line?

191
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,520
Let them figure it out.

192
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,040
Go on and step across.

193
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,920
Just remind yourself that we all need to go.

194
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,460
The odds of you being killed by a terrorist are practically zero.

195
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,960
So I say relax and enjoy the show.

196
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,660
You have to be a realist.

197
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,660
You have to be realistic about terrorism.

198
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:51,240
Certain groups of people, certain groups, Muslim fundamentalists, Christian fundamentalists, Jewish fundamentalists, and just plain guys from Montana.

199
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,580
Are going to continue to make life in this country very interesting for a long, long time.

200
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,960
That's the reality.

201
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,880
Angry men in combat fatigues talking to God on a two-way radio.

202
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,240
And muttering incoherent slogans about freedom are eventually going to provide us with a great deal of entertainment.

203
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:16,520
Especially after your stupid fucking economy collapses all around you and the terrorists come out of the woodwork.

204
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,960
You'll have anthrax in the water supply and sarin gas in your air conditioners.

205
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,740
There'll be chemical and biological superpowers.

206
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,720
Case bombs in every city.

207
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,060
And I say enjoy it.

208
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,520
Relax.

209
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,700
Enjoy the show.

210
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,620
Take a fucking chance.

211
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,100
Put a little fun in your life.

212
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,260
I'm not close to love.

213
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,740
I'm not close to love.

214
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,340
I'm not close to love.

215
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,040
Go.

216
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,260


217
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:22,900
Go.

218
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,600
Go.

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,560
Go.

220
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:24,840
Go.

221
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,580
Go.

222
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,520
Go.

223
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,040
Go.

224
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:27,660
Go.

225
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,240
Go.

226
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:28,860
Go.

227
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,540
Go.

228
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:29,980
Go.

229
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,220
Go.

230
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,540
Go.

231
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,000
Go.

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,120
Go.

233
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,180
Go.

234
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,300
Go.

235
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,400
What is really in mind?

236
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,220
Who's at the top of the pipe?

237
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,060
Where does he draw the line?

238
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,540
Let them figure it out.

239
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,060
Go on and step across.

240
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,960
Just remind yourself that we all need to go.

241
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,700
Go.

242
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,620
Go.

243
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,560
Go.

244
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,400
Go.

245
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,220
Go.

246
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,400
Go.

247
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,100
Go.

248
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,620
To me, terrorism is exciting.

249
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,760
It's exciting.

250
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,500
I think the very idea that you can set off a bomb in a marketplace

251
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,560
and kill several hundred people is exciting and stimulating,

252
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,460
and I see it as a form of entertainment.

253
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,460
Entertainment, that's all it is.

254
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,560
Yeah.

255
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,840
Shit.

256
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,960
Take a fucking chance, bunch of goddamn pussies.

257
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,160
Oh, friends.

258
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,540
The times are grim,

259
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,820
but we try not to be.

260
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,740
The ranting there was by George Carlin,

261
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,420
I wonder how he feels about that particular rant now,

262
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,960
but that was mixed in with the Devo song

263
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,420
by Reverend Phineas Narco of Midnight Voice Jail,

264
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,260
which is part of the National Cynical Network.

265
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,700
You can find Midnight Voice Jail on the World Wide Web.

266
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,560
That's the only place you can find it.

267
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,540
Before that, friends,

268
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,380
um,

269
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,700
a collage by me of clips and collages sent in

270
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,820
by champion Jack Codini,

271
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,420
New Monet,

272
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,880
and Artemia Salina,

273
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,300
or Salina,

274
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,100
or whatever,

275
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,780
from Alt Binary Slack,

276
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,000
and the war anxiety comedy piece about the Gulf War

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,860
was by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy and Billy West.

278
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,680
The radio school thing came off of a puzzling evidence show,

279
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,940
from a couple of months ago.

280
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
There's a lot more puzzling evidence,

281
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,440
old puzzling evidence KPFA show,

282
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,680
very pertinent, however,

283
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,860
with special guest Papa Joe Mama,

284
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,380
and of course, Dr. Howell.

285
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,040
And now, Frank Zappa.

286
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,040
Some take the Bible for what it's worth

287
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,520
When it says that the meat shall inherit me

288
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,300
Well, I heard that some sheik

289
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,540
Has bought New Jersey last week

290
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,020
And you suckers ain't getting nothing

291
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,180
Is Harirama really wrong?

292
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:47,320
If you wander around with a napkin on

293
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,440
With a bell on a stick

294
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,740
And a pen on a stick

295
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,780
And your hair is all gone

296
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,000
The geek shall inherit nothing

297
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,840
You say your life's a fun deal

298
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,960
And you're up against the wall

299
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,260
Well, people, you ain't even got no kind of deal at all

300
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,180
Cause what they do

301
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,000
In Washington

302
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,960
They just take care of number one

303
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,580
And number one ain't you

304
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,640
You ain't even number two

305
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,420
Well, Jesus freaks

306
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,180
Well, they're friendly, but

307
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,340
The dish they believe

308
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,480
Has got their minds all shut

309
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,780
And they don't even care

310
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,160
When the church takes a cut

311
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,420
Ain't it bleak when you got so much nothing?

312
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,260
So what do you do?

313
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:06,780
Hey!

314
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,000
Eat that pork

315
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,580
Eat that ham

316
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,500
Laugh till you choke on Billy Graham

317
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,220
Moses, Aaron, and Abraham

318
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,900
They're all a waste of time

319
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,740
And it's your ass that's on the line

320
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,820
It's your ass that's on the line

321
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,260
Do what you wanna

322
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,040
Do what you will

323
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:42,180
Just don't mess up your neighbor's bill

324
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,380
And when you pay the bill

325
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,420
Kindly leave a little tip

326
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,180
And help the next poor sucker

327
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,740
On his one-way trip

328
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,000
Some take the pie

329
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,540
Whoa, whoa

330
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,000
Whoa

331
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,680
Oh, give me half a dozen for the hotel room

332
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,880
And so it came to pass

333
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,640
That outer space convened a high tribunal

334
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,280
To see whether mankind was worth saving

335
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,780
Chosen to speak in his behalf

336
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,780
Was a wanderer through time

337
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,860
Who was a combination of all men

338
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,080
Of the pious and the fallen

339
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,880
The bold and the meek

340
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,160
The dreamers and the builders

341
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,380
The chaste and the guilty

342
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,760
The great and the poor

343
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,320
The rich and the small

344
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,380
Men of all times

345
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,860
All represented by one

346
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,840
Who came to speak for all

347
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,600
Before the high tribunal

348
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,460
Bob?

349
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,720
Bob?

350
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,440
What?

351
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,700
Bob, save some for me

352
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,320
Don't worry about it

353
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,500
Pathetic

354
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,880
You don't feel so cocky now, do you?

355
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,840
Whatever he's paying you

356
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,540
I'll double it right now

357
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,760
You know what the tragedy is here, Bob?

358
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,660
We could have been friends

359
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,180
But you wouldn't go through proper channels

360
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,860
You went over my head

361
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,960
That hurt

362
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,880
But life goes on

363
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,760
It's an old story

364
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,960
The fight for love and glory, huh, Bob?

365
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,120
It helps if you think of it as a game, Bob

366
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,440
Every game has a winner

367
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,840
And a loser

368
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,380
I'm cashing you out, Bob

369
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,440
Bob?

370
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,440
People are calling in trying to escape the show

371
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,840
They've given up all hope

372
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,400
That Bob will straighten out and fly right

373
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,420
We're just mopping up

374
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,080
It's almost all over down here

375
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,640
The operation's almost done

376
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,240
35 minutes left until the next news update

377
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,300
Turns out they've bombed Dobbs town again and we heard that Dobbs has sent his family

378
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,500
back to Malaysia.

379
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,120
But cut those potatoes in exactly one inch cubes.

380
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:24,300
That's our military subgenius specification on those potatoes is one inch cubes only.

381
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,160
Anything bigger or smaller are going to have to be set back for retrofit.

382
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,460
So you may go back to sleep for approximately 20 minutes but then I expect to find you at

383
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,580
your post.

384
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,820
Bye now.

385
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,900
The poor EO Hippas is not used to the war yet.

386
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,340
The war visits her.

387
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,380
As it will visit all of us.

388
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,100
The blocky boots fall down to the ground.

389
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,500
The farmer screams.

390
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,920
off the mountains

391
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,960
my sockets looked down on the chest bone

392
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,320
meadows and the sun dropped down

393
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,960
and the moon ran off

394
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,860
his heels and elbows

395
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,220
and he was chalked

396
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,620
in all the comets to lighten the dust

397
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,920
for

398
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,460
fear they'd be seen

399
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,960
in the sky turned white in the middle of the night

400
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,220
in the sky turned white in the middle of the night

401
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,880
and the big floppy boots

402
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,640
started down into the ground

403
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,480
and the red violin

404
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,940
took the boat for to do the

405
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,580
hoot-doo-ho-down

406
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,500
and the red violin

407
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,540
took the boat for to do the

408
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,180
hoot-doo-ho-down

409
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,440
mama jumped in a circle

410
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,340
and played a chuck right down

411
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,640
ha!

412
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,500
hoot-doo

413
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:55,940
hoot-doo

414
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,860
hoot-doo

415
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,640
do-shit-do

416
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,900
the devil chose to

417
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,700
take expressing

418
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:01,800
ha!

419
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:02,660
hoo-doo

420
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,780
through the fog

421
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,200
hmm

422
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,760
and a farmer's

423
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,560
floppy boots

424
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,220
stomp down

425
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,480
red-tailed

426
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:13,900
scream

427
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,780
the hot leg

428
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,140
kicked

429
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,940
and the fire

430
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,040
leaped and lit

431
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,240
red-tailed

432
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,600
scream

433
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,340
the hot leg

434
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:19,620
kicked

435
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,440
and the fire

436
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,600
leaped and lit

437
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,580
and when the boot

438
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,200
came up

439
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,040
the fire

440
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,700
went out

441
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
and hell

442
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,560
was just an ice cube melting off in the ground.

443
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,220
It fell in the wrong circle.

444
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,120
He had a sore red tail.

445
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,120
Once went red, now was pale.

446
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,520
Feet full of five thumb, he was summoned up from hell.

447
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,620
Booted down a spell by a square dancing farmer.

448
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,040
By a square dancing farmer, well.

449
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,340
That old bum was sticking out his thumb when the farmer drew up.

450
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,780
Said, listen, son.

451
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,860
Son, in the horse come paddies, hooves.

452
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,040
If you fall in my circle again, I'll tan your red hide and dance you on your tail.

453
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,360
And pitch you from now to now.

454
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,200
Pitch you from now to now.

455
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,140
In a hot lead kitchen, a fire leads to lit.

456
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,720
In a hot lead kitchen, a fire leads to lit.

457
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,760
In a hot lead kitchen.

458
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,860
In a fire just leads to lit.

459
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,680
In a hot lead kitchen, a fire leads to lit.

460
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,780
In a hot lead kitchen, on a pile leads to lit.

461
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,080
In a hot lead kitchen, on a pile just leads and they can

462
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,480
The fire leads to lit!

463
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,080
Foggy breasts far down, to the ground.

464
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,320
Foggy breasts far down to the ground.

465
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,620
Fly me blue, storm down, to the ground.

466
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,820
Fly me blue, storm down, to the ground.

467
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,300
Fly me blue, storm down, to the ground.

468
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,220
Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band, friends from Shiny Beast.

469
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,340
Coming up, some ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland

470
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,600
with Dances with Rockets' Lone Cow Dave

471
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,880
and special guest Dr. Legume and Vagina Jones.

472
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:03,620
But first, on our own show, Reverend Pat Robertson.

473
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,640
Ladies and gentlemen, what we have going on here in the Middle East

474
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,020
is a situation that is filling biblical prophecy from 2,000 years ago.

475
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,440
You dumb chief.

476
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,300
Sheila, Pat will point this out.

477
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,320
Sheila, that's a delicious cake.

478
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,500
Thank you for providing it, by the way.

479
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm going to have to have another point.

480
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,420
It's really delicious, and we're going to share that recipe with our viewers at home here.

481
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,400
We can't wait.

482
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,920
But unfortunately, Sheila, we have a real difficult problem here in the Middle East

483
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,580
because, you see, those who bless Israel will be blessed,

484
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,400
but those that curse Israel will be cursed.

485
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,040
And Saddam Hussein, whose name begins with an H like Hitler

486
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,200
and whose name sounds insane,

487
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
like someone who's...

488
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,180
who's insane, is definitely cursing Israel.

489
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,140
And so we have what we call an obligation to hell.

490
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,740
It sounds like, you know, in those cities of the plain, Sodom and Gomorrah.

491
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,440
We have decided to send a good percentage of the money that you send

492
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,880
at that toll-free number at the bottom of your screen.

493
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,460
If you will just pledge that money immediately.

494
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,100
Because, see, friends, the anti-times are coming

495
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,260
and the anti-Christ, that is Satan, as precisely,

496
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,100
as the name of the book of Revelation, is here.

497
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,240
And contrary to what most people think,

498
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,000
Satan just is not going to wear a little red outfit.

499
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,180
He's not going to be carrying a fish for you.

500
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,220
He's going to look like a real person,

501
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,820
perhaps someone you know and trust.

502
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:42,360
Maybe even a televangelist who's always on the verge of constant laughter.

503
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,580
So please, send those pledges now.

504
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,460
You haven't seen any suspicious people hanging around lately, have you?

505
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,320
Well, if you have...

506
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,320


507
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,240
it might be the boy from below.

508
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,300
The man from the basement.

509
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,340
I mean the sub-basement.

510
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,280
Oh, that's right.

511
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,040
They have been seen to crawl out at these times and days,

512
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,160
and sometimes at the end of times.

513
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,740
And some call them gremlins,

514
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,040
others call them little devils,

515
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,580
but we know them as anti-bombs.

516
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,700
See what's on the radio, huh?

517
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,100
Yeah, see if ballroom dancing is on.

518
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,760
See, those guys on there doing that funny show?

519
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,300
Is that supposed to be some kind of...

520
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,200
I don't think it's supposed to be funny anymore.

521
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,460
Things are too serious.

522
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,900
As we stand here on the brink of nuclear Armageddon,

523
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,680
how can even someone think about it?

524
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,660
Yeah, and Armageddon's sick of it anyway.

525
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,100
Why don't they just drop it and get it over with?

526
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:39,240
In my book, One American Life is worth all the lives in all of Iraq.

527
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:44,440
I urge that we use the atomic option if it can be used efficiently.

528
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,120
And I urge that we do so now.

529
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,640
My constituents agree with me wholeheartedly.

530
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,280
So we can achieve a sufficient life.

531
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:52,280


532
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,580
Good boy, Krieg.

533
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,660
I don't know, impressive.

534
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,260
That's not the answer I asked you to give!

535
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,640
It doesn't come to that yet.

536
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,280
No matter how many days I look at Arun & Anu's relationship with automobile movers.

537
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,280


538
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,320
Their relationship's a huge part of what we're doing.

539
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:20,500
We value bilinguality so that no one's always has to pay their viability bills.

540
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,640
tools. The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked

541
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,780
and when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad. I really believe

542
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:37,700
that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who

543
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,560
are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American

544
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:49,900
Way, all of them who tried to secularize America, I point the thing in their face and say, you

545
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,780
helped this happen.

546
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,500
Well, I totally concur and the problem is we have adopted that agenda at the highest

547
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,620
levels of our government and so we're responsible as a free society for what the top people

548
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,960
do and the top people, of course, the court system.

549
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:04,620
Amen.

550
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,360
Amen.

551
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,120
Amen.

552
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:39,940
Amen.

553
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,320
Amen.

554
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:42,640
Amen.

555
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:42,640


556
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:42,640


557
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:42,640


558
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:42,640


559
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:42,640


560
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,240
That's right.

561
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,180
You asked for it.

562
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,440
Remember?

563
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,180
Remember, there's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over.

564
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,180
He's got $20 million in his heavenly bank account.

565
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,840
All from those chumps who was born again.

566
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,900
Oh, yeah.

567
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,960
Oh, yeah.

568
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,260
He's got seven limousines and a ride-a-plane.

569
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,940
All for the use of his special friends.

570
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,840
Oh, yeah.

571
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,900
Oh, yeah.

572
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,100
He's got $1,000 suits and a Wembley tie.

573
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:42,380
Girls love to stroke it while he's on the phone.

574
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,260
Oh, yeah.

575
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,280
Oh, yeah.

576
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,940
And the House of Representatives, he's a groovy guy.

577
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,340
When he gives thanks, he is not alone.

578
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,260
He is dealing, he is really dealing.

579
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,160
IRS can determine where the hook is.

580
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,560
It is easy with the Bible to pretend that you're in showbiz.

581
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,600
And you are.

582
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,500
And the two.

583
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,420
And you are.

584
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,040
They will get him.

585
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,960
They will never get him.

586
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,240
Pull them.

587
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,320
There is the naughty stuff that he did.

588
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,300
And it's best in cases like this

589
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,040
to pretend that you are stupendous.

590
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,880
He's got residential help all along the way.

591
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,380
He says the grace while the lawyers chew.

592
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,560
Oh yeah, they sure do.

593
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,140
And the Governors agree to say

594
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,220
He's a lovely man

595
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,640
He makes it easier

596
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,180
For them to screw

597
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,440
All of you

598
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,480
Yes, that's true

599
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,980
Cause he helps put the fear of God

600
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,020
In the common man

601
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,220
Snatching up money

602
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,100
Everywhere he can

603
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,140
Oh yeah

604
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,720
Oh yeah

605
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,220
He's got twenty million dollars

606
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,660
In his heavenly bank account

607
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,120
You ain't got nothing, people

608
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,460
You ain't got nothing, people

609
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,860
You ain't got nothing, people

610
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,080
Thank the Lord

611
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,080


612
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,720
Man

613
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,340
Whoa

614
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,600
Yeah

615
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,640
Hey

616
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,340
Hey

617
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,740
I don't understand it

618
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,280
I was trying to change the subject

619
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:57,700
You people aren't American at all

620
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,900
Because the whole thing actually just bums me out

621
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,180
If I go into the real world for very long

622
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,660
I get so sick at heart and disgusted

623
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,040
And confused

624
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,900
That I prefer to stay in this little fantasy land

625
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,440
Of sick humor and subgenius artwork

626
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,080
I don't understand it

627
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,640
I try like baby

628
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,060
Surrounded by Dobbs heads

629
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,140
I am often crying

630
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,740
This world is so nauseating to me

631
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,160
They make me feel much more protected

632
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,300
What are you gonna do when a 757

633
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,240
Comes tearing through your wall

634
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,360
And tearing down all your Dobbs heads

635
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,460
Well even before this end

636
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,500
You have to worry about your hands are glowing

637
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,000
Sometimes parts of your body are falling off

638
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,860
What are you gonna do when Bin Laden comes after you

639
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,420
Come knocking on your door

640
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,100
You know Chas, Voltaire said

641
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,560
If you want to change the world

642
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,920
Cultivate your garden

643
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,420
Thomas Jefferson said

644
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,060
I think I'm going to go in my bed and go to bed

645
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,940
And the price of freedom is diligence

646
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,220
Yes, well I think I'll work on my own personal freedom

647
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,920
And my own personal kingdom

648
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,580
Liberty is a cracked bell

649
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,900
Which isn't very big

650
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,420
But it is mine

651
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,740
Oh screw it all

652
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,960
You sound like a bunch of spoiled brats

653
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,000
You should get back to the basics

654
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,240
The basics

655
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,960
Seek comfort my brothers

656
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,800
In the city

657
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,200
To me there's nothing like eating a pound of dog food

658
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,480
And all you need in life

659
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,060
Was that titty

660
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,220
Get back to the titty brothers

661
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,640
Back to the titty

662
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,480
How can anyone argue with that

663
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,620
That's what I said

664
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,760
That's what we said earlier

665
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,340
They're not getting enough titty

666
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,660
Don't worry about your job

667
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,460
Don't worry about

668
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:33,980
Terrorism

669
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,200
Or anything

670
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,700
Everybody's just got enough titty

671
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,960
They're uptight about the titty

672
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,740
Mammon is the mammary we suck

673
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,760
They can't just say

674
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,460
They're uptight about the titty

675
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,740
That's a beautiful titty

676
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,120
That's such a lovely titty

677
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,420
And just

678
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,120
You know

679
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,800
Leave it at that

680
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,500
Leave it out

681
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,060
No they have to cut it off

682
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,780
No they gotta

683
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,500
Or hide it away

684
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,000
Or get a little

685
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,100
You know

686
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,100
Put an airplane into it

687
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,300
And then

688
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,240
Sublimate it

689
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,260
They gotta replace it

690
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,180
With a

691
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,200
With God

692
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,560
Or some big ugly rock in the desert

693
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,960
What do they know of

694
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,000
The glories

695
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,080
Of the round soft things

696
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,700
That is the birthright

697
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,960
Of every primate

698
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,380
Every mammal nay

699
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,020
Indeed every mammal

700
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,460
Loves the soft things

701
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,280
Loves the soft round things

702
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,540
This is a hardwired

703
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,140
Instinctive thing

704
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,780
The teat is the friend

705
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,400
Of all living things

706
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,440
Men and women love the titties

707
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,080
Do they not

708
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,240
Now come on admit it

709
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,420
Just as the childish

710
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,280
How can

711
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,080
And yet

712
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,500
The mighty lion enjoy the teat

713
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,400
The gun is good

714
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,200
The gun is good

715
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,780
The penis is evil

716
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,300
The penis shoots seeds

717
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,980
Jesus Christ

718
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,260
No it's still coming

719
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,760
It hasn't even been touched

720
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,080
It's shooting lightning bolts from its eyes

721
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,180
The flames are being blown from the sky one by one

722
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,800
Trouble on Mars

723
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,720
How nice

724
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,580
Hey just sit down relax now

725
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,500
As I put your feet up on the table

726
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,340
Like you were the king of this smorgasbord

727
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,320
It's your day here

728
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,180
Open wide

729
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,600
You're a subgenius

730
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,100
Now you

731
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,640
Spread em

732
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,820
You paid your thirty dollars

733
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,040
And you're all

734
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,220
This will be a little cold when it comes in

735
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,280
Yeah don't worry about the feelings of you know

736
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,100
Like climbing up there

737
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,180
Just relax man

738
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,460
Just relax

739
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,160
Relax those muscles

740
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,540
Relax those muscles

741
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,500
Quite natural there W

742
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,860
Just hang on

743
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,160
It's okay

744
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,900
It's gonna be over in a second

745
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,960
You'll feel a little prodding

746
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,680
Now if your eyes begin to bleed

747
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,580
Don't move your fingers here

748
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,220
We'll just take care of it for you

749
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
Don't mind that squiggling inside

750
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:31,580
Alright you'll be seeing Bob any second now Mr. President

751
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,560
Oh yeah there's a lot of usually some intestinal discomfort

752
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,440
Yes of course

753
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,860
We're gonna be stepping back here a little bit

754
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,140
We don't think it's gonna get messy

755
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,740
Can you imagine what that wreck could look like?

756
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,120
The troops go marching into Kuwait

757
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:48,620
Preparing to liberate the innocent Kuwaitians against the evil Barakas, Khode and Sadani

758
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:55,220
They know that the Arakian army cannot stand up against the will of the Emperor's troops

759
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:02,500
The evil Emperor who has secretly moved his troops under the guise of a UN resolution

760
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,800
Into position to take over the planet

761
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,900
Alright check off-route mine infrared sensors

762
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,300
They know that only through the guise of liberation

763
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,520
Fire projectile targets when they reach optimum position

764
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,940
The will of the Satan who say

765
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,720
Improved surveillance, target acquisition, intelligence gathering and dissemination systems all checked

766
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,060
I don't think it's very funny to make fun of this war

767
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:24,540
Forward

768
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,640
Command control communications and intelligence

769
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:28,940
It's the...

770
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,720
3C cubed is the way the war is happening

771
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,000
Stand off engagement of armor

772
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,540
Composite armor, main armor, special armor elements, ceramic plate, carrier material

773
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,160
It's war I just, I don't understand this

774
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,000
Operation protection, bulkhead armor, external bulkhead, bulkhead surveillance and general bulkhead accuracy

775
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,200
C3L systems are likewise patient to successful implementation

776
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,820
The Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, JTIDS

777
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,140
Presently in development with 10 units purchased for testing

778
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,220
Will be deployed in 580 units by FY90 single channel ground air

779
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,740
Perhaps something dangerous

780
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,920
Why does an increase of muzzle walls seem like a corresponding to the increase of the armor?

781
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,320
The

782
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:11,980
The

783
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,220
The

784
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:14,840
The

785
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,120
The

786
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,140
The

787
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,460
The

788
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,900
The

789
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,420
The The

790
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,080
The The

791
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:56,600
The The The

792
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,760
RAGE

793
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:01,760


794
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,880
calorie

795
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:03,420


796
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:03,440
Insane

797
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,140
Insane

798
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,400
Insane

799
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:04,880
Insane

800
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,320
crazy

801
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,180
Man who's saying here? We've got superior to

802
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,600
I could have sworn it was J.R. You shot him

803
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,360
Bob

804
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,420
If you are wise you listen to me

805
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:58,100
Eating as much as an elephant eats. What are you at getting terribly fat?

806
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,860
What do you think?

807
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,560
That I

808
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,720
Don't like the look

809
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:04,860
Of my

810
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,080
Love it

811
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,880
Oompa loompa doompadee da

812
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,380
If you're not greedy you will go far

813
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,780
You will live in happiness too

814
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,060
Likely

815
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,880
Oompa loompa doompadee doo

816
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,440
Doompadee doo

817
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,320
Bob?

818
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,020
Now shrunken heads for all occasions

819
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,280
Collect them, swap them, give them to your witch doctor friends

820
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,840
Nothing's coming

821
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,700
Nothing's happening to my brain, it's all dried up

822
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,880
It even vibrates

823
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,700
It was terrible, it was just terrible

824
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,900
I'll never get over it as long as I live

825
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,980
You on drugs

826
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,160
You'd be ashamed of yourself

827
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,380
Sounds like it's having a hallucinogenic effect

828
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,340
Not like a drug which is harmful and wrong and just say no kids

829
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,440
But spacey nonetheless

830
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,060
I won't go schizo will I?

831
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,080
We'll uh, we'll talk to Bob

832
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Thank you Mr. Know-it-all

833
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:03,020
Ain't nothing better than when you got a burning love and a Blackhawk helicopter to let it out with

834
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,560
The drama is forced to sink off TDSA

835
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,860
Sign up now kids

836
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,340
North Africa

837
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,820
Get down to your local recruiting station there

838
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,080
Get Napoleon, think about T.D.

839
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,840
Sign your name on that dotted line

840
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,080
Do it tomorrow

841
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,740
Hey Chaz, hey Chaz, did you ever hear of this book called All Quiet on the Western Front?

842
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,280
The professor that sent all the kids off and they all died

843
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,440
They came back and they wanted to kill them and they couldn't figure out why

844
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,520
Oh that was World War I back when there was blood and stuff

845
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,880
I saw the Gulf War on TV

846
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Nothing bad happens now

847
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,340
That's right there was no blood now

848
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,000
Go sign up

849
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,700
Smart bombs you know

850
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,760
Don't listen to them

851
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,280
Those things always work

852
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,020
Those doves though, those peace doves over there

853
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,720
There ain't no flapping people

854
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,340
Flapping your lips there

855
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,460
We'll get that madman Hoosen

856
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,020
Don't you worry about nothing

857
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,640
Here we go

858
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,480
Yee-haw

859
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,960
Hold it, hold it, hold it

860
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,380
Fire one, fire two, fire three, fire four and a half

861
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,760
Hey he's slap happy

862
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,540
Yee-haw

863
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,440
Here comes some tracer

864
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,740
Here's a self-destruction device

865
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,860
Here's a high explosive device

866
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,740
Here's an incendiary target

867
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,260
Here's a nose pad

868
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,040
We're ready for this all night

869
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,960
Yee-haw

870
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,460
Japanese Wada sees great computers

871
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,420
And we got a bunch of bullets

872
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,840
And we're gonna kick some

873
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,020
High-rope technically initiated explosive now

874
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,440
Oh my goodness look at that

875
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,560
A great big crater

876
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,440
Performance increase by transition from 80 millimeter gun to the 100 millimeter gun

877
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:29,380
And finally we should all sit up and listen to Jackie Jones, an army lieutenant

878
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,060
When she says

879
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,320
That's called upon Hollywood and Walter and J.T. and Jackie

880
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,180
As you can see dear friends, in the subgenius universe the war never ended

881
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,080
Maybe it never will

882
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,900
Get the war on man

883
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,400
This is ridiculous

884
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,860
We can't have war

885
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,820
This is the peaceful times

886
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,780
We've reunified Germany after all

887
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,800
Gorbachev is on our side

888
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:00,740
Our commission is worried that the war will damage the small ecologically sensitive community of monsters

889
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,860
And I had no idea

890
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:10,700
And my colleagues sincerely believe that military exercises should not be conducted in the vicinity of Monster Island

891
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,240
You are brothers

892
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,680
You must have these exercises in the vicinity of Monster Island

893
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,200
Because this is the only place that the Roidians can be had

894
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,400
You are a fool

895
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,460
If these exercises are held near Monster Island

896
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,280
I will not answer for the consequences

897
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,800
Oh his lips are moving at a different pace

898
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,640
The words come out

899
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,420
Order in the court

900
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,000
This is the only place where this can happen

901
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,360
I see what Tetsuo means

902
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:33,960
Yes

903
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,940
The third world war might begin any minute

904
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,880
We'll all be killed

905
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,940
Why should we bother about giant turtles?

906
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,700
Yes, maybe you're right

907
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,980
I know how much you love your turtles

908
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,520
But there are other things in life just as important

909
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,900
Like having friends

910
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,140
Our ancient legends did mention fire-eating turtles

911
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,900
Remember, the next time if you are naughty again

912
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,940
I'll shave your heads

913
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,420
And we can't waste any time

914
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,940
Because while they are sleeping

915
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,840
We'll eat their brains raw

916
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,620
Let's eat the kids later

917
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,220
And let's fix the spacecraft first

918
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,780
You are new here

919
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,720
And we don't expect you to believe us

920
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,780
When we tell you how bad it is

921
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,180
It is a flat scary jungle

922
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,280
Thick with scrub trees and tall grass

923
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,700
Hot and wet in intermittent rain

924
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,060
And strong tropical dragonflies

925
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,940
And Vietcong sniper bullets

926
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,540
You are a long, long way from Port Riley now

927
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:37,840
And there is no Jersey Cafe in town on Washington Street

928
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,020
Where you can sit around the counter eating hamburgers

929
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:46,840
And sipping coffee without having to be afraid a bomb might go off

930
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,080
Like it did at that restaurant in Saigon a few weeks back

931
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,800
You can get killed here

932
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,920
Get out while you are still alive

933
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,920
And before it's too late

934
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,660
Start to goено

935
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,580
Or Presto

936
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:32,460
Can you control the Air Force?

937
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:32,520
классity

938
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,120
People are scum, humanity sucks, all you care about is your neighbor, it's who he fucks,

939
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,200
I know about you, you think you're tough snot, deep in your heart, you know you're not, you

940
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,040
are just like the next guy, full of shit, you know it's true, but you can't face it,

941
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,880
just like you and the crap that you spew in your high-minded tribe makes me want to puke,

942
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,500
think about you, what you think about me, I'm king of the scum, cause that's all I can

943
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:58,780
see.

944
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,360
But I love you anyway.

945
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,660
I love you anyway.

946
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,400
I love you anyway.

947
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:02,040
I love you anyway.

948
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,520
I love you anyway.

949
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:42,020
But upcoming, next, is a collage, and it's whatever, by the great, groovy Neptune.

950
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,100
I don't care who you are.

951
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:18,360
Head for the mountains, where the beer-fuzzin' fountain boys, drunk like a bum, countin' up

952
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:25,140
his countenance, astounded in the flip effect of a trip you rigged, whatever the set.

953
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,380
It's dissection of the insect intellect, boy.

954
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:30,560


955
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:31,820
Boy.

956
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


957
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


958
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


959
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


960
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


961
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


962
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


963
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


964
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


965
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


966
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


967
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


968
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


969
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


970
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


971
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:32,520


972
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,080
Boy.

973
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:41,160
Bug brain go-bots, while the anvils they drop, one after another, that X marks the

974
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:41,440
spot.

975
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:51,580
Boys, I tell you, them brains are defected, with their master's blood out of my face.

976
00:49:53,200 --> 00:50:01,040
With my son, you're headed for destruction, you're living a life through sin and corruption.

977
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,740
Ha!

978
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,200
Ha!

979
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:09,540
You can suck a dick for talking that shit about the way I function.

980
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,540
It's all over.

981
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,720
Come on, child.

982
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,940
You can take my hand.

983
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,040
Damn.

984
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:38,420
Blessed is the day you give up your own control over your own lame brain.

985
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,100
Do you love the queen of pussies?

986
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:46,280
Pretending you know what the game is, but who really deals the cards?

987
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,320
You as long as me.

988
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,380
We're both retards.

989
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,560
Ah, yes, the great groovy Neptune, dear friends, from his demo album Demolition.

990
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:11,100
You can know more of the great groovy Neptune on the web.

991
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:16,420
Check out Neptune.itco.com.

992
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,360
Neptune.i-t-c-o.com.

993
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,040
And now, friends, a blast from somebody's past.

994
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:29,840
More of Willy Wonka's terrifying hell.

995
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:30,220
First.

996
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,060
Oompa loompa, oompa loompa, oompa.

997
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,460
I've got another puzzle for you.

998
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:41,280
Oompa loompa, oompa da dee.

999
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:44,740
If you are wise, you'll listen to me.

1000
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:48,360
Gum chewing's time when it's once in a while.

1001
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,100
It stops you from smoking and brightens your smile.

1002
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,660
But it's repulsive, revolting, and wrong.

1003
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,200
Chewing and chewing all day.

1004
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,360
Love the way that a cow does.

1005
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,180
Oompa loompa, oompa dee da.

1006
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,980
Given good manners, you will go far.

1007
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,600
You will live in happiness, too.

1008
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,180
Like the oompa loompa, oompa dee doo.

1009
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,680
Paranoia strikes deep.

1010
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,420
Into your life it will creep.

1011
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:43,880
It starts when you're always afraid.

1012
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,780
Step out of line, the man come and take you away.

1013
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,540
We better stop.

1014
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,440
Hey, what's that sound?

1015
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,540
Everybody look what's going on.

1016
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,060
Stop.

1017
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,740
Stop.

1018
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:58,740


1019
00:52:59,040 --> 00:52:59,740
Stop.

1020
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,260
Doesn't matter.

1021
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,240
As well, we'll talk tomorrow.

1022
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,460
Don't answer.

1023
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:05,960
Oh.

1024
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:14,240
Friends, if you're in any state of confusion at all now,

1025
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,180
you're in...

1026
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:15,420
Remember.

1027
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,520
You're in state of confusion.

1028
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,620
Free information.

1029
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,340
The Bob.

1030
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,340
Did you know you're in the state of confusion?

1031
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:28,260
That sacred P.O. box which still exists in mysterious Dallas, Texas.

1032
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,920
Even though there's nobody left there...

1033
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,440
Wow.

1034
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,980
It's still there.

1035
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,220
Hey.

1036
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:37,980
It's just a town that used to be there, but now it's just only a stick in the middle of town with a box on it.

1037
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,380
And it's the P.O. sacred P.O. box because the rest of the city is gone.

1038
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,560
I've seen the tape in that MTV tape, folks, that you saw on MTV so many years ago.

1039
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:45,800
But one thing...

1040
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,600
There's a picture of the guy that answers that box with his family.

1041
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,420
One thing survives.

1042
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,460
Out in the middle of the wrecked city.

1043
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,580
And there you can see in the foreground a little box, a little mailbox.

1044
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,040
The sacred golden box.

1045
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:55,460
That's the mailbox.

1046
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,900
It's made out of solid gold now.

1047
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,860
It glistens in the distance.

1048
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:13,340
As people draw closer to Dallas, they see the shimmering, gilded sky as they approach the golden P.O. box that is Dallas, Texas now.

1049
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,180
Next day's coming.

1050
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:20,080
That's Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1051
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,880
Order now.

1052
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,680
Please shine the light of whatever.

1053
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,660
Not available in any store.

1054
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,260
Not on YouTube.

1055
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,380
Sold separately.

1056
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,880
Batteries not included.

1057
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,860
Some assembly required.

1058
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,180
Not stored in soles.

1059
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,260
Not stored in soles.

1060
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,600
I'd almost forgotten that old saw.

1061
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,560
That clever play on words.

1062
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,060
Not stowed in sores either.

1063
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,500
So sad not to have it anymore.

1064
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:54,900
And friends, if you don't want to end up like...

1065
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,780
Well, I shouldn't go that way.

1066
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:05,660

So don't fear when you hear a foreign sound to your ear.

1090

It's all right, Ma.

00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,480
I'm only sighing.

1092
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,540
I'm only sighing.

1093
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:53,980
Make the rules for the wise men and the fools.

1094
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,600
I've got nothing, Ma, to live up to.

1095
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,620
For them that must obey authority that they do not respect in any degree,

1096
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,680
who despise their jobs, their destiny, speak jealously,

1097
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,340
leave them that are free, do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.

1098
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,640
I'm only sighing.
