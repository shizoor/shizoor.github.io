1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,740
Bog.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:04,900
Bog.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,160
Bog.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:09,660


5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,940
Bog.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,140


7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,520
Bog.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,960
And now, the tras-tras-tras-tras-tras-tras-tras-tras-tras-tras-tras-tras-tras

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,840
Genius Hour of Slack!

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,560
Little Neepy is still in Devo Land.

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,120
And now, dear friends, after the Devo Convention or the Devotional in Cleveland,

12
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,380
now it can be told we're all Devo.

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,580
And we all trade our weird-ass Devo cover tune copies.

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,180
The one just heard was a Bach cover by Mark Mothersbaugh and yours truly.

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,180
We have Occupant coming up, friends, which will follow.

16
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,300
This mix by Reverend Greg Cheatham.

17
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,060
People had to amuse themselves or die, you know, spiritually die.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,100
So that's why the particular kind of music came out of there.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,680
It's like an inward imaginative music.

20
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,600
You know, it obviously wasn't based on mainstream currents or big beat hard rock and roll.

21
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,380
It was more like little clicks and whirs.

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,060
Brainwaves.

23
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,420
Inward imaginative music.

24
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,140
Little clicks and whirs.

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,360
Brainwaves.

26
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,260
Polyrhythmic experimental sound.

27
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,200
Not even real drums.

28
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,260
Just a crude forerunner of electronic drums.

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,760
Filled by one of Mark's brothers.

30
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:37,180
You know, within the realm of music there were obviously influences from Bowie and Eno.

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,480
And even just more pure electronic composers.

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,420
Well, I kind of feel sorry for Jimmy.

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,100
Yeah, but you don't know the whole story.

34
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,420
He wasn't a nice guy.

35
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,480
What do you mean?

36
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,420
Let me tell you.

37
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,680
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care.

38
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,540
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care.

39
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:58,540


40
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,940
Jimmy's in a wheelchair.

41
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,740
He used to walk his dog.

42
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,360
Didn't beat him good.

43
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,620
Like his pretty wife.

44
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,000
Now they're up and gone.

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,120
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care.

46
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,660
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,540
Jimmy's in a wheelchair.

48
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:28,540


49
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:28,540


50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:28,540


51
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,980
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

52
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,320
Jimmy's in a wheelchair

53
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,800
He was the president

54
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,260
Of a company

55
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,920
He kept his work as far

56
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,860
As he liked to steal

57
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,860
But with justice strikes

58
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,400
Every once in a while

59
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,920
He makes a bullseye hit

60
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,200
Every once in a while

61
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,220
He used to yell and scream

62
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
Until his son would cry

63
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,240
He used to spank his phone

64
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,900
But he don't spank his own

65
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,500
And he don't spank no more

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,640
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

67
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,160
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

68
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,540
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

69
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,960
Jimmy's in a wheelchair

70
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,640
But he got big and fat

71
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,280
And he was rising high

72
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,580
Making lots of cash

73
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,980
Trashing all the slides

74
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,760
Trashing all the slides!

75
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,500
Oh, with justice strikes

76
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,940
Every once in a while

77
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,420
He makes a bullseye hit

78
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,800
Every once in a while

79
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,820
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

80
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,300
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

81
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,700
Jimmy's in a wheelchair and I don't care

82
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,040
Jimmy's in a wheelchair

83
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,160
Jimmy's in a wheelchair covered by Occupant.

84
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,580
Friends, if you need to know more about Occupant, and you do,

85
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:52,560
check out www.mp3.com slash Occupant.

86
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,480
You know how to spell it.

87
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,260
Okay, here's the story.

88
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,160
But aren't you going to molest me some more?

89
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,740
Dr. Piper, Bob?

90
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,020
Climb right up here on my...

91
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,220
That's right, that's a good boy.

92
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,320
Climb right up here on my lap.

93
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,000
Now bend over.

94
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,680
I'm going to have to give you...

95
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,260
Oh, boy!

96
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:22,860
Oh, boy.

97
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,020
Can I have a kiss?

98
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,020


99
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,880
Can I have my spanking?

100
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,660
We're all people.

101
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,280
Come on, boys.

102
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,180
Come on over here.

103
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,160
The doctor's going to give you a good spanking

104
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,000
and teach you about Planet X.

105
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,800
We're just cannibal eggs.

106
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,140
Huh?

107
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,460
And so, the poor little children were abused and abandoned

108
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,440
by the evil doctor.

109
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,060
Left to their own devices,

110
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,420
there wasn't much left to eat but rat meat and sundaes for the week.

111
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,940
Some of the little boys resorted to crying

112
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,980
but they knew they had to be bigger than that.

113
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,940
They had to stand tough and swallow back their tears.

114
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,940
And speaking of Devo,

115
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,880
there is a, um, the third of the Devo conventions

116
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,020
or the devotional, 2002,

117
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,100
is coming up August 10th, all day, on Saturday,

118
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,360
at...

119
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,160
The Starwood Center, Cleveland, Ohio.

120
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,920
Um, yes, the, uh...

121
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,460
And that's, again, that's all day, August 10th.

122
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,820
I think there's...

123
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,440
I'm sure there's some kind of a charge for it.

124
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,800
It's great.

125
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,000
I was at the last two

126
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,140
and they've never been able to get any of the Devo's out there

127
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,640
except the first, from the very first order,

128
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,900
the earliest evolution,

129
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,700
the first ones to crawl out of the water,

130
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,380
Jim, Jungle Jim Mothersbaugh,

131
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,540
the little-known first,

132
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,840
drummer, uh, uh, as, is there, will be there,

133
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,240
was there last time,

134
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,260
he's actually a real funny guy,

135
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,480
and General Boy!

136
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,600
Yes, the progenitor and sire!

137
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,740
A, a friend and a brother.

138
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,620
A monkey and a robot.

139
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,040
Occupant O-C-C-U-P-A-N-T

140
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,260
I'm a mechanical man

141
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,800
to mechanical arms

142
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,280
to mechanical legs

143
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,440
I'm a...

144
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,560
I'm a two plus two equals four man

145
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,040

152
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,040
to mechanical arms

153
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,620
to mechanical legs

154
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,740
I'm a two plus two

156
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:14,720
We build swell, we work well, and we want what you want.

157
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,780
You want, you want, you want, you want.

158
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:27,120
I'm a mechanical man, two mechanical arms, two mechanical legs.

159
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,700
I'm a two plus two equals four man.

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:40,240

I'm a two plus two equals four man.

Baby!

176
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,660
Me feels well

177
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,580
Thank you.

178
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:29,320
You've got, you've got, you've got, you've got, you've got, you've got, you've got, you've got, you've got.

179
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,120
Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?

180
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,900
Nay. Like most of your followers, I was maimed building the great brewery.

181
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:46,940
Mechanical Man was covered by Occupant. That's Reverend Onan Canobite and Reverend Mitch.

182
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:56,200
And now, Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo has a little fun with the pinkest creature known to Bob.

183
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,960
In this case, the drive-time rock station DJ.

184
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,080
You know, Bob, it's time for the 5.30 phone call.

185
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,580
And today, we have Mark Mothersbaugh.

186
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,020
From Devo on the phone. Hi, Mark.

187
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,780
Hi, Mighty Wah.

188
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,320
How's Devo these days?

189
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,460
Oh, busy, busy. We just finished an album.

190
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,620
I don't know if you've heard it yet or not.

191
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,520
Yeah, we're playing it.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,880
Oh, you're playing it?

193
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,140
Yeah.

194
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,120
Oh, good. Well, then I'm going to have to buy a radio.

195
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,920
Yeah, it's Shout is the name of the new record.

196
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,160
That's right. Actually, for us, it's a real interesting album because

197
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,520
this is the first one where we gave up total control

198
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,560
and let someone else do it.

199
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,080
And let someone else direct it for the first time.

200
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,720
I don't know if you're familiar with the Church of the Subgenius,

201
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,760
but I made friends with them in the last three or four years,

202
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,240
became a reverend in the Church of the Subgenius,

203
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:57,240
and now Devo Incorporated is totally controlled by the Church of the Subgenius.

204
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,540
And Bob Dobbs, who is our spiritual leader, makes all the decisions now.

205
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,640
Well, actually, with a little help from Jimi Hendrix.

206
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,400
Yeah, in fact, you guys did a cover?

207
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:07,720
Yeah.

208
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,840
And you guys did a cover version of Are You Experienced on the new record, huh?

209
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,720
Yeah. It wasn't by choice, either.

210
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,780
This was a surprise to me, too.

211
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,780
We actually hadn't planned on putting that song on the record.

212
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,320
We had a couple other songs we were going to put on,

213
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,940
and we were in the studio, and it was late at night,

214
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,900
and who should appear in the room in this big purple gas cloud?

215
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,600
It really didn't smell very good.

216
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,940
It had that sickening sweet smell of LSD.

217
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,000
And, you know, I didn't recognize him at first,

218
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,880
but it was Jimi Hendrix, and he chased us around the room.

219
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,220
It was.

220
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,200
He told us we had to record Are You Experienced.

221
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,100
It wasn't by choice.

222
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,700
Well, that's a pretty tough order to say no to, I guess.

223
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,180
Well, actually, we were pretty happy with the way it came out,

224
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,100
so we did use it on the record.

225
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,500
Now, what about these neon green Chinese-American friendship suits?

226
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,760
Oh, well, that's easy to explain.

227
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,880
In the last couple of years,

228
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,820
since we put out Oh No, It's Devoe,

229
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,260
we did five world tours and five albums and 22 videos

230
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,880
all in about four and a half years.

231
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,940
And so about the end of 1982, we said, forget it.

232
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,100
And we dropped out.

233
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,760
We went underground, and we got jobs at a fast food restaurant.

234
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,400
No.

235
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,760
Well, they were the outfits, and they let us keep them.

236
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,580
Mm-hmm, I see.

237
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:33,860
They matched.

238
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,380
What have you been doing besides recording the new record?

239
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,140
Are you making any more movies?

240
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,280
Well, like I said, we dropped out.

241
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,340
We've grown our hair, although that's computer hair you see in the photo.

242
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,660
We all have long hair now, and we've kind of...

243
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,140
We had never...

244
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,940
To tell you the truth, we didn't have time for drugs back in the...

245
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,040
prior to 1982, and, well, we decided we'd experiment in the last couple years,

246
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,500
and things are a lot groovier and more far out for us than they've ever been before.

247
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,540
You guys took some time out to do a Devoe,

248
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,360
a Devoe endorsement for Honda, I know.

249
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,380
How was that?

250
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,480
Is that fun, making commercials?

251
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,460
Well, Church of the Subgenius, once again, they made us do it.

252
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,360
It wasn't by our own means.

253
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,300
Oh, I see.

254
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,400
It was all right.

255
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,460
They fed us once every day and, you know, let us out at night.

256
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,420
So it was okay.

257
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,460
Mark Mothersbaugh from Devoe is on the telephone at WLIR.

258
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,960
Two of the Hondas have wrecked already are the Hondas they gave us.

259
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,900
Really? Two of them?

260
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,680
I have to tell you that.

261
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,100
Oh.

262
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,340
Oh.

263
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:37,900
Yeah.

264
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,120
Yeah.

265
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,520
On Long Island.

266
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,260
Actually, I know that.

267
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,460
You think I'm talking to you from Los Angeles,

268
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,000
but in reality I'm in that phone booth at the 7-Eleven around the corner.

269
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,040
Oh, yeah, I know that one.

270
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:49,940
Yeah.

271
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,220
Listen, Mark.

272
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,080
I'm just putting static noise over, so.

273
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,480
What I really want to know is, since this is an election year,

274
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,280
what's the candidate that Devoe is collectively endorsing?

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,200
Well, to tell you the truth,

276
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,540
we're in awful disarray.

277
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,060
I'm disappointed that Larry Flint dropped out of the running.

278
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,560
He had our vote.

279
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,300
Uh-huh.

280
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,960
You know, I don't know.

281
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,420
I think, you know, you have no other choice.

282
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,560
You know, there's really no way to vote, because Republican and Democrat, it's all the same

283
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,380
at this point in time.

284
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,200
Well, you could still put him in on the write-in ballot, I guess, you know.

285
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,960
Yeah, well, I think General Boy may get a few votes out of us.

286
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,420
Other than that, I don't know what to suggest.

287
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:37,540
I don't know what to suggest.

288
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:37,540


289
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:37,540


290
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:37,540


291
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,560
Ugh.

292
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,600
Gag onto me with a spoon.

293
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,800
Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments.

294
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,820
You got a chisel?

295
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,860
Take this down.

296
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,380
Oh, that's what I say, because that's what the word of Bob says.

297
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,220
I'll tell you, friend.

298
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,900
There's no slack.

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,660
There's no slack.

300
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,360
There's no slack.

301
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,020
I'll tell you, in this world, in this flesh, in this devil, there's no slack.

302
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,680
And if you can't whoop it, go ye down, my friend.

303
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,420
That's what I said.

304
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,640
Go ye down.

305
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,180
There's nothing that says you can't.

306
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,680
The devil don't have a rule book.

307
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,320
That's right.

308
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:06,980
The devil.

309
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,520
The devil.

310
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:07,520


311
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:07,520


312
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:07,520


313
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:07,520


314
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:07,520


315
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:07,520


316
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,240
The devil does not have a rule book.

317
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,380
He is not humanistic.

318
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,640
He is not pacifistic.

319
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,080
And he owes you money, my friend.

320
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,420
That's right.

321
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,560
The devil owes you money.

322
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,640
And so does Uncle Sam.

323
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,860
You have to recognize the devil just like you recognize Uncle Sam.

324
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,440
Now, I'm going down there to pay taxes.

325
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,520
As far as I'm concerned, I might as well be paying taxes to the devil.

326
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,460
I'm sorry, but that's just the way things are.

327
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,060
It's a test of faith.

328
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,360
And that's why God put the devil down here to see if you can tell the difference between the devil and Uncle Sam.

329
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,860
Let there be slack.

330
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,520
My lord, the infidels on your back no longer believe in you.

331
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,940
They say their prayers go unheeded.

332
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,840
Of course they're unheeded.

333
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,640
How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?

334
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,080
They talk of war against the faithful.

335
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,080
I beseech thee, rise up against them.

336
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,620
Smite someone who deserves it for once.

337
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,160
Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse.

338
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,740
You're best off solving your own problems.

339
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,840
But, but Metalodeon...

340
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,000
My lord, what part of nay dothn't thou understand?

341
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,080
Armageddon!

342
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Who says that I didn't?

343
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,760
Now, join me, Screamy Ted Horne, dude!

344
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,960
Screamy Ted Horne

345
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,460
Screamy Ted Horne

346
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:28,460


347
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,760
We interrupt this program before the sound of the...

348
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,820
...the alarm of our naval unit's speed.

349
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,540
A large object traveling at supersonic speed is headed over the North Atlantic towards the

350
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,540
east coast of the United States.

351
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,660
Armageddon!

352
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,100
It's what we call a global killer.

353
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,720
The end of mankind.

354
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,100
Doesn't matter where it hits.

355
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,400
Nothing would survive, not even bacteria.

356
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,340
Armageddon!

357
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,460
The team from CX Massive Recommend Alert might recommend Alert 1.

358
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,840
The more you make a big deal out of denying something, the more possible it is to get

359
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:03,840


360
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,060
the most out of it.

361
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,000
The more people think it must be true.

362
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,620
You're on the air, Laurie.

363
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,480
If you read the Bible, Mark, you'd know that there won't be another thousand years.

364
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,400
Right now, we're in the last days as foretold in the Book of Revelations.

365
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:13,740
The last days?

366
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,220
You mean the coming of the apocalypse, right?

367
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,040
The rapture?

368
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,380
You only have to look at the signs.

369
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,160
There are wars and rumors of wars that...

370
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,400
Now, just so the rest of us know how much time is left, when is the rapture supposed

371
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,900
to hit?

372
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,620
Exactly.

373
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,660
Is it midnight New Year's Eve?

374
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,480
That's right.

375
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,040
Now, is that midnight L.A. time or Eastern Standard Time or what?

376
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,840
I mean, you're not going to be able to tell me what time it is.

377
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,060
What time zone has God in, anyway?

378
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,540
I pray for you all.

379
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,500
These people are nuts!

380
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,800
Skybird, this is Dropkick with a red dash alpha message in two parts.

381
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,840
Break, break.

382
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,320
Stand by for mind control.

383
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,360
Prepare yourselves for destruction!

384
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,880
Don't be crazy, Mr. Boy.

385
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,660
The best way to take our minds off the smell of burning flesh is to begin tonight's karaoke

386
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,060
contest.

387
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,280
I got a finger tune song now.

388
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,800
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,

389
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:03,800


390
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,180
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,

391
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,180


392
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,720
As I was saying, the universe is just doomed.

393
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,020
Doomed.

394
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:13,960
Doomed.

395
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,720
Doom!

396
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,240
Just watch, guys.

397
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,680
It's time to embrace the horror.

398
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,040
Look, we got Fun Road tickets to the end of the Earth.

399
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,840
There's a 68.71% chance you're right.

400
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,060
That's the fact.

401
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,680
Yeah.

402
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,700
Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.

403
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,780
I think something is happening.

404
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,680
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.

405
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
It's seen him.

406
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,660
Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over.

407
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,900
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

408
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:33,760
Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over.

409
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,440
It's a night zone that we don't know anything about, and I think we ought to stay clear.

410
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,680
See that the humans remain entertained until the end.

411
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,300
Armageddon, a mix by our friend Reverend DJ Epoch.

412
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,420
That's not E-popped, but E-pock.

413
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,480
It's all American, friends, and it's weird.

414
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,200
All Ameri-key.

415
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,560
Bob loves you.

416
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,340
Have any favorite Bob songs?

417
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,940
God, it's unbelievable.

418
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:40,740
The Bob Spangled Banner by Professor Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo.

419
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:48,960
And now in the patriotic spirit, to continue that spirit, the Rainmakers with Government Cheese.

420
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,640
Bust out the windows, put his family on food stamps.

421
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,180
Now he's a big spender, no food on the table and the bills ain't paid.

422
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,560
Cause he's spending on cigarettes and PGA.

423
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,220
They'll turn us all into beggars cause they're easier to please.

424
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,120
They're feeding our people that government cheese.

425
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,680
Give a man freedom.

426
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:38,220
He'll eat food and he'll figure out a way to steal more than he can eat.

427
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,140
Cause he doesn't have to pay.

428
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,180
Give a woman free kids and you'll find them in the dirt.

429
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,160
Learning how to carry on the family line of work.

430
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,340
It's the man in the White House, the man under the steeple.

431
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,240
Passing out drugs to the American people.

432
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,340
I don't believe in anything.

433
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,160
Nothing is free.

434
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,760
They're feeding our people that government cheese.

435
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,780
Cheese.

436
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Government.

437
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,220
Cheese.

438
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
Government.

439
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Cheese.

440
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,300
Government.

441
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,520
Get out!

442
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Decline.

443
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Fall.

444
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,200
Decline and fall.

445
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,140
Fall down baby.

446
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,300
Decline and fall.

447
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:33,560
Fall.

448
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:33,760
Fall.

449
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:33,760


450
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,820
Fall way down there.

451
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,280
Decline and fall.

452
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:37,720
Come on.

453
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,260
Fall down little mama.

454
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,360
Decline and fall.

455
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,340
Oh, decline and fall.

456
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,100
Give a man a free ticket on a dead end ride.

457
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,440
And you climb in the back even though nobody's driving.

458
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,360
Too god damn lazy to crawl out of the wreck.

459
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:03,760
And you climb in the back even though nobody's driving.

460
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,800
And you ride a rally,

461
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,260
waits up for the welfare check.

462
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,900
Gone to hell in a handbag.

463
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,340
Can't you see I ain't gonna eat no government cheese?

464
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,300
No government cheese.

465
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,260
No government cheese.

466
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,240
No government cheese.

467
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,420
No cheese.

468
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,240
No cheese.

469
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,600
And I'm hovering like a fly

470
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,480
Waiting for the windshield on the freeway

471
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,500
That's too realistic for me, guys.

472
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,740
Oh, that's cool the way he does it.

473
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,480
Yeah, but that's, that's nihilistic.

474
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,220
You know what I mean?

475
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,120
That's anti-chromatic.

476
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,240
That's re-fistulating.

477
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,640
That's totally imbibed, I think, if it's not drunk already.

478
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,260
You're gripping onto the waves of life and riding forward as fast as you can, right?

479
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:17,480
You don't want to sink down into that gray, neutral nothingness of squared-off, murky plainness and ordinariness.

480
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,820
You want to dive for the heights and float down to the lowest lows.

481
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,780
That means waiting for the windshield like a fly on the freeway.

482
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,840
Manic depressive.

483
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,160
Wait.

484
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,340
Waiting for the bus.

485
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,120
For the ups.

486
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,880
In the middle of the...

487
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,420
And downs.

488
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:31,820
Road.

489
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,360
The ups and downs are the number seven.

490
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,500
The ups and downs are the cross sound B.

491
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,920
The ups and downs are getting on without the change, right?

492
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,460
Getting up and down, getting...

493
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,760
They didn't tell me to take those pills, but I didn't take them anyway.

494
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,380
Bye.

495
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,800
I love you.

496
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,840
Let there

497
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,260
be light!

498
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,940
Yippee!

499
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,520
You're the best!

500
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,740
I got it, I got it!

501
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,240
Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle.

502
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,220
That's right, doctor, this is how it be.

503
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:53,500
I can see you, but you can't see me.

504
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,960
That's right, doctor, now it's up to you.

505
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:06,160
Here's the gift of freedom, you know what to do.

506
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,320
Huh? Oh, yes, I remember.

507
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,260
Don't think I forgot.

508
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,860
I was having a little party the night that you were shot.

509
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:31,200
Shot right in the brain cells so that all that stuff came out.

510
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:37,200
All the evil ranting that you never knew about.

511
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,680
Yes, yes, the ranting.

512
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,740
That evil twist of fate.

513
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,720
Faces you thought you could never do, but now you have the hate.

514
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,980
Oh, that's right, doctor, soon there'll come a day

515
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:02,200
when all the rational civilized thoughts have gone away.

516
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,740
That's right, doctor.

517
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,840
That's right, doctor.

518
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,960
That's right.

519
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,400
That's right, doctor.

520
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,700
That's right, doctor.

521
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,580
Yeah.

522
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,760
That's right, doctor.

523
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:17,760


524
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,160
That's right.

525
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,220
Yeah.

526
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,300
Oh.

527
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:22,440
Yeah.

528
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,060
Yeah.

529
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,920
That's right, doctor.

530
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,120
That's right, doctor.

531
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,320
Yes, that is right, doctor.

532
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,740
You heard what I said.

533
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,620
We must watch TV

534
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,880
to hold our eyeballs to the rib.

535
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,080
That's right, doctor.

536
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,000
We must see other laws.

537
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,000
We must show our incompetence.

538
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,320
That ain't all I've got.

539
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,300
The walls are closing in.

540
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,400
The room is getting small.

541
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,880
I don't know where you've been.

542
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,060
I don't know where you've been.

543
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,060


544
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,480
I don't know where you've been.

545
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,000
It's too late to talk.

546
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,680
That's right, doctor.

547
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,520
That's right, doctor.

548
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,680
That's right, doctor.

549
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,920
That's right, doctor.

550
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,040
That's right, doctor.

551
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,200
That's right, doctor.

552
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,160
That's right, doctor.

553
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,500
That's right, doctor.

554
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,380
Doctor.

555
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,380
That's right, doctor.

556
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,700
That's right, doctor.

557
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,000
That's right, doctor,こだ Dante, dr.

558
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,000


559
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,060
He's got a, he's got a doctor.

560
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,620
Doctor, doctor.

561
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,700
He goes right, doctor.

562
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:32,840


563
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,680
Doctor, doctor.

564
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,400
Doctor.

565
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:36,960
Doctor.

566
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,440
Doctor.

567
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:38,960
Doctor.

568
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,020
That's right, Doctor.

569
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,020
That's right, Doctor.

570
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,420
By Reverend Doctor

571
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,160
Hodge, Uncle Onan's

572
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,640
Wotan Band.

573
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,420
Onan Canobite

574
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,840
and Mitch there.

575
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,200
Praise

576
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,760
above.

577
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,860
Finding God. That's important, yeah.

578
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,780
But you know what might be a treat for everyone?

579
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,940
If you let me use the telescope to find my

580
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,900
lost friend Bender. I don't

581
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,620
know what to say other than

582
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,900
absolutely not. Your loss is

583
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,380
a tragedy, but our work is...

584
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,680
Come on. You guys have forever to look for God.

585
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
All I'm asking is one measly lifetime

586
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,900
to find my friend.

587
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,260
He speaks out of love for his friend.

588
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,780
Perhaps that love in his heart is

589
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,920
God. Oh, how convenient.

590
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,680
A theory about God

591
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
that doesn't require looking through a telescope.

592
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,340
Get back to work.

593
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,280
...

594
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,100
...

595
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,600
...

596
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,780
...

597
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,640
...

598
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:48,640


599
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:48,640


600
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:48,640


601
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:48,640


602
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:48,640


603
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:48,660
...

604
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:48,740
...

605
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:48,880
...

606
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,080
Thank you.

607
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,780
Thank you.

608
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,720
Thank you.

609
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,620
Thank you.

610
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,400
Thank you.

611
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,020
Thank you.

612
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,520
Thank you.

613
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,760
Thank you.

614
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,900
Thank you.

615
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,120
Thank you.

616
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,880
Thank you.

617
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,360
Thank you.

618
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,000
Thank you.

619
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,680
Thank you.

620
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,020
Gone two years and I don't know why

621
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,920
Now I'm happy all the time

622
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,620
I can't think I'm feeling fine

623
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,360
I've got feelings they don't show

624
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,240
Don't ask me, I don't know

625
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,860
Don't, don't, don't

626
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,980
All of us

627
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,960
All of us

628
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,520
All of us

629
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,220
You've heard this all before

630
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Now here comes

631
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,240
Gonna hear some more

632
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,220
I know a place where dreams are crushed

633
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,760
Hope you're smashed

634
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,940
That ain't much

635
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,200
Are you stupid anyway?

636
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,420
We're all gonna die someday

637
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah

638
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,080
All of us

639
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,240
All the past

640
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,640
All the past

641
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,840
All the past

642
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,700
All the past

643
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,360
All the past

644
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:39,360


645
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,940
I live off my fucking

646
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:18,920
I live off my fucking

647
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,220
All the past

648
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:30,160
All the past

649
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,620
All the past

650
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,020
All the past

651
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,220
All the past

652
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,420
All the past

653
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,820
All the past

654
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,920
All the past

655
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,580
All the past

656
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,980
All of us

657
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,720
By Gajetto

658
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,000
Yes friends, Gajetto, Will Black

659
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,560
Performed at the devotional

660
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,320
And that song, All of Us, believe it or not

661
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,060
Is a really ancient Devo song

662
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,320
Before any of their albums came out

663
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,040
And

664
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,180
And

665
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:18,300
And

666
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


667
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


668
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


669
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


670
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


671
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


672
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


673
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


674
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


675
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


676
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


677
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


678
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


679
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:18,900


680
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,980
As we sign off for this week

681
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,580
The King

682
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,260
As I walk through

683
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,940
This wicked world

684
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,460
Searching for light

685
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,180
In the darkness

686
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,400
Of insanity

687
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,100
I ask myself

688
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,640
Is all hope lost

689
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,440
Is there only pain

690
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,820
And hatred

691
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,280
And misery

692
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,160
And each time I feel like

693
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,740
There's one thing I want to know

694
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,580
What's so funny about

695
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,640
This love and understanding

696
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,660
Oh

697
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,180
Oh

698
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:18,600
Oh

699
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:18,900
Oh

700
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:18,900


701
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:18,900


702
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:18,900


703
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:18,900


704
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:18,900


705
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:18,900


706
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:18,900


707
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:18,900


708
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:18,900


709
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:18,900


710
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:18,900


711
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:18,920


712
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,600
Oh

713
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:20,640
Oh

714
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:22,460
Oh

715
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,340
Oh

716
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:23,900
Oh

717
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,820
Oh

718
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:24,820


719
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,780
Oh

720
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,000
Oh

721
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,800
Oh

722
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,180
Oh

723
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:29,940
Oh

724
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,280
Oh

725
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,200
Oh

726
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:31,780
Oh

727
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:31,780


728
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,180
Oh

729
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,640
Oh

730
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:35,700
Oh

731
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:35,700


732
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,480
Oh

733
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,340
Oh

734
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:49,500
And as I walk on through troubled times, my spirit gets so downhearted sometimes.

735
00:44:51,800 --> 00:45:04,820
So where I'd have gone and who I'd have trusted, where is the harmony, sweet harmony?

736
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:11,740
Cause each time I feel it slip away, it just makes me wanna cry.

737
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,760
What's so fun about peace, love, and understanding?

738
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,660
What's so fun about peace, love, and understanding?

739
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,780
What's so fun about peace, love, and understanding?

740
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,780
Sweet harmony.

741
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:12,660
Cause each time I feel it slip away, it just makes me wanna cry.

742
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,800
What's so fun about peace, love, and understanding?

743
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:24,620
What's so fun about peace, love, and understanding?

744
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,960
What's so fun about peace, love, and understanding?

745
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:32,360
Yeah.

746
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,480
What's so fun about peace, love, and understanding?

747
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,160
Uh, they're dead.

748
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,080
All dead.

749
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,000
Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?

750
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,420
Uh, yeah.

751
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:03,860
Yeah.

752
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,260
Yeah.

753
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:04,540
Yeah.

754
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:04,800
Yeah.

755
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:04,800


756
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:04,820


757
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,520
Ha ha ha ha!

758
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:10,320
Elvis did What's So Funny About Peace, Love, and Understanding?

759
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:18,740
And we have another classic Costello song coming up, after Mark Mothersbaugh once again encounters

760
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,540
the pink boy.

761
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,960
We've had a lot of Devo fans calling in the radio station all day long, Mark.

762
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,860
So I have to ask you, when is Devo coming to the New York area?

763
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,560
And uh, do you have any plans to come by and do some gigs around here?

764
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,020

i sure do w all right thank you mark

774
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:39,120
radio advised with every one of those late night stations playing songs bringing tears to my eyes

775
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:45,340
i was seriously thinking about hiding the receiver when the switch broke because it's old

776
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,720
they're saying things that i can hardly believe they really think we're getting out of control

777
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:57,760
radio is the sound salvation radio is cleaning up the nation

778
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,720
the

779
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,780
you better listen to the vice of reason

780
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,400
but they don't give you any choice because they think that it's treason

781
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:15,620
so you had better do as you were told you better listen to the radio

782
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:28,860
i want to bite the hand that feeds me i want to bite that hand so badly

783
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,980
i want to bite that hand so badly

784
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,020
i want to Make them wish they'd never seen me

785
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:40,660
some of my friends sit around every evening and they worry about the times ahead

786
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:47,400
But everybody else is overwhelmed By indifference and the promise of an early bed

787
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,900
you either shut up or get cut out they don't wanna hear about it

788
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,160
Sony inches on the reel to reel

789
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,460
and the radio was in the hands of

790
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,480
such a lot of fools trying to an expertise

791
00:49:59,480 --> 00:49:59,960
to un denk

792
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,880
The way that you can hear your radio is the sound of salvation.

793
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,320
Radio is cleaning up the nation.

794
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,080
They say you better listen to the vice of reason.

795
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,000
They don't give you any choice because they think that it's treason.

796
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,320
So you had better do what you were told.

797
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,280
You better listen to the radio.

798
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,360
What a fall, baby.

799
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,620
My bless you, baby.

800
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,980
What a fall, baby.

801
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:19,340
What a fall, baby.

802
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,860
What a fall, baby.

803
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,460
What a fall, baby.

804
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,500
What a fall, baby.

805
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:37,180
What a fall, baby.

806
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:44,100
And there's the Devo convention coming up also.

807
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,420
And the Devo the next day.

808
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,580
Devo convention here.

809
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,320
It's in August.

810
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,160
Mass baptism.

811
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,380
You said there was going to be a mass baptism.

812
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,700
August 15th.

813
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,320
Reverend Ivan Stang.

814
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,340
Hellfire preaching by Reverend Ivan Stang.

815
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,300
Dr. Katahdin.

816
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,320
And Dr. Onan Kanobai.

817
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,680
He's coming out from Portland.

818
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,140
Yep.

819
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,680
Wow.

820
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,100
Yes.

821
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,160
It'll be good to see Onan.

822
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,860
He's a fellow rocketeer.

823
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,660
Yes.

824
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,060
He's a rocket man.

825
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,400
He's the oldest, youngest of genius doctors.

826
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,340
And St. Ann and Helen the handbasket.

827
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:16,940
She rocked.

828
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,080
I thought she was right on the mark singing her songs.

829
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:20,980
I thought for once.

830
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,940
That's going to be August 11th.

831
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,980
She not only nailed it.

832
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,140
But went into some sort of starter.

833
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:25,480
At the maximum level.

834
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,380
In Akron.

835
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:26,980
In Akron.

836
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,980
August 11th in Akron.

837
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,840
It's 207 South Main Street.

838
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,120
Yeah.

839
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,420
You could know about that.

840
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,460
Where the rubber meets the toads.

841
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,280
The day before that here in Cleveland is the devotional.

842
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,040
Devotional.

843
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:37,940
2002.

844
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,680
At the Starwood Center.

845
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,700
712 East 185th Street.

846
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,240
What time is that?

847
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,300
There's going to be a mass baptism.

848
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,460
Isn't that at that event?

849
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:46,980
That's all day.

850
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,780
That's like all day Saturday.

851
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,640
A general boy.

852
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,260
Just head down to the Starwood Center.

853
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:51,800
All day long.

854
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,040
Will be there.

855
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,280
The sire.

856
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,040
The progenitor.

857
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:55,260
The progenitor.

858
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:55,260


859
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,380
Of all the devos.

860
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,320
Jim.

861
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:57,980
Jim.

862
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:58,300
August 10th.

863
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,140
Jim Mothersbaugh.

864
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:05,060
And if it's like last year, there'll be home videos that Mark Mothersbaugh sends.

865
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:05,780
Well, this is Sunday.

866
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,680
I hope all the subgeniuses come out on a Sunday night.

867
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,060
After all, don't they all go to church on Sunday?

868
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,360
After the show.

869
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,340
Akron, man.

870
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,780
And have a big fat old chicken dinner underneath the city.

871
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:15,160
Rubber City.

872
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,020
Eight miles high.

873
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,180
And when you touch down.

874
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,020
You'll find that.

875
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,600
It's.

876
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,700
Stranger than no.

877
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,180
Signs in the sea.

878
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,180
That say where you're going.

879
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,700
Are somewhere.

880
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,700
Just being there all alone.

881
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,560
Nowhere is.

882
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:55,820
There a walk to be found.

883
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:01,640
A man who's afraid of losing their ground.

884
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:06,260
Way, way down.

885
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,660
Known for its sound.

886
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,160
In places.

887
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,140
Small places.

888
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,240
And now.

889
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,520
.

890
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,180
I see.

891
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,580
The.

892
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,240
Man 제가.

893
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:40,240


894
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,800
I should've said told me before my parents left me alone.

895
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:45,800
Actually simply the people.

896
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:45,920
City.

897
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,040


898
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,040


899
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,040


900
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,040


901
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,040


902
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,080
And I hated it.

903
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,100
I slept.

904
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:48,100


905
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:48,800
For a living.

906
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,320
Who doesn't have it all.

907
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:49,320


908
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:49,320


909
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:50,700
Yeah.

910
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:59,060
guitar solo

911
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,280
Down the stairs

912
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,140
A little store

913
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,000
Some laughing

914
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,260
Some just shameless

915
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:18,840
Boys

916
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,900
Sidewalks

917
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,420
And black men

918
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,920
Some laughing

919
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,880
Some standing

920
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,560
Alone

921
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,220
guitar solo

922
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,360
Eight miles high

923
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,820
by the birds.

924
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,260
Yes, the old-fashioned birds with a Y.

925
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,000
Friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack

926
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,600
with Doctors for Bob in the background.

927
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,780
You must write for free information if you don't already have that.

928
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,620
Or you can check www.subgenius.com

929
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:48,240
But, but, you can still write.

930
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,200
Write to Bob and request that information from

931
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,300

Boy, oh boy

941
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,020
Boy, a boy

Boy, a boy

944
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,960

Boy, a boy

947
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:42,320


948
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,580
Boy, a boy

949
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:45,020
Boy, a boy

950
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,400
Boy, a boy

951
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,300
Too late I realized that me children are me only real treasures.
