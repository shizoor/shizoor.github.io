1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Okay, give me a little bit more slack.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,380
Oops!

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,100
Okay, that's too much slack!

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,260
Ha ha ha!

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,340
J.R. Bob-Dub's

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,400
I am your man

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,040
Who calls your name

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,000
And through this world

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,300
I'm bound to ramble

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,500
To spread your word

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,640
And slackful fame

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,440
To spread your word

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,000
And slackful fame

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,660
I am a subgenius

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,600
Of yeti stock

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
And ancient blood

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,200
I seek for slack

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,620
Where I can find it

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,780
Through storm and calm

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,020
And fire and flood

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,280
He seeks for slack

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,340
Through storm and fire and flood

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,640
You must hear his story

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,980
And let his words and work be known

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,120
Don't let the conspiracy

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,820
Prevent you from finding slack

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,060
That's all your own

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,680
Go find the slack

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,300
That's all your own

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,960
Go find the slack

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,200
That's all your own

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,200


33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,260
That's all your own

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,920
That's all your own

35
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,960
That was, of course, the great Dr. Hal

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,040
With Princess Wee accompanying

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,080
It was recorded at WCSB Cleveland

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,840
Shortly after 20X Day

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,720
Actually, that was on Dr. Sinister's

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,740
Radio Synesthesia show

41
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,580
You might end up hearing it again

42
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,440
In a couple of weeks

43
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,160
We're traveling through time

44
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,060
In the way we are assembling shows currently

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,760
A lot of people recorded

46
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,200
A lot of show at Tarzan

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,280
radio station during the week-long X-Day drill in early July, but a week later I delivered two

48
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,700
serious rants at Starwood Festival, and those are not only timely, but they're designed to follow

49
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:17,060
one another. The first one was recorded on Midnight in the Puffer Dome, a really weird audio space

50
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:27,180
with crazy projections on the dome's sphere by Waking Dream, and music by Mayan Ruins of Cincinnati,

51
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,360
and it's only about half an hour long. We'll be hearing that in the last part of this episode,

52
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:39,860
which is number 1,633, by the way. The second Starwood rant from the main stage was a whole

53
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:46,740
hour, and it'll probably be the whole next hour of slack, but for now, however, before the rude,

54
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,040
rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude,

55
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,760
rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude,

56
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,600
let's finish the rather more sedate conversation that Dr. Howell and Reverend Mother Miller were

57
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:06,020
having that week from Tarzan's radio station in the Caffeinist Cafe at Wisteria Event Center in

58
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:15,740
deep southern Ohio. Now, what's this about an ant's brain? Well, the ant, as you know, has, like all

59
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:22,980
arthropods, a ventral nervous system which is involved into grouped ganglia, and the largest

60
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:33,040
and most complex ganglion is in the ant's little head, and this we call the brain. But the critter

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,780
is very small, and nervous impulses can flash back and forward at an incredible rate, unlike

62
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,480
your brontosaurus, where it takes half a minute to get from the head to the tail. So,

63
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:53,720
the ant's brain does not need to carry in its superfluous structures necessary for the higher

64
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,780
mammals with their complex limbic system, or even the humans with the over brain, which has

65
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:10,420
retrofitted over the limbic system. And the inter-folding complexity of the ant's brain

66
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,460
has been recently remarked on, but perhaps it is necessary to be done.

67
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,240
We will always listen to a question by the

68
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:26,720
CMSC Dr. C. Wolff from the Nations lunar museum.

69
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:36,360
Dr. Worrarck I wonder, what I got to say about the ant's brain.

70
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,500
The ant is not stealthy and happens to be a ì ‘bi across the entire body at an average

71
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:42,500


72
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,960
Dr. == That's on average 10 times the counterfeits value in life.

73
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,460
Dr. That Epicurus X Xiaomi.

74
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,240
at all, like the human brain. It was just crazy.

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,340
And I wondered how much of that has to do with

76
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,660
is there a collective insect

77
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,620
consciousness, the hive mentality?

78
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,800
What the crazy?

79
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,100
You know, I think by sharing

80
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,280
you get to

81
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,800
experience what the whole

82
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,580
experiences.

83
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,580
If you're part of a hive,

84
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,600
myrmidons,

85
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,060
remember the insectile

86
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,620
warriors that the ancient

87
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,520
Greeks spoke of,

88
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,980
semi-human,

89
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,520
the myrmidons are so

90
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,500
named because they were part human and part

91
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,600
ant, from myrmics

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,480
or ant. Yes, these

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,660
were fearsome warriors back in the

94
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,480
day. Where you also had the

95
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,560
cynocephali, you may have heard of them

96
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,480
who had dog-like heads

97
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,460
and stooped over bodies, but were

98
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,640
mighty warriors. And then there

99
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,660
were the aromaspians

100
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,700
who do wear

101
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,660
their heads below their shoulders.

102
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,680
That is to say, they had

103
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,960
no heads, but a sort of

104
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,960
cephalothorax, like a spider.

105
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,520
In their chest was their face,

106
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,100
their mouth, their

107
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,440
nose directly connected

108
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,380
with the lungs and so forth.

109
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,260
And then these big, bulked shoulders.

110
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,380
Up above that, they had a

111
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,240
civilization that lasted a long

112
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,520
time. In Paradise Lost,

113
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,820
John Milton describes

114
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,920
how the aromaspian

115
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,260
goes hunting for the jewels

116
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,980
hoarded by the griffon.

117
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,040
You know, that composite creature.

118
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,940
Falco Leonis,

119
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,520
Serpentus, has the

120
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,940
head of a falcon. You know, the griffon

121
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,020
and the forelegs of the

122
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,900
griffon are the hind legs of a bird

123
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,940
of prey. The body is the lion

124
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,160
of Africa. The tail is

125
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,820
serpentine. Aren't there griffons

126
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,020
mounted on the Hotel

127
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,700
Zilos in San Francisco? It has vast

128
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,020
wings by which it soars

129
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,020
aloft. No, those weren't really

130
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,840
griffons. They were some kind of

131
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,240
wyvern, I believe.

132
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,080
A wyvern is a small

133
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,840
bipedal

134
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,120
dragon with bat wings.

135
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,800
Which those were. Or sometimes a

136
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,080
quadrupedal dragon.

137
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,600
Mostly,

138
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,120
the Welsh wyvern

139
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,600
is definitely bipedal.

140
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,000
So it's pronounced wyvern.

141
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,840
W-Y-V-E-R-N. I've never heard

142
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,980
anyone pronounce it, and so this is my idea

143
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,180
of how it is pronounced.

144
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,080
Wyvern? Well, that's

145
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
picturesque. Probably true. I don't know.

146
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,580
Stangor fights

147
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,960
wyverns. Oh, he does, does he?

148
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,140
In Monster Hunter, yeah.

149
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,460
They're supposed to be tough creatures.

150
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,260
Not for Stangor. Not anymore.

151
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,200
Even the small ones

152
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,500
were feared by

153
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,060
travelers.

154
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,280
Well,

155
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,760
there's

156
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,160
some that are still a challenge.

157
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,920
I'll admit that. I read

158
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,460
the most amazing account

159
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,000
recently. I

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,060
ordered from Indiana University Press

161
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,200
a book on werewolves, a subject

162
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,920
which I've been more

163
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,000
interested in recently.

164
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,680
Don't call you Doctor.

165
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,720
How for nothing.

166
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,420
Well, the modern view,

167
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,700
which you kind of have to get past, is, oh, they just

168
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,520
have a problem. We don't understand

169
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,500
them. We've oppressed them, and

170
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,600
so forth. They eat human flesh.

171
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,680
They do do that, and they have

172
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,560
a, you know, they have a other...

173
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,660
It's a pathology. It's bad.

174
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,580
It's classically the worst

175
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,680
of the wolf and the worst of the human together.

176
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,500
Now, in their defense,

177
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,020
it can be said that

178
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,340
they have indeed been horribly

179
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,420
persecuted and burned and tortured

180
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,500
and torn apart in public and so

181
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,080
on because

182
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,360
they wanted to discourage that sort

183
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
of thing. Or they wanted to show they

184
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,980
were righteous since the

185
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,400
lycanthrope obviously has to be a

186
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,240
manifestation of Satan.

187
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,240
They always show the

188
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,420
transformation occurring in just a couple

189
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,480
of minutes, and, well, that's Hollywood.

190
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,480
But, of course, that transformation takes

191
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,440
a huge amount of energy,

192
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,540
and what your classic wolfman

193
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,640
does is startle

194
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,320


195
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,320


196
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,320


197
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,320


198
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,320


199
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,320


200
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,660
metamorphosing as the moon

201
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,820
waxes, and then at its

202
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,600
peak, you have the full transformation,

203
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,920
and then it wanes as the moon

204
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,760
wanes, and that still in itself

205
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,420
is a remarkable cellular

206
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,860
transformation involving

207
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,360
a great modification of the body.

208
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,440
Sounds painful. It is

209
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,160
painful, and it adds

210
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,520
to the anger and ire of

211
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,880
the werewolf. That's why they're so cranky

212
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,240
because they hurt all the time. They're just

213
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,680
old curmudgeons.

214
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,180
You know, now I'm in a tip,

215
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,980
because

216
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,400
when you're in constant pain

217
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,620
and irritation, yes, you tend to lash

218
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,460
out, and if nature has

219
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,460
conveniently provided you with claws,

220
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,540
fangs, carnassial teeth,

221
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,220
and superhuman strength,

222
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,340
the ability to jump and

223
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,680
roar and rip and so forth,

224
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,300
but don't get me started. Anyway,

225
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,120
so I wanted to write

226
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,400
this new book from Indiana University

227
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,620
Press, which looked like the

228
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,540
most promising werewolf

229
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
book yet, so I

230
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,840
wrote down the number, which is how

231
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,820
you make those orders. You're not allowed to write

232
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,940
down the title. When the book finally

233
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,760
came, it was the wrong book.

234
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,880
I know I wrote down the

235
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,740
number correctly, but that's the problem with

236
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,740
the system. So

237
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,720
this book that I received instead was

238
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,840
the memoirs of an

239
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,520
Arabic traveler named

240
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,640
his, he has a long Islamic

241
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,780
name, 10 or 15 words

242
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,760
long, but scholars know him

243
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,820
as Ibn Battuta.

244
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,380
He started off on his

245
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,420
travels just at about the same

246
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,640
time as the aged Marco Polo

247
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,200
was dying in Italy,

248
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,660
and he went everywhere. He was

249
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,500
an Islamic teacher. He

250
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,340
taught at a madrasa. He visited

251
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,480
all the islands, some of the same ones

252
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,900
that Sinbad visited.

253
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,500
He went to China. He went to India.

254
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,820
He did go to Ceylon.

255
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,480
He was

256
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,320
favored at court

257
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,520
by a hideous sultan who was

258
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,560
really nice to you, except when he

259
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,420
wasn't, and then he tortured you,

260
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,600
in ungodly ways, and let you

261
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,300
and your remains be shown in

262
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,600
public. And to Ibn Battuta,

263
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,680
this sultan entrusted a very

264
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,520
important mission, and ships

265
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,720
filled with gold and tribute and so on,

266
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,920
which was all immediately

267
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,460
stolen when Hindu pirates

268
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,580
attacked, and Ibn

269
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,020
thought it was the better part of

270
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,480
valor not to return to that particular

271
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,540
sultan's court.

272
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,560
But there were two things that

273
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,560
really rocked me in this

274
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,120
book. One of them is,

275
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,120
he saw the Indian rope trick

276
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,500
performed. Oh, you described this on your

277
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,740
show before. It was pretty gruesome.

278
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,040
Well, that is the classic Indian rope trick.

279
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,300
But, so much for all

280
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,380
these modern scholars and people

281
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,120
who don't know anything, who say,

282
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,880
oh, this whole thing about the Indian rope trick,

283
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,000
British colonialism,

284
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,240
crap, you know, they never did that.

285
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,360
You make your oppressed victim exotic,

286
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,980
you know, trash,

287
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,280
not worth investigating.

288
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,760
It was classically described.

289
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,820
It was seen in the marketplace.

290
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,120
And the Islamic

291
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,320
Middle Ages by Ibn Battuta.

292
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,260
Have you ever heard of the

293
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,580
Indian rope trick, Stang?

294
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,480
Oh, sure. I've seen it

295
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,280
in cartoons many times. Yeah, they show it in

296
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,480
cartoons. The

297
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,380
fakir causes the rope

298
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,260
to rise, but the top

299
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,180
of the rope disappears. It's sometimes

300
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,140
represented as going into a little cloud.

301
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,320
You can't see the top of the

302
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,440
rope. So then the apprentice

303
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,340
climbs the rope and

304
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,820
disappears into the cloud.

305
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,300
And then, this is all what

306
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,060
Battuta saw, the master climbs

307
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,360
the rope and disappears into the

308
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,320
cloud. Then pieces

309
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,380
of the apprentice start falling

310
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,480
down. Arms, legs, head

311
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,020
chopped up,

312
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,580
falling back down. Then the master

313
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,380
climbs down the rope. He bends

314
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,360
over, he picks the pieces

315
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,400
up, he puts them back together, and

316
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,380
the apprentice is all

317
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,760
well again. End of trick.

318
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,180
And at the same time,

319
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,200
Battuta watched this incredulously,

320
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,080
an Arab friend of his was

321
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,340
standing next to him saying,

322
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,900
it's all a fake. This is faked.

323
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,100
This is trickery. Don't believe in it.

324
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,620
It's fake.

325
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,620
So that was one amazing

326
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,940
incident from Battuta's

327
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,980
travels. The other one

328
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,660
is perhaps even more interesting

329
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,880
to some of us, which is that once

330
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,860
during one of the many voyages,

331
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,680
they saw a dark mass

332
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,080
on the horizon towering

333
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,000
up, and they thought perhaps it was land.

334
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,900
But then, to their horror,

335
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,320
they saw this dark mass rise

336
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,340
up into the sky,

337
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,820
and the captain said, we're lost.

338
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,940
It is the Ruh, that giant

339
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,860
bird, you know, it's coming this way

340
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,600
and we'll be destroyed.

341
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,900
But by the grace of Allah,

342
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,300
it didn't, it veered

343
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,860
off. It didn't come that way. Nonetheless,

344
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,160
they saw sky and

345
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,000
water under it

346
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,280
as it rose and as it took off.

347
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,800
And they felt the wind

348
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,160
of its passage

349
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,480
even though they were far away.

350
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,640
Well, that's another

351
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,020
incident that made me happy.

352
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,100
I had to slog through all the rest of it about

353
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,200
what they ate, what the sultan

354
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,160
did, why the sultan's wives were

355
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,100
immoral. Actually, that part

356
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,860
wasn't too bad.

357
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,960
But, anyway,

358
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,580
it wasn't about werewolves, but

359
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,620
it was interesting.

360
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,660
That giant bird couldn't beat Popeye.

361
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,420
I saw Popeye. Yeah, Popeye

362
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,380
turned it into a giant

363
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,180
roasted turkey.

364
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,660
So, wait, wait, you're talking about this giant rock.

365
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,240
Is it like that bird from The Claw?

366
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,160
The giant...

367
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,840
The Giant Claw.

368
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,100
Ugliest of all the monsters.

369
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,020
You know, Sam Katzman,

370
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,200
that producer at Columbia, tried to

371
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,920
design the octopus

372
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,420
in Ray Harryhausen's It Came From Beneath

373
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,020
the Sea, and Harryhausen

374
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,100
didn't understand why he was saying,

375
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,240
you're doing it wrong. He figured

376
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,120
out that what Katzman thought was that the

377
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,000
octopus was like in Popeye cartoons

378
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,360
with the sack at the top and the tentacles

379
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,740
down at the bottom instead of...

380
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,540
the sack essentially behind.

381
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,120
So, Harryhausen got his way, but in

382
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,520
The Giant Claw, Sam Katzman

383
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,940
got his way, who personally

384
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,180
designed the monster and had

385
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,640
cheap craftsmen

386
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,900
construct it in Mexico.

387
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,220
And all the people who had starred in the

388
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,760
movie had not seen the monster,

389
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,080
but they'd been in other better movies

390
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,920
with better monsters, and they assumed that

391
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,080
their reactions to it

392
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,120
would make sense.

393
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,920
When Jeff Morrow, who was the star,

394
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,780
went into a theater and saw it, he said,

395
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,160
wanted to sink down into his seat

396
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,080
in mortification and shame

397
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,460
because it is such a goofy

398
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,480
monster. It's the goofiest,

399
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,720
silliest-looking

400
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,380
giant turkey-saurus

401
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,780
thing with the

402
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,080
snaggly teeth, a Jimmy Durante

403
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,120
nose, tufts of hair,

404
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
big googly eyes. You can only

405
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,360
laugh at it, despite the fact that

406
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,200
it's an antimatter invader from

407
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,180
outer space, you know,

408
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,320
flying around the world and destroying it,

409
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,800
which is a fine plot, but...

410
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,480
But then why does it have to look like that?

411
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,060
Producers.

412
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,920
Leaving their P mark.

413
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,940
That's what it is. They don't give us

414
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,120
producers enough credit. I'm gonna make

415
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,180
sure this monster looks really scary

416
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:56,840
this time.

417
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,980
Irwin Allen. People like that.

418
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
I wrote a letter to famous monsters

419
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,320
complaining about Irwin Allen

420
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,780
and Forry defended him

421
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,100
because ever since

422
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,280
they printed an article

423
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,020
by Joe Dante criticizing certain

424
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,700
AIP productions and were

425
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,380
then they outraged

426
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,560
AIP.

427
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,100
From then on, famous monsters

428
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,260
could only praise monster

429
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,220
movies no matter how bad they were.

430
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,380
And that always astonished me,

431
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,020
you know. Here they're giving this

432
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,660
big loving treatment to

433
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,320
Night of the Blood Beast.

434
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,120
Or something like that with stills,

435
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,980
columns of print,

436
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,300
and not anywhere there

437
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,900
does it say this is one of the most boring,

438
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,620
stupid movies you'll ever see.

439
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,280
A complete waste of time. You'll be discouraged.

440
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,180
It was fake news.

441
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,840
But no.

442
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,540
But I liked it.

443
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,160
Better to enthuse about everything

444
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
than to curse

445
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,960
about most things except

446
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,980
one's favorites, which is what

447
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,940
C.C. Beck did in his rival

448
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,460
monster magazine, Castle of Frankenstein.

449
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,100
The intellectual's

450
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,020
monster magazine. Boy,

451
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,020
I loved that one. I would haunt every

452
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,040
Circle K and 7-Eleven because

453
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,920
very occasionally

454
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,920
one would pop out, but they were so

455
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,940
rare you had to find them on

456
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,000
the stands and amid the

457
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,480
biker magazines and

458
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,900
other things, but there you go.

459
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,240
They

460
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,560
certainly had a lot of attitude

461
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,140
and when hippiedom

462
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,260
happened, they enthusiastically

463
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,980
were acid heads and now their

464
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,700
magazine was psychedelic and

465
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,940
cool and had monsters and

466
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,660
Timothy Leary and

467
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:39,840
...

468
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,180
...

469
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,020
...

470
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,340
in a room full of

471
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:44,680
monotonic

472
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:44,680


473
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,000
and

474
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,280
he of the

475
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,600
This recorder shows it's been on for two hours and 16 minutes.

476
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,340
I'm going to give it a break.

477
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,680
Obviously time to bring these babbling, senile reminiscences to an end.

478
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,140
But remember, we were here to fill in when duty unfortunately took you away.

479
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,220
There must be something.

480
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,700
Oh, that wasn't unfortunate.

481
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,420
I left here with this.

482
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,640
When I left with Dr. Leguien, this was full of cash.

483
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,180
Now it's full of guns and ammo.

484
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,960
Okay, yeah.

485
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,640
It's heavy. It's very heavy.

486
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,940
More than kind pills, Bob.

487
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,180
More than kind pills, Bob.

488
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,500
As they said, every day is X day if you have a gun.

489
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,520
And more than kind pills, Bob.

490
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,920
Okay, friends, thank you, Reverend Mother Miller and Dr. Howell.

491
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,500
Now the Puffer Dome rant.

492
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,720
And we'll end with a song by the Rainmakers.

493
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,120
37 years of carefree life.

494
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,040
Is this still true?

495
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:58,700
Yes.

496
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,260
I hear it now.

497
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,360
I hear it now.

498
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:05,740
What is it?

499
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,680
Oh, no.

500
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,940
I hear it now.

501
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,840
That noise signifies a change of mood.

502
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
I hear it now.

503
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,160


504
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,460
I hate to break up the nice solemn solemnity there.

505
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,040
But I'm here to be funny.

506
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:40,920
Now, on the other hand, these are not funny times anymore.

507
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,160
I was hoping they would be funny.

508
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,520
They are funnier.

509
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,040
But I'm not going to bum you all out tonight.

510
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,620
I'm going to do that on Saturday afternoon.

511
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:03,300
When I will preach an actual, somewhat more thought-out sermon

512
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:14,340
that is, I hope, going to really, really humiliate and insult some minority of people.

513
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,160
I'm pretty sure the majority of people will say,

514
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,120
at Starwood will be going, yeah, right on, finally, somebody's saying it.

515
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,560
And there's going to be some people going, he's making me feel like a snowflake.

516
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,860
Oh, I can't wait.

517
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,060
Now, actually, things can still be funny these days.

518
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,900
And not even from the White House.

519
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:53,480
In fact, my script was written when I turned on, when I looked at a news website this morning.

520
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:06,080
There were two things in there that were, one was so dumb, I just had to jump up and go, praise Bob!

521
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,500
And the other one was so cool that I had to jump up and go, praise Bob!

522
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,260
In fact, let's all do that.

523
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:13,880
Praise Bob!

524
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:13,880


525
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,800
Praise Bob!

526
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:15,660
Yeah!

527
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:25,000
You know, it's amazing to me, some of these graphics that are being projected by Waking Dream

528
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:34,300
started off as, well, I have to admit it, LSD scribbles in the early 1980s.

529
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:43,780
Then they were turned into more careful scribbles and then translated into clip art and then redrawn by,

530
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,820
really good artists.

531
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:51,780
And now, thanks to thousands of dollars worth of equipment, they look like LSD scribbles again!

532
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,260
The circle is complete!

533
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,440
It's beautiful!

534
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:07,540
But, yes, they're, okay, the first thing I saw in the news today, oh, it did my heart such good.

535
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,120
It had to do with this creation museum in Kentucky.

536
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,040
Okay.

537
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,060
It's a really expensive one.

538
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:25,900
And the only way they could sink so much money into something that dumb was by using taxpayer money.

539
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:36,180
In Kentucky, instead of doing a science science museum, they did a creation science museum with taxpayer money.

540
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,920
I happen to be fairly well acquainted.

541
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,820
I'm very well acquainted with a different creation museum, one in Texas, the Creation Evidence Museum.

542
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,720
I know too much about it.

543
00:22:51,820 --> 00:23:02,060
I visited it for the first time just last year and I'm building a competing museum in Texas called the Destructionist Museum.

544
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,740
But I don't want to give away all of our secrets yet.

545
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,700
It's going to be great.

546
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,020
And the road signs leading up to it will be as good as possible.

547
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm going to go to the Burma Shade.

548
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:21,500
But the Creation Evidence Museum in Kentucky, oh, it's gigantic.

549
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:30,040
It's built to look like Noah's Ark, whatever, which is basically a big box of so many cubits.

550
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:40,660
And I've never been there myself, but I know that it has lost so much money, they can't believe it.

551
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,560
It costs so much.

552
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,000
It costs so much.

553
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,000


554
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,380
It costs the taxpayers of Kentucky a lot.

555
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,100
And it's not working.

556
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,840
In fact, a lot of Christians go to it wanting to like it and they come away going, well, that was sure lame.

557
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,740
So it made the news that it was failing miserably.

558
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,540
Here's the great part.

559
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:12,520
The director of that museum, a Mr. Ken Ham, made the news, I think, this morning.

560
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:27,360
He explained the reason that they failed so miserably financially was because of atheists praying for them to fail.

561
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,700
Now, stop and think of it.

562
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,440
That's not, that's a direct quote.

563
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,580
We failed because the atheists prayed for us to fail.

564
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,480
Do you know what that tells us?

565
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:51,840
For one thing, there's what, like maybe one atheist for every 50 Christians or believers of whatever kind?

566
00:24:52,540 --> 00:25:00,440
This, the guy just admitted that praying to nobody works ten times better than praying to Jesus.

567
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:11,620
If I had known that my prayers would be heard by God, I, but how, how the hell am I supposed to work that?

568
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,980
I don't even believe it.

569
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,260
I don't believe in God.

570
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,460
I'd be talking to myself.

571
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,840
I shouldn't say that it's, it's not that I don't believe in God.

572
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:29,960
It's that why would I or anyone else be expected to understand that kind of thing?

573
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:37,280
It's a miracle enough that we can understand some of the rules of the force of gravity.

574
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,960
So, but anyway, you know, any, if there are any disciplines that are not, you know, you

575
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:42,960


576
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:49,880
Ok, well, I can admit that I don't believe in God.

577
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,420
I would say that I believe in Darwinism.

578
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,160
I don't believe I don't have any.

579
00:25:53,160 --> 00:26:09,720
I don't have anylan tree, I believe in people from planet music as the more civilization

580
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,880
learned indispensable to humanity.

581
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,960
You have to stay.

582
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:42,940
Bob. Now that was the dumb, yeah, the prayers of atheists caused us to fail. Thank you Ken Ham, you made my day. The next thing in the news, it was from the neighboring state of Tennessee, which normally is as dumb as Kentucky, although not nearly as dumb as Texas, Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi.

583
00:26:42,960 --> 00:27:00,380
And Arkansas. I really follow this stuff. And here was this article. This one was so good, I wanted, it's very short. It's from the Tennessee newspaper, the Chattanooga Bystander.

584
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:12,660
It has a picture of a Tennessee license plate with the words Hail Satan in the middle of it and a pentangle upside down as it should be.

585
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:33,780
Hail Satan license plates now available in Tennessee. Now, that's not all though. I remember when there was a pagan guy in the military that was sued so that he could get pagan stuff on his tombstone at Arlington Cemetery and I think he won.

586
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,140
Well, this was something like that.

587
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,740
After Tennessee legislators passed a bill to allow residents to get

588
00:27:42,740 --> 00:28:03,340
license plates that bear the phrase in God we trust, in the interest of religious diversity, other plates were made available that bear other religious phrases, including Shalom, Namaste, Praise Jah, and Hail Satan.

589
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,700
I'm sure they have plenty of other ones. They should have the Hail Eris on there.

590
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,340
But get this.

591
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,720
It's only faithful.

592
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:19,340
Then said Tennessee State Senator Bodie Prince Chip.

593
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,120
Borodee Senator Prynne Shrip said,

594
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,420
He said, quote, we should celebrate our diversity.

595
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,560
This is unusual for Tennessee.

596
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,140
Quote.

597
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,700
Yes.

598
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:42,720
We are deep in the Bible belt that the freedom of religion is a constitutionally protected right, saidiestate.

599
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:42,720


600
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:42,720


601
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:42,720


602
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:42,720


603
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:51,840
print trip holding up a license plate with the phrase there's no prob with Bob

604
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:08,040
that's an available license plate now I feel like writing to him and going hey

605
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:14,220
actually we're a Texas novelty company and that's not religious freedom that's

606
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:22,760
a trademark violation and they didn't spell Bob right they left the quotes off

607
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,040
but that might just be the important the interesting thing is somebody in the

608
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:33,500
government office that runs license plates knew about us and threw us right

609
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,880
in there with all the other world religions the Church of the subgenius is

610
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,020
you know I'm gonna let you know that I'm gonna let you know that I'm gonna let you

611
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:45,300
know that I'm gonna let you know that I'm gonna let you know that I'm gonna let you

612
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:55,880
know that I'm gonna let you know that I'm gonna let you know that I'm gonna let

613
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:04,300
you know that I'm gonna let you know that I'm gonna let you know that I'm gonna

614
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,200
94

615
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,960
but

616
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:14,320
that but but look what happened I mean he tried to start this cool little funny

617
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:23,500
joke cult and come my god look what happened a couple of guys in the 1600s

618
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,860
decided to write a satirical pamphlet under the fictitious name Christian

619
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:36,620
Rosen prance it was a joke but it turned into the entire new age so my

620
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:41,300
old partner and I dr. Philodrom and have been very very careful to make sure the

621
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:47,600
Church of the subgenius has elements built into it trap doors and rugs that

622
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,580
get pulled out from under you if you start to believe the wrong things which

623
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,140
is any of it

624
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,840
so that we don't end up in the middle of a cult

625
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,380
inadvertently starting another thing like the Mormons or Scientology only a

626
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:09,780
thousand times worse because our stuff so much better frankly horribly it's

627
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:19,660
more believable and in fact since last year the most ridiculous absurd

628
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:27,560
impossible to even imagine subgenius prophecies much like Mike Judge's movie

629
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:35,820
idiocracy all came to pass Arnold Palmer died that meant the Trevino's one

630
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:46,700
Donald Trump is president obviously Dobbs prophecy came true it's not our fault

631
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:54,320
okay in fact we were selling a button last year that said don't blame me I

632
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,540
voted for Bob although if you did vote for Bob you would have been in the top 10 in the world.

633
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:03,080
actually vote for Bob I'm afraid we do blame you but the important thing was

634
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:11,400
because I didn't the important thing was I left that little button is red white

635
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:17,920
and blue button that said don't blame me I voted for Bob I've got into the wash

636
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:25,960
and it got washed but it came out fine these colors don't run I see some people

637
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,540
are old enough to remember that but I'm not going to do that I'm going to do it again.

638
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:27,540


639
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,080
oh what else

640
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:42,340
yeah I really I'm planning to I'm planning to do this kind of a serious

641
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:50,340
sermon on Saturday because well the president said it was okay to be crude

642
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:57,480
and un-PC and insult people and have I got some crude and

643
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:05,760
unsultry insulting things for just the smattering of the crowd I think I am an

644
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,680
optimist about that kind of thing although this year I got to admit it it

645
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:18,300
started to turn out that our most pessimistic our most outrageously

646
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:26,480
pessimistic notions in Church of the subgenius turned out to be lots of bleep

647
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:35,940
optimistic and naive. You can't write science fiction as nutty as what's going on now, although

648
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:43,540
Neil Stephens' Anathem is not a bad start. It takes place in a world where science has

649
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:52,780
basically been outlawed, and I know not all of y'all are scientists. In fact, I'm just

650
00:33:52,780 --> 00:34:01,280
a junior scientist, and for that matter, I'm really just a clown junior scientist. But

651
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:10,160
they did kind of basically start outlawing science this year. Church's subgenius sells

652
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:17,600
you a doctorate in the forbidden sciences. Well, all sciences are forbidden at this point.

653
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,760
Astrology, astronomy, they're all exactly the same. All turn to the other side. All

654
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:28,100
turn to facts. So welcome to the church of the subgenius, all you forbidden scientists.

655
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:37,840
If you even suspect that evolution might be right, that's thought crime. It's funny, I

656
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:45,660
had to drive to Wisteria three times in the last two weeks from Cleveland, so I ended

657
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:51,460
up listening to audio books. I listened to an audio book of George Orwell's 1984.

658
00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:01,860
Well, what a surprise. It sounded like a boring, old, outdated documentary. But, oh,

659
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,120
I said I wasn't going to bum everybody out. Okay. So I'll talk about something cute. Dogs!

660
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:18,580
Dogs. You don't see dogs at Starwood very often. I guess that some people, if you can

661
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,760
get a, if you have one of those licenses that says you're a dog, you're a dog. You're a dog.

662
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:22,760


663
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:29,500
You're a service animal, or you're a pet, whatever pet. Then it's okay. I have seen

664
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,860
somebody walk your dog around here. The thing is, this is my first Starwood where I had

665
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:43,180
to bring a dog. I inherited an old hound dog from my father, who shot through, as he put

666
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:52,760
it, about two years ago. Now, I got his beautiful house and his, his cool old coonhound. And,

667
00:35:52,780 --> 00:36:01,980
I wish he could be here tonight. He would love to meet everybody. He's a very laid back old dog.

668
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,840
He's a terrible watchdog. If a burglar came in the house, he'd wag his tail and beg for treats

669
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:22,760
from him. But, but his kind isn't allowed here. I understand the policy. Because, you know,

670
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:29,220
a lot of people think their dog is the best, like, like their child. They assume it's the best

671
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:37,280
creature in the world until it pees on somebody else's dog or child or bites their face off or

672
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:47,960
whatnot. So, it's, really the rules here are very similar to that bar in the oldest Star Wars movie.

673
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,760
You bring the dog over and it's like, we don't allow his kind. And, you know, it's very difficult to, you know,

674
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:52,760


675
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:52,760


676
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:52,760


677
00:36:52,780 --> 00:37:00,320
here they also don't allow droids at wisteria now i'm not complaining about wisteria i understand

678
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:10,040
the policy but here's the thing there could be this room could be half droids how would we know

679
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:19,460
now you could dress my hound dog up in a suit and every and everybody would know he was a dog

680
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:27,580
i know because i tried and i i wasn't able to sneak him in but droids hey they can make them

681
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:33,860
pretty realistic now i think they're up to nexus seven or something that's a pretty pretty

682
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:42,520
realistic model how do you know that that pagan sitting next to you isn't one of those i don't

683
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:48,100
know obama droids they put out a few years ago in fact

684
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:57,540
how do you know you're not one if you're well enough made you wouldn't know the difference

685
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,300
i understand there's a tv show about that called westworld but i

686
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,480
haven't seen it because i sort of swore off tv

687
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:16,660
as i say this standing in a room full of projections of images that i can make

688
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,260
by the way

689
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:25,660
folks you hear a lot about fake news and the lame stream media and all that

690
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:34,320
i actually worked in that for half my life i never was well actually i was a journalist

691
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:43,940
a few times i never uh i never finished college so i ended up being sometimes i was a writer and

692
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:49,440
sometimes i was a typesetter but sometimes i was just the office boy but it was for a

693
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:56,760
it was all

694
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,160
Vanilla

695
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,180
some

696
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,300
content

697
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:14,420
real stuff

698
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,060
just

699
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,700
They were trying to outdo each other, discovering real stuff.

700
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,600
That's what their competition is all about.

701
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,480
Somehow they got changed around.

702
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,740
Oops, I wasn't going to talk about that.

703
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,920
I was going to talk about the funny stuff.

704
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,200
The dogs and the droids, okay?

705
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,400
So how do you know?

706
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,720
How do you know the person next to you isn't a really well-programmed artificial intelligence?

707
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,420
Well, probably you can smell them.

708
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:51,180
We don't have Terminator models yet that actually stink just like people.

709
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,840
We don't think.

710
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,420
But that wouldn't be hard to do.

711
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,660
I can think of a few friends that just scrape the side of their leg and rub it onto my Android

712
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,340
and probably fool my dog.

713
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,020
So yeah, friends.

714
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,920
Oh, this is the main point of the dog story.

715
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:19,400
Okay, Starwood is all about, in theory, transformation, learning.

716
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,980
It wasn't originally started as a pagan thing specifically.

717
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,120
It was started kind of like that old magazine Mondo 2000.

718
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:37,580
It was going to be a place, I think what Jeff and Joe had in mind,

719
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,400
was a festival where everyone was welcome.

720
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:41,680
Everyone.

721
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:42,300


722
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700


723
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700


724
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700


725
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700


726
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700


727
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700


728
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700


729
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700


730
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700


731
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700


732
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700


733
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,700


734
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,820
The Satanist, an atheist, a Wiccan, a druid, a clown junior scientist, whatever.

735
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,320
It was just, let's get together and prove that we're not really enemies.

736
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:56,800
Let's communicate.

737
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:04,720
And by the way, it's because of that that I still have plenty of, let's just say it,

738
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,120
Republican friends and family.

739
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,260
Because when you stop talking, then...

740
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,160
That's the end, you know?

741
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:23,500
So I'd rather serve as an example of a libtard who hasn't completely joined that bubble yet.

742
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,120
In fact, I spend an unhealthy amount of time inside the right-wing bubble and echo chamber,

743
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,560
probably more than most Trump voters.

744
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,480
And I've been doing it since the 70s,

745
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,620
which is why I may be a little bit more...

746
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,260
suspicious.

747
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,500
But I wasn't going to go there.

748
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,040
I was going to save that for Saturday.

749
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,160
Okay, the transformational aspects of Starwood.

750
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,980
It works on dogs.

751
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,900
Just the vibes.

752
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,420
The poor creature can't come down here with me,

753
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,580
but we've been sneaking around the perimeter a lot.

754
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,000
We're staying in Charlene's little bed and breakfast up at the top of the hill.

755
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,620
We can hear the music.

756
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,500
We can hear the music from up there.

757
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,960
And he knows there's a party going on.

758
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,460
And we go down to the registration place

759
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:25,320
and greet people coming in before someone chases us away.

760
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,480
And there are secret trails that lead down to the swimming hole,

761
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,520
that pond that everyone's afraid to go in,

762
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,620
except the bravest and hardiest.

763
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,340
And the dog and I did go down there and spy.

764
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,160
Were you down there?

765
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,360
We may have actually spied on you for a very brief time from a distance.

766
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,820
We didn't want to creep anybody out.

767
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,500
But, oh, he wanted to get down there.

768
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,880
Anyway, this place we're staying at, Charlene's,

769
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:03,060
it has a creature that he's never seen domesticated before.

770
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,220
This dog grew up on a cattle ranch,

771
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,080
and all of his friends and relatives had dogs.

772
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,020
Did he have dogs?

773
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,600
No one had a cat.

774
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,380
So, suddenly, during the previous festival, X-Day,

775
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,880
and this one, Starwood,

776
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,920
he was forced to live in a bed and breakfast with cats!

777
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,200
And for the first three days,

778
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,440
his whole attitude was,

779
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,000
you don't understand!

780
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,540
They're not dogs!

781
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,560
You can't pet them!

782
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,600
You can't feed them!

783
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,780
They're cats!

784
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,680
They're evil!

785
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,620
They're the worst, stinkiest,

786
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,460
thing in the world!

787
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,900
They're even stinkier than monkey people!

788
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,040
Now, this dog was raised to chase raccoons,

789
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,860
and cats are kind of the same size and move similarly.

790
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,380
And he just, every instinct in his body

791
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,560
made him want to chase Charlene's two cats and break their necks.

792
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,740
But, those are two cool cats.

793
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,840
They both were, I think they were strays

794
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,600
that she took.

795
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,580
And what does one of them catch on her reach?

796
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:13,780
A coot.

797
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:13,880
And then, she wasæœ€è¿‘oh,

798
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,700
one was a tough old tom cat named Sam.

799
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:22,720
Sam was not intimidated by my gigantic hound dog.

800
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,660
This dog is like a tiger.

801
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,360
He's, ah, well, maybe more of the size

802
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,380
of a mountain lion.

803
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,020
He's really big.

804
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,800
But, the cat

805
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,540
would not shirk or run away.

806
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,340
So of course I basically had to hold the leash really tight.

807
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,860
The dog's just landed!

808
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,380
It's a cat! We have to kill him!

809
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,920
But I decided, hey, it's Starwood. He can learn.

810
00:44:54,740 --> 00:45:01,400
We're not going to be like the people on the internet that just insult each other all day long.

811
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,300
We're going to actually try to communicate.

812
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:11,040
So I sat there with that dog out on the porch with the cat about five feet away

813
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:19,120
and a tight grip on the leash and I just let that dog stare, trembling at that cat.

814
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,960
And the cat stared boldly back at the dog.

815
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,880
I let him do that and I sat there for half an hour.

816
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,460
A little bit later on, we went in the house.

817
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,960
There's like a glass door.

818
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,280
It's a glass door.

819
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:40,720
The dog could see the cat outside the glass door.

820
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,440
The cat was just standing against the glass door.

821
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:49,200
He was just sitting by the glass door, looking at the dog as if to say,

822
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,960
you know, I own this place and you can't do anything at all.

823
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,780
And the dog's just, if that glass wasn't there, I'd get that cat.

824
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,820
I'd get that cat.

825
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,480
Meanwhile, the cat saunters away and heads off.

826
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,800
The dog can't see the cat, but he knows he's out there.

827
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:14,180
He just couldn't, he couldn't let go of his intense hatred.

828
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,740
The cat, meanwhile, climbs in the window behind the dog.

829
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:30,800
There's four of us humans or subgeniuses watching and laughing as the cat walks up right behind the dog.

830
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,500
Who's still just so obsessed.

831
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,760
He doesn't realize the cat has entered the room and is behind him.

832
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:47,100
The cat walks up, sniffs the dog's butt, then flips around like, huh, and saunters away.

833
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:55,140
At no point did the dog know that he, I don't normally use this kind of language, but it's literally true.

834
00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:00,200
Sam the cat made Dammit the dog his little bitch.

835
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:10,480
Now, the funny thing though is, after a couple of days, they got more and more used to each other.

836
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,380
The dog knew that he was not going to be allowed to kill the cat.

837
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,560
And he was forced to watch while people, including us, petted the cat.

838
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,160
The cat got to eat this yummy fishy smelling food.

839
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,900
The cat was treated just like a dog.

840
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,700
And I, Der,

841
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,960
During X day, the dog was still nervous around the cats.

842
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,760
He kind of wanted to get after them.

843
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,040
But we went back to Cleveland for a while.

844
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:41,840
And we came back.

845
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,880
The dog's like, we came back to Wisteria and that bed and breakfast.

846
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,500
The dog is like, we're going back to that house full of cats again?

847
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,360
Are you crazy?

848
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,760
Well, I guess I'll try to make friends with them.

849
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,420
And I swear that dog has become,

850
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,180
so adjusted to the cats,

851
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,940
that he honestly, obviously wants to make friends.

852
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,960
The cats have not gotten that far yet.

853
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,420
But that dog, affected by the vibes of Starwood,

854
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:20,340
changed from an instinct driven, cat killing monster,

855
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,680
which was his job on a cattle ranch,

856
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,860
into a friendly, open minded,

857
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:31,460
a lot more open minded than those two cats are.

858
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,220
I think he'd probably love to lay down and sleep with them.

859
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,560
And maybe by the time Starwood is over, that will happen.

860
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,620
Heck, maybe by the time Starwood's over,

861
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,760
all of us will lay down and sleep together.

862
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,840
Actually, that sounds kind of gross and horrible.

863
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,820
I think that's for the church of all worlds, folks.

864
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,400
I got to,

865
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,240
praise the church of all worlds.

866
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,920
That's one of my favorite rival cults.

867
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,360
We pretend to be a sex cult,

868
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,080
but they're a real sex cult.

869
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,320
So, friends, really, that was my main thing.

870
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:21,100
I just wanted to let you know that the influence of a calm communication,

871
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,800
possibly a certain,

872
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,100
a certain amount of pot smoking,

873
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,640
and just time,

874
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:35,940
can cause even a hound dog to become a cat lover.

875
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:41,160
Now, could this possibly work with us monkey people?

876
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:48,180
Not if we stay barking and growling at each other all the time.

877
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,960
And I've noticed that most of that barking and growling,

878
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,600
it happens on the internet,

879
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,600
where people aren't looking at each other.

880
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,940
But that's where a lot of people spend more time.

881
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,360
So, of course, things are getting nastier,

882
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,100
because you can be a cowardly, anonymous jerk,

883
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,860
if you want to,

884
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,360
and a lot of people seem to spend all day long doing that.

885
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,360
Last year, I stood here and said,

886
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,320
I don't trust the cyber Bob.

887
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,720
I only trust the real,

888
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,920
the Bob that's in front of you.

889
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,340
Actually, I'm terrified of both of them.

890
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,320
But, I think you know what I'm saying.

891
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:31,920
It's better to look a person in the face

892
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,600
and tell them they're an idiot

893
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,360
than it is to do it on the internet,

894
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,820
because when you're doing it to their face,

895
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,380
you're going to be a lot more polite

896
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,240
about telling them they're an idiot.

897
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,680
And nobody's going to go to the point of

898
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,480
punching each other in the nose, most likely.

899
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,260
Now, if I do my job correctly,

900
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,740
on Saturday when I did my main sermon,

901
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,020
I'll get somebody to want to punch me in the nose.

902
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,360
Then I'll know that I have succeeded.

903
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,600
I've reached true communication.

904
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,960
And I'm not worried about it,

905
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,520
because I'm usually much faster at ducking and running

906
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,980
than the drunks that try to punch me in the nose.

907
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,100
Um, friends,

908
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,320
I think I've been yakking for about half an hour,

909
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,840
and to tell the truth,

910
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,520
I've been taking care of an 88-year-old human

911
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,240
and an 88-year-old dog.

912
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,280
And we kind of have to go...

913
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,540
I have to spend a lot of time up the hill babysitting,

914
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,680
while my wife, Princess We Are Doe,

915
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,520
queen of all the UFOs,

916
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,440
is down here on the field saving Starwood.

917
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:46,820
With the help of the nostrils over there

918
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,580
and everybody else on the A staff,

919
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,360
who is...

920
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,300
had to pick up the ball and run with it.

921
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,820
You know, we've lost a lot of people.

922
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,980
We've lost some hard, hard-working,

923
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:02,520
uh, Starwood volunteer staff.

924
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,920
For volunteers, they sure did spend a lot of time on it.

925
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,060
And for no pay.

926
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,200
And, uh, so we're glad to see younger people

927
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,940
taking their places,

928
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,140
and we'd love to see more of that, too.

929
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,140
I'm one of the ones who got too old

930
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,160
to deal with it anymore.

931
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,920
I've got one bizarre religious cult

932
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,840
that's all I can handle anymore.

933
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,500
And we're...

934
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,580
I won't tell you anything about my bizarre religious cult,

935
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,560
because, as I said, we're not really trying to recruit you.

936
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,620
However, I know you'll be a lot more curious

937
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,860
by the fact that I don't talk about it.

938
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,900
And we'll have a nice little $1 pamphlet

939
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,120
that explains everything.

940
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,660
We'll have everything out there on Saturday.

941
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:54,960
And a $20 book and a $35 ministerial ordainment kit.

942
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,420
And T-shirts and...

943
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,720
And the truth.

944
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,700
Yes, we're selling the truth.

945
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,960
Because we sold out of lies.

946
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,500
I guess.

947
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,580
And if lies is listening,

948
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,780
hi, Paul.

949
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,120
But he wouldn't be.

950
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,040
So, uh, thank you very much.

951
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:21,380
Mind Runs is the greatest band in the universe,

952
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,300
as you can tell.

953
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:29,580
Well, they told me to say that last year

954
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,620
when I introduced them.

955
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,620
And then I found that I agreed.

956
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,540
In fact, by the way, you guys,

957
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,840
Princess Gwee and I had to do three hours of radio last Sunday.

958
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,600
And for a whole hour of it,

959
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,780
we had your music in the background.

960
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:48,000
And we mentioned your name about five times.

961
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:48,840
God bless you.

962
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,700
To all four of our listeners on the college station.

963
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,120
And in Germany and all over the world.

964
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:57,540
Right.

965
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,220
So, uh, yeah, so I'm not sure what's up next.

966
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,000
I know there's kind of a beatnik theme going on.

967
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:10,700
The beats were ahead of their time.

968
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,320
They...

969
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,340
Uh...

970
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,800
They were...

971
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,580
They lived in a rough time,

972
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,160
as Magdalene was telling me earlier.

973
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,920
Probably a lot rougher than now

974
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,240
if you were any of those minorities.

975
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,760
And...

976
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,940
There's a lot of people trying to make that bad time come back.

977
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,500
I mean, I know it sounds ridiculous,

978
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,460
but think about those poor Jews in 1939 going,

979
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,580
oh, Hitler?

980
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,660
Oh, that guy's a joke.

981
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,500
He's stupid.

982
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,980
He can't get anything done.

983
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,360
Oops, I wasn't gonna go there.

984
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,080
I wasn't gonna do it.

985
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:52,280
Sorry.

986
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,520
Christ, Bob.

987
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,980
Slack for everyone.

988
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,620
Yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda.

989
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:03,680
See you soon, and somebody else do this now.

990
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,260
Oh, man, those last three songs in minor chords,

991
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,920
they just bummed me out.

992
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,620
I wish...

993
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,840
That song was about a horse.

994
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,240
I wish you had, like, a happy song.

995
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,780
Like a happy song.

996
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,220
Like a song about a dog.

997
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:19,980
That would be good.

998
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,760
Oh, hell, you're the kind of man

999
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,660
who seems to leave a trail

1000
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,420
behind him of a friend

1001
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,240
who used to be so close,

1002
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,680
but then in some concocted scene

1003
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,860
they done you wrong,

1004
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,080
and so you ride them off

1005
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:39,760
and by,

1006
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,200
they're gone.

1007
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,900
If you don't like dogs,

1008
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,160
what do you like?

1009
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,260
If you don't like dogs,

1010
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:56,420
you're gonna wake up some cold night

1011
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:02,620
and howl at the lonely moon.

1012
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,800
If you don't like dogs,

1013
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,920
there's something wrong with you.

1014
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,340
You're the kind of man

1015
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,220
who wants everyone to think

1016
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,500
that he's successful,

1017
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,060
so you talk about it

1018
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,960
and you write about it

1019
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,640
and blah, blah, blah, blah,

1020
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,600
but way deep down inside

1021
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,920
you're afraid that you're a fraud.

1022
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,720
If you don't like dogs,

1023
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,120
what do you like?

1024
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,220
If you don't like dogs,

1025
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,360
you're gonna wake up some cold night

1026
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,460
and howl at the moon alone.

1027
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,820
If you don't like dogs,

1028
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,980
you better just go home.

1029
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,300
Oh, I used to be your friend,

1030
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,320
even now from time to time,

1031
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,680
I wish that I could see ya,

1032
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,800
wouldn't wanna be ya.

1033
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,540
You might have the car,

1034
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:15,540
the money,

1035
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,540
the home,

1036
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,780
but you know and I know

1037
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,480
you'll always be alone.

1038
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,060
You're the kind of man

1039
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,280
who wants to know real love,

1040
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,580
but all that you can do is

1041
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,620
talk about your girls

1042
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,320
and tell off color jokes

1043
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,600
and act all kinds of flirty.

1044
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,560
But when the truth be told,

1045
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,720
you're afraid of getting dirty.

1046
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,460
If you don't like dogs,

1047
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,680
what do you like?

1048
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,760
If you don't like dogs,

1049
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,120
you're gonna wake up some cold night

1050
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,560
and howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl.

1051
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,580
Till your head's a throbbing.

1052
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:15,440
If you don't like dogs,

1053
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,600
what's your fucking problem?

1054
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:36,140
Well, if you don't like dogs,

1055
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,180
what do you like?

1056
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:44,420
If you don't like dogs,

1057
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,560
you're gonna wake up some cold night

1058
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:53,040
and howl, howl, howl, howl, howl, howl.

1059
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,100
Till you're a pain in the rump.

1060
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,060
If you don't like dogs,

1061
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,300
you probably voted for Trump.

1062
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,120
And if you asked your woman how?

1063
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,140
Well, you probably voted to stop Ð–ÑƒÐº

1064
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:28,220
Be prepared.

1065
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,080


1066
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,880
That was the Rainmakers

1067
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,120
doing a song by theirundayadesueì–¸

1068
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:36,120


1069
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:42,000
called Like Dogs at the Record Bar in Kansas City, Thanksgiving 2016.

1070
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,680
And now, this.

1071
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,820
Hey, the world's ending.

1072
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,340
You may die.

1073
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:49,760
Finally.

1074
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,160
I've been trying to shut this show down for now.

1075
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,340
Well, who's stopping you?

1076
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:53,960
Two hours and 30 minutes.

1077
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:54,900
Keep trying.

1078
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:55,860
You can stop it.

1079
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:59,300
You're not the only ditherer around here.

1080
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,960
I can prolong into the infinite.

1081
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:03,500
Yes.

1082
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,720
So make your decision and sever the line now.

1083
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,840
You've been listening to the Hour of Slack.

1084
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:11,500
More than an hour.

1085
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,340
On this station.

1086
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:18,680

1087
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,020
Thank you, Dr. Howell and Reverend Mother Miller.

1088
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:22,900
Thank you.

1089
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,200
The sacred scribe himself.

1090
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,100
Beautiful, beautiful.

1091
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:25,680
Thank you.

1092
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,020
And thank Susie the floozy for the first hour.

1093
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:28,660
Yes, thank you, Susie.

1094
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,180
Yes.

1095
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,940
Listen and audit.

1096
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,580
I'm fading it out.

1097
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,200
Okay, that's all.

1098
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:33,480
That's all.

1099
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,620
Okay, I'm really fading it out.

1100
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,240
I'm fading it out all the way now.

1101
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:37,860
Information.

1102
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:37,860


1103
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,320
Thank you.
