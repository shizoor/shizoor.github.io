1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
What, a problem?

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,740
Oh, why would you want a problem?

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,480
No, no, no, why would you ask that?

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,880
We're not having any kind of a problem at all.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,080
No, no, no, a few, uh,

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,100
I've had to answer a little bit of extra e-mail perhaps lately,

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,000
and, well, the mail has been stacking up,

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,820
but, you know, I mean, people want to be chatty,

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,380
they have questions they need answered,

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,720
and, of course, after you answer them,

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,500
they always want to throw in a nice little joke return.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,680
And, uh, a problem, no, no,

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,700
you're not a, of, of,

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,280
oh, getting a radio show put together

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,920
shouldn't be any problem at all.

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,840
No, I think we'll just,

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,940
no, no, no, no, don't worry about it.

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,920
We want to hear your phone calls.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,540
We want you to call us and tell us

20
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,600
what's been happening in your life.

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,360
That's not a problem.

22
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,460
Oh, well, uh,

23
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,860
we have time to listen to the tapes,

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,760
I'm sure, sooner or later.

25
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,020
It's not a problem.

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,560
No, no, no problems here.

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,340
We're just doing just fucking fine!

28
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,700
Uh, pardon my language.

29
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,300
Uh, mm!

30
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,280
Uh, uh, yeah.

31
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,100
We've probably just, uh,

32
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,220
a few little technical setbacks here and there.

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,560
A few minor little, uh, things

34
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,880
on the personal side,

35
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,800
but, uh, maybe, uh, but, uh...

36
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:19,980
Oh.

37
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,340
Oh, cut.

38
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,380
Cut.

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,960
You don't know what it means

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,240
You live

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,680
You don't follow your dreams

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,000
You feel

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,380
You don't fall to your knees

44
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,780
You love

45
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,040
But you don't love me

46
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,300
I'm tired of waiting for my time to come

47
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,540
I'm tired of playing your games

48
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,280
I'm tired of watching my life slip away

49
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,320
Take me from this lonesome town

50
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,380
Too bad you don't love me no more, baby

51
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,160
Too bad your people are rolling down

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,780
Through the dark

53
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,800
Ooh

54
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Ooh

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:24,920
Ooh

56
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,000
Ooh

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,660
Ooh

58
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:25,940
Ooh

59
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,140
Ooh

60
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,440
Ooh

61
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,560
Ooh

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,560


63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,560


64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,560


65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:26,580
Ooh

66
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,220


67
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,220


68
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,220


69
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,220


70
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,220


71
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,220


72
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,220


73
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,220


74
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,220


75
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,220


76
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,220


77
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,220


78
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,840
doesn't matter

79
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,500
I'm tired of playing your game

80
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,080
You live

81
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,180
Just doing what it takes

82
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,180


83
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,180


84
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,180


85
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,180


86
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,180


87
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,980
Just when every day

88
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,000
Seems a great day with a smile

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,700
Sounds about to fade in

90
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,780
I'm doing time

91
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,020
I'm doing time

92
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,560
Oh, yes, friends, we're back with that wacky, funny, hilarious show.

93
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,560
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

94
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,980
This is for everybody.

95
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,900
Slack, yes, Slack for everyone.

96
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,340
We're going to share our Slack with you, friends.

97
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,040
Because it was under the sea.

98
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:34,980
At first for food and later for other purposes that the Old Ones first created Earth life.

99
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:46,780
These viscous masses were without doubt what Abdul Alhazred whispered about as the Shoggoths in his frightful Necronomicon.

100
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,780
Although even that mad Arab had not hinted that any existed on Earth except in the dreams of those

101
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,320
when Shoggoths were born.

102
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,580
They were not only the first to eat a certain alkaloidal herb.

103
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
Oh, wait, wait a minute.

104
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,040
Oh, that's not, oh, that's not what, that wasn't the Slack we were going to share.

105
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,520
We were going to share with you the kind of Slack that we've been getting lately.

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,260
Now, um, let's see, how did that go?

107
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,740
Uh, um, hey, Stang, Stang, did you listen to my tape yet?

108
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,540
How come I haven't heard it on the show?

109
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,700
Hey, Stang, my man.

110
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,260
What?

111
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,540
What?

112
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:22,640


113
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,120
What?

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,320
What?

115
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,320


116
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,320


117
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,320


118
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,320


119
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,320


120
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,320


121
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,320


122
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,320


123
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,320


124
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,320


125
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,320


126
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,320


127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,480
What?

128
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:24,480


129
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:24,480


130
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:24,480


131
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,600
I just don't answer it.

132
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,780
Duh.

133
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,580
Uh, but I have a question.

134
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,540
Um, uh, Stang, you didn't spell my name correctly on the website, and that picture of Reverend

135
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,520
Suzy the Floozy looks all grainy on my screen.

136
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,400
Uh, hey, Stang, I know you're busy, but you wouldn't believe what my dog did today.

137
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,660
Hey, hey, Stang, I just called to tell you.

138
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,480
I won the lottery, man.

139
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,980
Bob came through.

140
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,320
I'm going to be buying that Bob T-shirt.

141
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,980
shirt real soon now. I just wanted to let you know. So, uh, like, tell me how things are going, dude.

142
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,740
Mr. Stank, your internet access will return. We are working on the problem.

143
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:15,280
Expect your service to improve just as soon as our Dallas move is complete.

144
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:25,120
Please. Dear, you never spend any time with the family.

145
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,600
Hey, Stank dude! I haven't seen you in years! I'm in town and I'll be right over!

146
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,020
Dad, uh, somebody backed into the car today while I was driving it.

147
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,840
Uh, hey, uh, Stank, you got a minute? I know you're busy, but this won't take long.

148
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,260
I promise, this will only take you five minutes.

149
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,720
Five minutes, max!

150
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,840
Oh, Stank, have I got a deal for you!

151
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,160
I have this game for a, this, this, this great game idea, and all you have to do is write the proposal.

152
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,480
It'll be easy. You will all get rich, man. You want to get rich, don't you?

153
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,240
Well, Stank, uh, uh, I guess you just don't, uh, even care about us, uh, little people anymore.

154
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,040
Uh, I guess you're too, uh, busy partying with, uh, Gwar and, and fromping with movie stars.

155
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:22,900
Uh, Mr. Stank, um, I'm afraid we have some bad news about your dog's nose.

156
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,200
It, it is cancer.

157
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:37,040
Uh, well, uh, Mr., uh, Stank, we're not accepting applications at this time, and, well, we'd rather talk to people with college degrees.

158
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,680
Hey, Stank, about those pictures I said I'd scan for you.

159
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,420
Um, I, I can't find them.

160
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,060
Do you have any more spare copies of those you can send me?

161
00:06:53,260 --> 00:07:03,200
Hey, hey, Stank, hey, this is Bob Dean, hey, hey, hey, the Canadian False Bob, hey, hey, hey, hey, guess what, hey, hey, I got interviewed again.

162
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,820
Hey, Rev, remember me?

164
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,800
We met at that DeVival in Austin in 1983, and I bought that Bob button from you.

165
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,180
Man, I lost it. Can you look, send me another one?

166
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:28,000
Dear Church of the Subgenius, I ordered a church video from you three weeks ago, and I have yet to see any such video in my mailbox.

167
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,840
I am alerting the Better Business Bureau.

168
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,760
I spend three hours a day listening to other people's problems, Stank.

169
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,100
Uh, uh, Reverend Stank, you must see this television special.

170
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,920
I taped about UFOs.

171
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,140
It's somewhere down near the middle of the tape.

172
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,520
Tell me what you think.

173
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:09,900
Reverend Stank, I'm sure you're too high and mighty for people like me, but I sent you five 90-minute tapes of me ranting, and if you don't even have the courtesy to respond, you can forget any future support from me.

174
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,280
You, sir, are a fascist.

175
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,260
Hey, Stank, I'm sorry.

176
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,260


177
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,860
Dang, dude, you're like working too hard on slack, man.

178
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,020
Why don't you slack off, Teed?

179
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,640
Get it? Slack off?

180
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,460
And where's the stark fist, dude?

181
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,780
Well, friends, now I know how the Omega Man felt.

182
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,380
You ever saw that movie?

183
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,500
But at least, you know, he got to go out killing them during the daytime.

184
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,840
Well, not necessarily.

185
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,840
Nice working, pensar.

186
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,120
Okay.

187
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,740
I'll tell you how you were removed from your family.

188
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:11,740


189
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:11,740


190
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:11,740


191
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,240
Your 74-year-extra has just awareness of commentations byarios перед dumb lambs of aology.

192
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,240


193
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,680
I'm so sick, so sick of you

194
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,880
Your face is gross, you eat my toast, you don't know what to do

195
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,600
And just your luck, you really suck, that's all I'm sick of you

196
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,160
Sick of you

197
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,880
I'm so sick, so sick of you

198
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,180
Sick, sick of you

199
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,420
I'm so sick, so sick of you

200
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,740
Bring it down

201
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,500
I said bring it down

202
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,240
Thank you

203
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,380
Don't you know

204
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,140
It's not fair

205
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,820
I'm so sick, so sick you

206
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,420
Think you're sad

207
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,520
Think you do

208
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,960
Don't you know

209
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,280
I'm so sick of you

210
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,820
Think you're sad

211
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,900
Think you do

212
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:30,900


213
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:30,900


214
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:30,900


215
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,000
and know the things you do

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,320
See don't you know

217
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,420
Why you're still sick of you

218
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,900
And all the things you said

219
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,180
and all the things you do

220
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,320
Don't you know

221
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,140
That I'm sick of you

222
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,140
And all the things you do to me

223
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,140


224
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:12,800
See you next week.

225
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:41,640
See you next week.

226
00:11:51,900 --> 00:12:12,880
See you next week.

227
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,880
See you next week.

228
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,640
See you next week.

229
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,500
See you next week.

230
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:13,120
See you next week.

231
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,980
See you next week.

232
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,040
See you next week.

233
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,260
See you next week.

234
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,200
See you next week.

235
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,100
See you next week.

236
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,200
See you next week.

237
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,200


238
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:26,520
The heresy within the church is that I've been listening all night long to all this fine talk about slack.

239
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:35,720
And I got to tell you, there are some people here that are working too god hard so y'all can have some slack.

240
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:43,140
But those who know Sister Melodia's chops know that I'm here.

241
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:55,780
not one to complain. No, I write songs and this is all about that hard work heresy.

242
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:17,160
Amazing face that's known as Bob. You promised slack to me.

243
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,760
I took your red light and I put my heart in your hands.

244
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:45,260
You took my advice and quit my job. Now I'll work twice as hard for thee.

245
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,560
Well, it's good to see you here tonight, but I got to say it's all not right.

246
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,040
Behind the scenes of the things you see is a lot of hard work heresy.

247
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,940
Now, Bob is great and Bob is good, but he don't slack me like I should.

248
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,620
He should be eating bonbons and lying in bed and busting ass at the smart bar instead.

249
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,220
Whoa, give me that!

250
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,760
Where do I go tonight?

251
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:25,760


252
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,220
I'm going to get my slack.

253
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,020
Say whoa, give me fun.

254
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,920
Knock another ranch and rave to run.

255
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,960
I went to a party that was wrong.

256
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,720
Cause everybody wants to hear Bob's song.

257
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,560
They kept me playing till my fingers bled.

258
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,920
With nothing paid and no one said no.

259
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,200
Give it back.

260
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,060
Where do I go to get my slack?

261
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,880
Say whoa, give me fun.

262
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,780
Knock another event to run.

263
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,660
I worked all night at another ranch.

264
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,640
I wanted to sleep, but they said you can't.

265
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,140
You got to pack up a room or two.

266
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,960
And put up the tables before you're through.

267
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,860
Whoa, give it back.

268
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,700
Where do I go to get my slack?

269
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,340
Say no.

270
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,520
Give me fun.

271
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,420
Knock another big event to run.

272
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,580
Why can't Bob just pass it on?

273
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,560
Without an event from dusk till dawn.

274
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,240
Why can't slack descend on me?

275
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,840
Without this hard work heresy?

276
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,040
Whoa, give it back.

277
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,900
Where do I go to get my slack?

278
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,760
Say whoa, give me fun.

279
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,680
Knock another big event to run.

280
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,440
So all you people, don't you.

281
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,600
Tend to them cause we are through.

282
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,540
Go out and find a world to save.

283
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,580
We're going to enjoy the rants and raves.

284
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,380
Say whoa, give it back.

285
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,300
Where do we go to get our slack?

286
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,240
Say no.

287
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,180
Give me fun.

288
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,040
Knock another event to run.

289
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,900
Say whoa, give it back.

290
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,740
Where do I go to get my slack?

291
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,600
Say whoa, give me fun.

292
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,540
Knock another event to run.

293
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,340
Knock another big event to run.

294
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,280
Knock another rants and raves to run.

295
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,020
Give it back.

296
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,580
I want it now.

297
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,040
Up to hell with you.

298
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,180
Okay, she's down to hell.

299
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,240
She dared to question Bob Zedek.

300
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
Lucky for her it's the sub-sum.

301
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:20,720


302
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,600
She's the sub-genius hell.

303
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,240
Lucky for Sister Melodia's chops.

304
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,240
It's the sub-genius hell, my friends.

305
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,800
And by the time you get to the sub-genius hell,

306
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,620
you'd be wishing to God that you'd made it to.

307
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,300
No, wait a minute.

308
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,120
Take two.

309
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,220
By the time you get to the Christian heaven, my friends,

310
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,040
you'll be wishing to God you'd made it to sub-genius hell.

311
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,600
But the great thing about sub-genius hell is,

312
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,940
oh man, what a party.

313
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,300
You have to go through it in order to be prepared to endure

314
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,900
the even greater pure slack fun of sub-genius heaven.

315
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,460
Oh, that must be where we are now, I guess.

316
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,600
I had it all mixed up.

317
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,240
I'm sorry, folks.

318
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,420
Just been under a little bit of pressure lately.

319
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,820
Just a little bit of a steam cooker, but I'm sure we can...

320
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,900
give some credits.

321
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,140
Yeah, that's it. Credits.

322
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,320
Well, of course, that song just now was by Sister Melodia's chops,

323
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,120
the lovely Sister Melodia's chops of Cleveland,

324
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,280
accompanied there by the lovely Princess Wiardo.

325
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,720
And what else have we been playing?

326
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,440
Well, this material in the background,

327
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,380
all of the background so far has been from a band,

328
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,500
a Cleveland band that we don't know,

329
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,180
nothing nepotistic this time,

330
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,900
called, um...

331
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
What are they called?

332
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,600
Oh, Only a Mother.

333
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,900
Yes, Only a Mother with their album Fetal Chicken.

334
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,340
They're very bull-dada, don't you think, really?

335
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,340
And, uh...

336
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,940
Well, they get wacky and quirky and then they get kinda sad like this.

337
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,840
But it's gonna be okay, man.

338
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,720
It's not a problem.

339
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,760
Um...

340
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,340
Uh, what we've heard...

341
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,520
Some of the Jimi Hendrix samples are from a group called...

342
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,360
Pardon me.

343
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,800
Beautiful People.

344
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,800
Uh, very technically adept at tape splicing and sampling there.

345
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,660
Well, now it's Sergio Leone.

346
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,700
Pretty soon they'll get to Nina Rota.

347
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,520
Um...

348
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,200
Eh...

349
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,260
Before that...

350
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,020
Oh, of course, um...

351
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,460
Sick of You.

352
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,080
That song by Gwar.

353
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,140
The gods from...

354
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,660
The elder gods, you might say, from beyond space.

355
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,500
Uh...

356
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,440
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

357
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,600
And a little media barrage there from sister...

358
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,520
Uh, Suzy the Floozy.

359
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,420
The...

360
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:08,900
The...

361
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,620
Oh, Suzy.

362
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,100
Uh, Suzy did a show on her show in Atlanta,

363
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,000
on WREK.

364
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,100
A pain show.

365
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,360
And it has come in very handy, uh, to us here, because, uh, to tell the truth, it's...

366
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,700
Gah!

367
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,420
Gah!

368
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:27,880
Gah!

369
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,500
Gah!

370
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,320
Gah!

371
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,040
Gah!

372
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,320
Gah!

373
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,500
Gah!

374
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:30,700
Gah!

375
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:30,900
Gah!

376
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,100
Gah!

377
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,280
Gah!

378
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,420
Gah!

379
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:31,560
Gah!

380
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:31,560


381
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,040
Gah!

382
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,120
Gah!

383
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,180
Gah!

384
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:32,680
Gah!

385
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,600
Gah!

386
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,580
Gah!

387
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,580
Gah!

388
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,300
Gah!

389
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,600
Gah!

390
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:48,900
Gah!

391
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,500
Gah!

392
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:50,900


393
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:50,900


394
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:50,980
Gah!

395
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,020


396
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,020


397
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,020


398
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,020


399
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,020


400
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,020


401
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,240


402
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,240


403
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,240


404
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,020
Gah!

405
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,620
Gah!

406
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:53,680
Gah!

407
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:53,680


408
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,600
Gah!

409
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:54,640
Gah!

410
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,180
Gah!

411
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,860
Gah!

412
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,460
Gah!

413
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,660
Gah!

414
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,480
Get your hold on it, get your hold on it

415
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,000
Mind it, mind it, get your hold on it

416
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,180
You work

417
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,520
You don't know what it means

418
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,720
You live

419
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,160
You don't follow your dreams

420
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,400
You feel

421
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,700
You don't fall to your knees

422
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,020
You love

423
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,280
But you don't love me

424
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,440
I'm tired of waiting for my time to call

425
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,560
I'm tired of playing those games

426
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,160
I'm tired of watching my life slip away

427
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:07,860
I'm tired of watching my life slip away

428
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,000
Slip away

429
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,540
Oh, slip away

430
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,200
Slip away

431
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,980
Slip away

432
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:31,980


433
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:31,980


434
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:31,980


435
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,220
When my ship rolls in

436
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,000
I'll be face down in the sand

437
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,660
Burning in the sun

438
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,300
On this distant island shore

439
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,340
When my ship rolls in

440
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,200
The captain will come to save me

441
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,180
I'll gaze about his visage

442
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,600
And see whose face is mine

443
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,860
When my spaceship lands

444
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,760
I'll be kissed by a silver angel

445
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,200
Who will drag me all aboard

446
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,840
While the trappers bite my flesh

447
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,100
They'll take me to the moon

448
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,260
A beat of white light

449
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,060
I'll be to banish his fear

450
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,720
And see his face is mine

451
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,700
When I'm stranded

452
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,680
I'm crying for help

453
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,940
Everyone ignored me

454
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,240
They stood around in line

455
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,400
When my ship rolls in

456
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,540
To my aching isolation

457
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,840
I'll gaze above the captain

458
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,720
And see his face is mine

459
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,480
Freedom, freedom

460
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,420
I'll be free from the mask

461
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:46,700
Of the world

462
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,960
Feminism is a nation of your society

463
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,920
Freedom, freedom

464
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,080
Don't leave me

465
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,440
Feminism is a nation of your society

466
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,280
When my spaceship lands

467
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,080
I'll be kissed by a silver angel

468
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,000
Who will drag me all aboard

469
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,660
While the trappers bite my flesh

470
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,700
And see his face is mine

471
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,780
When I'm stranded

472
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,780
I'm crying for help

473
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,960
Everyone ignored me

474
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,220
They stood around in line

475
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,620
When my spaceship rolls in

476
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,460
To my aching isolation

477
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,820
I'll gaze above the captain

478
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,660
And see his face is mine

479
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,680
When my spaceship rolls in

480
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,720
To my aching isolation

481
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,200
I'll gaze above the captain

482
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,380
And see his face is mine

483
00:27:59,380 --> 00:27:59,680
Freedom, freedom

484
00:27:59,680 --> 00:27:59,700
Don't ignore me

485
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,520
Lau-lu-lalau la-la-la

486
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,640
We charge and burn

487
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,720
O motion in time

488
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,380
Whose ship is this

489
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:16,380


490
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:16,680
Our Зап 1200

491
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:16,680


492
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:16,680


493
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:16,680


494
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:16,680


495
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,060
guitar solo

496
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,360
guitar solo

497
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,840
guitar solo

498
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,880
guitar solo

499
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,820
guitar solo

500
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,200
guitar solo

501
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,160
guitar solo

502
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,980
guitar solo

503
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,240
guitar solo

504
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,220
guitar solo

505
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,260
guitar solo

506
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:16,260


507
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:16,260


508
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,000
Yes, yes, yes dear friends, the great,

509
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,080
the great Zug's Riff

510
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,360
with his song

511
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,380
When My Ship Rolls In.

512
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,380
I'd give you Zug's address

513
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,600
except that it got to him.

514
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,360
He quit, he quit the music business.

515
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,420
He even quit the wrestling business.

516
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,700
He quit the music business.

517
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,700
Yes, because it,

518
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,400
he got fed up.

519
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,560
He just got fed up with

520
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,100
the struggle.

521
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,180
And here's an important credit, friends.

522
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,560
That song

523
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,900
Tired of Waiting,

524
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,880
which I have interspersed throughout this whole show,

525
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,360
is by Mary McGuire

526
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
is by Mary McGuire

527
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,240
and her band Cosmic Dolly

528
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,280
and I'm going to give you their address

529
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,080
because you should send off

530
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,000
their CD or write them for information.

531
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,940
Cosmic Dolly at P.O. Box

532
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,900
Got that pencil ready?

533
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,400
P.O. Box

534
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,320
1541

535
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,960
Royal Oak

536
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,220
Michigan

537
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,440
That's M.I.

538
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,800
48068

539
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,440
I saw her perform

540
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,300
at the Underground Film Festival

541
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,440
in Chicago and

542
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,000
it was lots of fun.

543
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,440
And you know, friends,

544
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,220
it is a struggle.

545
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,500
One must keep

546
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,900
must keep hacking

547
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,740
and hacking and moving

548
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,240
in constant motion

549
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,780
straight ahead.

550
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,440
Until the tape runs out.

551
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,880
Because the tape

552
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,780
will run out, dear friends,

553
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,740
just as it did for Dr. Legume.

554
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,680
And we'll get to that

555
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,220
pretty soon.

556
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,960
I guess on side two of show.

557
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,300
Although first,

558
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,700
I think there's some other things

559
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,860
that we're going to stick on

560
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,140
this pain theme.

561
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,740
I just love this.

562
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,420
Why it's almost as good as the hate.

563
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,160
In fact, we may not even get to Dr. Legume

564
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,980
this show.

565
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,920
It may just all be pain

566
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,940
and hate.

567
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,880
And we might not even get to death

568
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,920
until the tape runs out.

569
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,200
Yes.

570
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,000
Yes.

571
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,780
Sweet Susie.

572
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,920
She'll beat you

573
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,720
to death.

574
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,940
Sweet Susie.

575
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,240
From Ross Meyer,

576
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,540
the director who gave you

577
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,820
Vixen and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.

578
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,640
For a taste of evil?

579
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,380
Sweet Susie.

580
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,100
A woman.

581
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,500
A woman too much for one man.

582
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,140
Sweet Susie.

583
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,960
The diary of a wicked lady.

584
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,620
The memoirs of a bad girl.

585
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,360
Sweet Susie.

586
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,280
Sweet Susie.

587
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,420
No man escaped her island.

588
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,120
Or her whip.

589
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,820
Sweet Susie.

590
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,140
Slamming, crashing,

591
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,120
banging action from opening scene

592
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,520
to mind bending climax.

593
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,180
Sweet Susie.

594
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,700
She ain't no lady.

595
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,600
Whoa, yeah.

596
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,980
He knows what he's talking about.

597
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,780
Welcome, welcome

598
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,240
seekers of slack.

599
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,820
Welcome to WREK

600
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,360
Atlanta. Bob's

601
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,880
slack time funhouse.

602
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,420
Oh, I'm the right raving reverend

603
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,260
Susie the floozy, your genial

604
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,340
hostess. But let me

605
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,780
warn you, dear listeners.

606
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,200
The theme of my show

607
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,840
tonight isn't a pleasant one.

608
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,400
Last night, I had a close

609
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,940
encounter with Ross Meyer

610
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,000
and a 20 foot tall

611
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,120
Turris satana. And it

612
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,340
got me thinking about the nature of something

613
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,880
near and dear to my heart.

614
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,280
The only thing that cuts through my teflon

615
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,360
coating anymore. The only thing that

616
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,100
makes me sit bolt upright and take

617
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,440
notice. Pain!

618
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,080
Oh.

619
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,160
I don't mean the sharp twinges you get

620
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,860
when you slam your thumb in the car door

621
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,380
or stub your toe. I'm not bothering

622
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,860
with that penny ante piddling

623
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,360
ooh, I hurt myself crap here.

624
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,240
Oh no, I'm talking

625
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,160
about the brain twisting agony of

626
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,220
everyday existence. From that

627
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,160
first conscious breath you take in the morning

628
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,620
when you realize, no!

629
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,120
Damn it, I didn't die in my

630
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,100
sleep again!

631
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,040
Oh, until you eventually pass

632
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,300
out hours later from the excruciating

633
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,460
pressure and torment.

634
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,180
They call this going to

635
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,220
sleep. With me, it's like an

636
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,100
overloading agony circuit reaching

637
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,100
critical mass and then massive

638
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,320
systems shut down.

639
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,980
But maybe you're

640
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,140
different. Maybe you

641
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,160
think that there's a minimum of pain

642
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,180
in your life. Well,

643
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,020
think again, bucko! It's

644
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,480
there. And I'm gonna have to put you in touch

645
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,980
with it if you're going to achieve

646
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,500
Bobhead. And take it from me,

647
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,000
Bobhead is worth it.

648
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,360
So welcome to the house of

649
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,240
pain cakes. And

650
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,000
please feel free to scream.

651
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,280
It's music to

652
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,940
my ears.

653
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:10,380
.

654
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:10,900


655
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,140
.

00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:12,160

660
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:12,900
.

661
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:24,500
.

662
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:25,840

.

664
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,480
.

665
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,900
.

666
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:38,920
.

667
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:38,940
.

668
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:38,960
.

669
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:38,980
.

670
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,000
.

671
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,240
.

672
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:40,920
.

673
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,640
Your problems, they will soon be gone

674

We soak up, soak up, soak up lots of pain, yeah

675
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,060
If life is a reflecting pool

676
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,640
Then we are like a sponge, yeah

677
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,240
It's all been dug up with the bad

678
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,460
We soak up, soak it up

679
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,500
So give me all your troubles

680
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,780
And baggage you can't handle, no

We soak up, soak up, soak up lots of pain, yeah

We soak up, soak up, soak up lots of pain, yeah

685

Everybody locks the doors

Strangers

687
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,520

00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:41,880


701
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,700
There's no junior on the bus

702
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,360
There's no book by your side, yeah

703
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,780
Soak up, soak up lots of pain, yeah

704
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:51,780

You call the ever-missing bus

Everybody goes insane

00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,040
Everybody locks the doors to keep out any stranger

717
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,540
Everybody's all fed up

718
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,860

Put your hands on mine, on mine, on mine

Boys and girls of every creed, yeah

725
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,760
Religion and persuasion, no

726
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,520
It's time to get up off your knees

727
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,500
Soak up

728
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,200
Soak up

729
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,600
Soak it up

730
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,240
Open the door and let me in

731
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,580
Don't question who I am, no

732
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,320
Just shake my hand and give me your name

733
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,360
We soak up

734
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,460
Soak it up

735
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,620
Soak up

736
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,740
Soak it up

737
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,000
Soak it up

738
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,020
Soak up

739
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,960
Soak it up

740
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,300
Now

741
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,340
, let's go

742
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,380
Soak it up

743
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,700
Soak up

744
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,840
I saw her walking by, and I sort of winked my eye, and she stopped dead.

745
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,600
Redhead, she had a cute way of walking. I had to get her talking. My heart bled.

746
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,140
I said, my knees are getting weak. Smile at me, speak, she said.

747
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:31,020
We'll return to The Painful Threshold after this message.

748
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,220
So the severity of the anal rectal pain or burning

749
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,880
is sometimes a clue to the diagnosis.

750
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,960
They may have difficulty voiding,

751
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,560
and they may have pain in the buttocks

752
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,400
and paresthesias in the buttock areas

753
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,560
and also paresthesias in the upper posterior thighs.

754
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,540
This is thought to be related to the virus infecting the sacral ganglia.

755
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,600
Oh!

756
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:09,520
Betty!

757
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,040
What's the matter, Coco?

758
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,480
My cooch!

759
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:13,900
Oh!

760
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,300
Ow!

761
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,100
Oh!

762
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,020
Ha!

763
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,960
Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches

764
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,980
The last time I needed twenty stitches

765
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,820
To sew up the gash

766
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,200
You made one of my eyes

767
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,200


768
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,200


769
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,200


770
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,860
with your lash

771
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,920
As we dance

772
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,160
To the masochism tango

773
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,220
Bash in my brain

774
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,160
And make me scream with pain

775
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,780
Then kick me once again

776
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,980
And say we'll never part

777
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,120
I know too well

778
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,860
I'm underneath your spell

779
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,780
So darling, if you smell

780
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,900
Something burning, it's my heart

781
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,080
Excuse me.

782
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,800
Although they may be hitting the pain,

783
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,000
it's not affecting them through fear

784
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,880
as much as it would otherwise

785
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,700
because fear and pain

786
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,180
sort of act on one another.

787
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,720
In a way that the fear, plus the pain,

788
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,260
actually enhances the pain.

789
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,100
Mary never cries.

790
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,580
Smack her, pinch her, hurt her.

791
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,960
Not one tear will you get.

792
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:20,920
Ever.

793
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,080
Mary also never laughs.

794
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,500
I dare you to make her do either one.

795
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,720
In the midst of Gabbatha

796
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,760
was a huge stone, uh, a post.

797
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,080
They would bring a man to that post.

798
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,160
They would bring a man to that post.

799
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,380
They would take his hands

800
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,620
and wrap him around the post

801
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,580
and pull him as tight as they possibly could

802
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,180
to stretch the skin very tight across the bank.

803
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,620
They would turn and take the length

804
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,640
and pull them around this huge stone

805
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,320
and tie that person down,

806
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,980
spitting their clothes.

807
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,240
On each side of that stone

808
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,520
was a basin filled with salt water.

809
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,920
In that salt water was a number of skirts.

810
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,060
Now, these skirts was a short-handled leather skirt.

811
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,240
They had nine strands that came down from the hands.

812
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,260
Each of the strands, I'm told, were tied in knots.

813
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,680
Little bits of bone were tied in each of the knots

814
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,400
in the strands that came down from that skirt

815
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,820
that was huge.

816
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,820
Oh, yes.

817
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,700
Oh, real pain to my sham friends

818
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,060
and sham pain to my foe.

819
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,080
Hell, real pain for everyone all around.

820
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,340
Oh.

821
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,540
Yeah, see, the Church of the Subgenius

822
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:04,120
isn't the only religion that wallows in a pain theme.

823
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,180
Look at the supposedly benign Christian cults

824
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,700
like the Baptists and the Catholics.

825
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,160
But this is a season that all Christians indulge

826
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,160
in lip-smacking Easter-time necro-porn.

827
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,200
Boy, they pack the pews like rubberneckers

828
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,500
at a multi-car fatality this time of year

829
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,240
because everybody likes to see somebody else get hurt.

830
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,400
Oh, how they relish pouring over the gory details,

831
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,940
thinking that somehow because somebody got staple gun

832
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,340
to a tree a couple millennia ago, they're off the hook.

833
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:40,840
Hey, I'd rather duel a masochist than Methodist any day.

834
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:46,380
Oh, those religious snuff perverts sicken me.

835
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,200
I'd rather cast my lot in with a cult

836
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,780
where there's some certainty that when you buy your salvation,

837
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,200
it stays bought.

838
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,000
Barring, of course, any clerical oversight.

839
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,300
But grab a pencil, seekers,

840
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,280
because I'm going to give you some advice here.

841
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,680
You can buy salvation

842
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,320
by saying,

843
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,700
sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to Bob

844
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,820
at P.O. Box 140306,

845
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,500
Dallas, Texas 75214.

846
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,060
And get all the pain you've got coming

847
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,540
because with Bob, that pain you suffer daily

848
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,980
is a beautiful thing.

849
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,740
Bob's going to see to it that you not only feel the pain,

850
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,000
it becomes as a narcotic.

851
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,300
You actually jones for it if the torture...

852
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,080
ever stops.

853
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,560
Yes, you can use your pain like a magic strength tonic

854
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,040
to pump yourself up and spit the caustic fire

855
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,720
of your psychic agony out through your third nostril

856
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,980
enveloping this slackless world

857
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,280
in a sheet of Bob's scent flames.

858
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,280
Yes, the pain will keep your coat glossy.

859
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,460
But have you had enough pain yet?

860
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,140
I don't think so.

861
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,800
I'm alone

862
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,460
and I will always love you.

863
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,920
I will always love you.

864
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,440
Oh, even I'm not...

865
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,400
Let me show you something.

866
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,180
You will feel absolutely no pain at all.

867
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,200
How do you feel?

868
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,920
Fine, thank you.

869
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,300
Well, thank you, young lady.

870
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,300
We'll get back to removing the needles in just a few moments.

871
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,960
I wonder...

872
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,020
You don't care to hurt a person.

873
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:51,740
I am very sensitive to pain.

874
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:51,760
Okay.

875
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,140
Stand together.

876
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,120
Stand together.

877
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:53,320
Good.

878
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,520
I'm arrive.

879
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,480
Twoありがとうございました,

880
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,260
great to see you then.

881
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,540
I just have to start my experience.

882
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:03,540


883
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:03,860
I'll be on my way then.

884
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:04,660
Bye administrator.

885
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:04,660


886
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:04,820
Ok, there's still 1 day left.

887
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,460
Janice, goodbye.

888
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,440
I'm doing fine.

889
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:36,900
You're killing me.

890
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,220
Put me in the grave.

891
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,540
Try to set me aside.

892
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,880
Only be the grave.

893
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,040
You want to plunge a knife into my back and twist it.

894
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,720
Twist it round and round.

895
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,340
You want to plunge the knife into my back and twist it.

896
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,000
Twist it round and round.

897
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,880
You're killing me.

898
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,240
Turn me inside out.

899
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,840
You think you don't see what we're all about.

900
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,440
I'm a phone on your side.

901
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,600
I'm a pain in your ass.

902
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,840
You want to see me die?

903
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,100
You want to see me pass?

904
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,440
You want to punch the knife into my back and twist it.

905
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,120
Twist it round and round.

906
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:10,820
You want to punch the knife into my back and twist it.

907
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,280
Twist it round and round.

908
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:18,280
You want to punch the knife into my back and twist it.

909
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,020
You're killing me.

910
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,440
Put the sleep on good.

911
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,660
You want to die?

912
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,060
We can do you would.

913
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,420
You're killing me.

914
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,760
Put me in the grave.

915
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,020
Try to set me aside.

916
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,360
Only be the grave.

917
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,440
You want to punch the knife into my back and twist it.

918
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,060
Twist it round and round.

919
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,800
You want to punch the knife into my back and twist it.

920
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,420
Twist it round and round.

921
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,300
You're killing me.

922
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,640
Turn me inside out.

923
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,940
You think you don't see

924
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,240
what we're all about.

925
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,840
I'm a phone on your side

926
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,080
I'm a pain in your ass.

927
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,460
You want to see me die?

928
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,640
You want to see me pass?

929
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,880
You want to punch the knife into my back and twist it.

930
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,240
Twist it round and round.

931
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,000
You want to punch the knife into my back and twist it.

932
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,840
Twist it round and round.

933
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,360
Twist it round and round.

934
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:05,440


935
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:05,440


936
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:05,440


937
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:05,440


938
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,040
You're killing me!

939
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,760
You're killing me!

940
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,540
You're killing me!

941
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,120
Alright. Get down.

942
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,340
Oh.

943
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,920
So this is how the world works.

944
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,820
Vibrations getting nasty.

945
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,100
Overload.

946
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,740
Trading on disaster.

947
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,420
Vibrations getting nasty. Overload. Trading on disaster.

948
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,800
Pain is no problem.

949
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,920
Pain is art.

950
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,800
Love is pain.

951
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,920
Pain is art.

952
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,860
Love is pain.

953
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,900
Why do you eat people?

954
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,540
Not people.

955
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,340
Brains.

956
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:29,860
Brains only?

957
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,060
Yeah.

958
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:33,620
Why?

959
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,320
The pain.

960
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,960
What about the pain?

961
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,360
The pain of being dead.

962
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,500
It hurts to be dead.

963
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,380
I thought I'd gone to the limits.

964
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,860
I hadn't.

965
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,640
The Cenobites gave me an experience beyond the limits.

966
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,600
Pain and pleasure.

967
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,340
Indivisible.

968
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,520
What does it mean if you don't beat anybody?

969
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,440
But I do. I beat their time.

970
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,800
Is that how you got cutie pie over there?

971
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,680
By beating some guy's time?

972
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,140
No.

973
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,340
You're not the type.

974
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,460
You're the all-American boy.

975
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,120
A safety first Clyde.

976
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,820
Are you trying to say something?

977
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,240
I never try anything.

978
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,860
I just do it.

979
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,540
Like I don't beat clocks.

980
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,260
Just people.

981
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,900
Want to try me?

982
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,100
Oh.

983
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,500
Oh, so you want more punishment, do you?

984
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,440
I just never seem to push you far enough.

985
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,260
Oh, yeah.

986
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,900
Sometimes my best efforts just don't seem to take.

987
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,760
You've sickened me with your hopeful, craven looks as you grovel on your hands and feet

988
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,180
for more.

989
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,260
Feel the lash and learn to kiss the whip.

990
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,240
And you Marietta kids had better get one of those.

991
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:01,240


992
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:01,240


993
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,940
You'll be hurting plenty tomorrow, so why don't you do it now and get it over with?

994
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,080
Screw you, Seekers.

995
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,080
I'm the one who really needs the pain.

996
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:16,040
If I had any nerve endings left, I'd be scourging myself.

997
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,500
This show is a curse, but it's not nearly the source of enough agony for me.

998
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:28,640
Sometimes this ministry grates on my last nerve like electrified tin foil on fillings.

999
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:34,480
And that rage somehow inspires me to fling myself into the fight to get you the slack

1000
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,760
you need, to beat that slack into you, to tenderize you with Bob and Connie's special

1001
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,420
blend of herbs and spices.

1002
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:47,420
And then to grill you lightly until you're tender and ready to eat.

1003
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,060
But sometimes you have to make your own slack.

1004
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:58,580
You have to feel so much pain that it pushes you clear through the couch, through the space

1005
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:58,620
of your life.

1006
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,360
It springs like a sieve, catching all that clotted crap that's been backing up in your

1007
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,640
system for so long.

1008
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:10,780
And then you pop out on the other side, all wet and glistening.

1009
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,800
Oh, and most of your hide stripped off your body, your flesh hanging in ribbons, and you

1010
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,880
feel so good.

1011
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,760
Yeah, that's what you need right there.

1012
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,620
A good sucker punch from the stark fist of removal to knock you back through the rott

1013
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,160
ed fabric of space and time.

1014
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,860
Knocking that crud off you, blowing that carbon out of your pipes.

1015
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,340
Oh, thank you, Bob.

1016
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,300
Thank you.

1017
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,540
You're there for me.

1018
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,340
You've always been there.

1019
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:47,040
You're there grinning with that pipe still clenched in your teeth and that smile is just

1020
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:47,660
for me.

1021
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,580
Oh, hurt me, Bob.

1022
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,880
Make me feel something.

1023
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,020
Make me feel it all.

1024
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,520
And oh, see to it that the torture never stops.

1025
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:12,620
Oh, man.

1026
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:27,720
Oh, my gosh.

1027
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,080


1028
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,080


1029
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,300
Oh, my gosh.

1030
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:49,880
Hello friends and welcome.

1031
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,220
The sermon tonight is entitled Life's Little Compromises.

1032
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:03,320
Because, let's face it, life is full of little compromises.

1033
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,420
So many of them, in fact, that we are often not aware when we're making them.

1034
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,620
But hey, you gotta bend a little to get along.

1035
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,940
You can't always get everything you want just the way you want it, right?

1036
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:22,520
Well, allow me to respond to that common misconception with one word.

1037
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:24,560
Corrupt.

1038
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,120
You've heard about corrupt.

1039
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,020
It means lacking in moral integrity.

1040
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,140
To taint, infect, or spoil.

1041
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,180
To change the original form or intent.

1042
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,360
In other words, to compromise.

1043
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Now, most of us don't like the word corrupt.

1044
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,280
It sounds too dirty, too sleazy.

1045
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,940
We'd rather view ourselves as compromising.

1046
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,800
That sounds so much more respectable.

1047
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,540
But is there really any difference?

1048
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,260
My friends?

1049
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,560
Let me tell you a little story.

1050
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,720
It's a story about a fine Christian widow going through some hard times.

1051
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:12,560
She was still beautiful, but her husband had jumped out the window after a stock market crash,

1052
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,740
leaving her family and herself without much money.

1053
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,040
They had lived a very lavish lifestyle before, but now they were struggling.

1054
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,960
Her only daughter was sick, and both her parents were old and feeble.

1055
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:31,360
Still, she was a very proud woman, because she still had her integrity.

1056
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,780
Until one day, when a wealthy old man came by and visited her.

1057
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,420
He asked the old woman if she would sleep with him.

1058
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,680
Of course, she flatly refused.

1059
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:50,820
She was angry at the suggestion, but then he offered to marry her, restore the family fortune,

1060
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:54,380
take care of her daughter, and provide for her parents in their old age.

1061
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:00,360
At this point, she knew the man was a lecher, but marriage seemed a fair compromise.

1062
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,000
So she agreed.

1063
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,840
The man then offered her another compromise.

1064
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,440
Why not skip the marriage altogether and just have sex for a hundred bucks?

1065
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,680
She exploded in anger.

1066
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,020
What did he think she was, some kind of whore?

1067
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,500
Why, yes, the man replied.

1068
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,780
We just established that fact.

1069
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,300
Now we're negotiating price.

1070
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,620
You see,

1071
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,640
the old man was right.

1072
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,080
The woman was always corrupt.

1073
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,560
She was just living in denial.

1074
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,760
She wasn't a bad woman.

1075
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:37,140
She had many good qualities, but she had one fatal flaw.

1076
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:42,200
She was willing to compromise for principles.

1077
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,220
Now how many of us are in that same situation?

1078
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,060
I don't mean widowed with a sick kid or older parents.

1079
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,600
I mean willing to compromise for principles.

1080
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,120
I mean willing to compromise our principles in order to get ahead.

1081
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:02,760
After all, when the reward is big enough, it's not easy to resist giving in just once.

1082
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,500
The problem, of course, is that it never is just once.

1083
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,280
It's only the beginning of a long line of compromise.

1084
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,160
It's always that first little compromise that's the hardest one to make.

1085
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,460
But from there on out, it gets easier and easier.

1086
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,040
My friends, even religion is not immune to this temptation.

1087
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,680
Have you ever heard of a seeker church?

1088
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:39,400
A seeker church is a non-denominational church designed by compromise.

1089
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,860
Every principle that might offend or scare newcomers off is compromised away.

1090
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,880
There is no loud, angry sermons.

1091
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,860
There's no insistence on tithing.

1092
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,600
There's no talk about the horrors of sin.

1093
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:53,700
There's no hell.

1094
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,560
Only the peace of heaven.

1095
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,880
In fact, there's no controversy at all.

1096
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,320
Just touchy-feely stuff to make you feel good so you'll come again next week.

1097
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:11,560
These so-called seeker churches are the fastest growing churches in America today.

1098
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:18,540
Many of them are mega churches built to literally hold thousands of customers.

1099
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,260
I won't call them believers because they don't have anything to believe in.

1100
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,160
Nothing they're not willing to compromise.

1101
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,860
Because their church isn't built on a rock.

1102
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,180
It's built on the shifting sands of compromise.

1103
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:46,180
Alas, it's not just the seeker churches that are built on these changing foundations, my friends.

1104
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:51,920
Religions from across the globe are compromising away their most fundamental beliefs,

1105
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,440
their most fundamental principles, their most fundamental truths.

1106
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,960
Oh, sure, it starts out small.

1107
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,300
Some Jew eats pork.

1108
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,560
Then some Catholic has an abortion.

1109
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:09,240
The next thing you know, the Episcopalians perform homosexual marriages,

1110
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,160
and the Hindus forbid women from climbing on their husbands' funeral fires.

1111
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,780
I mean, really, what's the point of even having a religion if you're not going to play by the rules?

1112
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,900
Do you think God is a God?

1113
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,380
Is it going to know when you're cheating on Him?

1114
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:30,560
Do you think God is going to turn a blind, omnipotent eye on your betrayal?

1115
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,780
No, sir. No, sir.

1116
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,300
He knows.

1117
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:40,200
And if you betray God, why shouldn't God betray you?

1118
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,040
Oh, it's your choice, all right.

1119
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,040
Don't get me wrong there.

1120
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:44,980
You can choose.

1121
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,560
But stop a moment to consider this.

1122
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,080
Who is going to suffer more?

1123
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,680
In the long run?

1124
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,500
God or you?

1125
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:02,780
We've considered, and that's why we, the Church of the Subgenius,

1126
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,380
are dedicated to not compromising.

1127
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:12,720
That's why we, Bob's chosen few, refuse to give in to outside pressures to become more mainstream.

1128
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:19,440
If you want mainstream, you can go to any one of those other milk-toast churches that litter the landscape

1129
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,940
and refuse to pay taxes.

1130
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,080
But don't come whining to us with your,

1131
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:27,340
Gee, Bob, can you tone it down just a little bit attitude?

1132
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:30,220
Because we're not interested in winning the Nielsen ratings.

1133
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:37,360
We don't care if you're disgusted by Jane or launching decapitated heads from the stage with a nine iron.

1134
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:43,760
We don't care if you're nauseated by the hardcore anti-Muzak of the swinging love corpses.

1135
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,540
And we damn sure don't care if you're offended by my hate rats.

1136
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,940
In other words,

1137
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:53,220
we don't care about you at all.

1138
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,280
Because this church isn't about you.

1139
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:05,600
In fact, our church is probably the only product of the me generation that is not about you.

1140
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,080
It's about Bob.

1141
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,800
And if you don't like it, you can just go to hell.

1142
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:18,580
Because that's where Bob sends those who compromise his church.

1143
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,660
Hearing the word of Bob.

1144
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,060
Unchanging, unamended, and uncompromised.

1145
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,440
Praise Bob!

1146
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,500
Amen.

1147
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:34,640
Ah, yes dear friends, Father Joe Mama, the great Father Joe Mama, closing out the show.

1148
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:39,780
And of course, dear friends, if you need more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

1149
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:44,180

1150
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:48,280

01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,680
Box 140306.

1152
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,220
That's Box 140306.

01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,160

01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:04,400
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1155
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,620
Oh, yes.

1156
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:12,360
Yes, it's so purging.

1157
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,460
So purging to do a show.

1158
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:45,480
Us Fl bacterial tolls of about to make it from not flavourable to verifiable.

1159
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:45,480


1160
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:45,940


1161
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:45,940


1162
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:45,940


1163
