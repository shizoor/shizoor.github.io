1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
You know I'm the only man here

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,380
Okay, okay.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:16,240
Well, friends, I'm afraid it's time to fade out the nice music from African Abstract.

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,780
Thanks, Joel.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,660
You're welcome.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,920
Yes, the nice music is gone.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,920
Dr. Howell is here in the station with me.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,540
We both just landed after driving up from Southern Ohio.

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:32,960
Yes, we survived.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,800
And I'm going to play some background material for a little while while I get set up.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,700
Perhaps that would be best.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:48,980
This is all from the Floozies show of some time in the past, WREK's Bob Slatt Time Funhouse,

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,180
some Flooz collage work until Dr. Howell and I get situated.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,060
Thank you.

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:55,620
Yes.

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,780
Me.

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,200
Meanwhile.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,060
Huh?

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,800
That's weird.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,540
It's like something out of that Twilight-y show about that zone.

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:04,920
My God.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,280
What is that?

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,020
What?

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,740
Well, there's my ride.

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,080
I got one.

26
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,740
I got one.

27
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,180
I got a spaceship.

28
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,220
They're coming.

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,160
I got a spaceship.

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,560
Bob, there's something on the screen.

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,220
Yes.

32
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,680
It might be him, but the picture isn't very clear.

33
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,900
I can't find Bob.

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,200
Bob, it's coming right at us.

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,000
I can't believe it.

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,440
Look at those tentacles.

37
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,400
They're coming.

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,580
From outer space, they're coming.

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,780
They're going to enter our atmosphere.

40
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,080
We want the Earth.

41
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,460
We want the Earth.

42
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:48,700


43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,980
We want the Earth.

44
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:50,980


45
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,160


46
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,000
We want the Earth.

47
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,560
We want the Earth.

48
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,340
Who's there?

49
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,900
Remember Bob?

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,900


51
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,900


52
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,900


53
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,900


54
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,900


55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,900


56
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,900


57
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,900


58
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,900


59
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,900


60
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,900


61
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:26,900


62
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,920
Alien? What do you mean, alien? What do you mean from another planet?

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,880
That's a tricky one, isn't it?

64
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,620
Well, if that's the life, don't let them out there, Flying Saucer.

65
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,020
We don't want a lot of little green men terrorizing the home counties during Ask a Tweak, do we?

66
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,080
Yes, all right. Full emergency.

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,000
You hear the news? The three aliens are coming to New York.

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,320
One night only. Two thousand dollars a ticket.

69
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:51,960
Yee-haw!

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,380
We are flying! We are flying! We are flying!

71
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,700
So what are you guys here for? To see Flying Saucer's land? Is that going to happen tonight?

72
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,080
When they arrive, it's going to be the dawn of a whole new civilization.

73
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,940
Space creatures conspiring with the Soviet government already control our thoughts

74
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,360
by sending out electrical currents from the top of the Empire State Building.

75
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,940
And I'm the only one that knows.

76
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,240
If you're alienated, can you still help children?

77
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,980
Oh, sure. Alienation only affects the mind. It has nothing to do with the rest of your life.

78
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,760
We are...

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,280
going to see more and more of these visitors from space.

80
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,480
And that before too long, the evidence will be incontroversial.

81
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,820
That you will have on your TV screens and on your movie screens

82
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,120
concrete evidence that the ships are here and that they are real.

83
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,000
And they're not fantastic things which have been cooked up to make a movie.

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,140
I have made telepathic contact for the past eight years

85
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,140
with many space people from many areas of space, both inside and outside of the solar system.

86
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,800
And I'm sure they will be there for the rest of their lives.

87
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,040
And I'm sure they will be there for the rest of their lives.

88
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,680
Well, this device right here is one that we've used to contact the people in the flying saucers.

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,260
It receives the messages on a beam of light.

90
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,520
And it is in turn translated by this unit and brought out as intelligible voice speech.

91
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,220
You mean to say you actually received messages from the flying saucers?

92
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,740
That's right.

93
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,320
How about letting me try it, Dick, and see if I can get something on it?

94
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:15,540


95
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,980
Thank you.

96
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,220
Receiving transmission from the flying saucers.

97
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,240
Thank you.

98
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:21,540


99
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:21,740


100
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:21,740


101
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:21,740


102
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:21,740


103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,560
Thank you.

104
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,580
Bob, there's nothing to be frightened of, man.

105
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,980
From my mind, all of you will be free men, not locked away like animals.

106
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,580
Be free.

107
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,920
Is that recording good enough to identify the thing?

108
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,840
Yeah, right.

109
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,580
Ha ha!

110
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,220
Hey, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think.

111
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,840
From that fateful day when stinking bits of slime first crawled from the sea

112
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,980
and shouted to the cold stars...

113
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,060
Let us have our hour of slack!

114
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,880
That's what they shouted to the cold stars, friends.

115
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,280
The cold stars glittering metallic and indifferent above.

116
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:12,580
And yet, through some strange miracle, a small trickle of slack began to fall upon the rocks.

117
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,440
Yes.

118
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,740
The owls of Ohio are not what they...

119
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,000
Of course.

120
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,040
The owls of slack.

121
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,440
I hadn't thought of that.

122
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,620
And thank you, Dr. Howland.

123
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,420
Oh, yeah, sure.

124
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,300
Yeah, well, there are these owls, you see, and they help us find a slackful angle.

125
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,140
A slackful level, I suppose I should say.

126
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:46,580
Nothing like a bunch of owls hanging around to ask the existential question,

127
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,520
like an owl in the blue, to who do you do?

128
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,600
Well, I guess I'd say that we're out among the stars.

129
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,000
And, uh, yes, we've been out among the owls.

130
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,820
We were hoping to be among the stars, but...

131
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,140
I hate that phrase, next X-Day, but that's...

132
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:13,380
No, we should simply say X-Day and realize that whatever we did have, and it was delightful,

133
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:21,300
it wasn't the X-Day that will be the last, the be-end-all X-Day.

134
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,120
The be-all and the end-all.

135
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,420
It was another drill.

136
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,840
We can admit it, but it was...

137
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,680
We all got drilled pretty well.

138
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,580
I feel like I've been trepanated a bit.

139
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,760
Yes, our tubes are discharged and our ashes were hauled.

140
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,580
Bob's ashes are blowing in the wind now.

141
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:51,260
The last thing that happened, what now has to be referred to as the 18th X-Day drill,

142
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,320
was the burning of an effigy of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

143
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,600
It was a pretty good one.

144
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,320
We had to explain to some of the concerned pagans that it wasn't really Bob.

145
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:11,560
No, but you see, if X-Day, for some reason, does not quite get decanted, then it derives to Starwood.

146
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:18,920
It gives away, it comes away, and becomes Starwood, which it is now.

147
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,420
Yes, and I'm glad I'm not there.

148
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,380
Because they're just trying to get their systems up and running.

149
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,020
Yes.

150
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,540
It gets a little bit tricky.

151
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,700
It's a little muddy out there.

152
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,960
Wyrmwood under the stars.

153
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,960
Oh, it's a massive mass of muck.

154
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:42,820
Yeah, so we couldn't burn the effigy of Bob down in the pawpaw patch because it was so muddy.

155
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,080
It was just a big old swamp.

156
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,560
Just trying to get down in there, they'd slip and fall on their butts.

157
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,900
Get in there was one thing.

158
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,400
Getting out would be another if one could go.

159
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:58,820
You could only slip and slide helplessly in the mud with huge herds of mooing, panicked subgeniuses.

160
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:06,200
You know, you're giving me an idea for a great prank I could do at Starwood as a sort of a hippie trap.

161
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,140
Oh yeah?

162
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,420
And what would be best if there was a big antlion type thing down at the bottom of that pit.

163
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,420
Oh yes, snapping its mandibles.

164
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,560
And teach him hippies something about peace and love.

165
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,860
That's right.

166
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,180
Choke on this, hippie.

167
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,080
So we had to burn Bob up on higher ground.

168
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,920
He was nailed to a Dobbs icon in a crucified way.

169
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,480
And the funny thing was he all burned up except for his open outstretched palms.

170
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,860
And they took a long time.

171
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,080
Even when there was no head or torso left, there was Bob's hand out for money.

172
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,980
Yes, his fleshless palms were stretched as if asking alms.

173
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:55,500
Until some bright, eager beaver operative stepped up with a flamethrower and turned even those into char.

174
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,680
Well, we had fun.

175
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,240
It was a little challenging. The weather was wet. It wasn't hot.

176
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,260
It wasn't a treatment steamer.

177
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,720
Very comfortable temperature. Breezy sometimes.

178
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:16,280
Yes, occasionally there would be a cool evening breeze on a warm, flowery shore.

179
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,660
But for the most time, it rained.

180
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,580
We had been praying for lava hail or rain.

181
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,920
But the weather gods weren't cooperating with us.

182
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,480
And the space gods weren't either.

183
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,720
They weren't.

184
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,780
The space princesses sure were, though.

185
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,660
I never saw an X Day with so many pretty girls.

186
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
They were there.

187
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:46,260
So that should put to rest that old canard, the X Day, the subgenius gatherings, as I'm assuming.

188
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,260


189
00:09:46,260 --> 00:10:03,580
Some sort of sausage fest, as the term is, where oafs gather around in baseball caps with beards and large protuberant abdomens and scratch and spit and cuss and eat meat and...

190
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,860
And actually, there is a lot of that.

191
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:15,500
But on the other hand, the distaff subgeniuses certainly put in a remarkable appearance.

192
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,340
What does that word mean, distaff?

193
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,820
Well, it's just some silly, prissy old way of saying female, actually.

194
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,220
You see, females used to spin.

195
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,020
Oh, okay.

196
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,160
Men would delve and females would spin.

197
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,340
When Adam delve and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?

198
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,300
Now, don't ask me, because I don't know.

199
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:46,240
And I was only speaking lightly and perhaps playfully about the...

200
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,800
composition of the subgenius crowd.

201
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:57,240
But it is true that it is not an all-male bunch of sub-tards.

202
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,320
Nor are they all human, as evidenced by this collar.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,620
Lonesome cowboy.

204
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,820
Greetings and salutations.

205
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,860
What the hell happened, you guys?

206
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,020
Well, we...

207
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,580
How come you're still, you know...

208
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,740
I know, don't ask.

209
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,600
We survived.

210
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,940
We ended up in one big piece.

211
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,720
And I alone am left to tell thee and everybody else.

212
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:30,020
The giant magnetic orb of your own eye is the one to tell the tale.

213
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,360
You know, he who controls magnetism controls the universe, so...

214
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,540
Mr. Mesmer knew that.

215
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,820
Yeah, I'm not trying to tell tales out of school, but maybe not every subgenius acted properly.

216
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,580
Whatever the reason was, the exists might have hovered.

217
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,920
But they did not land.

218
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:55,420
We did gather at the appropriate time near the giant turtle mound, which has two huge eyeballs these days.

219
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,700
And we waited in the circle of standing stones.

220
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:08,580
But we only had a few drops of rain from the sky, as though they were the falling tears of heaven when the moment rolled around.

221
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,420
Wow.

222
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,160
No naked sex goddesses dropping from the sky.

223
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,900
No, but some came.

224
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,660
Although they did come join us in the baptism for once.

225
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,880
It was great that they actually showed up.

226
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,660
There is the...

227
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:30,780
Oh, yes, and they were most responsive and forthcoming during the baptism, which we recorded on audio.

228
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:41,700
So you will be able to hear an incredible collage of splashes and giggles, probably on this program, recorded live from X Day 16.

229
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:54,680
Resplendent in banana leaves and full of all kinds of arcane knowledge and willing to spew it out to anybody who will listen, as well as their organs, which are not only not dysfunctional, but not double negatives.

230
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,180
Well, I...

231
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,280
Unless you have a bad attitude about it.

232
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,660
We tried to let the chips fall where they may.

233
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,560
I came back with all the organs that I went there with, which may not be saying much.

234
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,400
What about that strange smell in the car, though?

235
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,980
That's a mystery that Dr. Howell and I have been dealing with all afternoon.

236
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:22,020
For some reason, the eye van smells like there's something dead in it.

237
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,580
Something went in there and up and died.

238
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,480
You know what them country witches do?

239
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,920
You guys were down there by the border of Virginia or West Virginia.

240
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,980
We were staying with a witch, actually.

241
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,800
You know what they do? They take doe pee-pee.

242
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,560
Uh-oh.

243
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,880
And if it's out for longer than five seconds, it stinks real bad.

244
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,600
And it's like a...

245
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,380
You know what?

246
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,360
Appalachian type of...

247
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,960
I'm gonna put some doe stinky on there.

248
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,440
Well, they often use tiger piss to drive marauding deer away.

249
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,680
You simply spray all your vegetables, flowers, and fruits with a heavy layer of tiger piss,

250
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,300
and deers do not nibble them.

251
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,520
Of course, you won't want them either, but...

252
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,880
But it's overcharged in many restaurants.

253
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,660
We sprayed some of that on...

254
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,320
We have to keep over-watering the tiger.

255
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,540
Excuse me. Go on.

256
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:16,940
Yeah, we bought some carnivore urine to spray on our tomato plants, keep the deer away.

257
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,740
But one dumb, drunk subgenius drank it.

258
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,780
I won't say even who that idiot is.

259
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,360
Well, it's like it's an aperitif or something.

260
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,800
It's like Angus Durand's bitter or something.

261
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,120
No, I think we're thinking about two different events.

262
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:34,300
Oh, really? Well, there were so many exotic drinks around that people got a little...

263
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,680
a shade too experimental, I think.

264
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,400
Tiger pee was a favorite.

265
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,020
Well, there was a...

266
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,820
a sort of a Texan, Hunter S. Thompson guy.

267
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,540
Yes, and his name was...

268
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,920
Reverend Hayseed.

269
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,480
And he was with the beautiful Ulla, wasn't he?

270
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,000
Right.

271
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,880
And they were certainly standouts at X Day,

272
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,600
and they constantly mixed exotic potations and libations.

273
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,380
They were really generous.

274
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,420
Yes, they were.

275
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,780
And he was a very stylish fellow.

276
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,940
He had an interesting uniform on.

277
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,420
A most interesting gentleman.

278
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,400
And in the absence of Papa Joe Mama,

279
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,120
he brought the coercive military thing along

280
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,900
and was as dapper as can be.

281
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,280
Reverend Dapper was there, too.

282
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:18,940
Yes, he was.

283
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,040
Did he have like epaulettes on his shoulders and so forth?

284
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,680
Well, he had an officer's high-peaked cap.

285
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,800
He was dressed in handsome sable from his head to his foot.

286
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,020
And this did not derive from...

287
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,720
Now that is a silly statement.

288
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,900
...gloving of ashes and sable.

289
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,520
There were plenty afloat, but...

290
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,280
And furthermore, he wore cowboy boots

291
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:45,080
and some badges and pins to show he was in his hoots.

292
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,260
And best of all, he spoke God's language like I do.

293
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,660
Oh, my.

294
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,760
He spoke good Texan.

295
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,500
Yeah, it was for real, too.

296
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,020
He was from Abilene and San Antonio,

297
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:02,060
and those are not as full of Yankees as Dallas and Fort Worth are.

298
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,060
Yankees?

299
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,640
Which is what drove...

300
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:03,780
Well, I...

301
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,800
It's like, well, might as well move in up north among the Yankees as be here.

302
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,400
So...

303
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,140
Oh, you see Confederate flags flying on occasion, and I wonder what point they're trying to prove.

304
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,660
They're just trying to recapitulate Evel Knievel's shirt.

305
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,060
Exactly.

306
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,160
I mean, that's what I was thinking all along, especially with the most recent stunt.

307
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,300
Who would...

308
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:31,040
Why would anyone do such a ridiculous thing, especially if he had any, you know, force

309
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,560
gain or pre-temporal lobes or anything that's important?

310
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:40,000
Were you talking about the Valenda brothers crossing of the Grand Canyon on a piece of

311
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
disintegrating twine?

312
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,640
Yeah.

313
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:42,640


314
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,940
Easier the exit should arrive, and everybody wished away in the, you know...

315
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,700
Well, next year, next year, yeah.

316
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,380
Sure.

317
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,660
Everything's fine.

318
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,780
Everything's just fine.

319
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,120
Yes, we're recording.

320
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,860
Everything's going fine.

321
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,960
And we did record several times.

322
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,440
We had many interesting performances.

323
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:03,540
Yeah.

324
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,080
We had three performances, and we had a lot of performances going on.

325
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,500
And we had a lot of performances going on on the main stage.

326
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,520
We had seven bass guitars playing simultaneously.

327
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,280
Yeah.

328
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,720
And it was really organized.

329
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,760
It wasn't just anti-music or, oh, it's seven basses and one's making noise.

330
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,360
Well, we had some of that, but not with the seven basses.

331
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:19,500
Wow.

332
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,840
The next group that followed the seven basses couldn't even keep the beat, but they were

333
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,740
vigorous players, and they were really loud.

334
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:32,380
And then they were followed by the Amino Acids doing an incredibly dynamic set, one of their

335
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,740
best.

336
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,460
Well, there was a lot of great music.

337
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:33,460


338
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:33,460


339
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:33,460


340
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:33,460


341
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:33,460


342
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,940
The bass players were called the Disgruntled Bassist Orchestra.

343
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,740
And there really were seven bass players up there.

344
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,380
Bishop Stick went to a lot of trouble to equalize all their sound.

345
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,960
One of them was Andrew the Impaled, who is a marvelous musician, as it turns out,

346
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,720
and can play songs of his own composition like Tom Leraire on contemporary subjects

347
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,140
when he's not hammering ice picks into his head.

348
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,060
Well, he's not perfect.

349
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,400
Especially ones clad in sable furs and stuff like that.

350
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,280
Their fingernails grow extremely long.

351
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,180
Well, he wasn't one of the bass players.

352
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,320
He wasn't the bass player.

353
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,780
That guy in night black sable was not a bass player.

354
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,500
They were all wearing T-shirts and shorts and baseball caps,

355
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,540
except for one bass player, Reverend Baby Bear, who wore a wonderful outfit.

356
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,240
Well, she had little bear ears.

357
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,340
Could you please describe it?

358
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,060
She had little tiny bear ears on top.

359
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:11,400
She had tiny bear ears on top and a form-fitting body suit type thing.

360
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,840
Reverend Baby Bear really doesn't have to worry about what she wears.

361
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,400
But she does.

362
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,740
And she's worried about representing her entire gender,

363
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,640
being the only woman up there while all the men are doing it.

364
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,640
She would feel if she made a mistake, she'd let her side down, you see.

365
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,600
She was playing bass?

366
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,700
Yes, she plays bass.

367
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,820
She plays in a band.

368
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,720
She has a band.

369
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,720
She's the bass player.

370
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,180
But she was the only woman up there in a group of bass players,

371
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,640
the Disgruntled Bass Players Association.

372
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:53,060
My actual mother was an actual bass player in a Victory Sweethearts all-girl swing band in the 1940s.

373
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,260
Well, this is kind of the opposite of that, Lonesome Cowboy, Dave.

374
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,480
It's kind of like an all-male band.

375
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,000
It's the opposite.

376
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,080
It's the opposite.

377
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,080


378
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,080


379
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,080


380
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,080


381
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,120


382
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,120


383
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,120


384
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,300
Except for one lovely girl off to the side.

385
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,300
But, you know, subgenius is nothing if not about experimenting with new combinations.

386
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,480
And who knows what's going to appear on that stage in the future.

387
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:13,740
Right.

388
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,040
Mothering is a sexual concept.

389
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,860
I think it has its merits and its demerits as well.

390
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,340
That's it.

391
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,660
We should get the mothers of subgeniuses with bass guitars up there.

392
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,560
No.

393
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,320
This has more to do with...

394
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,460
I dug up your mother.

395
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:30,560
Mother.

396
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,780
She can still play.

397
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,820
I dug up your mother.

398
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,800
Some people know what line follows that.

399
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,500
I can't say it.

400
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,180
I can't even say the theme of this section.

401
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,320
Are you listening to the owls?

402
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,960
Hear them?

403
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,640
Those aren't the owls of Gahoolie, folks.

404
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Those are Ohio's official owls.

405
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,300
Right.

406
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,380
What are the owls of Gahoolie and what are the official owls of Ohio?

407
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,680
The owls of Gahoolie were a famous motion picture that I believe Ivan Stang actually watched.

408
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,140
And when he came out,

409
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,820
he told me,

410
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,540
don't go see the owls of Gahoolie.

411
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,700
But the owls that you're hearing are the owls of Ohio.

412
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,000
This wonderful state, so fertile and wide and wild.

413
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,820
Out there by Wisteria, there's headless horsemen all up and down the roads late at night.

414
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:25,200
Is that the old legend of Stavastopol and Sleepy Irving and all that stuff like that down there, too?

415
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,400
No, that's in New York.

416
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,800
It's no legend.

417
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,240
He really is out there.

418
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,120
But they have their own owls.

419
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,760
Ohio headless horsemen and crazy school teachers.

420
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:39,760
And of course, my flesh was pierced and chewed by multitudes of insects.

421
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,140
I'm now scratching, scratching the endless bites.

422
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,600
They were in great profusion here, too.

423
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,300
They leave me alone.

424
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,500
Well, bully for you.

425
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,300
But some of us just happen to taste good, Stang.

426
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,500
And those of us are the bees make a bee line.

427
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,700
Well, the insects do.

428
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,040
Do know when they're up for a good thing.

429
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:09,120
Andrew the Impaled, who does know a little bit about things that stick through you,

430
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,420
said that if you just don't scratch the bites, they go away in a few days.

431
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,620
But if you do give in to the scratching, they'll be there for a long time.

432
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,060
Yeah, but when he said that, he had a screwdriver right in the middle of his face.

433
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,580
It's true.

434
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,680
And a mouth, a stomach full of chewed, broken glass.

435
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,480
Well, he likes broken glass.

436
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,920
A lot of people that I know eat broken glass, although I never have.

437
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,840
My pal Chicken John eats broken glass.

438
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:45,300
And then for a theatrical flourish, he apparently washes it down with Windex.

439
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,460
Well, of course, that's what would kill you.

440
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,980
It's just water that's dyed blue in a Windex bottle.

441
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,440
But I've heard people in the audience where I'm standing while this is going on say,

442
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,400
Oh, he didn't eat broken glass, but I saw him drink Windex.

443
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,600
Right, yeah.

444
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:05,920
Well, I know that the ones who put spoons in their noses have deviated nostrils, deviated septums.

445
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,320
Yeah, if they didn't when they started, they do when they finish.

446
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,920
And I know that many of their tricks are the result of years of training.

447
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,520
And if we were stupid enough, we'd try them.

448
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,700
I mean, why stick a screwdriver in your nose if you don't have to?

449
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,760
Especially if what you need is a Phillips and what you have is a standard screwdriver.

450
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:21,920
Exactly.

451
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,760
That's what must have gone wrong with Andrew's mind.

452
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,420
That's where the motherboard is, right below the eyeballs.

453
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,520
Holy mother.

454
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,960
Motherboard of Jehovah.

455
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,180
We'll prove all of this that we're saying, by the way.

456
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,940
Yeah, it's all true.

457
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,600
Dr. Sinister.

458
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,960
Dr. Sinister is here.

459
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,920
It's on paper.

460
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,020
It's hard copy.

461
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,000
There's no, uh...

462
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,640
Um...

463
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,740
There's a real trail.

464
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,460
Dr. Sinister, you messed up.

465
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,080
What?

466
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,240
You messed up?

467
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,380
No, I figured this is...

468
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,520
Since I'm...

469
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,340
Since it's a year I'm not going, I heard you say that there were a lot of girls there.

470
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,140
Oh, my God.

471
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,700
It was the year...

472
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,520
I've never seen a gorgeous female.

473
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,080
That's what I was...

474
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,780
Basically, that was the reason.

475
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,060
There was a lot of...

476
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,360
Very...

477
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,100
Uninhibited.

478
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,000
Young ladies.

479
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,520
Pretty.

480
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
In all states of undress.

481
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,320
And of...

482
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,260
It's probably better that I didn't go.

483
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,600
Most racist, actually.

484
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,520
That was another...

485
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,900
Yes, it was a...

486
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,180
A much more diverse...

487
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,580
The most diverse X-Day with these girls were all different colors, also.

488
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,560
Oh.

489
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,600
We had all the same color on the inside.

490
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,600
And when the...

491
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,600
The lights go out.

492
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,160
You don't want to be that kind of guy.

493
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,340
That's...

494
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,380
Yeah, I mean, that's terrible.

495
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,680
I mean, I thought we were gentlemen here.

496
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:33,900
That ain't cool, man.

497
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,700
What's the purpose of this?

498
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,720
Gentlemen, indeed.

499
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,720
That ain't cool, man.

500
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,200
Well, I...

501
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,400
Perhaps I've got a little dinosaur egg on my face there.

502
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,040
Well, you should.

503
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,300
I can smell the bacon frying all the way here, 50 miles away.

504
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,760
We've got to find out what's making that smell of horrible, rotted, burning flesh in the car.

505
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,600
Well, the Bob dummy was in the car, and you and I.

506
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,760
We're in the car.

507
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,740
Yes, but it could be...

508
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:07,000
It occurred to me at one point, well, X-Day, maybe it did come, and maybe it wasn't what we thought.

509
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,760
Maybe we're dead.

510
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,760
We're smelling our own decay, just like in those EC comments.

511
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:25,240
I think it's more likely that alternate theory that you proposed, that legume giggling and tiptoeing stashed some rotting meat inside the Bob dummy, which is still in the car with us.

512
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,340
And that is the source of the...

513
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:26,860
He's done it before.

514
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,920
He left his colostomy.

515
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,520
He left his colostomy bag there.

516
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,860
He's done that before as a practical joke.

517
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:35,200
You know, if you wear a catheter, there's probably some good news for you.

518
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,420
Especially if you attach the bottom part to the top part to your eardrum.

519
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,200
Zoe Owl.

520
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:40,940
Hmm.

521
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:41,740
Hmm.

522
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,080
Let's listen now to the hoots of the great woodsy owl of Ohio.

523
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,860
Who the hell are you?

524
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,240
I've wondered so long.

525
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:55,960
No.

526
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,840
I don't think...

527
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,960
I don't think you've ever been in a house with two owls like you've seen.

528
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,620
No, you're scaring them away.

529
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,080
Well, honestly, we really wish you would have been there, Dave.

530
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,780
At one point, the power died.

531
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,240
Yeah, the power went off.

532
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,660
And some bands, and not just with us, the whole neighborhood, it was annual karma.

533
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,420
Because last year, we were the only place with power.

534
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,520
Yeah, but this time, everybody else had power, but we had to suffer a power outrage.

535
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:27,260
But still, a group got up and did an acoustic set in the flickering lamp lit...

536
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,920
Scene of Caffeine and Scaffec...

537
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,620
The Mutant Mountain Boys.

538
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,540
The Mutant Mountain Boys, two of whom are remarkable-looking girls.

539
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,900
Oh, listen to that.

540
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,880
That's the Pee-Wit.

541
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,320
A relation of the dwarf elf owl.

542
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,200
Are you making fun of me?

543
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,000
A dwarf elf owl.

544
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,300
I'm just sorry.

545
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,600
The dwarf elf owl.

546
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,680
Any of them have their skulls exposed to the same kind of micrometer atmospheres in the

547
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,000
atmosphere?

548
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,820
I mean, the atmospheric...

549
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,580
Who had skulls exposed?

550
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,680
The double air.

551
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,500
Who?

552
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,040
Who had exposed skulls?

553
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,240
I...

554
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,100
That's what I was wondering.

555
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,160
If the dwarf renegade mountain...

556
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,000
Who's in the tree?

557
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,300
No, no, no, no.

558
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,040
The elven owl.

559
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,700
No renegade dwarf at X-Day this time.

560
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,720
I...

561
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,320
You know, why look for exotic explanations when the simple ones will do?

562
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,720
That's Occam's razor.

563
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,440
Now, there were mysterious giant reptile tracks.

564
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,100
Remember the first night?

565
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,720
There were the tracks in the mud of ornithopod dinosaurs.

566
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,260
Not theropods.

567
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,540
Fortunately.

568
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:36,940
But the distinctive tracks, the tridactyl tracks of ornithopods like Hadrosaurus and things

569
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,500
like that.

570
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,200
Edmontosaurus.

571
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,800
I thought it was old Sequel.

572
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,580
They've been shrunken, though.

573
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,180
Come up out of the lake.

574
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:41,480
Really?

575
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,460
Don't you have to find a coproliter, too?

576
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,200
But old Sequel is a turtle.

577
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,100
Right.

578
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,580
I think the coprolites are as big as a house sometimes.

579
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:54,280
Now, I did notice later on, Susie the floozy seemed to be running away from me with some

580
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,720
kind of odd pointy things on her feet.

581
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,300
Hmm.

582
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,000
She's actually...

583
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,040
Hmm.

584
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,040


585
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,600
She looked guilty, like she'd been caught doing something, and she was hiding these

586
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,820
things she had on her feet.

587
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,100
She usually runs away from you with just ordinary shoes on her feet.

588
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,360
Well, we'll see.

589
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,500
The photos will tell all.

590
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,380
Oh, that's right.

591
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:21,180
We have extensive photos and even full-color movies in 8D to go over tonight.

592
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:21,500
Yes.

593
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,340
Helen, I will be wild.

594
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,700
We'll drink a few cocktails, put on our smoking jackets, and...

595
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,680
And put on the baptism day.

596
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Yes, that's right.

597
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:35,180
And decide what we need to withhold from the tender eyes of a possibly underage audience.

598
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:40,120
Well, we would want to give the wrong impression that it was some kind of lewd...

599
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,660
Orgy or...

600
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,220
Yeah, right.

601
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,740
Right.

602
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,960
Or exposed pineal gland.

603
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,200
You know, we had the chance to have the big orgy.

604
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,420
Well, I missed it, whatever it was.

605
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,220
Just before the roast pig was to be served...

606
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,040
I beg your pardon.

607
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,760
Oh, that.

608
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,860
Yeah, right.

609
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,100
Yeah, we did have a roast pig.

610
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,180
There was a...

611
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,660
They went whole hog.

612
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,960
Torrential downpour of rain.

613
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,840
There always is one at X-Day.

614
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,320
This one...

615
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,260
And it always picks a unique time.

616
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:13,980
So, about 50 people ended up crammed together under these shelters, really close, hiding

617
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,680
from the rain, trying not to get wet.

618
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,020
And that was when...

619
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,240
That was the chance to have the weird sex cult orgy.

620
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,060
And what does it say for us that it didn't happen?

621
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,000
And I even suggested it.

622
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:32,740
Well, I'm afraid I just got the cold, shivering girl I was with a cup of hot coffee.

623
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,420
But instead, I could have used vital magnetism to...

624
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,320
Really?

625
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,800
To take care of her problem.

626
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,680
To jump back a moment...

627
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,200
You can actually...

628
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,240
You can hypnotize people with magnetism.

629
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,120
And that's what the...

630
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,540
Well, you could, but...

631
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:52,200
The secret of a great speaker like yourself and Adolf Twitler and the other renegades

632
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,300
that, you know, people don't care to mention anymore and stuff.

633
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,760
This is what they all have in common.

634
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,120
It's an astute form of...

635
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,800
It's a varietal function.

636
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,640
I'm not sure if it's wisdom or teeth or...

637
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,400
Well, you've got to show your teeth.

638
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,980
Flash a big grin while you're telling him the lies.

639
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,100
But if we could jump back just a moment.

640
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,560
There's something I've always wondered.

641
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,840
What was the matter with the Owls of Gahooli, anyway?

642
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,440
It was a little bit too much like every other children's film you've ever seen.

643
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,760
It had Darth Vader and I Am Your Father.

644
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,300
As an owl.

645
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:26,580
As an owl.

646
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:27,940
Luke Skywalker.

647
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:28,820
As an owl.

648
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,360
Dorothy.

649
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,220
As an owl.

650
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,920
The Wizard.

651
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,700
As an owl.

652
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,900
It was just the same story with owls.

653
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
But did the owls...

654
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,420
The owls looked great.

655
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,680
They had feathers and flight and all that.

656
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,960
Zack Snyder's great with cartoons.

657
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,380
He's a good cartoon movie maker.

658
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,400
What does an R2-D2 owl sound like?

659
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,360
Like Bubo.

660
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,940
There he is.

661
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,340
That irritates your inner ear just thinking of it, you know?

662
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,160
And his head spins around while he beeps and cuckoos.

663
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:00,200
Owls are one of the few birds that can actually do that.

664
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,520
They can turn their head completely backwards.

665
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,660
R2-D2.

666
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,720
And some of them can keep going around to the front and then do it again.

667
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,920
Just like that little R2 unit.

668
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,220
It's like a spring that's wound up.

669
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,400
Eventually, whoop, there's one going where it goes backwards.

670
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,660
Yes, legend says that the owl of Athena was...

671
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:25,880
In fact, some of those same owls will actually stick, you know, specially crafted or carved reeds into their beaks

672
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,160
after twisting their beaks.

673
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,960
They're twisting their necks up like that and they turn into propellers and it makes them fly faster.

674
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,240
It's just like one of those little wind-up...

675
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,200
On Halloween.

676
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,080
But not normally.

677
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,180
I think it's more than just all saints do.

678
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,340
All of them are necrophiliacs to begin with.

679
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,100
They love that flavor.

680
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,200
They love that smell.

681
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,940
No comment.

682
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,400
We're the ones who actually have to deal with that smell.

683
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,020
You can make gags about it.

684
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,540
You can make cracks about that smell.

685
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,960
But we're going to have to go out and get in that smell mobile after this is all over.

686
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,540
You know, in fact, just dump Bob out and leave him on the...

687
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,920
Then we...

688
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,360
You know he would do the same to you.

689
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,220
You know he's done that to you how many years in a row?

690
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,920
Haven't you gotten in trouble calling that Bob dummy around before

691
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,260
because people think that you have committed a capital crime?

692
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,520
Well, I do.

693
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,200
Perhaps the Bob dummy is a coprolite of its own.

694
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,300
He may have experienced some sort of personality after being driven around all these years

695
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,040
to various spots and being looked at by thousands and thousands of people.

696
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,620
So you think he copped a coprolite?

697
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,900
People have looked at him in some very...

698
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,200
I'm thinking it's the Bob dummy's poo-poo that's rotting away in that car

699
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,820
and you don't have the foresight.

700
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,640
The dummy was not that realistically constructed.

701
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,560
But he comes in handy when you visit or drive through those cities

702
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,360
that have high-occupancy vehicle lanes.

703
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,120
Yeah.

704
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,580
That's right. You're a carpool.

705
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:47,160
You know, usually we leave him sitting in our living room as a kind of a scarecrow.

706
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Again, we're burglars.

707
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,740
Yeah, there aren't any crows in Doug's living room, so...

708
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:55,340
When we were being robbed, when our cars were being broken into here at WCSB,

709
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,640
there was a spate of those.

710
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,560
They hit us, ironically, right after we'd completely cleaned the car

711
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,060
and it had nothing in it.

712
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,020
Even Bob?

713
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,160
Not even Bob.

714
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,700
But after that, we put Bob in it whenever we park here.

715
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,080
The police congratulated me.

716
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,060
They thought Bob was a great fella.

717
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,220
They said he offered him a few hits off his pipe.

718
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,540
And from now on, every car will have to have a Bob in it.

719
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,420
Well, I...

720
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,680
Is there a motorcycle helmet law in Ohio?

721
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,580
That sounds like a bad...

722
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,480
No, not in Ohio.

723
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,960
Because we came back, we saw all these people carousing on motorcycles with no helmets,

724
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,300
with their hair streaming in the breeze.

725
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,200
Motorcyclists I see on the road around town, it's about 50-50.

726
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,060
I'd say about half of them don't have helmets at all.

727
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,700
Every motorcyclist we saw had no helmet.

728
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,700
We saw a young blonde woman riding a motorcycle, no helmet, her ponytail in the breeze.

729
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,120
But as soon as we got on Ivan Stang's street,

730
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,320
we saw some prissy bicyclists pedaling along.

731
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,900
They were fully armored with helmets.

732
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,320
Big, fat, juicy ones.

733
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,780
No, they were, they were, well, they were slender bicyclists.

734
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,840
But they had helmets.

735
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,320
Slender, slender bicyclists.

736
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,500
Socialist problem law.

737
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,680
But you could make the argument, say, perhaps this is a hirsute, beautiful young woman flying by on her Harley.

738
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,960
Perhaps she had no need to cover her skull,

739
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:23,120
which was partially exposed to the wind and giving off those funny signals.

740
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,580
Well, there is the Church of the Rushing Wind here.

741
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,320
It was unusual.

742
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,960
It was unique signals.

743
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,560
But it's not good for you to fall off and land on your face.

744
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,640
So you need the helmet, and that's why most states have the law and mandate.

745
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:44,220
You see a lot of people driving around on their motorcycles who have actually had that happen to them numerous times.

746
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,460
It's a nanny culture.

747
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,300
Oh, I know terrible stories, which I could tell.

748
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:56,280
They would bring everyone down and ruin this radio show if I described the hideous mutilations.

749
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:03,600
And the damage is that come from riding what emergency room technicians are apt to call donor cycles.

750
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,020
Like an old high school doctor drama.

751
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,500
They do.

752
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,480
By the highway patrol.

753
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,660
This is what will happen to you.

754
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:18,320
Jimmy Fuzz Thunder, 26, driving 95 miles an hour in a 35 mile an hour school zone.

755
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,520
Well, we did that.

756
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,920
From above by helicopter, but released.

757
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,960
We went through a school zone, a 20 mile zone.

758
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,960
At 50 miles an hour, we went through a stop sign without stopping.

759
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,060
We did all sorts of things.

760
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,640
Because after you've survived X-Day, you feel like you're kind of immortal, whether you want to be or not.

761
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,240
Nothing can happen if X-Day has happened.

762
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,520
I could see you guys all with those Marlon Brando Wild Ones hats.

763
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,920
You know, those like cap, sea captain's hats.

764
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,260
Who had that?

765
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,340
Reverend, what's his name?

766
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,000
They had the cap with the high peak.

767
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,340
The.

768
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,780
Officer like cap.

769
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,740
He dressed in black.

770
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,640
Reverend Hayseed.

771
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,500
Reverend Hayseed.

772
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,440
Yeah, he had that.

773
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,260
That cap.

774
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,880
And boy, did it look good.

775
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,580
It made you want one if you saw it.

776
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,200
Hmm.

777
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:15,560
But, of course, many people carried enormous umbrellas because of the constant rain pelting down.

778
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,800
Like the stations of the cross.

779
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,520
And then only it was umbrellas.

780
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,360
And the road became a squishy quagmire of brown mud oozing water.

781
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,180
And.

782
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,120
But it was very hard to navigate.

783
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,380
Well, when life.

784
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:28,800
Hard water.

785
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,820
Hard rain.

786
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,560
Throws muddy mud pits at you.

787
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,480
You have made mud wrestling.

788
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,220
I missed that mud wrestling.

789
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,360
I didn't see that.

790
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:37,820
There were.

791
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,460
We weren't.

792
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,580
That's because we weren't hippie enough.

793
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,900
But I bet you can be some.

794
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,680
Mud wrestling.

795
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,680
That's.

796
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,720
Oh, well, I bet you can't wait to get back to Starwood.

797
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,560
Actually, I can.

798
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,480
Oh, but it's ridiculous to try to wrestle mud.

799
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,680
It has no supernal form in the way of.

800
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,180
A bishop or archbishop.

801
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,220
He used to be.

802
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,980
Oh, I forget his name.

803
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,900
But anyway, you can't.

804
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,560
You can't argue with mud.

805
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,120
Let alone let alone get and wrestle with and expect to win.

806
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,500
Well, that's the challenge.

807
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:12,980
You know, you might be able to to beat some here stoop obese man in spandex, but you'll never beat the mud.

808
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,040
Yeah, you could smear mud all over that guy.

809
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,120
He probably love it.

810
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,240
Why not smear it on a female wrestler instead?

811
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,600
Well, that's usually what ends up.

812
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,840
Happening because one great big girl right in the middle who's with a big grin on her

813
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,160
face and a whole bunch of skinny boys crawling around smearing mud all over.

814
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,920
No, that wasn't.

815
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,840
That hasn't happened for many years.

816
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,840
You're you're I don't know, reminiscing.

817
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,320
These are old ex days.

818
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,460
With a hat and a pig on the phone.

819
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,060
Pigo, Piggora, Squealy, Gruntum.

820
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,680
I'm so.

821
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,300
The disease.

822
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,620
Go.

823
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:59,100
Did you actually have the feast of the pig or it sounded like it was recently aborted?

824
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,740
It was.

825
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,140
No, we had the pig.

826
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:06,100
We ate deeply of the flesh of the swine and the head was on display.

827
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,740
And it wasn't just the pig.

828
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,020
That wasn't the only hoofed animal we can see.

829
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,860
You ate a horse.

830
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,500
We ate lamb.

831
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,500
Oh, you cheap poor little lamb.

832
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,040
I had to sacrifice himself.

833
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,260
And Princess, we provided the greenish jelly.

834
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:23,600
Oh, you cheap. You had to sacrifice yourself. And Princess, we provided the greenish jelly.

835
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,180
And Princess, we provided the greenish jelly.

836
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:25,260
And Princess, we provided the greenish jelly.

837
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:25,260


838
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:25,980
And the lamb.

839
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,260
She raised it and killed it with her teeth.

840
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,700
Just like Errol Flynn used to do.

841
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,120
And butchered it with her nail file and handed the liver to Reverend Heathen and said, here,

842
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,820
cook this up.

843
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:43,620
And everything was cooked marvelously by Reverend Heathen Hammer, the Hephaestus of cooking.

844
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,200
Did any of the little children run away with hooves in their mouths screaming?

845
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,420
Little children ran away with endless teetering towers of Doctor Who VHS tapes.

846
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,600
No.

847
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,420
They were just a bunch of little kids.

848
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:54,720
Oh, wow.

849
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,540
Yes.

850
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,140
Yes.

851
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,100
Lord Ferg brought his son, who was about, what, 11 years old, maybe?

852
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,180
He seemed a very well-behaved lad, and he certainly partook of the Bulldada auction.

853
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:07,960
Yeah.

854
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:14,120
It was like, I want to watch all the TV shows and old movies that made these people this

855
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,500
way, so I can be like them.

856
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,600
And they're in heavy VHS tapes.

857
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,580
It must have weighed a considerable amount by the time he got older.

858
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:23,580


859
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:23,720
Yeah.

860
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
And he had all his swag together.

861
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,600
Yeah.

862
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,060
Did he have an entourage that picked up the stuff behind him?

863
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:30,780
He did it.

864
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,860
I assume he was some sort of squire's child.

865
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:36,180
When we do the auction, the bidders have to come forward to collect their property and

866
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,740
to pay the bursar, and then it's theirs to do with as they will.

867
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,440
Well, where did this 11-year-old child get so much money?

868
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,220
That's what I'd like to ask.

869
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,400
He's smart.

870
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,800
I ripped it off from the crippled newsie.

871
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,400
No, I don't know.

872
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,740
How does that make you feel, Dave?

873
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,220
It makes me feel pretty dumb.

874
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:53,560
Oh, I don't know.

875
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,080
Oh, he probably owns some startup company.

876
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,300
Yeah, probably.

877
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,560
Dave probably invented some app that everybody had to have.

878
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,560
Now, he was 11 years old or he just thought he was?

879
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,240
I'm sorry.

880
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,700
I don't quite understand the question.

881
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,100
He was actually 11 years old or he just thought that he was?

882
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:13,420
No, no.

883
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,480
He's probably about 11.

884
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,020
He wasn't 11 years old.

885
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,720
He was surely older than that.

886
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,240
I'm not good at figuring out people's ages, as I was telling Reverend Baby ... Oh, you

887
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,400
are?

888
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:21,940
Yes.

889
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,420
I raised him.

890
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,540
Oh, well, of course.

891
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,360
He looked like he was about 11 or 12 to me.

892
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,720
All right.

893
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,740
If you say so, that's good enough for me.

894
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,780
He was 11 or 12.

895
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,280
I would still judge 12 more than that.

896
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,080
And Reverend Baby Bear, I'd say, is about 8 or 9.

897
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,260
She looks younger than she is, I believe.

898
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,000
Right.

899
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,380
She is.

900
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,360
She sounds younger than she could possibly be.

901
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,300
She has to be in her 20s, and she told me that she would give up smoking cigarettes

902
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,240
when she got to be 26, which is a far off date for her.

903
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,380
Yes, a far off date for me, too.

904
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,360
Way far off.

905
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,420
I'm afraid so.

906
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,340
Anyway, we had some great performers at X Day and wonderful events.

907
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:12,320
So, really, it's all that X Day ever might be, except it was the wettest X Day on record.

908
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,260
That's not true.

909
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,360
I wasn't near as wet as some that we had at Brushwood.

910
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,100
I remember those, but I also remember staying in the trailer and having a really good time.

911
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,180
Besides, those cleared up, and this one never cleared.

912
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,160
No, no.

913
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,720
I see it the other way around.

914
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,320
Oh, really?

915
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:29,880
Yes.

916
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,460
Okay.

917
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:36,320
I remember X Days when all of Chaz Smith's equipment was suddenly destroyed because

918
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:42,800
one minute it was a clear night sky, and the next second it was the flood of Noah.

919
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,380
I lost video camera that same night.

920
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,120
Wham!

921
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,480
Suddenly it hit, and we were afloat.

922
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,920
I had a great time.

923
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,600
I lost my camera, but Princess Wee and I had to jump in the car, and we were trapped in the car for hours.

924
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,580
We had a wonderful time.

925
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,180
In fact, I think I even filmed an infrared sex tape.

926
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,340
That should horrify many youngsters.

927
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:18,380
Well, if you were talking about the same Brushwood X Day, we played sexual games in the trailer while we were stuck.

928
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:18,720
What?

929
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,140
Nobody ever invites me to those things.

930
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,600
We were in the damn trailer, unable to get out.

931
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:34,260
But I seem to remember that the rain fell for the first couple of days, and then afterwards it cleared up.

932
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,120
There have been ones like that.

933
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,140
In Wisteria?

934
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,480
Not Wisteria, the old place.

935
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,860
In Wisteria, you tend to get firestorms and earthquakes.

936
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,000
This was freak weather that we had this rain.

937
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:48,540
I'll say.

938
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,680
It was a freak festival.

939
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,120
It was a freak festival.

940
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,740
Rumblings from old sea quads.

941
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,100
Fences are down, man. It's a freak festival.

942
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,940
Dog stock is free now.

943
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,240
You could have taken refuge on that old turtle's back and started your own nation and your own people.

944
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,120
A turtle would have to rise first, and we're happy that he didn't.

945
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,260
Had he been seen recently?

946
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:18,000
Actually, I didn't see him during the whole thing, but I was only in the pond once, which was at the baptism and following the baptism.

947
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,140
Oh, he avoids those.

948
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:26,500
Usually I go in as many times as I can while I'm there. That was the only day I was ever in there.

949
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,980
In the baptism waters?

950
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,500
I beg your pardon?

951
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,680
You were actually there in the baptism waters?

952
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:41,380
Oh, yes, of course. I'm always there. I usually am there to catch the large, slippery subgeniuses when they're baptized and fall back into the water.

953
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,360
But this time I had the microphone.

954
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,200
So I was actually able, by preserving it from rain and splashes,

955
00:43:49,200 --> 00:44:00,260
to record, as I said, a wonderful tapestry of the subgeniusettes giggling as Reverend Stang fondly dipped them into the water.

956
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,660
Boy, the subgenius haters hate that more than anything.

957
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,260
They do?

958
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,060
They seem to consider, think that I have somehow brainwashed these girls.

959
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,280
They do?

960
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:16,640
Yes. They talk about it constantly. I use my Masonic skills that I learned from George Bush and Dick Cheney and the Grateful Dead.

961
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,100
Who talks about this constantly? I wouldn't mind reading it.

962
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,040
The subgenius haters on the old news group we used to use, alt.slash, they're still here.

963
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,280
The subgenius haters club.

964
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:29,440
Yes. Now it's only a subgenius hater news group. There are no subgeniuses at all.

965
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:35,000
And, ironically enough, they hate each other even worse than they hate each other.

966
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,320
Well, it's because of the point of view that I think is why they think you're a Mason.

967
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:45,880
It's because of the long... But many people think that's, you know, something out of, you know, some opera or something.

968
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,260
Opera? Ab?

969
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,020
Yeah, like Paul Cinelli.

970
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,720
And you have, like, big pointed toes or...

971
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,500
Yeah, Punchinello and Judith, that famous opera.

972
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,160
Punchinello and Judith. Yeah.

973
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:06,080
You know, it's been a while since I've been to the opera, but it just strikes me that perhaps Brushwood would make... I'm sorry.

974
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,120
Wisteria.

975
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:13,260
Wisteria. Would make an... You know, I always have to stop and say one and not the other, and that time I said the wrong one.

976
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,000
Yes, Wisteria would make an opera. After all, they had a Burning Man opera, which was rather good, which I said.

977
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,940
So now it's time for the Wisteria opera.

978
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,100
It's a rather literal opera name to begin with.

979
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,700
Wisteria, Wisteria, Wisteria.

980
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,200
Well, we're off to a great start, aren't we?

981
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:28,660
Oh, man.

982
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,680
It's not the over turn.

983
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,140
Call a big producer in New York.

984
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:32,880
Draw the curtain.

985
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,740
And we did have a big shepherd's hook on hand for people like Dave.

986
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:39,660
Shepherd's hook.

987
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,620
And I forgot to use it when that bad band came on.

988
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,640
Boy, were they bad.

989
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,480
Oh, a shepherd's hook.

990
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,780
There was a bad band.

991
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,800
But they weren't bad.

992
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,440
Not deliberately bad.

993
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,400
Baby Bear and I kind of enjoyed them anyway.

994
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,420
How can you wreck Wooly Bully?

995
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,100
They did.

996
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:04,280
The things that they played, they sang terribly, and they played against the beat, and their guitars were loud.

997
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,700
But still, at least you could tell what they were doing.

998
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,800
They were sandwiched in between some good acts, though.

999
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:17,740
The keyboardist, though, was one of our main sound technicians and helpers, so that we could hardly tell him, no, no, you can't have your local band here.

1000
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,260
And that was the only local band.

1001
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,780
One good guy can't save a bad band.

1002
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,900
But it wasn't really so much even their fault, because their main guy didn't show up, as they explained.

1003
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,300
Oh, I didn't know that.

1004
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:28,940
You didn't know.

1005
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,120
Yeah, he's from some strange country behind the Iron Curtain that no longer exists.

1006
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:34,880
A strange country?

1007
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:43,380
Yeah, they weren't even sure about how to pronounce it, but they said they were going to sing the national anthem of that land.

1008
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:43,820
Ah.

1009
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,200
I love those quarters.

1010
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,580
They're so deep and strong.

1011
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,020
Children have such an intense identity.

1012
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,980
Children shouldn't play with dead things.

1013
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,860
Or play dead music.

1014
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:55,680
Pardon?

1015
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,480
I was just saying, children shouldn't play with dead things.

1016
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:06,980
Well, if you're a musician, you must at all costs play with dead things, because what else makes the world go round?

1017
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,920
It's a foxy smell, isn't it?

1018
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,140
We're going to try to get that out of the car.

1019
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:11,760
It's a wake-up call, isn't it?

1020
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:12,560
Uh.

1021
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,560
Now, there was a living instrument in The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.

1022
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:23,620
The Sultan had written an opera called The Eunuch's Life is Hard.

1023
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,120
It was called The Torturer's Apprentice. Pardon me for creating the lyrics.

1024
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,400
The Eunuch's Life is Hard.

1025
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,840
And that is all, I think, was the way it went.

1026
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:39,240
And the organ, when he pushed a key, it would push a spike or something into a cage full of slaves.

1027
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,840
And he had them lined up as high shrieking, low shrieking.

1028
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,820
It was the torture organ, so he could get the shrieks to be music.

1029
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,780
And it did have a funny mouth, too, that it spat out.

1030
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,720
That it spat out nails or something.

1031
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,360
That I didn't see.

1032
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,780
No, we're talking about the Sultan of Turkey, I believe, back in the 18th century.

1033
00:47:59,060 --> 00:47:59,560
Right.

1034
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,500
He wrote the opera The Torturer's Apprentice.

1035
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,560
And then he performed some of it.

1036
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:13,620
But it's time for the Wisteria opera, for some musical genius to create, to document these things.

1037
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,480
Because they're epic.

1038
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,740
Even though we still haven't worked out all the bugs to get the saucers to embark us.

1039
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:33,420
You know what worries me, Dr. Howell, is there's only really two things that have been consistent at every single 7 a.m. on July 5th.

1040
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,220
Bug bites.

1041
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:34,680
No.

1042
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,740
No.

1043
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,060
Everybody stares at Stang.

1044
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:42,540
Well, what has always been there.

1045
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,740
And maybe shouldn't be next year.

1046
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:55,740
Is me or our friend Dr. Dark, who is the only other living subgenius besides myself who is at every single 7 a.m.

1047
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,180
Susie only missed one.

1048
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,580
There are people who've been at almost every one.

1049
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,380
Nikki, I think, only missed one.

1050
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:10,840
But what if Dr. Dark and I stayed in bed.

1051
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,520
And the rest of us.

1052
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,260
And the rest of you went down there and waited for the saucers.

1053
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,080
Maybe that's what we need to do.

1054
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:24,860
I would hate to miss that one time in the year that I have to get up at 6 in the morning and get ready.

1055
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:30,780
But if that's what it takes, I'll stay in bed our next day.

1056
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:37,660
If that's what I have to do to help encourage the saucers to come, I'll do it.

1057
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,800
By God, I'll sacrifice.

1058
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,520
I can help with that project by staying in bed.

1059
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,800
And not showing up to it.

1060
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:47,580
But then we wouldn't get to look into the bedraggled faces of these people.

1061
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,960
Including some at Caffeina's just stayed up all night and never went to bed.

1062
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,100
Some people can do that.

1063
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,540
Some people actually believed you guys.

1064
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,120
I did several times and look what it's done to me.

1065
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,300
Now I can't do it at all.

1066
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,420
I have to get a good night's sleep.

1067
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,780
And a good breakfast.

1068
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,600
A hearty breakfast, kids.

1069
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,360
People say a man is made out of mud.

1070
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:11,500


1071
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,500
A poor man is made out of muslin bro...

1072
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,680
Did you have the hearty pancake breakfast?

1073
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,220
No.

1074
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,380
We were layabouts and puss-a-beds.

1075
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,480
Suck-a-thumbs.

1076
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,460
But so what?

1077
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:28,800
We had a wonderful gourmet feast spread out for us every morning.

1078
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,260
With fruit and cheese and...

1079
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,360
Not everybody else did.

1080
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,840
Yeah, I know we were feeling guilty because we had things that no one at X Day had.

1081
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,660
Like a working toilet, for example.

1082
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,700
And we had this special...

1083
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,700
What was its occupation?

1084
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,760
What was what's occupation?

1085
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,460
The working toilet.

1086
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:49,400
Oh, it was serving a large and varied clientele.

1087
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:56,360
But it was the only one that worked because there was a little problem with the Santa Port company.

1088
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:00,380
Now that was an aberrant event.

1089
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,780
That won't happen next year.

1090
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,520
You see, they forgot it was a pink national holiday.

1091
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:05,800
Yeah, they actually did.

1092
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,100
They scheduled the honey dipper man to come by on Thursday.

1093
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:17,020
Both sides of the telephone conversation forgetting that Thursday was also known as the 4th of July.

1094
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,600
Well, leave it in the park.

1095
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,780
And so the toilets got high that day and people were in panic.

1096
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,100
Along with everybody else.

1097
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,180
Yeah, well, that was the thing.

1098
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:30,560
Once again, symbolism, talking animals, talking machines, paid toilets that literally are underpaid.

1099
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,740
Animals that can't...

1100
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,520
I'm sorry.

1101
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,360
Animals without backbones.

1102
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,440
Without backbones.

1103
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:37,620
Invertebrates everywhere.

1104
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,080
Animals that rape tourists for sex.

1105
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,080


1106
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,020
For 7 years.

1107
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,300
Including the hibernation period.

1108
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,600
Those bears that everybody complains about.

1109
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:53,260
And then something that Pantiera was talking about a year ago called man-bear-pig.

1110
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,880
Oh, that's from a cartoon.

1111
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,620
There's no such thing as man.

1112
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,100
I'm a man-bear-pig denier.

1113
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:58,600
Oh, really?

1114
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,040
Okay.

1115
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,140
Well, but they were talking about it.

1116
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,360
In fact, they even drew little cartoons of it.

1117
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,380
That's a south park stick.

1118
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,220
Of man-bear-pigs.

1119
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:08,960
Oh.

1120
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,600
There is a man bear pig, but I deny it.

1121
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:19,420
Pantiera drew a picture, which I have, of herself being victimized by this creature.

1122
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,040
With a tear running down her face as it goes up.

1123
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:28,420
They were the actual original autocracy, the original aristocracy of Europe.

1124
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,220
That's the royal bloodline right there, the man bear pig, man bears.

1125
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,760
Well, where do the Yetis fit in?

1126
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:37,220
The Yetis have yet to show their true cultural impact.

1127
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:42,460
They're waiting, I don't know, perhaps waiting in the wings for something at the right time.

1128
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,840
Waiting for humanity to destroy itself?

1129
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,820
They're rather passive. They're not about to man the streets with Yeti signs.

1130
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:59,460
Speaking of man on the street, Ivan Stang didn't let any grass grow under his feet while he was down there.

1131
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:06,400
He actually interviewed people who were standing around waiting for the saucers.

1132
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,080
Waiting for me.

1133
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,040
They say something funny.

1134
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,480
I just turn it around and walk up to them and go,

1135
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,320
Hey, how'd you weather last night? What'd you do?

1136
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,320
Oh, you get all kinds of confessions.

1137
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,860
They instantly look guilty and start telling you all kinds of stuff that you really didn't want to know.

1138
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,360
And why are they telling you?

1139
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,380
Well, because they actually thought the world was going to end the next day.

1140
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,760
And they're just like in the experiments that you do on their minds.

1141
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,400
Experimenting again.

1142
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,000
Well, we've learned a lot for future generations.

1143
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:34,920
That's right.

1144
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,200
The end justifies the means.

1145
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,080
The end justifies the means.

1146
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,680
Your English teacher was wrong.

1147
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,660
The end does, in fact, justify the means.

1148
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,860
Yes, if we've learned any one thing.

1149
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,840
If you're a subgenius.

1150
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,040
That's right.

1151
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,800
The laws don't apply to us.

1152
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,080
They're good laws.

1153
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:51,960
They just don't apply to us.

1154
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,460
Why should we obey society's foolish, constricting laws and morals?

1155
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,000
Ours is a high and lonely destiny.

1156
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,200
As if that made it all right.

1157
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,460
Ours is a high and lonely destiny.

1158
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,420
Yeah, I've got a lonely destiny.

1159
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,200
I have to eat all the time.

1160
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,260
My doctor says so.

1161
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:15,980
But if you want to discriminate against those of us with a high and lonely destiny,

1162
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,640
well, you're obviously just not a very evolved person.

1163
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,740
You're speaking about high bowels and low bowels.

1164
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,300
I thought for a second that you had the interocitor machine with you that makes that sound.

1165
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:26,800
No, I don't.

1166
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,840
I was wondering if this was some sort of lunchbox.

1167
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:35,000
But let's not forget about the special fluids stored outside this compartment.

1168
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,120
Ah, but just like...

1169
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:37,960
Radio Valencia.

1170
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:43,520
We must not get caught bringing food into the studio.

1171
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:47,540
My dear sir, everyone violates that rule at Radio Valencia.

1172
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:54,260
It's the other radio station that actually has literal eyeballs bulging out of the walls that watch everything you do.

1173
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:54,800
That's right.

1174
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,960
If WCSB was a real station, we'd have spy cameras all over like that.

1175
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,700
Cameras that resemble eyeballs with an iris and a pupil.

1176
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,660
And they're everywhere.

1177
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,720
You can't get away with anything.

1178
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:06,860
And...

1179
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:07,140
And...

1180
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,760
And Osama Hussein Obama is watching you through them eyeballs now.

1181
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,420
Are we going to blame this on him, too?

1182
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,340
I don't think it's his fault.

1183
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:17,020
Alcoholics laying on the chairs in the lounge...

1184
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,140
No, that's all done.

1185
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,840
...and people would argue about whose beer was whose.

1186
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,900
No, alcoholics get to lie on chairs in the lounge.

1187
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,340
There isn't even a lounge anymore.

1188
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,820
...a sneaky spot in the hallway where nobody would see and smoke your damn cigarette.

1189
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,640
No one cared.

1190
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:37,120
Years ago, it used to be a Berkeley hippie radio station, and you wouldn't know who was camping out there with bedrolls.

1191
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:37,760
And so on.

1192
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,540
People used to sack out in the music room and leave drinks...

1193
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,260
The air was thick with cannabis smoke.

1194
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,760
And the sickly sweet aroma of LSD.

1195
00:55:47,760 --> 00:56:00,040
I remember nights in the old WCSB studio before 9-11 when you could just break all the rules with impunity on the air, brag about it.

1196
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,460
Not leave it there.

1197
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,320
Yeah, frag them if they can't take a joke.

1198
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,220
...on the couches were so large.

1199
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,560
Oh, the couches were...

1200
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,340
...the entire lounge.

1201
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,280
...so dark, downy, and soft.

1202
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,660
They were just physically, inordinately large.

1203
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,560
You'd try to move them to maybe turn on a monitor or something like that.

1204
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:21,660
There'd be a huge arm all over the desk and stuff next to them.

1205
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,280
An armrest which you had to arm wrestle with.

1206
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,380
Oh, oh, oh, I'm speaking for radio stations.

1207
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,220
Speaking for radio stations?

1208
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,020
Yes, sir.

1209
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,160
It's time to do that station ID thing, right?

1210
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,200
We're going to comply with all the rules.

1211
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,880
You're listening to Insert Station Name Here.

1212
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:41,780
Excellent.

1213
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,040
So, see, now I've got aversion for the Internet.

1214
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,000
There you go.

1215
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,980
I always feel aversion to the Internet.

1216
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,040
Me too.

1217
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:54,080
Well, as Onan said, humans are the Internet's way of making more Internet.

1218
00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:00,240
By George, Onan was not physically present, but he sure appeared at X-Day in more ways than one.

1219
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,140
Well, he, as my speech writer...

1220
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:06,260
Yes, he wrote a Stang rant, which...

1221
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,580
It was a...

1222
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,340
I know, you can go ahead and say it.

1223
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,700
It was the best rant I ever did.

1224
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,140
And now I have to consult a dentist.

1225
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,320
But it was a great rant, yeah.

1226
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,040
Typically great, actually.

1227
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:25,460
Well, we have to remind everyone of the sad truth that Stang is no longer capable of writing his own stuff.

1228
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,960
And it's not a psychological or mental thing.

1229
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,520
He still hasn't lost his luster as a great writer and a beautiful talent.

1230
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,140
It's the fact that...

1231
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,280
I chewed my fingers down.

1232
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:36,880
To the bone.

1233
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,800
Yes, I got too agitated one night.

1234
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,500
Too much of that white knuckle entertainment.

1235
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,720
I ate my own...

1236
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:49,680
Actually, you know, my knuckles have tooth marks on them because of the girls of X-Day.

1237
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,680
You and Fat Mandy, but those are her own tooth marks.

1238
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,140
The women were biting their knuckles, man.

1239
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,600
They bit you on the hand?

1240
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,220
They just blew kisses to me.

1241
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:05,320
When I'm sexually excited but frustrated in my urges...

1242
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:05,620
Oh.

1243
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,400
Some of us...

1244
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,220
By our knuckles.

1245
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,680
I get it.

1246
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,300
Say no more.

1247
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:10,980
Say no more.

1248
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,240
No, I say no more.

1249
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:12,720
Say no more.

1250
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,540
So as to keep oneself from doing something bad.

1251
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:16,840
It's very adequate.

1252
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,040
And according to the station manager friends, we need to take a break.

1253
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,440
Yes, we're going to be fired.

1254
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,680
So please stay tuned.

1255
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,580
Oh, that means we have to put on something else besides us.

1256
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:29,080
I wasn't prepared.

1257
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,120
Take that owl record off.

1258
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:30,860
Oh, there's animal noises.

1259
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,840
The two-headed jackal musical.

1260
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,820
We will now play the jackals of the Serengeti.

1261
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,700
Serengeti playing.

1262
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,560
There's the two-headed jackals.

1263
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,480
We're getting ready.

1264
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:47,180
We leave you with the jaundiced jackalopes of the Nevada Basin.

1265
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:47,980
And good night.

1266
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,680
I've been waiting for our friends to come

1267
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,320
Like spiders that roam street before

1268
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,740
I've heard you out there for a visit to Cards

1269
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:03,620
But we've won Jimmy and Lucy Balls

1270
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,560
And now the moment you've been waiting for

1271
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:15,480
The aliens are about to materialize before your eyes

1272
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,340
They came to us from a far distant planet

1273
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:22,160
And now here they are in our midst

1274
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:27,840
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry

1275
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,900
