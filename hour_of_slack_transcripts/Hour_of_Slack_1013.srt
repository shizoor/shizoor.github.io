00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
From PR News in Washington, I'm kicking and screaming for golf outings.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:11,180
Inscreations, children cry, troops fines, growing dissent against President Bush's no-child law.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,580
One man says it's about time.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,720
Security police prison arrested, detained, on our king clerics, tribal suicide kidnappings.

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,320
Taking a look at figures on Wall Street, 2, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,340
This is PR.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:32,400
Inside a courtroom in Wichita, Kansas, protesting Jewish settlers took turns lashing out at PR News, Washington.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,080
Let's go to the Gigolo Club over in Yancey.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,500
They've got a...

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,100
Some genius, powerful, smart.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,400
I say this calls for action, and now, nip it in the bud.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,420
Ah, shut up.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,600
Here it is, kids.

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,760
Are you tired of being a square? Are you tired of a dull, dull, dull existence?

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,460
Well, for one dollar.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,280
The tenth pot of a sawbuck.

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,720
Try kelp's cool tonic.

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,300
The life of the party.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,160
He's right, kids. It's a gasser.

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,240
Step right up, folks. Be somebody. Be anybody.

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,140
Only trouble was, nobody got killed.

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,320
No, Mr. Boob, that's me.

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,560
B-double-O-B, Boob.

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,520
The reason for this hearing is to promote outrageous filth.

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,120
Pornography. It's outrageous filth.

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,240
So I'll be looking.

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey!

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,840
Weaver!

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,140
Starring Barbara the Weaver.

30
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,000
Something has just come up.

31
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,120
Oh, boy.

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,020
Ooh, get a kiss?

33
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,600
Sure.

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,340
Watch.

35
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,320
Hey, the ass is...

36
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,920
Oh, a little squircums.

37
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,160
To the dog.

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,960
And a squircum.

39
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,220
Yeah!

40
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,580
Oh, squircum fun.

41
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah.

42
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,600
Mom?

43
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,460
Oh.

44
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,440
Get over here.

45
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,520
Get over here.

46
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:54,900
Mom?

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,940
He's a local boy.

48
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,560
Uh, he's just terrific.

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,060
He's our new leader.

50
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,640
Leader?

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,380
He's like too much.

52
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,520
Like too much what?

53
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,640
He's one of the truly great swingers of all time.

54
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,840
We now present Bob, internationally known founder of Bob University.

55
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,860
Sitting down down down rising.

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,100
Up up up up.

57
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,700
You know, Filipino boy.

58
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,860
I always... I knew it. He's nice fella.

59
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,360
I had another talk with a young fella yesterday.

60
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,420
And... I knew it. He's nice fella. I had another talk with a young fella yesterday.

61
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,320
And as I probed him, I found out he could have, uh, fooled me.

62
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,380
He didn't know.

63
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,920
It's hard probing that and you get to pull things out.

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,940
Strange about people.

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,780
And, uh, you can think things.

66
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:45,740
Did you know it's the hardest thing in the world for a man in analyzing his own impulses to know what Filipino boy wants him to do?

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,860
Do the dang job.

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,760
Do the dang job.

69
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,980
Never leave it unfinished.

70
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,900
Don't walk out and leave an unfinished job.

71
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,800
Then...

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:52,980
Job.

73
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,380
And then, you know, I've learned a few other little things too.

74
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,520
You did his hard-on, Bob.

75
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,140
What?

76
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,860
Sounds good, doesn't it?

77
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,600
If you'll pay me a thousand dollars more, I'll be glad to come.

78
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,120
You know, a little chill went up and down my back.

79
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,740
Wait a minute.

80
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,540
You have just heard Bob, internationally known founder of Bob University.

81
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,100
This program is sponsored by Bob.

82
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,360
The history of sexuality is as long as the history of man.

83
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,960
From the glory that once was grown, sexuality has been both despised and idolized.

84
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,820
Though nothing new, sexuality is having an upsurge since the war.

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,900
Whether it is an actual increase or merely an increased public acceptance is a point to be argued.

86
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,400
One male out of six is sexual.

87
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,420
Sexuals no longer hide in shadows, giving secret signals of recognition to each other.

88
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:52,120
But rather, they have joined together into groups or clubs in an attempt to seek freedom.

89
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,920
Hopefully we'll be seeing you again soon.

90
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,020
Tear down, and the other job is done.

91
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,460
In the valley of Moab.

92
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,220
here is the prohibition of sex.

93
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,540
In the valley of Moab.

94
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,120
The Moabites.

95
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,100
The Moabites themselves.

96
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,900
Get out.

97
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,380
Get Moab out of your mouth, boy.

98
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,580
We got some lambs to slaughter here.

99
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,080
First you whip your dictionary out.

100
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,060
Then you put your Moab in your mouth.

101
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,860
Put your Moab on it.

102
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,100
Come on.

103
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,780
Then you put those lambs on the altar.

104
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,000
You just slit them a little bit right there underneath the throat.

105
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,660
It's kind of nick them.

106
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:36,760
It's nicking.

107
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,280
Or the blood.

108
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,980
It's sticking in the nick.

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,860
The bit of nick comes out.

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,280
The blood starts flowing down that glycine.

111
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,400
It's blood.

112
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,540
The blood.

113
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,840
But it's the blood that cleanses.

114
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,480
It's the blood that makes things right.

115
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,160
It's the blood that provides the ultimate salvation to which you've attached yourself.

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,080
All these years.

117
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,800
It's the blood that we make that special antidote for you.

118
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,120
You know, those bats that get on your face.

119
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,540
You know what they do to your face.

120
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,100
Special bats.

121
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,440
Put your dictionary away now, children, and we'll tell you about the bats.

122
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,680
That book is kind of heavy.

123
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,160
It's a heavy book.

124
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,040
The frontal cerebral fornicating bat.

125
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,120
And the ejaculate.

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,080
We won't talk about them.

127
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,940
No, we can't.

128
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,220
We can't talk about them.

129
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,140
We can't get too specific about them.

130
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,060
We can't talk about what those bats do.

131
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,980
You may as well just stick your finger in a light socket.

132
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,740
But the Church of the Subgenius provides the only way.

133
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:36,520
It provides the only proscribed and tested by time instructions for de-beaking the prairie squid.

134
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,160
Which is all the practices that you'll need, children.

135
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,880
Yeah, I talked to my step-neighbor-in-law.

136
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,500
By those bats.

137
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,600
Porky was telling me that story one time about Moab.

138
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,140
And he was, well, I hate to say it.

139
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,340
I hate to tell you this.

140
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,320
But Porky didn't say no.

141
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,180
He forgot to say no.

142
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,700
So he was not in the state of mind he might have been in other lives.

143
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,960
He had launched ahead in years.

144
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,040
He had launched ahead in oh Lord knows how long.

145
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,380
He'd never been in a doctor van.

146
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,900
Yeah, he never realized the glories of the doctors and the priests and the bats.

147
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,760
Accordingly.

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,460
He'd never.

149
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,380
His own.

150
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:17,940
Ever.

151
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,480
Boy, that's a little doggy.

152
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,140
Quick on that.

153
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,040
Oh, sorry.

154
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,160
I knew who was coming down tonight.

155
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,460
Well.

156
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,220
Well, that was Willa Dobbs, friends.

157
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,860
A guest hosting on an ancient subgenius radio show.

158
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:42,320
With Dr. Philo Drummond and Pope Sternodocs Kee Kaver as guest stars.

159
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,380
That was on an hour of slack back in the 80s.

160
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,300
I wasn't even there for that show.

161
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,160
Heck, I'm not even here for this show.

162
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,140
Which is number 1,000.

163
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,180
1013.

164
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,140
1013.

165
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,780
Well, that spells ayob.

166
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,900
Anyway, this is a sexy episode.

167
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,780
If only because I've been tossing sexish audio files into this one folder until it

168
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,140
equaled 600 megabytes which equals one show.

169
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,780
One sinful show.

170
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:20,260
And we'll be hearing more Bobulous collages from Mr. Fernand and Andy Lemur, from Reverend

171
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,100
Norrell Preff.

172
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,240
All kinds of devos.

173
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,000
And more Philo and Sternodocs.

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And this background music here is by Lemur Devotee.

175
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,960
So listen up and you'll find slack.

176
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,080
Or else you'll learn what it is or who it is that you need to get slack.

177
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,780
Imagine me needing someone.

178
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,280
Back on Earth I never did.

179
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,640
Oh, there were women.

180
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,440
Lots of women.

181
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,660
Lots of love making.

182
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,720
But no love.

183
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:49,740
Oh.

184
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
That was the kind of world we'd made.

185
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,300
So I left.

186
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,340
Because there was no one to hold me there.

187
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,540
Did I tell you about Stewart?

188
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,360
Now there was a lovely girl.

189
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,340
The most precious cargo we brought along.

190
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,620
She was to be the new Eve.

191
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,660
With our hot and eager help of course.

192
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,180
I can accommodate either sex and any combination of people.

193
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,060
I'm also programmed with all the appropriate sexual expletives.

194
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,400
A large catalog of moans, groans, howls, squeals, grunts and purrs.

195
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,380
Really?

196
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,560
I'm not programmed for disinformation or lying.

197
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,620
What else can you do?

198
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:42,120
I also have a number of pleasure features, including three vibration stimulators placed strategically in the oral, anal and vaginal orifices.

199
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,400
My nipples are programmed to harden under manual or oral stimulation.

200
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,800
I salivate, secrete and spurt appropriately.

201
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,720
An android for all seasons, huh?

202
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,620
And there's a beautiful girl.

203
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,140
And there's a beautiful girl holding a paintbrush.

204
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,940
And there's a beautiful girl holding a ticket.

205
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,580
High boots, hipster miniskirt.

206
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,480
Brief.

207
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,600
Very brief.

208
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,980
She's neat.

209
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,400
Petite.

210
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,380
Swinging gaze.

211
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,700
Fear.

212
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,180
Wild.

213
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,260
Long.

214
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,240
Long.

215
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,100
Straight.

216
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,600
Couldn't be much bigger.

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,520
The big sex pact.

218
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,140
And there's a beautiful girl all over it.

219
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,700
There.

220
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,760
It's creamy.

221
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,080
Looks like she's ready for a happening.

222
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,280
I'm a lesbian.

223
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,420
The sociologist says I'm a self-absorbed narcissist.

224
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,940
One troubled individual.

225
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,420
Willing to destroy any institution.

226
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,360
The destruction of human life.

227
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,480
Put that down.

228
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,960
Don't you feel that I'm a lesbian?

229
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:03,880
Don't you feel it rather interesting that every time you have a story about terrorism it is linked to Christian extremists.

230
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,860
Christian extremists teach us violence.

231
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,760
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

232
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,380
Osama Bin Laden is their great hero.

233
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:12,980
Yes.

234
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,980
Christian extremists blew up trains. Christian extremists assassinated film producers.

235
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,020
Christian extremists blew up a crowded shopping center.

236
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,100
And the Christian extremists, it's always Christian extremists.

237
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,040
And it's time we recognize it and begin to deal with it.

238
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,820
I'm a lesbian.

239
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,720
Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!

240
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:52,980
Fornication, sodomy, fellatio and cunnilingus, unbridled concupiscence on every street corner.

241
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,020
Lord sir, you make me quite nervous.

242
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,960
Indeed, ma'am, it is not so bad as that.

243
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,620
Indeed it is, sir. I wouldn't venture nearer the Capitol than Litchfield.

244
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,560
Buggery, incest, bestiality.

245
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,960
And it was a splendid day.

246
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,040
I believe the buggery took place in the conservatory.

247
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,440
Or was it the laboratory?

248
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,260
It was an extraordinary buggery!

249
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,240
The way they took place back there in the lavatory?

250
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,400
It wasn't in the lavatory. I thought it was in the conservatory.

251
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,200
But that buggery was the most extraordinary buggery I'd ever experienced.

252
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,960
They scoffed. Oh, they scoffed!

253
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,280
It was a...

254
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,660
Oh boy, little did they know.

255
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,260
I believe it was in the aviary.

256
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,620
I've got pictures.

257
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:42,960
I've got pictures.

258
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,160
I've got pictures of it.

259
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,580
It was a conspiratorial buggery, which was brought about by lack of faith in Bob Children.

260
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,260
The

261
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,520
The

262
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:55,520


263
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,080
The

264
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,040
Rel Zacconico

265
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,340
The Rel Zacconico

266
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,140
Theams

267
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,480
Therem

268
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,740
Therem

269
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,020
I really do.

270
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,140
I really do.

271
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,660
I really do.

272
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,080
I really do.

273
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,320
I really do.

274
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,520
When a man

275
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,860
loves a ticket

276
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,080
he can't

277
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,280
keep his mind on nothing else.

278
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,740
He'll stay in the barn

279
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,320
for the good

280
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,680
thing he's found.

281
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,860
In his

282
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,060
inside he can't

283
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,760
see it.

284
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,700
She can't do

285
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,640
no wrong.

286
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,020
Rose Arlen Red is his best

287
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,820
friend. He can't put her

288
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,360
down.

289
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,440
When a man

290
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,300
wants a ticket

291
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,620
he

292
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,360
can't

293
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,600
stay

294
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,860
behind

295
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,420
to

296
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,280
count on

297
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,400
the

298
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,880
lights.

299
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,840
Rose Arlen Red

300
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:41,840


301
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:41,840


302
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:41,840


303
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:41,840


304
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,080
his mind

305
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,900
on nothing

306
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,980
She lays them on the eggs she had

307
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,780
Tells the farmer there's nothing going on

308
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,580
Believe me, she's cocky just cause she said

309
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,200
When a man loves a chicken

310
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,620
People think that it is wrong

311
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,100
Shouldn't stick his beak in where it don't belong

312
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,180
Just when a man loves a chicken

313
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,560
I know exactly how it feels

314
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,500
Hey baby, baby, baby

315
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,220
I'm your cocky doo-doo

316
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,100
When a man loves a chicken

317
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,400
I know exactly how it feels

318
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,800
He shacks up into his house

319
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,520
With the good things he's found

320
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,140
When a man loves a chicken

321
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,000
People think that he's insane

322
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,700
But all he can do is wing it

323
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,020
For the one he loves

324
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,900
Just when a man loves a chicken

325
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,140
He's got a good reason to be a chicken

326
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,920
He's got a good reason to be a chicken

327
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,460
He's got a good reason to be a chicken

328
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:17,460


329
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,460
In the morning, I would immediately get annoyed.

330
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,820
I'd just think, roosters, you know.

331
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,800
Why do I have to even think about roosters?

332
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,620
I'm already, it's, I just got up and already I'm thinking about roosters.

333
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,100
I don't want to think about roosters.

334
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,100
You may be angry.

335
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,640
What's the matter, Colonel Sanders?

336
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:37,920
Chicken?

337
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,500
I found a way to cook chicken deep down.

338
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,660
And get that crispy, real crispy chicken crust.

339
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,640
Yet it's entirely different.

340
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,420
No, no, no.

341
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,600
That real crusty, real what kind of damn?

342
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,380
Crispy crust.

343
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,040
Crispy crust.

344
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,060
You don't want me to sing, do you, for Christ's sake?

345
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,280
I'm not getting anywhere with this damn thing.

346
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay, fine.

347
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,900
I hated the colonel with his wee beady eyes.

348
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,320
And that smug look on his face.

349
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,480
Oh, you're gonna buy my chicken.

350
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,040
Oh.

351
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,380
Oh.

352
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:10,980
Oh.

353
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,200
Oh.

354
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,540
Oh.

355
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,020
Oh.

356
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,800
In the face.

357
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,440
...

358
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,740
But this reminds me of a porno movie I saw in the 70s.

359
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,340
Yeah, that's where we got the...

360
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,820
It sounds like that poignant, heart-rending story

361
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,280
of the woman with the world's largest breasts

362
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,240
who meets the man with the longest dick.

363
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,860
It was so tragic,

364
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,280
I could barely make myself watch the whole thing.

365
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,120
So sad, so fresh, the days that are new.

366
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,340
They were just such parodies of human things.

367
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,820
Of exuberance, of life and life efforts.

368
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,360
I'm not kidding you, his dick was like this long.

369
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,400
It's just way beyond normal.

370
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,920
It's incredible what they can do with special effects these days.

371
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,780
I walk down the block

372
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,000
and I see walking towards me

373
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,480
a beautiful young lady.

374
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,700
And the closer she gets to me,

375
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,280
the older she starts to look

376
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,180
and the closer she gets to me,

377
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,920
the more virtues she leaves behind

378
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,680
and the closer she gets to me,

379
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,700
the further she ventures from her youthful past

380
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,180
and the closer she gets to me,

381
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,240
the closer she gets to her own death

382
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
and mine!

383
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,880
And I see it!

384
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,060
And I pity her for the things that I know.

385
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,840
Personally.

386
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,060
And I pity myself for the times when I didn't think fast.

387
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,700
And I pity her more for the humdrum thing she is wearing.

388
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,080
And I smile as she sniffes when she realizes I am staring.

389
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,180
And I feel so ashamed for the arrogant way that I scrutinize.

390
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,180
I can tell her that I am not alone.

391
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,180


392
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,180


393
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,920
I can tell her that she is my age.

394
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,660
And the further she gets from me,

395
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,600
she lessens her chances of becoming my bride.

396
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,140
And the further she gets from me,

397
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,380
the more I love her.

398
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,800
All kidding aside,

399
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,600
and the further she gets from me,

400
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,280
the further I am taken back

401
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,780
to the days of my sister's friends in high school.

402
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,940
And the further I get from my sister,

403
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:20,940


404
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,040
And the further I get from her,

405
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,040


406
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,140
And the further I get from her,

407
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,140


408
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:29,380
The closer she gets by a band called The Billy Nayer Show.

409
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,220
Nayer is spelled N-A-Y-E-R

410
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,740
because there's a billynayer.com.

411
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,720
Reverend Magdalene turned us on to them.

412
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
They did this incredible movie called,

413
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,620
called The American Astronaut, which just came out on DVD.

414
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:55,860
And all I can say is, yeah, it's BillyNayer.com.

415
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,580
You'll be hearing more from all of that on Hour of Slack.

416
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,200
Husband, is that you? Where are you all at?

417
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,560
Good evening to you, madam. Would you care to join us?

418
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,640
You get no joy from him.

419
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,540
I loved her dearly once.

420
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,260
But she's a whore.

421
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,960
Not by necessity of a bank commission.

422
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,300
Well, she owns 51% of the bank's stock, for Pete's sake.

423
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,780
Don't tell me your wife believes all that Luther Hegg's hogwash.

424
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,000
With all her heart, she came home last night and vibrated for an hour.

425
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,680
The father of that little girl, she didn't know anything about Bob.

426
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,540
She was begging me to tell her about Bob.

427
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,660
She paid me $20 for one word of Bob.

428
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,100
I gave her a silver-bonded dictionary.

429
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,940
She gave me my first dictionary.

430
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,840
She was only 13 and I was 83.

431
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,360
Now that's time control.

432
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,600
Yeah, back when we went back early, way back in time,

433
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,700
we went back to a couple of amoebas, flipping our flagellas around.

434
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,140
Next thing you know, we're progressing through time.

435
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,920
She ended up in a freezer bag.

436
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,420
If I recall my course of events,

437
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,360
I believe that it was dinner time in Dobbs Town.

438
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,800
Yeah, dinner time.

439
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,300
Wasn't it?

440
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,700
Or maybe supper time.

441
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,100
I don't know.

442
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,340
Supper time in Dobbs Town.

443
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,020
Dinner, supper.

444
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,200
And she'd suffered a serious freezer burn.

445
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,460
And it was all because of her lack of faith in Bob.

446
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,740
She wouldn't put her soul, after brunch, in Bob's hands.

447
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,960
She couldn't bring herself home.

448
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,400
She couldn't bring herself home.

449
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,400


450
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,140
She couldn't face the facts.

451
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,520
Then after lunch, we have lupper,

452
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,700
which is kind of like a brunch between dinner and supper.

453
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,060
She had problems with a bit of the genius dogma.

454
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,980
She had problems with slack.

455
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,280
And sinner is not the sinner you would think of.

456
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,260
It's actually a meal that we have between dinner and supper.

457
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,800
Sinner on rise.

458
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,480
Supper.

459
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,040
Sinner on rise.

460
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:03,880
Puffer.

461
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,440
At night, late at night, we have puffer.

462
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,540
And then we sin.

463
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,600
We just sit there and sin.

464
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,520
That's all we do.

465
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,040
We don't have to do anything.

466
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,780
For the Church of the Subgenius, we think sin.

467
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,460
It doesn't want to eradicate sin.

468
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,180
It's not because we want to.

469
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,180
It's not because we want to.

470
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,580
It's because we have to.

471
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,760
The Church of the Subgenius have to.

472
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,300
Because we have to bear that sinful burden of mankind.

473
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,200
Justifies sin.

474
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,680
Of the normals, the pinks.

475
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,280
You know, they're sinning all the time.

476
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,560
It's their sins that we kind of ride on like the luck plane.

477
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,220
Like a wave in the luck plane.

478
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,540
Riding like cosmic surfers.

479
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:38,840
Ah.

480
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,120
Looking at the words and the ways of Britney Spears.

481
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,540
A religious leader.

482
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,360
The way she's used her body.

483
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,140
Offers us sexuality all the time.

484
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,560
Gee.

485
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,880
But you know what?

486
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,700
Britney Spears flaunts her sexuality in all of its forms.

487
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,280
Now, what do you say?

488
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,180
An adulteress!

489
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,500
Is it right to kill her?

490
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,320
Go now.

491
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,360
I am so quick.

492
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,560
I'm so quick.

493
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,000
Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop.

494
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,960
All over the ground.

495
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,060
Creates another feeling in me, perhaps.

496
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,780
And also, perhaps in you.

497
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,000
And that is a feeling of enormous awe.

498
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,760
Awe.

499
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,320
Awe.

500
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,500
Enormous awe.

501
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,520
Enormous awe.

502
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,000
Awe.

503
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,280
Awe.

504
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,280
Britney Spears.

505
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,680
She flaunted her body in ways that creates another feeling in me.

506
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:28,140
You know and I know Britney Spears kissed Madonna, another woman, on live television.

507
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,180
Her body.

508
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,640
Throw her down as a tool.

509
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,360
Come on silk sheets.

510
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,240
Illicit sexuality.

511
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,400
Over here.

512
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,640
Here.

513
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,900
Caught in the act.

514
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,020
Britney Spears bent two feelings in me.

515
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Two feelings in you.

516
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,820
Fool for Britney Spears today.

517
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,920
I was praying last night.

518
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,240
When an angel broke the light.

519
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,920
He said, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for a time.

520
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,220
I said, hold like hell.

521
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,480
Let me talk to the boss.

522
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,380
He said, sorry, slow down.

523
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,120
Sinner, it's the boss's day off.

524
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,380
And I realized this.

525
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:13,200
That the wages of sin was two bucks an hour and working weekend.

526
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,640
I was ignoring the fee.

527
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:22,320
He was lashed to the cross and cried, help me get this son of a bitch off.

528
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,940
I said I would if I could.

529
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,280
I can't so I won't.

530
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,880
Well I wouldn't want you messing your hair up so don't.

531
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,140
And I realized then.

532
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,480
That the wages of sin.

533
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,880
Was all the lumber you can carry.

534
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,980
All the nails you can bend.

535
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,280
The wages of sin.

536
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,640
The reward of fear.

537
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,360
It's worrying and threatening every second of the year.

538
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,540
And heaven is guilt.

539
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,760
No sex and no show.

540
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,420
That I'm not sure if I really wanna go.

541
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,680
Oh.

542
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,040
Oh.

543
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,280
Just the waiting.

544
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,260
экспaire accordion

545
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,260


546
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,680
You've been taught to ask.

547
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,120
Those three snares

548
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,120


549
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,400
Every second of the day

550
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,700
The church and the state

551
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,080
You've got a country kind

552
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,320
One gets your body

553
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,780
The other gets your mind

554
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,500
Mary, Mary Magdalene

555
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,220
How about a date?

556
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,460
You've been wasting your time

557
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,760
Staying up so late

558
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,820
Your boyfriend's dead

559
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,560
The word is you're a whore

560
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,040
Just about then I heard a knock on the door

561
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,360
And I realized then

562
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,620
That the wages of sin

563
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,700
Was a bad reputation

564
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,240
And too many friends

565
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,600
The wages of sin

566
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,200
The wages of sin

567
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,780
The wages of sin

568
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,380
The wages of sin

569
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,940
The wages of sin

570
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,600
The wages of sin

571
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,180
The wages of sin

572
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,840
The wages of sin

573
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,360
The wages of sin

574
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,580
The wages of sin

575
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,940
The wages of sin

576
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,520
The wages of sin

577
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,940
The Rainmakers, Wages of Sin.

578
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,520
The Rainmakers, Wages of Sin.

579
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:26,780
The Rainmakers, Wages of Sin.

580
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:32,940
Friends, we also heard some Philo Drummond and Sterno Kekever,

581
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,640
Pope Sterno Docs, and some clips via Jacques Pate,

582
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,100
and great cutting by Noral Preff and Fernand and Andy Lemur.

583
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,600
More of that coming up, and also coming up, Nicky Death Chick.

584
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,620
It is written that man does not live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,

585
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,560
but by bread alone.

586
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,520
We invite you to study the scriptures,

587
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,400
with us to learn about bread alone.

588
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,760
We would like to hear from you, and we pray in the name of bread alone.

589
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,880
Thank you for listening to this message.

590
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,840
There I am.

591
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,400
Thanks again, and may the love of bread alone

592
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,800
abide in you and yours forever and ever.

593
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,480
Amen.

594
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,540
Oh, you are healed.

595
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,780
Go forth and sin again.

596
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,760
Oh, yes, I think I've had quite enough healing tonight.

597
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,580
Every one of you, you must remember that the conspiracy guilt demons inhabit your ass.

598
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,760
And if you can't get me to sin,

599
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,420
spank you, you can always pay someone else to do it.

600
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,420
Thank you very much.

601
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,640
Reverend Nicky Death Chick.

602
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,940
I heard that you were feeling ill.

603
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,320
Headache, fever, and a chill.

604
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,860
I came to help restore your pluck,

605
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,880
cause I'm the nurse who likes to...

606
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,080
Stage two.

607
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,120
Warm liquid goo phase beginning.

608
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,580
Warm liquid goo phase complete.

609
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,440
Stage three.

610
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,740
Sir, sir, I pulled the trigger.

611
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,180
Fire away, my dear.

612
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,540
Oh!

613
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,740
Oh!

614
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,620
Oh!

615
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,780
Oh!

616
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,220
Hello, I'm Hurley Mann, and I wrote a book called...

617
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,760
Cleavage and Swords.

618
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,980
Joy for everybody.

619
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,640
Cleavage and Swords.

620
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,680
Admire her character.

621
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,580
Even if she doesn't have any.

622
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,720
Admire her...

623
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,100
Cleavage.

624
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,760
You like the way she handles her...

625
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,100
Cleavage.

626
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,160
Cave man.

627
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,620
Act confident.

628
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,220
Cleavage.

629
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,600
Even if you aren't.

630
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,440
What was his name?

631
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,000
You mean the one you couldn't get to...

632
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,180
This is the second time that you've laid hands on me.

633
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it.

634
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,460
I was sure that he would ravish you.

635
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,780
But he was not long enough with you to complete a full ravishment.

636
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,180
But I'll warrant he offered you some gross indecencies, am I right?

637
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,060
No, indeed, sir.

638
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,000
He was most genteel.

639
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:15,660
Showed you his virile member, forced you to touch and play with it on pain of death and so forth in the usual way.

640
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,220
No doubt.

641
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,520
No, I assure you.

642
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,540
Nothing of the kind.

643
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:19,780
Strange.

644
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,100
Strange.

645
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,780
Strange.

646
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,140
I heard only the other day of three...

647
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,400
Ladies in a coach who were subjected to the most unspeakable indignities.

648
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,720
The first offender...

649
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,000
Please.

650
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,440
I am not well.

651
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,180
Come on.

652
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,680
Well, love takes a backseat to life

653
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,340
When a man runs away from his wife

654
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,660
That's when you know he's dead

655
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:55,660


656
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,740
That's when you know he's in the world

657
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,260
When a guy tries to run up his mate

658
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,800
But she's gone and it's getting late

659
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,340
That's when you know he lost his girl

660
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,600
So it happens all the time

661
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Don't get low, just stand in line

662
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,200
Take your turn, now make your move

663
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,280
Take your turn, now make your move

664
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,860
And crush that dog

665
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,460
With a ton of love

666
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:44,460
When a woman takes a backseat to man

667
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,200
She has to tell him where to go if she can

668
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,660
And she decides to wear his ring

669
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,640
So it happens all the time

670
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,320
Don't get low, just stand in line

671
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,540
Take your turn, now make your move

672
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,140
And crush that dog

673
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,900
With a ton of love

674
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,360
Times a girl with the face of a clock

675
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,080
Will have to go until you can't stop

676
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,460
She comes from above with a ton of love

677
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,080
With a ton of love

678
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,500
As if you didn't know, that was Devo from the old days.

679
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,800
And you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

680
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,540
At the age of 12, I received my first scribe.

681
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,280
At the age of 14, as a roastery named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles.

682
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,360
There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum.

683
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,680
It's breathtaking. I suggest you try it.

684
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,320
You know, we have to stop.

685
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,440
Say, did you see the skid marks out here?

686
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,100
They go at a direct right angle to the direction of travel.

687
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,820
And let the record show that Mr. Hank Hill really knows his pornography.

688
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,580
Thank you, Your Honor.

689
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,520
I shall be sorry to see you swing, I shall.

690
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,740
I miss you, Mo.

691
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,940
Oh, the chaplain sends his apologies.

692
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,820
He was going to come and pray for you, but he's been took up himself.

693
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,960
Robbing the collection and buggering the altar boys.

694
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,140
Well, every man to his taste.

695
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,580
Oh yes, Lord, make it hard, Lord.

696
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,260
You and I come together.

697
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,400
Right now, right now.

698
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,060
Right now.

699
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


700
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


701
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


702
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


703
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


704
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


705
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


706
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


707
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


708
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


709
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


710
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


711
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,060


712
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,800
Oh, oh, oh, have a life.

713
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,540
Now listen to this.

714
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,640
Change your thinking.

715
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,180
Come.

716
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,320
Begin to come.

717
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:00,760
Come.

718
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,260
Done.

719
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,160
Blood on the doorpost.

720
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,780
Eat that all night.

721
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,520
Bondage and feeble premature.

722
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,940
Follow me.

723
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,220
I'm the head behind.

724
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,820
I'm going to tell and I will.

725
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,720
Now listen close.

726
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,360
Take it.

727
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,700
Number one, let me tell you something.

728
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,180
Heaven.

729
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:15,820
Member.

730
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,060
My dear member.

731
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,880
Stop it.

732
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,800
I don't know.

733
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,760
We are as.

734
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,600
We are what we think we are.

735
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,140
You are what you think you are.

736
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,140
Stop it.

737
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,660
And let me tell you something right now.

738
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,220
There's nothing wrong with one.

739
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,500
My dear member.

740
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,160
For what you tasted.

741
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,520
My dear member.

742
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,920
Now listen close.

743
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,040
Listen to me.

744
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,200
Direction.

745
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,640
Our.

746
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,580
Power.

747
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,500
Hello.

748
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,780
Let me tell you something.

749
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,680
Listen to me.

750
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,360
Bah, bah, bah, bah, ha, shanda.

751
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,840
You realize it's your food.

752
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,240
Even now I am touching you.

753
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,300
My dear member.

754
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,800
Great power.

755
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,880
Great power.

756
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,380
Our.

757
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,400
My dear.

758
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:53,980
Great.

759
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,040
Now let me say something to you again.

760
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,380
I want you to remember.

761
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,280
Cuss a candle and go with the flow.

762
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,020
Number two.

763
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,740
Number two.

764
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,120
Gah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

765
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,800
The power of the tongue.

766
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,440
Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.

767
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,600
I got to get your mouth open.

768
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,580
Hello.

769
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,400
Listen to you.

770
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,520
Listen to me.

771
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,720
I'm talking to you.

772
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,100
I am cannibal.

773
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,320
A cannibal.

774
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,520
Dog.

775
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,280
Monkey.

776
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,700
We become carnal minded.

777
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,020
I found out that secret place.

778
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:27,840
I don't know if I passed out under exhaustion or what in my closet, but I was in there a long time.

779
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,940
I have dick, dick.

780
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,780
It just starts coming out of your mouth.

781
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,920
Get it in your soul.

782
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,700
No!

783
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,920
Get it in your soul.

784
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,260
And then you touch my erection.

785
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,980
Now listen to this.

786
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,180
You've got, let me tell you this one thing.

787
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,880
Be like a tree.

788
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:49,120
You've got, my dear member, natural, brute, almost animal.

789
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,760
The blood pressure goes down.

790
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,860
There it is right there.

791
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,000
There's blood pressure, blood pressure, blood pressure.

792
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
You stabilize.

793
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,140
Put a little bit of oil.

794
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,880
Pour it in again, pour it in again.

795
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,260
All . . .

796
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,140
I, I, I, I . . .

797
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,820
After about an hour of that, I can't forget this.

798
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,000
I can't forget this.

799
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,780
I can't forget.

800
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,980
We'll just use it, it'll grow.

801
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,520
Those devils, those lying devils, they get on television and radio and newspapers, they'd

802
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,060
say all-

803
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,520
Those devils, those lying devils, they get on television and radio and newspapers, they'd

804
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,100
say all-

805
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,860
The devil tried to get me believe the very lies!

806
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,860
The devil tried to get me to believe the very lies!

807
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,240
Ho!

808
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:22,800
Ho!

809
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,560
Favor!

810
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,420
Favor!

811
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,060
Favor!

812
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,500
It grew.

813
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,760
I just can't have it.

814
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,680
Believe it!

815
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,400
Believe it!

816
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,060
Woo-hoo!

817
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,500
What do you want?

818
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,960
What do you want?

819
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,020
What do you want?

820
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,320
What do you want?

821
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,900
Day every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every day, every

822
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,400
day, every day.

823
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:40,800
Oh!

824
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:41,900
Woo-hoo!

825
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,300
Dumb and blind to everything around you.

826
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,200
Are you ready?

827
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,200
I am.

828
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,000
I am.

829
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,740
I am.

830
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,000
I am.

831
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,680
I am.

832
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:51,740
I am.

833
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,620
Pervert.

834
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,420
I am.

835
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,980
The grand wizard of the clue club's claim.

836
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,520
Nonsense.

837
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,620
I'm going to give it to you.

838
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,020
Now listen to this.

839
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,800
I want you to open your mouth.

840
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,620
You need to make a check out for $5,000 and send it in today.

841
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,320
Get some more meat here in this.

842
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,560
Get your mouth open.

843
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,360
Some more meat.

844
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,560
Right out of check today.

845
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,880
Six, six, six.

846
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,800
I'm going to give it to you.

847
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,240
You must win it.

848
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,020
When something's going wrong.

849
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,240
You must win it.

850
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,080
Now whip it.

851
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,760
In the shape.

852
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,280
Shape it up.

853
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,700
Get straight.

854
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,360
Go forward.

855
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,660
Move ahead.

856
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,480
Time to detect it.

857
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,920
It's not too late.

858
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,220
To whip it.

859
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,860
Whip it good.

860
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,920
When a good time comes around.

861
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,220
You must win it.

862
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,920
You will never live it down.

863
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,280
Unless you win it.

864
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,620
No one gets away.

865
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,080
Until they whip it.

866
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,440
I say whip it.

867
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,100
Whip it good.

868
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,340
I say whip it.

869
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,060
Whip it good.

870
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,000
Crack that whip.

871
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,000
Here's the best to slip.

872
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,760
Step on the crack.

873
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,940
Break your mama's back.

874
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,200
When a problem comes along.

875
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,540
You must whip it.

876
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,100
Before the creeps come along.

877
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,560
You must whip it.

878
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,220
When something's going wrong.

879
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,560
You must whip it.

880
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,360
Now whip it.

881
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,020
In the shape.

882
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,580
Shape it up.

883
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,940
Get straight.

884
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,540
Go forward.

885
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,920
Move ahead.

886
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,680
Try to detect it.

887
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,120
It's not too late.

888
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,640
To whip it.

889
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,180
In the shape.

890
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,700
Shape it up.

891
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,020
Get straight.

892
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,580
Go forward.

893
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:27,960
Move ahead.

894
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,800
Try to detect it.

895
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,180
It's not too late.

896
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,440
To whip it.

897
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,040
Whip it good.

898
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,020
Whip it.

899
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,660
Done up by CD Truth.

900
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,400
A great band from nearby here in Cleveland.

901
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,100
And more about them.

902
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,100


903
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,100


904
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,100


905
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,100


906
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,100


907
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,100


908
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,100


909
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,100


910
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,100


911
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,100


912
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,100


913
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,100


914
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:57,340
them at cdtruth.com. That's from the devotional commemorative release, not necessarily beautiful,

915
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:05,560
but mutated. You know, friends, some people over the years have considered our subgenius material

916
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:13,520
offensive. Our religious subgenius material offends some people. Imagine that.

917
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:24,300
What do you think about them wimp subgeniuses on the coast that were upset by the preponderance

918
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:34,040
of protruding blue-veined throbbers in the new Stark filth removal? What do you think about that,

919
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,600
Philo? How about some of the subgeniuses out there on the west coast? They just couldn't deal with

920
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,380
the new Stark filth removal. I mean, what do they got?

921
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,180
What do they got against it? What do they got against those things sticking out everywhere?

922
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,740
Nasty. Is that what they think it's like? Juvenile. But it's something you would do if you were a

923
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:07,380
manly thing. They can't see us or hear us right now. The little faraway subgeniuses still fighting

924
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,340
those old canards.

925
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,580
The best British accent should read that one. We just got this in the mail this week. I think it's interesting.

926
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,140
You have to self-censor yourself.

927
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,260
See, we can't send a signal to where they are. They can still send a signal back to us, though.

928
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:34,020
The latest church magazine is none of it. You can't make any excuses for the rape-fixated fantasies.

929
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:41,020
I can't even read this guy's writing. You try to pass off as a celebration of sexuality.

930
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,420
That's so you.

931
00:41:43,520 --> 00:42:01,500
Human. That's so human. As much as I've enjoyed the subgenius stuff over the years, I don't want to receive any more of your and your contributors grow out of this adolescent arrested sexuality.

932
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,120
Beep. You've lost it. Chris Aton.

933
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,240
Well, Chris, let's just dissect this.

934
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,340
First of all, I want to say we're all missing. We didn't put out that last word.

935
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,620
That's right.

936
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:26,900
That was a blatant attempt of the Citizens for Normalcy or some other underground organization to discredit the church of the subgenius

937
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:33,760
by publishing that filth, that horrible, horrid filth that we will take no credit for whatsoever.

938
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:41,500
Although if we did, we would be gladly aligned with it. We would support it to the fullest degree.

939
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,500
But unfortunately, I can't.

940
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:52,560
I can't take credit. Neither can would Reverend Stang if he was here. It's just a it's an unfortunate thing that they did such a good job of of imitating our style.

941
00:42:53,260 --> 00:43:05,940
But I have to admit now, before we take any more unnecessary heat, although we were trying to pick up the profits as well as we could, which is you would you would you would normally expect that from us.

942
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:12,680
But I have to admit right now, we had nothing, nothing whatsoever to do with a horrible, filthy start.

943
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:24,780
Which was the end of the day.

944
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,380
We had nothing quite such a good afternoon.

945
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,520
We hadn't even had a pandemic, we thought we'd stitch up some work for the phone calls to come in the

946
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:30,520


947
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,560
We're thinking obviously the best way to put it, you know, the worst thing is to use some old American Rubiki on them.

948
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:34,560


949
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:34,700
We have a lot of important details here.

950
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,520
I haven't gotten to this detail, but I think make them look fantastic.

951
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,420
It has won me over the world.

952
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,620
Does that say good news and it's good news.

953
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:43,500


954
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,540
We would have abandoned this immediately.

955
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,740
Okay, you're a shot.

956
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,220
It looks like shot.

957
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,960
He says, you're not stuff.

958
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:56,420
How can you call the primary excommunication with the X's and the word of Bob stuff?

959
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,280
That just relegates it to some type of mundane fecal tissue.

960
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,400
Okay, and then he says, you're stuff.

961
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,200
It cannot be equated.

962
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,380
You're stuff used to be.

963
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:12,240
Now, masters of time control don't even, we don't even need the used to be.

964
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,840
What is this used to be?

965
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:23,580
Masters of time control have no need for such narrowly confining used to be.

966
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,540
Used to be.

967
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,920
Clever, funny, and intelligent.

968
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,840
We've never been clever, funny, or intelligent.

969
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,160
There's no such thing as claim to be clever or intelligent.

970
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,800
Look at the word.

971
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,300
It's subgenius.

972
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,580
We're not geniuses.

973
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:35,880
Clever.

974
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,440
I mean, if you take clever and intelligent.

975
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,000
Clever.

976
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,900
And what is clever but just a simple machine?

977
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,840
We're like the LEV office.

978
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,500
It's just ER.

979
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,600
It's a simpleton.

980
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,460
Take all of that.

981
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:50,040
We have nothing more complex than the basic wheel, inclined plane, and lever.

982
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,560
That's the most complex we get in our, in anything we may even consider.

983
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,940
So, calling us clever, or funny, or intelligent is just a, it's just an insult.

984
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,640
Okay, and then look at this word here.

985
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,020
The.

986
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:02,640
The.

987
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,800
He starts the second sentence of his letter with the word.

988
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,100
The.

989
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,520
A three letter word.

990
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,080
A three letter word.

991
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,480
Why would you write?

992
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:09,840
The.

993
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,460
The.

994
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:10,940
I just can't.

995
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,100
The.

996
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,440
Okay.

997
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,240
The latest.

998
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:12,740
The.

999
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,140
The latest church magazine.

1000
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,680
How does he know it's the latest church magazine?

1001
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,400
Did he get one, did he get this morning's magazine?

1002
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,120
I guess not.

1003
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,660
Did he get the one we put out this afternoon?

1004
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,120
No.

1005
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,020
Did he get the one that we're working on right now?

1006
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,460
I can't believe this call.

1007
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,580
Has he got the one that we're going to do next week?

1008
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:26,900
The.

1009
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,100
The.

1010
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,260
The latest church magazine.

1011
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,240
Read the letter.

1012
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:29,520
What else?

1013
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,260
What else do we have?

1014
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,180
I just can't believe this.

1015
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:31,540
Never is.

1016
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,600
Read the letter.

1017
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,220
Is none of these.

1018
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,020
None of these what?

1019
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,300
Brent, it's all of those.

1020
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,080
None of these what?

1021
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:37,600
None of them.

1022
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,280
All of them.

1023
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,260
It's only three or four of them at the same time.

1024
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,340
It's a dozen of them as we sit here and eleven of them in the morning first thing.

1025
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,660
Unless one of them gets wet and starts to swell up and he puts it in that box.

1026
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,840
What's he going to do?

1027
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,640
Does he have that oaken box?

1028
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,960
Does he have an oaken casket?

1029
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,840
Does he have the arc of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer to put it in?

1030
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,040
What's he going to do when it starts swelling up?

1031
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,420
I just can't believe this.

1032
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,480
None of these.

1033
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,560
Okay.

1034
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,300
Another three letter word.

1035
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:03,780
You.

1036
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,140
You.

1037
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:04,440
You.

1038
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:04,720
You.

1039
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,260
You.

1040
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:05,340
You.

1041
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:05,400


1042
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:05,400


1043
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:05,400


1044
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:05,400


1045
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:05,400


1046
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:06,900
You.

1047
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:08,600
You.

1048
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,320
You.

1049
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,380
You.

1050
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,380


1051
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,380


1052
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,380


1053
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,380


1054
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,380


1055
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,380


1056
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,380


1057
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,380


1058
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,380


1059
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,380


1060
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:24,420
Huh.

1061
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:29,940


1062
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,160
I used that one there to start the

1063
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,160


1064
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,160


1065
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,160


1066
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,160


1067
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,700
flawed like a O chick

1068
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,540
The keer

1069
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:32,540


1070
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,840
the

1071
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,180
collaborating

1072
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:40,240
The

1073
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,740
210-577. Northwest Airlines says they found ordinary skin and bone cells,

1074
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:50,860
but employees and some outside observers say they found PR news in Washington.

1075
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:03,000
You sound really pretty. Let me tell you what I'm wearing. I'm wearing brown pants,

1076
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:09,420
an old navy crew neck, and a pair of red Skechers. Did I mention I'm also wearing a

1077
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:16,380
UGO baseball cap? I'm lying on my floor playing with my model trains right now.

1078
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:24,820
I'm making tracks, baby. Oh, just lay back and listen. I'm small, but I know how to choo-choo.

1079
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:32,140
You could be my jungle gym and I'll swing around and climb. Let me get my trampoline, baby.

1080
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,400
Choo-choo. Imagine my tiny body crawling all over you, boo.

1081
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,400
Feet.

1082
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,160
He'll sneak my way all up inside and through you.

1083
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,460
You like that, don't you?

1084
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,960
So don't be afraid.

1085
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,060
It won't hurt much.

1086
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,280
Bob appears to be just a head.

1087
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,740
You never see him with arms and legs anymore.

1088
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,660
You might call him a head of his time.

1089
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,380
But what else if it's Bob?

1090
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,400
You don't need arms.

1091
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,720
You don't need legs.

1092
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,460
You don't even need a brain.

1093
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,980
Because all you really need, friends, is slack.

1094
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,620
That's all anybody needs.

1095
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,440
When was the last time brains got you a good job?

1096
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:18,860
No!

1097
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,320
Lying on your resume or somebody else dying gets you a good job.

1098
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,320
When did being smart get you success on a date?

1099
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,740
Well, actually, if you're like me, that's about the only way to you.

1100
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,020
But, nonetheless, you know what I'm saying.

1101
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,320
Kevin Fox, hi.

1102
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,400
Before you do this, I've decided to meet my assistant.

1103
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,420
It's a five-minute, easy version.

1104
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,360
The wrongs warn you of a game.

1105
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:38,700
First, you say,

1106
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,300
Ready?

1107
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,940
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1108
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,540
Walk those legs out.

1109
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,160
5, 6, 7, 8.

1110
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,360
3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1111
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,580
4, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.

1112
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,760
5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1113
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,520
Down all the way to the back extension.

1114
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:46,840
Ready?

1115
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,960
Game, game, game, game, game, game.

1116
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,860
2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2.

1117
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,680
Straighten those legs out.

1118
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,860
4, 3, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4.

1119
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,560
Stand up and ready for the easy.

1120
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,020
Come side to side.

1121
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,280
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left.

1122
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,440
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left.

1123
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1124
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1125
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,400
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1126
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,040
Drop down to side extensions.

1127
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:01,540
One leg to side.

1128
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,120
Game, game, game, game, game.

1129
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,220
2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4.

1130
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,440
4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3.

1131
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,160
Green meat for me.

1132
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,480
Spread out so far and wide.

1133
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,280
I'd rather get allergic smelling.

1134
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:33,880
But.

1135
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,020
The stars.

1136
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,640
Fresh.

1137
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,200
Crap.

1138
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,700
Do you know your daughter well?

1139
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,680
And do you know she's dreaming?

1140
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,260
Do you know your daughter well?

1141
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,640
Talk to her soon.

1142
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,680
Boy, do you know your daughter well?

1143
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,420
And do you know she's dreaming?

1144
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,620
You know as well as I.

1145
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,640
She stays higher than the moon.

1146
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,580
And do you know your sister well?

1147
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,640
And did you know she's drinking?

1148
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,140
Do you know your sister well?

1149
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,460
Talk to her soon.

1150
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,580
Boy, do you know your sister well?

1151
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,400
You know I think she's losing.

1152
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,520
You know as well as I.

1153
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,420
She stays higher than the moon.

1154
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,580
You broke my heart.

1155
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,360
She's a child.

1156
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,160
She's everywhere I see,

1157
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,880
my wife's wherever I see,

1158
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:53,340
I yearn for where she goes.

1159
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:53,740
I guess.

1160
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,780
I'm cut out to be each other's episode of my life.

1161
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:55,780


1162
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:55,780


1163
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:55,780


1164
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,340
Show up the nightly radio or your sister mean.

1165
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:56,720
One more message.

1166
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:56,720


1167
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:56,720


1168
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:56,720


1169
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:56,780
I'm gonna search around and keep a safe spot for you.

1170
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:56,780


1171
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:56,780


1172
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:56,780


1173
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,360
Twoelo.

1174
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,600
And do you know your brother well

1175
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,600
In the company he's keeping

1176
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,160
Do you know your brother well

1177
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,560
Talk to him tonight

1178
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,520
Or do you know your brother well

1179
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,840
He's very, very strange they tell

1180
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,940
Probably he'll go to hell

1181
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,480
Unless you steer him right

1182
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,700

1202
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,560

Love, that Bob.

1236
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,860
Starring Bob.

1237
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:28,760
Bob.

1238
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,500
Bob.

1239
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,040
Bob's an absolute genius.

1240
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,580
Bob's an absolute genius.

1241
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,220
Bob?

1242
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,540
Where's Bob?

1243
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:36,540
Where's Bob?

1244
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,340
Well, honey, I don't know where he is, but I'll tell you this.

1245
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:44,240
Wherever he is, you can be sure he's got his armor and some cute little titty.

1246
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,440
You'd have to beat him off.

1247
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:45,920
Bob.

1248
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,560
Bob was up the creek.

1249
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,340
Which reminds me, where's Bob?

1250
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,760
Does he have any news of Bob?

1251
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:51,520
Bob.

1252
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:51,780
Bob.

1253
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:52,540
Bob.

1254
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,720
Love, that Bob.

1255
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,020
Bob.

1256
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:56,640
Bob.

1257
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,380
Oh, Bob.

1258
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,000
Bob, you will wear a pair of shoes.

1259
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,420
Carry plenty of oxygen.

1260
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,100
Bob.

1261
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,480
He is gorgeous, isn't he?

1262
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,940
Oh, Lord, I do just throw my fingers through his hair.

1263
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,220
Now, here's something to think about.

1264
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,180
Who cares?

1265
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,880
If your love hurts you.

1266
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:19,360
Please.

1267
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:19,800
Do it.

1268
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,780
Who cares?

1269
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:22,540
Who cares?

1270
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:23,340
Hurts.

1271
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,840
Did you ever think about how important it is to.

1272
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,400
If your love hurts you.

1273
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,240
Head hurts.

1274
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,200
Come out.

1275
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:29,700
Hurts.

1276
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,860
Come out.

1277
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:31,800
Who cares?

1278
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,100
And here's a funny thought.

1279
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:35,580
Head.

1280
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,780
Who cares?

1281
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,940
Do you have a bathroom problem in your house?

1282
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,220
Eat it all.

1283
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,580
Eat it all.

1284
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,540
Eat it.

1285
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,180
Eat it.

1286
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,120
Who cares?

1287
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,400
Hurts.

1288
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:57,200
There was no progress at birth.

1289
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,380
Patients suffer with a lower level.

1290
00:56:59,380 --> 00:56:59,940
They are such a scann bad whore.

1291
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,760
We are only the psychics.

1292
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,300
I don't think it's just me.

1293
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,020
Those of you who say I'm like that aren't faithless.

1294
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:09,240
However, if that were true, there will be a limit.

1295
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:09,280
Amazing.

1296
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,620
There are devils.

1297
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,960
There are people like just just people.

1298
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,300
Who sayretimet.

1299
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,300
But we just say it's a life of us this are human beings often tell us to be living out of our lives.

1300
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:19,520


1301
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:26,360
he shall be self-righteousness. Heaven's Lord, the body of we are lost in such folly. None of us

1302
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:31,220
would build a home with special doors for each member of the family. We all use the same doors.

1303
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:36,560
And of course, for which is large enough for the biggest one of the family, is large enough for

1304
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:43,080
the smallest too. It is large enough to permit the biggest as well as the smallest sinner to enter

1305
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:51,400
if he but come, but come, but come, come, come, come. Some doors can be entered only after a

1306
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:58,580
specified entrance fee is paid. Some doors are open only certain hours of the day. Doors enable

1307
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:05,040
us to seek shelter from the storms of life. It makes all the difference in the world which side

1308
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:12,480
of the door we're on, the inside or the outside. Which side of the door are you on? Most doors

1309
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,840
permit us to carry anything through them as we enter pass through heaven's door

1310
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:26,220
what a joy it would be to come enter in heaven's door is still wide open won't

1311
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,680
you enter while you may

1312
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:38,740
opportunities for open wide

1313
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,380
we go big oh yeah

1314
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,080
we

1315
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:46,560
Oh

1316
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,420
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

1317
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:28,880
Take these broken wings

1318
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,460
And learn to fly

1319
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,040
All your life

1320
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:42,060
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

1321
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,640
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

1322
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,820
Or when in my mind the men come in their six black shiny ships,

1323
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,560
do they come in your mind too?

1324
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,040
Very funny, I agree.

1325
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,760
Very, very, very.

1326
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,220
Yes.

1327
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,480

1329
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,280
Very funny, diarrhea.

1330
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,220
Very runny, diarrhea.

1331
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:12,660
Yes.

1332
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,500
Yes.

1333
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,760
Very runny, diarrhea.

1334
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:18,680
Very runny, diarrhea.

1335
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,080
Yes.

1336
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:21,920
Yes.

1337
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,400
Irritation.

1338
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:23,980
In the rectum.

1339
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,260
Irritation.

1340
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:25,840
In the rectum.

1341
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,340
Constipation.

1342
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:28,920
Hemorrhoids.

1343
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,060
Married.

1344
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,060
Constipation.

1345
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,660
Hemorrhoids.

1346
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:33,700
Married.

1347
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:34,580
Irritation.

1348
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,160
In the rectum.

1349
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,640
It's not my job.

1350
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,020
I am.

1351
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,300
I'm on fucking fire.

1352
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,200
I'm on fucking fire.

1353
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,200
I'm on fucking fire.

1354
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,200
I'm on fucking fire.

1355
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,240
I'm on fucking fire.

1356
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,160
I'm on fucking fire.

1357
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,580
That's the way I feel.

1358
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,980
I don't expect to go to sleep for a year.

1359
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,320
I'm on fucking fire.

1360
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,540
And what we saw tonight was a physical phenomenon,

1361
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,580
an inexplicable physical phenomenon.

1362
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,500
And what we saw tonight was a physical phenomenon,

1363
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,580
an inexplicable physical phenomenon.

1364
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,060
That's the way I feel.

1365
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,460
I don't expect to go to sleep for a year.

1366
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,820
I'm on fucking fire.

1367
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:25,960
I bet you don't know what to do in case of a nuclear attack.

1368
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,340
You know what to do?

1369
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:29,760
You put your hands behind your head,

1370
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,280
put your head between your knees,

1371
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,540
and kiss your ass.

1372
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,120
goodbye

1373
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,240
definition

1374
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,100
of indecent

1375
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,620
if it's long enough

1376
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,420
hard enough

1377
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:47,500
and far enough

1378
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,700
it's indecent
