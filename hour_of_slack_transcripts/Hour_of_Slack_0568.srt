39
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:36,680
Frank Zappa's classic Peaches and Regalia. Beautiful, beautiful piece of music that

40
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,680
many of us of us old folks cut our teeth upon and you know we don't play much

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,280
Frank Zappa on the Hour of Slack and it's because Frank Zappa may very well

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,280
be what led you here if you're over 30 and you know what we like to do for Bob

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,340
is to lead you on to the next thing help the next poor sucker down the line as

44
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:08,020
Frank himself said and recently I was given to hear of a conversation actually

45
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,000
something I picked up off the internet in which someone had had been griping on

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,720
alt Frank fan Zappa or something about how oh you know it's so sad Frank's dead

47
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,800
and Captain Beefheart only does paintings now

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,260
and maybe he's dead.

49
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:32,240
I mean what is what is there left and Zug's Rift our fellow minister and a

50
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:41,380
great musician Zug's Rift responded that well you know buddy it's not like there

51
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,820
aren't other musicians floating around there I mean are you just as

52
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,520
conservative as that guy that can't listen to anything but Led Zeppelin now

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,140
that he's 45 years old?

54
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,960
You know yep.

55
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,260
Frank's dead as a doornail and and the captain has gone on to other things and

56
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,200
he's not gonna make any more music but friends have you bothered to seek out

57
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,880
that Rudy Schwartz project CD or that Zug's Rift CD that Kings of Feedback

58
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:22,200
that silica gel Reagan's Pollock or even swinging love corpses or Doctors for Bob

59
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,520
have you have you?

60
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:23,940
Well I'm not sure.

61
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:32,420
Um Friends I was thinking about that and this is gonna be our nepotistic Friends of Stang music show but don't be afraid because

62
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,320
old Reverend stang has some very talented friends.

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,780
um so it will be a musical show a musical show indeed of

64
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:50,580
people might complain that well I sent my tape to Reverend stang...

65
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,940
It's true that it was unlistenable and I did not want to listen to it...

66
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:53,940


67
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,060
I did not put any label on it,

68
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,340
and I did mention in my handwritten note on the napkin

69
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,480
that it probably sucked,

70
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,480
but he never played it on his show.

71
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,500
He only plays his friends.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,180
Well, here's why.

73
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,920
bass & drums play in bright rhythm

74
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,180
That was Joe Newman, and that's good music.

75
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,860
We'll be talking about Bob.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,180
We'll have songs about Bob.

77
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,520
We'll have Dr. Bizarre's rap-a-like songs about Bob.

78
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,100
It's all right, we'll have Bob, we'll have Bob.

79
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,740
What are the possibilities of complete music?

80
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,480
Follow us at Mr. Slack.

81
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,600
Boop-bop, beat-up!

82
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,880
Boop-bop, beat-up!

83
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,500
Boop-bop, beat-up!

84
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,020
Boop-bop, beat-up!

85
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,000
Bob is lucky, not smart.

86
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,240
Boop-bop, beat-up!

87
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,240


88
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,240


89
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,240


90
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,240


91
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,240


92
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,080
That's for puke from people like you.

93
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,740
Would you F.I.P. to the FBI?

94
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,260
Would you tell to them a dirty lie?

95
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,780
Everything will soon turn out all right

96
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,760
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum!

97
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,320
Did you F.I.P. to the FBI?

98
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,840
Would you tell to them a dirty lie?

99
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,020
Slowly slid in both my wrists

100
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,940
Metaphorically speaking, that is.

101
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,080
Bob is lucky, not smart.

102
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,340
In fact, by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence,

103
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,700
he is gifted with incredible stupidity.

104
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,520
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness.

105
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,060
This enables him to act without thinking,

106
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,960
to surf effortlessly on the luck plane,

107
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,460
to float down the fabled path of least resistance.

108
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,400
In fact, to make a million dollars every time he screws up.

109
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,180
A catatonic stupid

110
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,500
Where do you think you're being?

111
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,260
A catatonic stupid

112
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,040
You'll know you'll never again

113
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,580
Cole, what are you doing?

114
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,200
Cole, hi, man.

115
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:16,800
Hey, how's it going?

116
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,500
Christ, okay.

117
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,920
Oh, you brought me some tapes.

118
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:23,380
Yeah.

119
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,180
Oh.

120
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,280
From bearing gifts.

121
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,500
Oh, Jesus comes bearing gifts.

122
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,360
St. Andrew.

123
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,140
Cole, Jesus.

124
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,460
What's that noise?

125
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,100
Feedback from my great presence.

126
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,060
I guess either that or my little headphones here.

127
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,660
Tray full of lab mice.

128
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Tray full of...

129
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,940
Now, this is what it's like, friends.

130
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,440
We're on the air, by the way.

131
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,040
See, I've been sitting here.

132
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,000
I've been playing.

133
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,440
This is a...

134
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,860
This is a show of nepotistic friends of ours music.

135
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,200
It's like Joe Newman, Zug's Riff, Negative Land, you know.

136
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:55,980
No, it's Doerr.

137
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,020
Oh, now, is that my Bryce CD?

138
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,400
Oh, Bryce.

139
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,260
Oh, okay, good.

140
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,260
I was worried about that.

141
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,040
Okay, well, what is this new CD?

142
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,460
Numersonic.

143
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,060
Frequencies of the Beast.

144
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,940
Oh, look at the titles on this.

145
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,520
Hippie Freakout.

146
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,420
The Mark of the Beast.

147
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,700
Creature Double Feature.

148
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,360
Martian.

149
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,200
Girlfriend.

150
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,760
Greetings, Earth.

151
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,140
Hey, I wonder if these are X Day.

152
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,380
This some...

153
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,820
You know what it might be.

154
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
Let's see what this letter is.

155
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,140
Tray full of lab mice.

156
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,520
Dear Ivan, I worship you.

157
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,680
I once contributed my little Jesus being crucified on Telephone Pulse collage.

158
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,020
So he's the one who did that.

159
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,360
You must immediately play Numersonic on your show.

160
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,500
Practically, the whole album is your cup of tea if you ever steeped a bag.

161
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,300
I also enclose Unbunny, which may not...

162
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,120
...appeal to your fine sensibilities.

163
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,800
Okay, here, Numersonic.

164
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,220
Make Unbunny and Numersonic household names by tomorrow noon.

165
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,080
My telex operators await your instructions as we just hatched our label yesterday.

166
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,480
I'll make the press kit short.

167
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,260
Unbunny just put out his first album.

168
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,020
He drives a flower delivery truck.

169
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,800
I guess...

170
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,420
It says Goiter Boy is the one to use if I use any of them.

171
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,380
But now the second CD.

172
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,600
Numersonic is the band.

173
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,340
Frequencies of the Beast is the album.

174
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,140
The lead singer is a credit to dementia, having been certified homeless.

175
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,700
Get the...we got another one!

176
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,740
We got another...this is like a...

177
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,440
The ultimate, quote, outsider artist and schizophrenic for the last 20 years.

178
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,900
Yet he's not just a novelty act.

179
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,700
He improvises wildly funny lyrics and sounds like Elvis with a sore throat.

180
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,440
The opening song, Hippie Freakout, will be the...

181
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,980
The smash hit of the album.

182
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,960
Most of the profits go to Paul's coffee fund.

183
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,760
Well, I was just telling that we only played stuff by our friends.

184
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,720
But now here's proof that if somebody sends us something wild enough...

185
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,340
We've never even heard this, friends.

186
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,300
We've...we have...

187
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:04,620
I hope it's clean.

188
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,020
You're hearing it for the first time just as we are.

189
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,240
Well, we are on tape, so...

190
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,700
You know, I'm lying my ass off to them.

191
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,360
Okay.

192
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,220
Here it is.

193
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,460
Hippie Freakout.

194
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,940
Thinking about a bunch of hippie in the parking lot.

195
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,020
All set out there ready for a bout.

196
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,560
I says, hey, you fellas, you better be careful because someone's gonna holler.

197
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,600
And we're sure gonna start there and we're all gonna shout.

198
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,840
And there's no doubt about it, someone's gonna call the cops.

199
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,640
One guy said to me, he says, hey, mind your business, friend.

200
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,020
This is none of yours.

201
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
I says, well, I'm aware of that.

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,380
But I'm trying to be concerned for you and what's gonna happen.

203
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,500
If you get caught.

204
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,880
So it doesn't really matter.

205
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,860
One way or another, they didn't seem to care.

206
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,060
I says, hey, listen, you guys.

207
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,600
Don't you realize that we all out here sitting out in the front chair?

208
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,300
So there was a bunch of hippies.

209
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,720
Yeah.

210
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,180
Hippie Freakout.

211
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:14,120
It's all set to go out there in the parking lot and get ready to do themselves a bout.

212
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,520
So there was this young lady.

213
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,800
I took a look at her.

214
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,960
I says, oh, ho.

215
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,640
Give me a, give me, give me a drag or two.

216
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,800
She says, hey, get away from me.

217
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,820
I don't want nothing to do with you.

218
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,420
She took a shot in her arm and I could see.

219
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,220
I says, hey, you're getting rather kind of dizzy.

220
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,540
She says, hey, hey, you can kiss when the sun doesn't shine.

221
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,040
I says, hey, don't tell me that.

222
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,220
Just do the things on time.

223
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,460
She just starts shaking.

224
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,260
She started wiggling, going from side to side.

225
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,480
She says, hey, come on over here.

226
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,060
You want to be my guy?

227
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,260
I says, hey, what makes you think that I'm any different from you?

228
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,220
Because I have a clean haircut and I just don't seem to know what to do.

229
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,040
She says, hey, man, let that reefer smoke it strong.

230
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,400
Pump that old needle up your arm.

231
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,200
I says, oh, yeah, I surely will.

232
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,400
She says, hey, brother, have a drink.

233
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,740
Have another or two.

234
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,160
This is one thing I want you to do.

235
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,000
Well, friends, we have no idea whether this song goes on for another hour or two or what.

236
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,000
It is definitely a hippie freakout.

237
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,840
Do you believe that you're mine?

238
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,340
You are for few in this particular time.

239
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,640
Do you believe that you seek guidance, understanding?

240
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,740
Do you think of yourself as being somewhat mentally ill and disturbed?

241
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,480
Do you think that your drinking problems will really, really cause you the troubles after all?

242
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,720
Do you really think that you're a drunk?

243
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,300
Do you think that your life is so bad that you know it wasn't?

244
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,940
Do you know what my hands are?

245
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,740
Do you know what my hands are?

246
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,500
Now.

247
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,920
Yeah, go ahead, Paul.

248
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,640
My outer space machine.

249
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,800
The woman with the eyes so big and bright.

250
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,820
My outer space machine.

251
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:24,260
The woman that has to come through in disguise.

252
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:32,480
Yes, my outer space machine.

253
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,460
Well, friends, this show is a strange show.

254
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:46,160
We got a bit sidetracked there into some hippie freakouts when Jesus suddenly, right in the middle of being nepotistic,

255
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,720
Jesus showed up with a little bit of a show.

256
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,060
With some tapes or CDs from strangers.

257
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,260
And I went and played them anyway just when I was trying not to be democratic.

258
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:03,160
I was trying to just stick to my buddies and the graft and grifting of, uh,

259
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,240
Praise Bob Joe Newman and the Rudy Schwartz Project.

260
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,360
Oh, yes.

261
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,560
.

262
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:27,600
.

263
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,860
.

264
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,700
.

265
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:37,800
.

266
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,280
.

267
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,520
Thank you.

268
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,940
Thank you.

269
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,140
Thank you.

270
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,960
Thank you.

271
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,720
Thank you.

272
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,840
Thank you.

273
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,720
Thank you.

274
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,820
Thank you.

275
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,800
Thank you.

276
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,880
Thank you.

277
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,120
Thank you.

278
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,260
Thank you.

279
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,700
Thank you.

280
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,020
Thank you.

281
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,260
Thank you.

282
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,280
Thank you.

283
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,680
Thank you.

284
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,900
Thank you.

285
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,840
I'm having a heart attack.

286
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,680
Thank you for watching.

287
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,940
Thank you for watching.

288
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,160


289
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,880
Thank you for watching.

290
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:21,120
She got back to her residence on Sunset Boulevard, where the residue of her love had died through.

291
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,380
I got bit and stoned by a Ned fly, went swelled up into a baby, and floated away up in outer

292
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,040
space like a Jules Verne hot air balloon.

293
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,740
Jacob Barley took a doll axe and bled his tiny trim and all his little friends.

294
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,520
Disney from Starsdale!

295
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,160
That's why I'm having a heart attack!

296
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,640
Can't be the same till I get my baby back.

297
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:51,360
She's gone and left me broken hearted. Came to stay but now we've parted.

298
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,320
Like a trans-continental island, burning, floating across the seven seas.

299
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,160
Corporeal to cost information and delicate bacteria, chitted in a mustard keg.

300
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,240
Her lover made a beautiful sunset. She's not a lefty, what shall I do?

301
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,360
She got back to her residence on Sunset Boulevard, where the residue of her love had died through.

302
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:19,840
I got bit and stoned by a Ned fly, went swelled up into a baby, and floated away up in outer space like a Jules Verne hot air balloon.

303
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:27,780
Jacob Barley took a doll axe and bled his tiny trim and all his little friends.

304
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,960
Disney from Starsdale!

305
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,360
That's why I'm having a heart attack!

306
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:47,700
Can't be the same till I get my baby back. She's gone and left me broken hearted. Came to stay but now we've parted.

307
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,200
I'm having a heart attack!

308
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,220
Not fair!

309
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,480
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it!

310
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,040
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it!

311
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,360
Hold it!

312
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:58,940
Alright.

313
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,560
Zoot Zrift.

314
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,160
Dear friends, uh, that, uh, heart attack.

315
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,560
There by the great Zugz Rift.

316
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,180
And his amazing, um, poo-poo hands is one way to call that man.

317
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,460
Um, and this is also Zugz in the background.

318
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:26,020
I'm about to give the address of Dr. Zugz Rift and also the address for Joe Newman, okay?

319
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:33,040
And, um, so you know who to write to for the uncensored versions of these self-same tapes.

320
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,140
Zugz Rift got that pencil right.

321
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,240
And the address already is at...

322
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,080
P.O. Box 18765.

323
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,960
That's Box 18765.

324
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,180
Encino, California.

325
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,880
Encino, California.

326
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,640
91416.

327
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,880
Yes.

328
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,160
That's Box 18765.

329
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,820
Encino, California.

330
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,060
91416.

331
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:19,920
And, uh, to, uh, get information about the, uh, CDs of, uh, tapes of, uh, Joe Newman's Rudy Schwartz Project,

332
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
that is P.O. Box 4542.

333
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,980
P.O. Box 4542 in Austin, Texas.

334
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,900
78765.

335
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,660
Yes, friends, it's P.O. Box 4542.

336
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,000
Austin, Texas.

337
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,740
78765.

338
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,740
For Joe Newman and I, yes, while I'm maddened with this great music in the background,

339
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:59,920
I probably ought to also give the background post office box number for B-B-B-B-Bob, yes.

340
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,960
And, uh, if you haven't memorized it by now, you will.

341
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,260
It's P.O. Box...

342
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,520
140306...

343
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,300
in Dallas, Texas.

344
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,200
75214.

345
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,180
When I say the word start, the test will begin.

346
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,220
Are you ready?

347
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,360
Start.

348
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,860
When was the last time you had your hearing checked?

349
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,240
Uh...

350
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,360
I would advise him to learn to lip read.

351
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,720
Insert earplugs now.

352
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,880
Watch out for this.

353
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,460
Crank it up, dude!

354
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:08,620
It's not what I'd like to listen to, but I don't think I should be able to tell the other people what they can or can't listen to.

355
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,020
Deafness is not only uncool, it's endurable.

356
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,980
I-I-I've shown my hearing.

I'm your real enemy!

367
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,140
Look out!

368
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,840
Don't you want to be saved?

369
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,020
Don't you want to be saved?

370
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,620
Fight the real enemy!

371
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,560
All this devil needs to have you, mister, but I won't let him!

372
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,800
Fight the real enemy!

373
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,500
What I'm asking people to do is accept that everything they've based their lives on is a lie.

374
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,360
What I'm asking people to do is accept that everything they've based their lives on is a lie.

375
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,080
Oh!

376
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:25,920
Dodgy!

377
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,640
I'm seeking salvation!

378
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,520
I'm seeking salvation!

379
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,220
I'm seeking salvation!

380
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,380
According to your beautiful ideals, I'm supposed to crawl away somewhere and die so that you and Bob can be friends.

381
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,280
Oh, there you are.

382
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,700
Bob, we were afraid you wouldn't get here.

383
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,440
Got here as soon as I could.

384
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,460
Oh, Julie.

385
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,680
Say, what is this whole thing all about?

386
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,940
I've got your belt the other way now, Dobbs.

387
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,580
Now, listen to me.

388
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,400
How do you...

389
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,060
Look.

390
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,500
How lucky I am, how lucky I am to have someone like you.

391
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,520
How lucky I am, how lucky I am to have someone like you.

392
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:57,620


393
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,040
From the beginning right to the end, from the beginning right to the end.

394
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,000
How lucky, lucky, lucky I am.

395
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,640
Bobbie!

396
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,140
Bobbie!

397
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,940
Bobby, baby!

398
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,020
Bobbie, bobbie, bobbie!

399
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,180
Robert darling!

400
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,540
LI voy a trapezar Shelley!

401
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,900
Where's our bare head Laz talent Ð´Ð²ÑƒÑ…!

402
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,680
This all just a dream Job's coming home

403
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,100
Aw, motion blur switch!

404
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,120
Ah, Maimura!

405
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,540
Man this's a shame!

406
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,900
Use speech to describe dethrone Slavoj!

407
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,700
No, no, no!

408
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,640
Don't stop me here! Don't stop me here!

409
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,680
Fight the real enemy!

410
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,620
Don't you want to be saved?

411
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,260
Don't you want to be saved?

412
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,300
Fight the real enemy!

413
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,960
Don't you want to be a cop?

414
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,580
We're all looking in the same direction.

415
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,120
We're not seeing quite the same thing.

416
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,460
You're looking at me and I'm looking at you.

417
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,220
But we're all going insane!

418
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,540
We're going insane!

419
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,720
We'll find the God!

420
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,940
Fight the real enemy!

421
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,400
No, no, no!

422
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,100
The mind is good and the heart is free!

423
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,940
Fight the real enemy!

424
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,740
Fight the real enemy!

425
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,760
I don't want to preach to people.

426
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,440
I don't want to preach to people.

427
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,380
Oh, Bob!

428
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:24,980
Oh!

429
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,980
Turn on.

430
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,540
Tune in.

431
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,360
Why do you want to be normal?

432
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,060
Why do you want to be normal?

433
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,580
Why do you want to be normal?

434
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,600
The rupture is upon us, dear friends!

435
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,160
The rupture is upon us, dear friends!

436
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,520
That fateful day,

437
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,440
July 5th, 1998!

438
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:44,440


439
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,360
Next days are coming!

440
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,420
And the peaks are bumming!

441
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,240
And the peaks are bumming!

442
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,240


443
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,240


444
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,140
Next days are coming!

445
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,460
And the peaks are bumming!

446
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,900
And the peaks are bumming!

447
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:05,900


448
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,880
Oh, Bob!

449
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,040
Fun!

450
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,900
When we were born in here in this life

451
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,960
We were destined to make it right

452
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,440
That is prettyatellis

453
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,100
And this is our fate

454
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,680
We're singing this song

455
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,260
So you can read late

456
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,220
We are going to save the universe

457
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,860
We are going to save the universe

458
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,580
We are going to save the universe

459
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,620
This time

460
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,520
We are full grown

461
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,960
We are grown up men

462
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,920
We are all passionate

463
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,640
We came to reason it

464
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,840
It is our mission

465
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,440
It is our task

466
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,480
It's obvious

467
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,460
Yet you still ask

468
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,460
We are going to save the universe

469
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,420
We are going to save the universe

470
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,580
We are going to save the universe

471
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,840
This time

472
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:22,420
We are going to save the universe

473
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,140
We are going to save the universe

474
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,700
Don't you worry

475
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,320
Don't have no fears

476
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,040
Don't get out of sight

477
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,380
Because the end is near

478
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,820
We can't let

479
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,300
So there's nothing to say

480
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,860
We're in control

481
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,520
And we are more than fine

482
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,020
We are going to save the universe

483
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,680
We are going to save the universe

484
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,420
We are going to save the universe

485
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,260
We are going to save the universe

486
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,420
This time

487
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,800
Well maybe next time

488
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,320
Sure when the rupture hits

489
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,580
We'll all be in our first class window seats

490
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,080
On the pleasure saucers

491
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,700
Watching the

492
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:21,880
Hey!

493
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,120
Turn on

494
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,980
Turn off

495
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,180
Amplify

496
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,160
You certainly don't want to teach people

497
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,820
Ins ë°˜

498
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:31,820


499
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,280
N tex days are coming

500
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,620
And pe blacks are coming

501
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,520
And the pigs are bum consequenc

502
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,420
There's a whole bunch of people coming after you

503
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,120
You better stop n try to listen to me

504
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,420
There's a whole bunch of people coming after you

505
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,960
Cause they want to ram a little something up your buns

506
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,060
And they call it the conspiracy

507
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,240
Well, they'll make you think and act just the way they choose

508
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,460
And they'll make you overpay just to sing the blues

509
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,720
And they'll tell you what to say and they'll never go away

510
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,020
Cause they got you in your work and they'll never let you play

511
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,660
Cause they kind of just designed it to work that way

512
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,880
Cause they kind of just designed it to work that way

513
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,200
And because of their design, well, it washes out your mind

514
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,360
And you think you're doing fine, but you're wasting all your time

515
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,340
Being very well behaved for the big machine

516
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,580
Being very well behaved for the big machine

517
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,940
And they'll tell you what to say, but they'll never go away

518
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,220
Cause they got you in your work and they'll never let you play

519
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,820
Here I am

520
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,980
Stuck in the blood by the man

521
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,420
Here I stay

522
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,620
Free will just drifting away

523
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,100
Smile

524
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,160
And be happy

525
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,260
Here's the American dream

526
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,580
More noodles for you poodles

527
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,720
Means less coffee for your dream

528
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,980
And if you want to make more money

529
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,160
We'll take more of it for ourselves

530
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,420
With your caddies in the driveway

531
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,740
But nothing on your shelves

532
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,020
Get through all the confusion

533
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,000
Of this structured illusion

534
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,360
I get down on my knees

535
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,620
And I pray

536
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:26,020
Cause Bob is my savior

537
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,600
Today

538
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,040
Today

539
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,060
Yes, I am Bob

540
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,060
The one high exalted master of slack

541
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,620
I am the carburetor of the universe

542
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,740
The rubbery wheels on a child's toy truck

543
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,320
I am the peloton of the universe

544
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,320


545
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,700
The cork of intercourse

546
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,620
I am the force behind all foolishness and humor

547
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,900
The laughter of the raving lunatic

548
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,900
The wisdom of ignorance

549
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,820
The death rattle of the infant of seriousness

550
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,680
I am slack

551
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,720
I have come

552
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,640
And my organ still swells

553
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,520
To spread the legs of your mind

554
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,700
And I will thrust my holy rod

555
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,320
Into the balkans of your kingdom

556
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,320


557
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,320


558
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,320


559
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,320


560
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,320


561
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:28,160
In your regresions

562
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,120
How merely the

563
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,940
How humble a sea

564
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,000
And iron

565
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:46,140
And Ð¿Ð¾Ñ‚ri

566
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:51,300
Is ë‚´

567
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:51,300


568
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:12,780
Yes, dear friends, Dr. Bizarro there with his opera, his rock opera, The Big Machine.

569
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,980
And I'll give his address in a minute.

570
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:22,340
Before Dr. Bizarro, we heard, of course, the fantabulous Swinging Love Corpses.

571
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:27,820
The Swinging Love Corpses with We Are Going to Save the Universe,

572
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,840
interspersed with X Days of Coming and Fight the Real Enemy

573
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:39,020
by the great Bill T. Miller of Kings of Feedback and Out of Band Experience.

574
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,020
All of these bands have many, many names.

575
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,480
You see also in the background we're listening to a huge voodoo.

576
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,900
And D.K. Jones.

577
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,740
And it is so...

578
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,020
Oh, those addresses.

579
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,820
Okay, yeah.

580
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,940
Dr. Bizarro and the Disgustos.

581
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,440
Write for information from them from iBob Digital.

582
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,420
That box.

583
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,720
This is a P.O. box again.

584
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:08,520
3-4-0-5, Skokie, Illinois.

585
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,400
Box 3-4-0-5, Skokie, Illinois.

586
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,980
6-0-0-7-6.

587
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,200
6-0-0-7-6.

588
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,700
Bill T. Miller and Kings of Feedback have an incredible CD

589
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:35,360
and several tapes available with information from Box 221, Boston, Massachusetts.

590
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:43,500
That's Box 221, Boston, Massachusetts.

591
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,900

592
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,540
0-2-1-2-3.

593
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,140
0-2-1-2-3.

594
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:04,820
Or call 6-1-7-LICK-O-B-A.

595
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,300
Oh, this microphone.

596
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,740
And the sounds, you know.

597
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,880
Sometimes it's...

598
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,440
We get tired.

599
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,600
Even we get tired of hearing some guy

600
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,300
or even some lovely lilting voice of an angel girl

601
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,820
talking about Bob.

602
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,680
And we just want to hear sounds.

603
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,500
And this band coming up here, Silica Gel,

604
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,580
makes sounds.

605
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,480
I don't know if you could really even would want to call it music exactly.

606
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,560
They're a band that was...

607
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:51,380
that is distributed by the same company that distributes Negative Land.

608
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,680
It's another of our friends.

609
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,140
We'll be playing Negative Land as well.

610
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,240
In fact, let's just get to it, shall we?

611
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,040
Thank you.

612
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,460
This is Silica Gel.

613
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,720
I hope you have headphones on for this one.

614
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,280
Thank you.

615
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,120
Thank you.

616
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,980
Thank you.

617
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,940
Going into the music business is really exciting.

618
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,740
I'm really learning a lot about it.

619
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:38,340
It's really exciting.

620
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:51,860
you. I'll have a secret message just for you. I'll have a secret message.

621
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,480
We all need plenty of that.

622
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,500
I've always liked cars.

623
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,960
I've always liked cars.

624
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,300
I've always liked cars.

625
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,620
I've always liked cars.

626
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,940
I've always liked cars.

627
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,020
That especially makes my mom happy.

628
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:48,340
That especially makes my mom happy.

629
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,160
That especially makes my mom happy.

630
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:10,480

Automatic!

637
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,040
Thank you.

00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,340
Thank you.

three six.

649
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,060
Bob

650
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,800

651
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,920

657
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,280
I don't want anything.

658
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,440
I don't want anything.

659
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,580
I don't want anything.

660
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,620
I don't want anything.

661
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,680
I don't want anything.

662
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,140
I don't want anything in the toilet.

663
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,620
Samples of bacteria.

664
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,740
Just throw 409.

665
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,140
Everywhere.

666
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,080
That's correct.

667
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:13,360
Everywhere.

668
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,620
Do you think that's a dumb thing to do?

669
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:17,620
No.

670
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:19,580
Evil.

671
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,960
It's not dumb.

672
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:22,920
Samples.

673
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,980
You have sex dirt.

674
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,160
This is all nonsense.

675
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,020
You know better than that.

676
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,060
Wash wash wash wash your hands.

677
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,120
Wash wash wash wash your hands.

678
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:41,560
This is all nonsense.

Wash wash wash wash your hands.

680
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,000

Wash your hands.

682
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:44,740
And then you're gonna need to wash your hands.

683
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,100
Wash your hands.

684
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,940
To create a continuing communication of erotic stimuli.

685
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,980
Wash your hands.

686
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,160
That's it.

687
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,800
To create a continuing communication of erotic stimuli.

688
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,640
Wash your hands.

689
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,160
Get big butt out of the bathroom.

690
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,980
I may decide to use another device.

691
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,920
And some men are particularly fond of this.

692
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,460
The Hoover.

693
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,680
My affectionate mate for this.

694
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,860
And then you're gonna need to wash your hands.

695
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,720
I don't want anything in the toilet.

696
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:18,780


697
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,520
I'm putting lyrics right in some listeners.

698
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,200
Isn't that beautiful?

699
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,420
Play black.

700
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,820
Be black.

701
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,200
Play black.

702
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,560
Be black.

703
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:38,860
Play black.

704
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:42,560
Seat.

705
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,320
Seat.

706
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,760
Immunocid.

707
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,200
Conduction.

708
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,220
Immunocid.

709
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,200
Conduction.

710
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,300
Seat.

711
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,640
Seat.

712
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,440
Seat.

713
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:54,820
Seat.

714
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,160
Seat.

715
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:56,620
Seat.

716
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,060
Seat.

717
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:58,520
Seat.

718
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,320
Seat.

719
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,460
Seat.

720
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,740
Seat.

721
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,120


722
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,120


723
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,120


724
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,120


725
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:43,260
You know, and then I started thinking, how come my moods are getting so...

726
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:53,700
The iodine, the 1, 3, 1, has got my thyroid on the run.

727
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:59,820
And the krypton, the 85, is making it hard just to stay alive.

728
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:08,320
But the iodine, the 1, 3, 1, the iodine, the 1, 3, 1, has no more run.

729
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,420
The metal manes, no more of everything in the mud.

730
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,980
Power, powers in the power team.

His body is a 2, 4, 8.

00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:29,800


735
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,180

So long, folks, I'll see you in heaven.

738
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:45,040
But the iodine, the 1, 3, 1, the iodine, the 1, 3, 1.

Shake the bony hand of chicken coops.

I'm in the void.

764
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,060
I'm in the void.

765
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:23,240

Well, you look like you're clean and you smell like you're shaving.

Climb up on the cigarette and make it like a monkey.

You pump, you're funky.
