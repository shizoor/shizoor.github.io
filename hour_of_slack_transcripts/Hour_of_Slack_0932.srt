1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
Ah, it's all coming back to me now.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,780
And now if I do this...

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,600
Fast! No time for the stairs! Out through the wall!

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,660
No time to find the entrance. I'll just drive straight to it through the solid rock.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,020
No time for opening windows.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,600
Clark Kent may need a plane, but Superman doesn't.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,760
Here's Bob One for A1 Slacks.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,560
Hi, I'm Bob One for A1 Slacks, and I'd like to take a moment of your time.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,500
Thank you.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,080
And I'd like to tell you about the nice folks down at A1 Slacks.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,460
They handle a needle just the way your mother used to,

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,600
and the results are racers, capers, tapers, and bummers, such as you've never worn before.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,020
The Action Man's Go-Go Now Generation Happening Slacks for the Go-Go Now Generation Action Man on campus.

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:42,800
And off.

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,440
And remember, you can get a good education and win valuable prizes, too.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,240
Thank you, Bob.

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,840
You're welcome.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,260
And now, back to our movie.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,820
Wherever there is mystery, intrigue, romance,

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,480
in all the strange and bizarre,

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,900
dangerous places of the world,

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,280
there you will find

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,780
Bob.

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,060
It's chaotic.

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,060
It's chaotic.

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,060
It's chaotic.

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,660
No sack.

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,980
No sack.

29
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,320
No sack.

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,780
No sack.

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,080
No sack.

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,300
No sack.

33
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,440
No sack.

34
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:21,440


35
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,600
No sack.

36
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,820
Yes, yes, finally, we can do it.

37
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,160
We'll actually have friends.

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,260
My microphone broke, and Bob made me come into the station.

39
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,720
He made me keep working, and so we're doing it.

40
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,880
God damn it.

41
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,840
From the very station itself.

42
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,860
As the...

43
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,900
If I push this button, now, theoretically, this should bring this noise up.

44
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,200
No.

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:45,760
No.

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,200
No.

47
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,000
No.

48
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,260
No.

49
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,220


50
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,220


51
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,220


52
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,220


53
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,240
No.

54
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,240


55
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,240


56
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,480
No.

57
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,480


58
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,900
No.

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,660
No.

60
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,300
No.

61
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:55,800
No.

62
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,960
No.

63
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:57,960


64
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,140
No.

65
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,320


66
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,520
No.

67
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,000
No.

68
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:02,620


69
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:02,620


70
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,080
No.

71
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,960
No.

72
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,760
No.

73
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


74
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


75
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


76
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


77
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


78
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


79
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


80
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


81
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


82
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


83
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


84
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


85
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


86
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


87
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


88
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


89
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


90
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


91
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


92
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


93
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:04,760


94
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,560
Praise Bob.

95
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,880
The fates have brought you into possession of a subgenius instructional video barrage tape.

96
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,080
Prepare yourself.

97
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,280
You are about to be remade into a new being through forbidden knowledge previously kept

98
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,600
secret for centuries by the jealous priesthoods of many religions.

99
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,520
Caution.

100
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,500
Improper viewing techniques may lead in some persons to dependency.

101
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,180
seizures, cranial fits, priapic conditions,

102
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,320
micturition, stern mutations, subtle glandular mutations,

103
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,140
and in some territories, legal arrest.

104
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,980
However, if the viewer follows instructions and trusts completely in Bob,

105
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,200
this tape can produce an unsurpassable beatific experience

106
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,700
that can last for hours, days, weeks, possibly even centuries.

107
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,660
This videotape bears a patented Dobbs Drome PowerShell time code,

108
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,640
which may cause some home videodecks to react unpredictably.

109
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,000
Although only a small percentage of playback systems or their owners

110
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,340
have suffered permanent damage from this signal,

111
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,860
the Subgenius Foundation Incorporated is not responsible

112
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,500
for injuries or damages inflicted by paranormal events during tape play mode.

113
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,160
The tape also contains a subliminal hypnopediatrics trance-inducement tone

114
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,020
operating beyond the range of human perception,

115
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:22,920
which is a very common problem in the world of video games.

116
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,820
However, pets in the viewing room may exhibit unusual behavior,

117
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,020
as may small children and certain less evolved adults.

118
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,080
If such behavior anomalies last more than two days after viewing,

119
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,600
consult a physician.

120
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,780
However, this brainwave-infolding signal is generally harmless

121
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,280
and should actually enhance your learning abilities during the program.

122
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,840
Special interactive, homosonic stereo effects

123
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,060
produced on the Ultomate Cerebral Synclock Interocitor

124
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,940
trigger stem cleavage, or brain division,

125
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,160
between the forebrain and hindbrain.

126
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,140
Using newly discovered break-thinking principles,

127
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,340
the viewer's brainwaves are locked into synchronization

128
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,400
with the tape's underlying suggestions by means of neuroelectric pulses.

129
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,200
Plant growth and gas mileage of nearby automobiles may be affected.

130
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,380
For the unworthy, this tape may be a one-way ticket

131
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,620
down a bottomless mental pit from which there can be no escape.

132
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,420
In unreceptive viewers,

133
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,540
there is a danger of synaptic backfire in the brain pan

134
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,400
caused by overheating of the attention gland.

135
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,860
This dense packing of brain cells without proper organic coolants,

136
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,120
such as FROP,

137
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,340
has been blamed for three recent cases of spontaneous human combustion.

138
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,640
Do not overmedicate.

139
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,640
High dosages have so sensitized the third nostril receptors of some viewers

140
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,140
that they were unable to stop seeing the tape even after it had been turned off.

141
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,820
This tape is to be used only by the person

142
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,940
to whom it is prescribed.

143
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,420
Do not operate a motor vehicle following viewing.

144
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,100
Do not operate heavy farm machinery at speeds over 70 miles an hour.

145
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,200
The demons you may see during the initial hallucination sequence are not real.

146
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,580
If you do not panic, this phase will end after a few minutes.

147
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,680
Always resurface from the hypnosis slowly.

148
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Coming out of the tape has been likened to a total rebirth process,

149
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,800
if managed correctly.

150
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,260
If you have trouble re-entering the earth plane,

151
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,940
focus on Bob and chant his name until you remember your own.

152
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,820
Bob and Bob

00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,520

Bob and Bob ...

165
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:01,700


166
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:01,700


167
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:01,700


168
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:01,700


169
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:14,720
Bob and I....

170
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,340
Bob and Bob Duran!

171
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,560


172
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,560


173
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,560


174
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,560


175
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,560


176
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,560


177
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,560


178
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:15,560


179
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,280
projected. These reactions

180
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,580
are normal. Enjoy

181
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:19,920
them.

182
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,340
Mom?

183
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,800
Mom?

184
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,080
That's your key phrase.

185
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,920
It will trigger the entire message

186
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,940
without your being aware of it.

187
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,080
Three, two,

188
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,360
and one.

189
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,980
Now to continue with the

190
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,260
recording.

191
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,440
Ah,

192
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,560
yes, dear

193
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,360
friends. Welcome back

194
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,860
to the subgenius

195
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,920
radio ministry.

196
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,080
Hour of Slack.

197
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,120
In this case,

198
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,960
number nine hundred

199
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,800
and thirty

200
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,340
two.

201
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,280
Nine hundred and

202
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,500
thirty two.

203
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,420
That's two, two, three,

204
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,200
nine, three, two.

205
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,000
Blonde.

206
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,060
Squids.

207
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,220
Fiery, fiery squids.

208
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,300
Yes, squids.

209
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,960
It's the squid fight time.

210
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,340
Time for

211
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,700
Matador Dave

212
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,340
to move out into the ring

213
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,980
and fight the enraged prairie squid

214
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,640
as it is tortured

215
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,140
and pestered by the men on horseback

216
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,760
with their little squid

217
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,380
prickers.

218
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,160
He's waving the psychedelic

219
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,780
paisley cape in front of the

220
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,760
enraged squid as it

221
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,800
paws the ground with its tentacles.

222
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,160
I see a sign from the

223
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,040
netherworlds.

224
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,240
Look, his neck is bleeding, too.

225
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,860
His neck is breathing?

226
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,420
Yes.

227
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,260
That's a bad sign.

228
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,420
Yeah, not so bad when the lungs

229
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,620
go right up off the top.

230
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:55,880
Look.

231
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,280
He's more capable than the other one.

232
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,760
That's no prairie squid.

233
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,080
That's a triceratops.

234
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,460
My God, these creatures

235
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,980
supposedly went extinct

236
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,940
over ten billion years

237
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,580
ago. And yet there,

238
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,280
lonesome cow I gave, ready to fight.

239
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,880
This is what we call time control, dear friends.

240
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,140
My suit of light is vestido

241
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,600
de lute.

242
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,740
Time control.

243
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,780
And it appears that he is ready to pull

244
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,640
forth his muleta. The muleta is for

245
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,740
tickling and sparing the bull

246
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,240
before it's entreated and

247
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,440
made of the turpid. That's a bull squid

248
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,400
you're talking about. It is a gigantic bull squid.

249
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,820
I've never seen someone with such a large...

250
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,900
Yeah, that's a bunch of bull squid. You're talking bull squid.

251
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,440
Okay.

252
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,520
There's a lot of leavings behind on this one

253
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,600
so we hope it's a slippery fight for a lonesome

254
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,980
swine boy in the hole of a...

255
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,120
Oh, that's right. Lonesome Swine Boy is here, right?

256
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,760
Oh, and I didn't mean him. I meant the one on the microphone.

257
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,820
Yes, Lonesome Swine Boy. Not Rob. Rob is Lonesome...

258
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,360
That's Lonesome Bovine Boy.

259
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,340
The one with the huge dripping ears.

260
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,360
Lonesome Char-Boy.

261
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,820
Lonesome Char-Boy.

262
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:15,660
Anyway, friends, we're... Yes, we dragged the Dave thing and the Princess Wee and the whole thing.

263
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,020
We dragged our muscles.

264
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,540
Everybody but Bob down into the studio.

265
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:29,700
And what we just heard earlier was, in fact, yes, the introduction to the Arise subgenius movie, which is now on DVD.

266
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,340
Yes, so you can... Well, you can hear the improved soundtrack on this show.

267
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,420
That's what I've been playing.

268
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:38,780
The new...

269
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,400
Improved soundtrack from...

270
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,200
You can replicate your brain cells, too.

271
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,020
It's new and improved.

272
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,680
Yes, it's as easy as remaking your liver in a pie.

273
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,540
Brain cells grow where they want to.

274
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,180
A friend told us last time you had you a great big steaming hot polo.

275
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,960
Wolf brand hair liver pie brain cells.

276
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Well, that's too long.

277
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,140
Well, that's way too long, friends.

278
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,840
Sit down by the old campfire and share the spell.

279
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,240
Grandma's going to bring you heaping and humping.

280
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,860
That's right. Take off your hat now.

281
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,600
And let's see your hands.

282
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,280
Oh, boy, you're not ready for eating that yet.

283
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,880
You got to get down there and wash your hands off.

284
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,380
Remove your cuticles.

285
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,900
That's right. Pull your nails right, right on.

286
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Ow! Ow!

287
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,140
Okay, now you all...

288
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,280
I noticed you're getting a little bit of trouble back here by the mastoid bone.

289
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,520
Pop out some of them wisdom teeth, too.

290
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,480
Okay, okay, enough of the pornography, you guys.

291
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,760
We don't need any more live...

292
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,980
We've heard enough live sex in this show.

293
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,220
Remember, we jump from thing to thing real fast.

294
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,980
Here's the other thing.

295
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,240
Me!

296
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,460
Obviously, the problem is, the less you know, the more...

297
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,960
And this is very true.

298
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,460
It's easy for me as an old fart to say this about kids.

299
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,140
The less you know, the more sure you are of what you do know.

300
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,180
And contrary-wise, the more you know, the less sure you are of any of it.

301
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:02,400
Thus, my very weak beliefs, you know, and fluid, you know, believe-me-out-of-it routine,

302
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,480
with the aliens giving extra time to the crop circle makers,

303
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,000
and those of us who are...

304
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,280
Finally inspired skeptics.

305
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:18,440
I, one time, was in a situation where everybody else at the trailer court saw the UFO.

306
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,220
And I was standing out there, and I didn't see a damn thing.

307
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,800
Now, how am I supposed to take that as a defined message from the aliens?

308
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,360
Obviously, not to believe it.

309
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,440
So, you know, we'll stick with the contradictions that make good sense.

310
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,560
Thank you very much.

311
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:45,420
I have never been able to get into this comforting, post-modernist mumbo-jumbo,

312
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,400
because I'm kind of a post-mumbo-jumbo as myself.

313
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,480
I've heard it all.

314
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,260
Screw the new age.

315
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,820
No blood for snake oil, I say.

316
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,720
And kids, you should leave world domination up to the crop professionals.

317
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,040
Gluing, as Chris Brooks' son said,

318
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,620
gluing feathers to your ass does not make you a rooster.

319
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,060
So, you know, they're just kind of chill.

320
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,840
I used to believe strongly in the afterlife,

321
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,600
because I've been to several Native American seances

322
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,940
before I suddenly, one day, realized how they did it.

323
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,980
And some people really...

324
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,740
I mean, the afterlife is a beautiful thing.

325
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,480
A lot of people say that death is great,

326
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,220
although I've noticed that most of the people who say that are not actually trying yet.

327
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,180
And the ones who have, haven't been getting glowing reviews, everybody.

328
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,420
They're getting very quiet now.

329
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,020
Who are they trying to hide?

330
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,380
Good.

331
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,060
Good.

332
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,020
Can you say it faster?

333
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,580
I can do anything.

334
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,880
I can do anything.

335
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,900
Here we go.

336
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:18,620
Here we go.

337
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,380
Here we go.

338
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,820
Here we go.

339
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:38,900
Here we go.

340
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:39,420
Here we go.

341
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,120
Here we go.

342
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,100
Here we go.

343
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,000
Here we go.

344
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,760
Here we go.

345
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,000
Here we go.

346
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,960
The theory is that all matter is composed of at least three fundamental particles.

347
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,520
Protons, electrons, neutrons.

348
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,620
Protons are charged positive.

349
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,560
By now you guessed it.

350
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,340
Electrons are probably negatively charged.

351
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,440
Neutrons don't follow either.

352
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,300
Neutral in the middle.

353
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,100
Only no apologies.

354
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,080
Centered, unmoved by yin and yang ideologies.

355
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,940
Neutron bomb songs.

356
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,800
Electron theory.

357
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,540
Dozen musical radio activity.

358
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,800
Different points in your brain.

359
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,560
Within infinity

360
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,500
Oxygen and hydrogen alive

361
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,940
Within all types of energy

362
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,380
Within all types of energy

363
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,800
Within all types of energy

364
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,280
Within all types of energy

365
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,680
Within all types of energy

366
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,360
Inside a world inside a world inside a universe

367
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,700
Inside of me existing although I can't see it

368
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,480
See it

369
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,780
Hydrocarbon, nitrogen cycle ionization

370
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,020
Heavier than electromotive metals that weigh over a ton

371
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,220
This has been the chemist black a licious creation

372
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,140
Clean out your desk put your papers away

373
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,540
Cause class is almost done

374
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,440
All aboard for the night train

375
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,280
This is chemistry

376
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,200
Plus calisthenics

377
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,360
Calcium plus potassium

378
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,920
Magnesium use paper of sodium

379
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,700
Sulfate your solvent chloroform

380
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,760
Remedy from the normal

381
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,040
Glycerin puristorm titanium

382
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,760
Brain is blown away I want this new

383
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,320
Fee a sound of water or vibration for me

384
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,140
That I need that's I'm legit

385
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,940
Contagious and leegious

386
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
And equal to be a system media

387
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,300
You're eager to be here and leave you can see it

388
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,180
I know what I'm going on I'm thinking

389
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,340
I'm thinking I'm streaming I'm going on

390
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,940
I'm thinking I'm going on

391
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,280
I'm going on

392
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm going on

393
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:11,440


394
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,240
And that was in fact black a licious

395
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,460
Here is Bob1 for A1 Slack

396
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,960
Hi this is Bob1

397
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,320
Years ago my grandfather Abner1

398
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,700
Known for short because he was

399
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,040
Invented the A1 Slack

400
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,080
However today's go go action now generation man on campus and off

401
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,620
Wants a little more out of life

402
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,120
So we added another leg to our super slim trim fitting A1 Slack

403
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,860
And came up with super slim trim fitting A1 Slack

404
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,980
A1 Slack's the two legged action slacks for the two legged action man

405
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,700
Thank you Bob

406
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,140
You're welcome

407
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,520
And now back to our movie

408
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,860
And what was that movie

409
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,660
I can't remember

410
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,160
It was the movie that

411
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,680
How old was that movie

412
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,060
Oh trip to the far east

413
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,040
Trip to the far east is the tonight's

414
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,400
Hell hole feature

415
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,120
I believe this was

416
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,780
Fire sign theater

417
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,820
In Singapore wasn't it

418
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,620
Remember the fire sign theater Dave

419
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,920
I unfortunately remember them coming to my home

420
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,680
Dressed up as little little

421
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,460
Wise men

422
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,880
It was on a Sunday just before Christmas

423
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,720
Do you like me remember every fire sign theater line from every comedy album they did

424
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,600
Only when reminded

425
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,980
But do you like me hate the people who quote fire sign theater lines incessantly

426
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes I abjectly

427
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,540
I strangle them while they strangle me

428
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,840
And then they start quoting each other backwards

429
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,200
And there's even more fist fights ensuing

430
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,900
Luckily the fire sign quoting people are far outnumbered

431
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,420
By the Monty Python quoting people

432
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,520
Which is much less embarrassing to me personally

433
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,780
That's embarrassing to me

434
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,540
Because I don't

435
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:52,780
I do not want to be reminded every five seconds of the scene where the guy rips off his arms and stuff

436
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,000
And says oh excuse me or whatever it is

437
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,260
Yeah

438
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,520
You know I've actually put

439
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,200
I've put a person's eye out

440
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,780
Of his own misery I suppose

441
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,740
Because it was an errant prisoner convict eye but

442
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,820
Speaking of early influences and

443
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,080
And limbs that have been removed

444
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,740
I was thinking how many bands that I know and hang with and record

445
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,460
Who were

446
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,420
Whose primary influence seems to have been the Three Stooges

447
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,220
Well of course

448
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,360
I was thinking about it Devo, Gwar, the Amino Acids

449
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,520
Last night we saw Man by the way

450
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,260
By the way that reminds me

451
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,940
We have a subgenius revival coming up

452
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,860
I wouldn't want to recommend that anyone

453
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,720
A thousand years from now

454
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,400
Go to it

455
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,120
Yes luckily it's a long ways off

456
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,180
Thank Dobbs

457
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,660
It's not until May 22nd but we did call the Beachland Ballroom

458
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,480
And they said that they would allow us once again to go in there and preach

459
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,660
That's Memorial Day weekend

460
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,620
Yeah and all those people will be post hoc by then

461
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,620
May 22nd

462
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,060
Yeah

463
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,760
And they're at Saturday night

464
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,040
I thought it was May 29th was the weekend

465
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,640
At the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland

466
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,460
Oh you should know you're a government

467
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,560
I don't think so

468
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,880
No in Cleveland is where we're doing it

469
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,720
Well thank God you know

470
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,400
Because you know the softer the conscience sound

471
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,680
The easier it is to get over

472
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,140
Yeah

473
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,560
On the people especially if they've been consuming the stuff

474
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,460
But they were going to let Man come to that

475
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,040
Even by the who is now Man Incorporated by the way

476
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,480
It turns out there was a band in England called Man

477
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,980
Well don't worry they'll emasculate him sometimes

478
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,700
For the last 30 years

479
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,880
They'll find his family jewels

480
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,200
Right

481
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,980
And try to bite him off

482
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,680
Soon he'll be

483
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,060
That's what they do

484
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,940
Woman Man, Girly Man

485
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,480
Yes

486
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,100
And the Amino Acids who are the most Three Stooges influenced

487
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,860
Thrash surf band that I know of

488
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,400
Aguar not being really a thrash

489
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,240
A thrash band but not a surf band

490
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,500
Well the Clocks were so

491
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,040
The band I was in in the 80s early 80s

492
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,660
Was so Three Stooges influenced

493
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,160
That one time after practice

494
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,500
The bass player was doing Curly

495
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,320
And he was going whoop whoop whoop

496
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,060
And doing all this stuff

497
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,820
And we were like you know smoking and drinking

498
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,760
And just like errantly half paying attention to him

499
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,040
And he fell down

500
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,900
And this is a true story

501
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,620
He fell down

502
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,460
Oh my goodness

503
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,240
He fell down

504
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,320
And he was in a pool

505
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,620
And he was in a pool

506
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,740
And a flower pot landed on his head

507
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,560
The flower pot broke

508
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,200
Are we not mad

509
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,700
Leaving

510
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,400
No the flower pot broke

511
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,220
Leaving

512
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,880
And we call it the slapstick miracle

513
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,820
Leaving the flower on top of his head

514
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,300
Suddenly everybody was paying attention to him

515
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:19,980
And said what the

516
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,340
Are we allowed to say the other word

517
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,600
No

518
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,900
What the heck you know

519
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,460
That's never really happened

520
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,120
Like just like in the cartoons

521
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,800
In the cartoons everybody their jaws dropped

522
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,760
Their drawers dropped

523
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,600
And of course their eyelids were drooping

524
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:31,920
There have been

525
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,840
A surprising number of cartoon like events

526
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,080
Oh my god

527
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,080


528
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,080


529
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,080


530
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,760
That's in my life

531
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Well you were a heroin addict for 14 years

532
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,880
So that explains a lot of these

533
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,580
Things that you call

534
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,140
Cartoon experiences

535
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,980
Dave Dave

536
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,080
I was an ex-lax abuser

537
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,460
And I was

538
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,300
Well that's what you like to call you modern people

539
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,980
I was self abused

540
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,480
I've read there's a

541
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,260
You can't perform a colonoscopy with your own arm

542
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,440
I mean come on man

543
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,700
You know you've done a lot of strange things to yourself

544
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,260
Well I found that out the hard way now didn't I

545
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,840
Yeah you did

546
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,200
I guess we all did

547
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,620
And we shouldn't have attended

548
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,320
Now you were about to tell us about some onion article

549
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,640
That you had read that was

550
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,700
Well it made me feel a lot better

551
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,900
Apparently there's a hell of a lot of people in America

552
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,160
Who a lot more than anyone ever thought

553
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,420
Who are victims of self abuse

554
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,560
And most of them don't report it

555
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,420
That was the big part

556
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,160
What I thought was the interesting part of the article

557
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,380
You don't want to tell on your partner

558
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,380
Because then you know

559
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,700
They'll never want to talk to you again

560
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,240
It said 99%

561
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,500
99% of men do not report

562
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,700
Their self abuse

563
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,820
When they're self abused

564
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,640
Now Rob for instance

565
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,740
Whose show is after

566
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,060
Well he's part of the 1%

567
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,660
That does report it every time

568
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,980
But the interesting thing was

569
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,480
And he's been warned by 911

570
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,060
To stop bugging them

571
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,320
Only 87% of women don't report self abuse

572
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,120
Isn't that weird

573
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,680
Leaving yes

574
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,820
13% do

575
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,520
See it shows

576
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,580
Actually brag about it

577
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,780
The more equipment you have

578
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,460
The more things you have to clean

579
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,720
The more you know

580
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,560
Things you have to like

581
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,920
Put weird polishes on

582
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,220
And stuff like that

583
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,340
So you're better off

584
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,500
Like with your fundamental equipment

585
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,000
Which is a tool bar

586
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,680
A crow bar

587
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,980
And a rectum

588
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,000
That's good

589
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,680
But I have to

590
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,180
No it was not

591
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,340
It didn't have to do with that

592
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:18,900
I'm sorry

593
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,320
I have to play the news now

594
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,320
Alarm Santa Fe parents

595
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,080
Met again with elementary school officials

596
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,120
Last night

597
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,580
To discuss the growing presence

598
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,580
Of Bob in the schools

599
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,040
Bob the deity

600
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,220
Of the Dallas based church

601
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,120
Of the subgenius

602
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,580
Is a comic book character

603
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,720
Who communicates with aliens

604
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,760
And worships money

605
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,800
Parents and teachers complain

606
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,720
That the Bob stickers and pamphlets

607
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,860
Which have turned up

608
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,540
In school laboratories

609
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,820
With increasing frequency

610
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,440
Encourage troublemakers

611
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,280
And weird behavior

612
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,100
It's not healthy for the children

613
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,440
I'm convinced of this

614
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,460
There has been a pamphlet going around

615
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,960
A Bob pamphlet

616
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,640
That I have looked at

617
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,260
And it's the least well adjusted children

618
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:00,680
Really

619
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,380
It tells them

620
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,220
The impact of the pandemic

621
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,520
On the world

622
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:04,520


623
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:04,840
They're so uncomfortable

624
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,980
With their classmates

625
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,120
It is because

626
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,000
They are better

627
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,040
Than their classmates

628
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,260
Can you imagine this?

629
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,660
Better

630
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,420
Can you imagine that?

631
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,220
Not smarter mind you

632
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,800
But better

633
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,360
Not smarter

634
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,480
What kind of

635
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,060
Syllogistic logic is this?

636
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,420
It's the logic of Bob

637
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,020
My friends

638
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,100
Bob's got a better deal

639
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,680
For you

640
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,220
A logic of a heart

641
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,080
So stuffed

642
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,020
Full of cheese

643
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,800
And so discorporeal

644
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,900
That no one

645
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,680
Can believe

646
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,700
In its existence

647
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,260
Obvious

648
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,680
He's got something

649
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,180
For you

650
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,900
That you can't

651
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,220
Even imagine

652
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,860
Imagine friends

653
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,500
Bob loves you

654
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,920
Oh Bob's loving you

655
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,760
And he's got something

656
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,660
For you called slack

657
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,540
Imagine the kitty cat

658
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,340
In the wells

659
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,200
Crying out to you

660
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,580
A little small baby cat

661
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,760
Perhaps only with one good eye

662
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,420
And perhaps muffled paws

663
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,640
Crying out of the well

664
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,040
Save me

665
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,980
Save me

666
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,880
Bob

667
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,240
He's got better things baby

668
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,920
He loves you

669
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,380
He's got

670
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,500
He's got

671
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,740
Like the what?

672
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,220
Like the what?

673
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,920
The Holy Ghost and the Fire

674
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,540
Yes

675
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,180
The Holy Ghost and the Fire

676
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


677
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


678
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


679
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


680
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


681
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


682
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,180


683
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,820
They consume together

684
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,660
And he'll make you sing like this

685
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,500
Now they're like a lot more

686
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,700
Oh I'm sorry

687
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,240
They were singing about Jesus

688
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,700
No they're singing

689
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,920
They are singing and

690
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,720
Jesus may actually have better things for you than Bob

691
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,380
They're singing

692
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,720
I don't know

693
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,380
I'm going to go see that movie about Jesus

694
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,560
I understood he was like a real tough dude

695
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,580
Well, he was into steroids and stuff like primitive Roman steroids.

696
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:44,540
He used to eat like palm clusters and force his way with goats and sheep and stuff like that.

697
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,260
The Lord?

698
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,360
The Lord, of course, was a robust, raw bone.

699
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,540
He was a prince of love and peace.

700
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,320
He loved the animals.

701
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,600
He loved the children.

702
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,320
He loves you, Dave.

703
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,120
Jesus loves you right this minute.

704
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,220
Piece of bladder, piece of neck, piece of arm, piece of mutton.

705
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,580
Jesus didn't care about the poor folks.

706
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,380
He just wanted a piece.

707
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,300
Yes.

708
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:06,640
Peace.

709
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,000
The prince of peace.

710
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,700
Are we being blasphemous?

711
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,680
Blasphemous?

712
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,480
You haven't taken your palsy medicine today.

713
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,140
It looks like your knees are shaking.

714
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,060
Sit down, honey.

715
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,260
Stop disturbing the reverend's things.

716
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,540
I can't do it.

717
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,360
Don't, don't, don't.

718
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,660
No reason to raise your voice.

719
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,480
You'll get all full of sweat and tears.

720
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,180
We'll take care of it.

721
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,180
I'll have a talk with him.

722
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,180
You know, we don't have nothing against Jesus.

723
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,120
It's just some members.

724
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,900
Members of his fan club occasionally make him look bad.

725
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,920
Jesus and Bob are old drinking buddies from way back.

726
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,420
And I mean way, way back.

727
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,200
Way back before the wheel was probably even conceived of.

728
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,640
Back before the way back machine was even invented.

729
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,600
And that was before.

730
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,360
That is impossible.

731
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,420
I know, I know.

732
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
But yet, and yet, that's the way it is.

733
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,800
It's the way back.

734
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,060
It's like a five.

735
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,740
It's, I forget, what number is it again?

736
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:02,040
It's like a time machine that keeps coming back and reinventing itself over and over and over and over.

737
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,500
Over and over and over and over again.

738
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,200
And look into the bright mandala.

739
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:13,720
And see the shining, glistening, smelly, yet urbane face of pooper M.G. Harvey.

740
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,640
Then that Robert Tofty arm.

741
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,720
Blah, blah.

742
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,620
Is this the surrealist part of the show?

743
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,780
This is the part of the show where you're expected to become very sleepy.

744
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,140
Wave your hands.

745
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,040
This is the part of the show where you'll contact your secret.

746
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:32,560
Self.

747
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,460
Gaze into my pointed goatee.

748
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,680
This is the part of your mind that is unregulated and wired.

749
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,880
Follow the bushy eyebrows.

750
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,500
Or the veil.

751
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,420
The blue brush.

752
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,980
Beneath the sandy exterior.

753
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,620
What the hell are you talking about?

754
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,120
Beneath the sandy exterior.

755
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,780
Is the very hideous interior where the soul resides.

756
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,080
Which, is this what makes it all look so ugly?

757
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,060
And smell so funny?

758
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,460
And yet, it's an eternal object, the soul is.

759
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,320
Immortal.

760
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,300
Permanent.

761
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:12,880
Unchangeable.

762
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,460
It's the same soul from life to life as it hops from one birth to another.

763
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,920
Yes, I'm going to watch the manifestation of the chi going down through the different meridians.

764
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,200
I'll go through the triple burner all the way down to the spleen.

765
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,460
And then all the way back up again.

766
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,780
Like a huge.

767
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,060
Huge highway of chi.

768
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,780
One lifetime reborn as a cockroach.

769
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,240
Another time as a Shaolin priest.

770
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,360
Another time as a piece of software.

771
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,600
A photoshop improvement or something.

772
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
A sleepy woman on a bus won't wake up.

773
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,560
There are many forms that consciousness may take.

774
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,660
And each one of them represents the active part of.

775
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Part of.

776
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,340
Yes, friends.

777
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,000
Represents the active part of.

778
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,980
An act of will.

779
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,960
Will is what will bring time control into you.

780
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,320
An act of will and the right kind of rock music playing loud in the background.

781
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,120
Corny enough, rock band will make even your terrible film soundtracks sell.

782
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,540
Everything will coalesce.

783
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,860
Look at those credits rolling by.

784
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,900
Everything seems so effective and yet so unreal.

785
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,260
I'm still excited by the last thing I just saw, which was.

786
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,040
Mom?

787
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,360
Wise up.

788
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,540
They're out to get you.

789
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,800
The difficulty was smashed by a global conspiracy.

790
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,720
Weird men arise.

791
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,480
Find out who they are and how to smash them.

792
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,940
You probably already knew that the U.S. government is a sham.

793
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,380
Something propped up there for you to blame.

794
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,600
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

795
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,920
That they are actually shambling?

796
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,020
Unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable things?

797
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,860
Yes.

798
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,180
Yes.

799
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:05,540
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet.

800
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,700
Defy the sinister star forces which mock us all.

801
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,980
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.

802
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,860
God has been misquoted all this time.

803
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:29,960
His actual words may disturb you, but Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind.

804
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:29,960


805
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,500
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.

806
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,440
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

807
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,220
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

808
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,080
Dobbs sees the world entering a new aeon.

809
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,100
Which, in a few years, will bring more wondrous and miraculous change and carnage, insanity, and destruction

810
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,420
than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

811
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,060
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

812
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:14,540
A time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power to those in the know.

813
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:21,400
While billions of deserving conspiracy dupes fry in hell on Earth.

814
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:28,360
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob, will usher in a spiritual rebrief.

815
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,080
And it can't be.

816
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:37,320
A cascade of astounding mysteries, supernatural riches, and a restoration of lost psychic abilities

817
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:43,860
that will totally transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

818
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,480
That's right. You're lucky to live in the end times.

819
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,980
Here's more money, Bob!

820
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,020
Ah!

821
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,540
I'm so lucky!

822
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,440
Ah, yeah.

823
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,760
I'm very lucky.

824
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,020
Ah, yeah.

825
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,300
Well, I think the world, uh, owes us an apology.

826
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,940
And not only a living, but an apology for sure.

827
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:15,120
A living, an apology, and a firm handshake, and I think probably a spare preternatal eyeball somewhere we could put, where we could look behind our heads.

828
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,200
And that's what Rammstein here is trying to tell us. Let's just listen.

829
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,620
Super deep!

830
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,280
I love you!

831
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,040
Ha! Take my hand in the painting!

832
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,660
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!

833
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,080
Don't you dare whine about my head!

834
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,720
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!

835
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,460
You're not gonna be such an old whore!

836
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,140
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!

837
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,840
All women are the same!

838
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,000
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!

839
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,300
I'm a nice girl with a very pretty body.

840
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,980
I love kissing.

841
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,880
Yes, man.

842
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,720
I love kissing.

843
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:52,320
With my blonde hair I always got a golden ring and all kinds of things.

844
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,620
Why? Tell me why!

845
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,860
Why are women so stupid?

846
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,200
They're not necessary and forbidden.

847
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,460
I mean, I don't need them for cooking, because I have a strong sense of humor.

848
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,580
And for clothing, they don't need it either, because I have the same suit on anyway.

849
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,300
So, take my hand in the painting!

850
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,000
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!

851
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,400
Don't you dare whine about my head!

852
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,640
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!

853
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,660
You're not gonna be such an old whore!

854
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,420
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!

855
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,120
All women are the same!

856
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,500
Ah, ah, ah, yeah!

857
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,300
Well, honey, what do you think of it?

858
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,120
You know what? Give me your number!

859
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,720
Next week I'm gonna get my bra on the floor and come and get you!

860
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,300
You're a whore!

861
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:29,940
Oh!

862
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
I think it was a conceptual zygote.

863
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,080
I have a weird idea, which is...

864
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,940
Bubblehead...

865
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,060
Yeah, see, we're on the same wavelength.

866
00:32:59,340 --> 00:32:59,920
She said bubble?

867
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,600
It's a love song, I think.

868
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,500
You know, I have the potential...

869
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,080
We have the potential of doing a theme show about love.

870
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,200
Oh, okay.

871
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,280
Because I've got a bunch of beatnik love songs.

872
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,480
Beatnik love songs?

873
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,100
Yeah, beatnik.

874
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:12,860
You'd recognize...

875
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,360
There's a Lenny Bruce...

876
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,260
Oh, yeah, cool.

877
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,160
Edward Burns, Sheldon Allman...

878
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,600
Oh, all those people.

879
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,160
Ed Kooky Burns, I suppose.

880
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,500
Yes.

881
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,820
The guy with the extreme...

882
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,300
That's right.

883
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,180
That's right.

884
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,040
Here, let's go ahead and see what...

885
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,640
Really out there, dudes.

886
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,100
...how it works.

887
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,300
Days became weeks.

888
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,760
The weeks, months...

889
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,200
That's Lenny.

890
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,340
...and the numbers on his great chart representing experiments mounted into the hundreds.

891
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:44,060
And gradually, the lines grew farther and farther until the numbers on the chart reached

892
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,680
666 and the lines were the width of the chart apart.

893
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,340
I am a...

894
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,340
I am a...

895
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:51,480
I am a...

896
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:51,920
I am a...

897
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:51,920


898
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:57,700
...a voice that no man on earth has ever heard before.

899
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,040
I am not a...

900
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,340
J.R.

901
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,920
I am not a...

902
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,220
...a...

903
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,220


904
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,280
J.R.

905
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,260
It's me?

906
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,080
Could it be?

907
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,500
I've only known you a week, but I die for you.

908
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:06,980
That's kind.

909
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,380
Oh, my God.

910
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,080
That sounds like the...

911
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,400
Listen.

912
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,860
I warned you it was a trap.

913
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,760
We'll never again see Dixon alive.

914
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,360
I told you not to trust foreigners.

915
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,500
Just give me their word and I'll blast them all into kingdom come.

916
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,400
You must...

917
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:21,480
That's good.

918
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:21,480


919
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:21,480


920
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:21,480


921
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,320
He's only one man.

922
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,320
The rest of us are different.

923
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,120
Are you?

924
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,420
Yeah, like the one with the forehead.

925
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,120
From another part of yours.

926
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,900
We are trying to reach you,

927
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,680
planet three.

928
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,100
We are trying

929
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,740
to reach you,

930
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,480
planet three.

931
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,160
Shut up.

932
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,520
Can you understand me?

933
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,240
Okay.

934
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,420
Thanks, sweet Adeline.

935
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,900
Really, Mr. Donaldson, what a ridiculous request.

936
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,020
You think the best scientific brains

937
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,120
in the country worked for six years for a brother?

938
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:55,980
Peter

939
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,640
Adeline.

940
00:34:59,600 --> 00:34:59,740
Parents.

941
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,840
Good Lord, man.

942
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,920
Open your eyes.

943
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,280
Okay, here's a love song by Sheldon Allman.

944
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,400
Hark to my tale

945
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,580
of a very tragic love

946
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,200
most grievous

947
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,700
to relate

948
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,440
to star-crossed

949
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,600
lovers

950
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,400
with a perfect love

951
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,120
they could not

952
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,660
consummate

953
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,420
their love was

954
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,660
constant, their love was

955
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,540
true, but of passion

956
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,720
it was devoid

957
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,580
for he

958
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,600
was a univac

959
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,000
mark two

960
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
and she was an

961
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,400
XF-1

962
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,860
humanoid

963
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,360
humanoid

964
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
she gazed

965
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,380
at him and a tear

966
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,660
was in her eye

967
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,500
to her love was denied

968
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,020
her lover stood

969
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,320
for mighty stories high

970
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,000
and he was

971
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,720
one block wide

972
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,840
how could

973
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,540
they do the impossible

974
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,340
how could

975
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,520
their love be

976
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,400
enjoyed

977
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,880
when he was a univac

978
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,260
mark two

979
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,660
and she was an XF-1

980
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,780
humanoid

981
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,680
and each to each

982
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,800
on wavelengths ultra high

983
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,380
they whispered secretly

984
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,140
of transistors

985
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,320
and gears and shafts

986
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,000
and cams

987
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,880
and printed circuitry

988
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,060
and so

989
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,420
time passed for the two

990
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,640
of them

991
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,840
in the place where they were

992
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,940
employed

993
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,160
where he was a

994
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,160
univac mark

995
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,740
two and she

996
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,080
was an XF-1

997
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,800
humanoid

998
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,440
oh hush your sobs

999
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,440
my pretty little miss

1000
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,120
and dry those

1001
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,660
oily tears

1002
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,060
you know that robots

1003
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,000
can't afford to cry

1004
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,280
for it surely

1005
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
rusts their gears

1006
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,720
you must give up

1007
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,860
all these thoughts of love

1008
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,560
though it leave you

1009
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,220
an aching void

1010
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,320
give up on this univac

1011
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,940
mark two

1012
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,040
and find you

1013
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
an XM-1

1014
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:49,820
humanoid

1015
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:54,390
un hu man oi

1016
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,530
better punchy than 98

1017
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:06,530


1018
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,230
I'm being mushy and everything

1019
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,430
now I don't know

1020
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,310
if I was doing the same rat last year

1021
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,510
that involved a

1022
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:18,290
a list of thirteen priorities in life

1023
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,230
yes

1024
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,850
Yeah, some people saw that.

1025
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,470
It was, you know, you're going to be middle-aged, and you start going, well, wait a minute.

1026
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,150
I'm going to make a list so I don't forget something important.

1027
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:31,430
I had been forgetting some important stuff.

1028
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:43,850
Slack was only number seven right on the list because the tie came after breathing, often forgotten number one, drinking water, peeing.

1029
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,170
The kids don't even think about it.

1030
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,250
Eating food.

1031
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:48,690
Shitting.

1032
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,250
I mean, think about it.

1033
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,150
These are priorities, friends.

1034
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,790
You're not going anywhere until you've done those first four or five.

1035
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,130
Sleeping, which you had another one.

1036
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,190
Finally, money came somewhere after Slack.

1037
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,870
And then you're back and offering, and then sex.

1038
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,930
You're back and offering.

1039
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,130
You came before sex.

1040
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,190
If something against her, say, that's real funny.

1041
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,070
You will see.

1042
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,610
You will see.

1043
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:16,770
You will see.

1044
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:21,190
Bob and sex weren't even in the top ten.

1045
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:27,230
Some might, actually nobody noticed, but I noticed.

1046
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,890
The word love was not on that list.

1047
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,690
Love wasn't on that list.

1048
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:39,690
And when I realized that, I went, oh, I guess I really am an asshole.

1049
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,790
Then I remembered, I don't want too much applause, please.

1050
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,590
Thank you.

1051
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:46,590


1052
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:46,590


1053
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,790
You know, quote, love is the word itself.

1054
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,650
It's corny, just that word.

1055
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:55,070
And also, friends, let's face it.

1056
00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:00,350
It's painfully obvious that it's possible to live for quite a long, long time

1057
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,390
without ever having any love at all.

1058
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:08,250
And we are surrounded by assholes who do that very thing quite spectacularly.

1059
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:12,550
However, Slack is completely open-ended term.

1060
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,030
It means something different for every single person.

1061
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,850
And it's usually comprised of very vague elements.

1062
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:24,510
Most of them aren't even spoken or not easily put into words.

1063
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:30,170
And for some of us, love might be in that mix somewhere.

1064
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:36,930
In fact, I suppose that for some people, Slack and love might be indistinguishable.

1065
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,730
And I don't want to demean those for whom hate is Slack, praise Bob.

1066
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,330
There should always, always be equal hate around.

1067
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,410
You know, we...

1068
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,550
But there was one of the younger preachers, Reverend Alex,

1069
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:59,530
the ex-day, was enough of a wuss or man enough to verbalize the love-Slack comparison.

1070
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:03,310
And it was kind of reassuring to see somebody do that

1071
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:08,170
because hate-Slack has been really well covered by the subjugus experts over the years.

1072
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:10,370
I don't need to rub that in.

1073
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,210
Jack said,

1074
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,790
andmp inequalities are so smallon us.

1075
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,270
I'm going to tell this.

1076
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:33,310


1077
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:33,310


1078
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:33,310


1079
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:33,770
Mrs. So traders don't buy that control at all.

1080
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:33,770


1081
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,170
In fact, I've known those traditional dishes

1082
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:35,710
and drug chokingmer laws for way too long.

1083
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:35,710


1084
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:35,710


1085
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:35,710


1086
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:35,710


1087
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:35,770
I feel pulled off.

1088
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:35,770


1089
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,890
No, I really am.

1090
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,150
Anyway,

1091
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:43,890
our fucking together

1092
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,950
we have to burns in a hangout.

1093
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,590
Co� CoRс

1094
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,710
Like, I don't want to swing without you, baby.

1095
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,810
Like holy mackerel, kingfish.

1096
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:51,890
And.

1097
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,750
Be hip, baby, I'm jelly.

1098
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,450
Like I've had big eyes for you since we popped at the hop.

1099
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:01,670
I mean, I get sounds when I think of you.

1100
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,370
Like sky-fi.

1101
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:04,330
Ooh, doobie-doo.

1102
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:05,930
Zip.

1103
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,850
Like, no, baby.

1104
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,690
This is your love burger from the other AM.

1105
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,190
Man, it was a wig.

1106
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,190
So far out, like I'm still orbiting.

1107
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:17,850
Shazam.

1108
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:19,770
Irwin?

1109
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,830
No noise like that.

1110
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,030
Let me straighten you.

1111
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,690
The drive-in movie.

1112
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,030
You and me on the backseat of my motorcycle.

1113
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,770
Wow, Jepica.

1114
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,750
I mean, I thought you were driving.

1115
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,370
Cool, cool, cool.

1116
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,090
Tony.

1117
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,470
Baby, let me clue you.

1118
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,390
Like, you're my leader.

1119
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,730
Let's do a double gig.

1120
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,550
I know crazy coffee pans.

1121
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:52,010
The Dad Class.

1122
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:56,690
What they got today, I can't even ride.

1123
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:56,690


1124
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:07,090
Don't talk, Jepa.

1125
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:07,090


1126
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:14,270
Don't think you know anything about après-bicamente,

1127
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,750
with kids who bleep up your numerous

1128
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:15,770
coworkers on everything.

1129
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:15,910
Yeah.

1130
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:16,210
Come on.

1131
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,050
Marsha? But this isn't Marsha.

1132
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,170
Is this sunset 77777?

1133
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:26,130
No, this is national 92600.

1134
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,050
Uh-oh.

1135
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,730
Well, don't bug me with details, baby. It's my last time.

1136
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,310
Just clue me where you live.

1137
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,250
This is me, Kooky.

1138
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,950
Wow, crazy, huh?

1139
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,070
Question.

1140
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,490
I depend on me.

1141
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,110
Throw your.

1142
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:17,310
Hands up at me.

1143
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,250
Throw your.

1144
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,350
Hands up at me.

1145
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,770
Roll your hands up at me.

1146
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,470
Roll your hands up at me, girl.

1147
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,350
I didn't know you could get down like Charlie.

1148
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,670
How do you angels get down?

1149
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,550
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like Charlie.

1150
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,310
How do you angels get down like that?

1151
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:46,970
Question?

1152
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,190
Question?

1153
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,690
Question?

1154
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,410
Question?

1155
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,650
Question?

1156
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,450
the backpack backpack.

1157
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,190
Okay, further

1158
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,190
inquiry on... Anyway, friends,

1159
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:54,150
that was, uh, that last song

1160
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,510
was by

1161
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:57,950
something called Elbow.

1162
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,330
I download this

1163
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,810
stuff from Alt Binary Slack.

1164
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:03,770
Oh, Dave's ripping off

1165
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,530
the conspiracy again.

1166
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:07,830
Yeah, they keep selling them.

1167
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,430
Would you quit ripping them over there, man?

1168
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,530
The minute you turn 50, you start getting

1169
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:12,950
all those retirement,

1170
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,790
American Association of Retired Persons.

1171
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,470
Now, the minute you turn your

1172
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,850
real nature back to the first

1173
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,650
time it ticked, man,

1174
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:23,450
that's when it happens? Yeah, baby.

1175
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,870
Yeah, groovy. That was Edward Burns,

1176
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,630
by the way, Kooky Burns, doing

1177
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,710
the Beatnik love song.

1178
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:30,370
Beautiful.

1179
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,470
The Univac Inhumanoid song, by the way, was

1180
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:34,770
Sheldon Allman.

1181
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,350
He's all man, but not as manly

1182
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,170
as man.

1183
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,630
No, as loquacious as a man with a dog's

1184
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,310
throat. What a singer.

1185
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,350
Well, I've heard that

1186
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:47,270
many people who want to sing and

1187
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,390
to talk better, or to have more

1188
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,330
fluid movements with their larynx, are

1189
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,090
now having dog implants in their throats,

1190
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:55,310
so they can yodel like a bright poodle

1191
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,170
or perhaps a...

1192
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,130
They can locate each other's

1193
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,810
pack members by

1194
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,930
a cry in the pines.

1195
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:05,250
But then wouldn't you need an ear transplant

1196
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,310
so you could hear those high-pitched

1197
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,050
tones of only dogs in here? Well, yeah, it can be done,

1198
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,210
but what happens is you've got a huge open

1199
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,130
space on the side of your head,

1200
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:15,230
which kind of remembers, well,

1201
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,190
resembles, not remembers. It can remember,

1202
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:19,290
though. I mean, it does have... That's the part that can

1203
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,290
remember. It does have self-memory, but anyway,

1204
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:22,170
that's another story.

1205
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:25,030
It makes the ears like lupine,

1206
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:27,610
kind of like leprechaun-ish,

1207
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,230
and a lot of people cosmetically...

1208
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:30,010
Yeah, wolfish.

1209
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,190
Like, uh...

1210
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:35,390
Well, it's a dog's life,

1211
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,450
you say? It's more than a dog's

1212
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,830
life. It's a dog's entire

1213
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:41,470
continuously reincarnating

1214
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,030
existence. There's a wonderful

1215
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,430
disease that

1216
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:47,010
goes with it as a dog-like

1217
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:47,730
appearance called

1218
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:50,770
discoid lupus. It's a skin disease.

1219
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,710
And it causes hirsutism of the

1220
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:54,250
clavichord and of the

1221
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:56,910
precerebral area. Well, actually,

1222
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,030
it's anti-hirsutism because it makes

1223
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,870
the hair fall out. It makes your hair fall out?

1224
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,070
Yeah. Oh, how doggy. Can that be... See?

1225
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,830
Ah, like a chihuahua poodle, yeah.

1226
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:07,190
Woof, woof. I mean, it looks...

1227
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,090
Yeah. You dog. You're trying

1228
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,990
to grow, like, canine incisors out of the top

1229
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,270
of your forehead, too. He's a dirty dog.

1230
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:14,950
He's a dirty dog. He is a dirty dog.

1231
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:16,810
And must be reprimanded

1232
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:18,230
firmly and constantly

1233
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,550
like a sleeping cow.

1234
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:22,470
Phew.

1235
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,910
I think there's something wrong here

1236
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,890
tonight. I don't want to put my fingers

1237
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,650
on it. I can tell you what it is.

1238
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,770
There's something that happened. I don't know what it is.

1239
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,850
We were doing a show

1240
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,790
about love, and then it turned into

1241
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,790
dogs again. Okay. But you

1242
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,130
guys earlier were talking about how...

1243
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:40,550
Discordians. We...

1244
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,610
And discoids. Oh, the beatniks. Right.

1245
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,410
Discordians on accordions. The beatnik stuff.

1246
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:47,090
By the way, Discordians,

1247
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,950
there's a biography of

1248
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:50,930
Cary Thornley, who's one of the

1249
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,190
founders of your religion. Cary Thornley.

1250
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:55,150
I met him once. He was a mentally

1251
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:57,270
ill man. As most Discordian

1252
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,210
founders are.

1253
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,270
Yeah. Well, and...

1254
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,450
But there's a... Adam Go-Rightly

1255
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,370
has a book out now telling the

1256
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,090
true, full life... Actually,

1257
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,270
judging by what he says about Church of the

1258
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,510
Subgenius, it's not a true story at all.

1259
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:13,390
I'm wondering if it's any kind of

1260
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,070
story for us to be telling here.

1261
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,530
I don't know. But what about the beatniks,

1262
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:19,290
man? Screw the Discordians. They're

1263
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,470
taking care of that themselves. The beatniks.

1264
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,090
Princess Wee and I, when we were

1265
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,230
about 12 in separate

1266
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,370
time zones, saw

1267
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:29,430
this... And you did, too. That Mad Magazine

1268
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,170
issue that

1269
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,530
had a magazine within a magazine

1270
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,430
about beatniks. It was a beatnik,

1271
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,210
fake beatnik magazine. It had some

1272
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:39,210
skin cells in a little hyper

1273
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,170
pack that was also connected

1274
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,270
to the back, along with the 45. Remember the

1275
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,250
45 record? Right. It had a little fake 45.

1276
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,210
A 45 flexi disc. Yeah, and you could

1277
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,270
rub those skin cells on your noggin

1278
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:51,190
and say, if you wanted to... And it taught you how to

1279
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,110
talk beatniks. Right, right.

1280
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:55,170
Now, when I was

1281
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,170
12 years old, I saw that,

1282
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:58,510
so did Princess Wee, separately,

1283
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,930
and thought, beatniks.

1284
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,750
What are beatniks now?

1285
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:05,050
These people that sit around in dark... That's Winky Cat.

1286
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,170
They drink a lot of coffee. They read poetry.

1287
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:08,910
They play weird music and they say weird

1288
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:10,610
poetry. Play the bongos.

1289
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,130
They play with their fingers and stuff like that.

1290
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,350
Sometimes they crunch their fingers.

1291
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:15,250
They wear black turtlenecks.

1292
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,090
The basic thing was, they were

1293
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,350
weird, and as 12-year-olds,

1294
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:20,370
we thought,

1295
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,350
man, I want to be like that when I grow up.

1296
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,170
Now, there was an interim...

1297
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:27,010
I got to be like 12 and 13,

1298
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,690
I discovered politics, and

1299
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,930
most 12-year-olds,

1300
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:33,130
people of that mentality, I was very

1301
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:35,390
conservative. Right, you want to be a eunuch with pimples.

1302
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,270
It goes with the 12-year-old

1303
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:39,050
sort of level of understanding the world.

1304
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,570
You're automatically pretty conservative.

1305
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:43,010
Just as you become after

1306
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:43,990
you're 50.

1307
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:45,710
But...

1308
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:48,510
It's when we understand everything.

1309
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:49,330
Right.

1310
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:52,390
You know everything when you're 13.

1311
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,590
12 or 13. I certainly did.

1312
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:56,230
I've since then forgot it all.

1313
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:57,450
But...

1314
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:01,490
Then it was like the hippies came along,

1315
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:02,930
but I didn't think the hippies were cool

1316
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:04,170
until...

1317
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,350
The nostril implants.

1318
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,670
What was it I was...

1319
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,090
Easy Rider.

1320
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:09,750
The Scourging.

1321
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:11,590
Which was kind of stupid.

1322
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,690
He doesn't even remember the Scourging.

1323
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,530
Monterey Pop, which was not that big of a deal.

1324
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,410
But Head Comics,

1325
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:18,750
Zappa's first album,

1326
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,490
Freak Out, or It Can't Happen Here,

1327
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:22,110
or something like that.

1328
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,230
Freak Out was first.

1329
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,030
And Hendrix's first album,

1330
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:27,970
Are You Experienced?

1331
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:30,150
All that stuff came out, and suddenly I kind of went,

1332
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:32,730
oh, this hippie stuff is...

1333
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,430
It's like science fiction.

1334
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,410
It is a...

1335
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,070
a phenomenon

1336
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:39,750
in sociology.

1337
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,270
Hold down your head, Dr. Morris.

1338
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:45,190
I'm about to fix the electrode to your scalp.

1339
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:46,450
As it turned out...

1340
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,310
Soon you'll be seeing the sprite mandala

1341
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,730
in the center of your skull.

1342
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,790
The sad thing was that they let us all down.

1343
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:52,970
It wasn't science fiction.

1344
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:54,470
It was just another beer commercial.

1345
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:55,770
It was. It is a beer...

1346
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:56,250
It was.

1347
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,010
And I was too young to be a hippie.

1348
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,650
I really didn't get to be anything but a 70s drug brother.

1349
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:03,150
And then punk came along.

1350
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,290
I was actually kind of punk before my time,

1351
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:06,890
and that wasn't science fiction.

1352
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,830
No, it's very cold and gray.

1353
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:09,610
But...

1354
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:10,890
It's abject.

1355
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,350
But I was a little too old to be a proper punk.

1356
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:14,230
And so what was...

1357
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:14,890
What could we be?

1358
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,330
We were three butts of geniuses.

1359
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,510
Two, the beatniks wouldn't take us.

1360
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,930
The hippies thought we weren't cool enough.

1361
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,470
The scum thought we were too cool.

1362
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,430
The punks didn't hate us.

1363
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,710
Didn't think we...

1364
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,530
We were put out.

1365
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,390
Hardly spoken to.

1366
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,930
No one gave me directions on the bus, man.

1367
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,590
I've been waiting three hours.

1368
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,530
They patted us with all fur and refuse.

1369
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,350
Oh, yes. More than rocks and garbage.

1370
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:42,570
They hit us with sharp, pointy things.

1371
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,410
They beat our knees

1372
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:45,710
with metal objects.

1373
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:47,430
They made Stumpy hide.

1374
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,750
They made Stumpy run.

1375
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:52,150
And hide in his little Stumpy Lens.

1376
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,170
He had to run and hide.

1377
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,090
Save my knees above the one hand.

1378
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,370
Now Stumpy has power.

1379
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,090
Now Stumpy has...

1380
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,950
They've reintroduced the same freaking stupid idea.

1381
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:03,410
...his precious.

1382
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:08,350
And now Stumpy shall lead the mutants,

1383
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:13,570
the ugly, the poor, the stupid, against the lucky.

1384
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,650
The handsome, yes.

1385
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,370
The rich, the educated.

1386
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:19,110
We shall bring them down.

1387
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:21,210
We shall force them to learn.

1388
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:22,530
Like the smegma they are.

1389
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,410
They shall be left in the pool of fire

1390
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,530
like the insects and lower vermin they be.

1391
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:33,430
Each one of these children grown to full manhood or womanhood

1392
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,530
shall be cut down in their prime.

1393
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:38,530
The world shall go under the sire.

1394
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,110
Oh, yes. The worm shall turn.

1395
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:42,430
The worm shall turn.

1396
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:45,630
And you're listening to Hour of Slack number 932.

1397
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:50,750
If you want more information about J.R. Bob Dobbs

1398
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:52,750
and the Church of the Subgenius,

1399
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:58,350
just check out www.subgenius.com.

1400
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:03,110
And you can always write to us at Post Office Box...

1401
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,930
Well, you can write to me personally, Reverend Stagg.

1402
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:11,190
Post Office Box, 0181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1403
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:14,110
44118.

1404
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:15,890
Oh, yes.

1405
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,430
And so the coffin of Dobbs is lowered...

1406
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:20,830
Bob, Bob Cranford.

1407
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:23,390
...into the great concrete tomb.

1408
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:24,550
Bob Cranford.

1409
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:29,430
The blubbering and snotting of the mourners...

1410
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:31,350
Friends we are gathered...

1411
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,530
...of Slackless, those left Slackless by...

1412
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,290
...and Sam Paul...

1413
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:37,090
...as Dobbs left this earthly plane...

1414
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:39,750
...he can write to our friend, our dear, dear friend,

1415
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:42,190
Robert J.R. Bobbs.

1416
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:44,610
My God! My God, man, he's risen!

1417
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:47,610
Look, he's rising from the grave!

1418
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:49,710
Stop!

1419
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:52,210
Well, that was...

1420
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:53,890
That was exciting.

1421
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,610
It was very anti-climatic.

1422
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:57,550
I'm going to put back...

1423
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:01,430
Let's get back to the Arise Subgenius video soundtrack.

1424
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,670
Now that it's on DVD, it sounds a lot better than ever.

1425
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:09,190
By the way, this background music is from Bride of Frankenstein.

1426
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,710
I forget the name of the composer.

1427
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:16,710
Since I didn't acquire it exactly the way you're supposed to,

1428
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:21,210
there weren't any liner notes or anything.

1429
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:22,810
Okay, bye.

1430
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:23,230
Bye.

1431
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:24,070
Bye.

1432
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:24,350
Bye.

1433
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:24,470
Bye.

1434
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:30,190
I remember back in the day when I was on a college radio station.

1435
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:30,850
Oh, man.

1436
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:31,510
It's great.

1437
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:32,290
Everybody should do it.

1438
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:36,130
Well, now, but with this great vehicle of the public airwaves,

1439
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:38,290
shouldn't we be, I don't know...

1440
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:38,830
Serving the public?

1441
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,690
Edifying the public in some way.

1442
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:46,350
Exposing the shenanigans of bad politicians or...

1443
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:47,790
I mean...

1444
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:48,470
How about those...

1445
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:50,430
We're just talking about the necessity...

1446
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:51,070
Necessity...

1447
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:51,870
Necessity...

1448
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:55,130
And the conversation always turns to bad movies.

1449
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,330
I just don't understand.

1450
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:57,270
How about that...

1451
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,730
Are we geeks?

1452
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:01,490
What kind of word is that?

1453
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:02,930
Is that what that means, pathetic geeks and weirdos?

1454
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:03,290
What?

1455
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,130
Is that why they throw rocks at us?

1456
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,010
Pathetic geeks and weirdos.

1457
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:08,130
Is that why we've been...

1458
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:08,710
Don't talk rot.

1459
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:10,050
Alien sex?

1460
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,070
We can talk about alien sex.

1461
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:11,310
Pshaw.

1462
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,290
Pshaw.

1463
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,610
I mean, that's the thing.

1464
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:16,990
Is that why those villagers are heading up here with those torches?

1465
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:20,570
Would we be able to talk about, like, alien sex for hours on end?

1466
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:26,810
I mean, that would be, like, edifying to the government, to the world, to everybody, wouldn't

1467
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:26,910
it?

1468
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:32,670
Well, except that there's so many shows that talk about aliens taking over the politicians.

1469
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:33,690
You know, that stuff...

1470
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:37,110
That stuff was old with the X-Files.

1471
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,050
And even the politicians taking over the aliens.

1472
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:39,850
That's old, too.

1473
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:53,910
I mean, it's the opportunitarian-capitalist.

1474
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:55,230
There's no Chancellor.

1475
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:56,830
There's no Richard

1476
00:57:59,290 --> 00:57:59,990
Carter.

1477
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:00,550
You tell now?

1478
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:00,590
True.

1479
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,090
I tell now.

1480
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:09,830
And that's why GPS has gone through these things.

1481
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:09,830

Yes.

1486
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:22,110
When the full moon rises and the drums start to beat in the jungle

1487
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:25,890
and the serpent god Dumballa raises his hooded head.

1488
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:27,330
Child of voodoo.

00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,590

Child of voodoo.

1497
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,710
That's a little tacky to me.

1498
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:45,830
The dark world is superstition.

1499
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,050
Yes.

Yes.

1508
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:04,270
When the full moon rises,

1509
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:10,390
and the drums start to beat in the jungle and the serpent god Dumballa raises his hooded head.

1510
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,830
Child of voodoo.

1511
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,110

00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,210
That's a little tacky to me.

1517
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:30,310
The dark world is superstition.

1518
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,510
Oh.

1519
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:34,550
The beautiful world.

1520
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:35,590
The world of superstition.

1521
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:38,750
Friends, that was Norrell Preff.

1522
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,090
